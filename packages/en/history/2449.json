To accomplish the task, other tools are needed\r\nbesides logic. It is something to show that the consistency of a\r\nsystem requires a particular result, but it is not all. The life\r\nof the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt\r\nnecessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political\r\ntheories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious,\r\neven the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men,\r\nhave had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining\r\nthe rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the\r\nstory of a nation's development through many centuries, and it\r\ncannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and\r\ncorollaries of a book of mathematics. In order to know what it\r\nis, we must know what it has been, and what it tends to become.\r\nWe must alternately consult history and existing theories of\r\nlegislation. But the most difficult labor will be to understand\r\nthe combination of the two into new products at every stage. The\r\nsubstance of the law at any given time pretty nearly [2]\r\ncorresponds, so far as it goes, with what is then understood to\r\nbe convenient; but its form and machinery, and the degree to\r\nwhich it is able to work out desired results, depend very much\r\nupon its past.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts today, while, on the one hand, there are a great\r\nmany rules which are quite sufficiently accounted for by their\r\nmanifest good sense, on the other, there are some which can only\r\nbe understood by reference to the infancy of procedure among the\r\nGerman tribes, or to the social condition of Rome under the\r\nDecemvirs.\r\n\r\nI shall use the history of our law so far as it is necessary to\r\nexplain a conception or to interpret a rule, but no further. In\r\ndoing so there are two errors equally to be avoided both by\r\nwriter and reader. One is that of supposing, because an idea\r\nseems very familiar and natural to us, that it has always been\r\nso. Many things which we take for granted have had to be\r\nlaboriously fought out or thought out in past times. The other\r\nmistake is the opposite one of asking too much of history. We\r\nstart with man full grown. It may be assumed that the earliest\r\nbarbarian whose practices are to be considered, had a good many\r\nof the same feelings and passions as ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe first subject to be discussed is the general theory of\r\nliability civil and criminal. The Common Law has changed a good\r\ndeal since the beginning of our series of reports, and the search\r\nafter a theory which may now be said to prevail is very much a\r\nstudy of tendencies. I believe that it will be instructive to go\r\nback to the early forms of liability, and to start from them.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly known that the early forms of legal procedure were\r\ngrounded in vengeance. Modern writers [3] have thought that the\r\nRoman law started from the blood feud, and all the authorities\r\nagree that the German law begun in that way. The feud led to the\r\ncomposition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the\r\nfeud was bought off. The gradual encroachment of the composition\r\nmay be traced in the Anglo-Saxon laws, /1/ and the feud was\r\npretty well broken up, though not extinguished, by the time of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an\r\nearlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson. The appeals\r\nde pace et plagis and of mayhem became, or rather were in\r\nsubstance, the action of trespass which is still familiar to\r\nlawyers. /2/ But as the compensation recovered in the appeal was\r\nthe alternative of vengeance, we might expect to find its scope\r\nlimited to the scope of vengeance. Vengeance imports a feeling of\r\nblame, and an opinion, however distorted by passion, that a wrong\r\nhas been done. It can hardly go very far beyond the case of a\r\nharm intentionally inflicted: even a dog distinguishes between\r\nbeing stumbled over and being kicked.\r\n\r\nWhether for this cause or another, the early English appeals for\r\npersonal violence seem to have been confined to intentional\r\nwrongs. Glanvill /3/ mentions melees, blows, and wounds,--all\r\nforms of intentional violence. In the fuller description of such\r\nappeals given by Bracton /4/ it is made quite clear that they\r\nwere based on intentional assaults. The appeal de pace et plagis\r\nlaid an intentional assault, described the nature of the arms\r\nused, and the length and depth of the wound. The appellor also\r\nhad [4] to show that he immediately raised the hue and cry. So\r\nwhen Bracton speaks of the lesser offences, which were not sued\r\nby way of appeal, he instances only intentional wrongs, such as\r\nblows with the fist, flogging, wounding, insults, and so forth.\r\n/1/ The cause of action in the cases of trespass reported in the\r\nearlier Year Books and in the Abbreviatio Plaeitorum is always an\r\nintentional wrong. It was only at a later day, and after\r\nargument, that trespass was extended so as to embrace harms which\r\nwere foreseen, but which were not the intended consequence of the\r\ndefendant's act. /2/ Thence again it extended to unforeseen\r\ninjuries. /3/\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this order of development is not quite\r\nconsistent with an opinion which has been held, that it was a\r\ncharacteristic of early law not to penetrate beyond the external\r\nvisible fact, the damnum corpore corpori datum. It has been\r\nthought that an inquiry into the internal condition of the\r\ndefendant, his culpability or innocence, implies a refinement of\r\njuridical conception equally foreign to Rome before the Lex\r\nAquilia, and to England when trespass took its shape. I do not\r\nknow any very satisfactory evidence that a man was generally held\r\nliable either in Rome /4/ or England for the accidental\r\nconsequences even of his own act. But whatever may have been the\r\nearly law, the foregoing account shows the starting-point of the\r\nsystem with which we have to deal. Our system of private\r\nliability for the consequences of a man's own acts, that is, for\r\nhis trespasses, started from the notion of actual intent and\r\nactual personal culpability.\r\n\r\nThe original principles of liability for harm inflicted by [5]\r\nanother person or thing have been less carefully considered\r\nhitherto than those which governed trespass, and I shall\r\ntherefore devote the rest of this Lecture to discussing them. I\r\nshall try to show that this liability also had its root in the\r\npassion of revenge, and to point out the changes by which it\r\nreached its present form. But I shall not confine myself strictly\r\nto what is needful for that purpose, because it is not only most\r\ninteresting to trace the transformation throughout its whole\r\nextent, but the story will also afford an instructive example of\r\nthe mode in which the law has grown, without a break, from\r\nbarbarism to civilization. Furthermore, it will throw much light\r\nupon some important and peculiar doctrines which cannot be\r\nreturned to later.\r\n\r\nA very common phenomenon, and one very familiar to the student of\r\nhistory, is this. The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive\r\ntime establish a rule or a formula. In the course of centuries\r\nthe custom, belief, or necessity disappears, but the rule\r\nremains. The reason which gave rise to the rule has been\r\nforgotten, and ingenious minds set themselves to inquire how it\r\nis to be accounted for. Some ground of policy is thought of,\r\nwhich seems to explain it and to reconcile it with the present\r\nstate of things; and then the rule adapts itself to the new\r\nreasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new career.\r\nThe old form receives a new content, and in time even the form\r\nmodifies itself to fit the meaning which it has received. The\r\nsubject under consideration illustrates this course of events\r\nvery clearly.\r\n\r\nI will begin by taking a medley of examples embodying as many\r\ndistinct rules, each with its plausible and seemingly sufficient\r\nground of policy to explain it.\r\n\r\n[6] A man has an animal of known ferocious habits, which escapes\r\nand does his neighbor damage. He can prove that the animal\r\nescaped through no negligence of his, but still he is held\r\nliable. Why? It is, says the analytical jurist, because, although\r\nhe was not negligent at the moment of escape, he was guilty of\r\nremote heedlessness, or negligence, or fault, in having such a\r\ncreature at all. And one by whose fault damage is done ought to\r\npay for it.\r\n\r\nA baker's man, while driving his master's cart to deliver hot\r\nrolls of a morning, runs another man down. The master has to pay\r\nfor it. And when he has asked why he should have to pay for the\r\nwrongful act of an independent and responsible being, he has been\r\nanswered from the time of Ulpian to that of Austin, that it is\r\nbecause he was to blame for employing an improper person. If he\r\nanswers, that he used the greatest possible care in choosing his\r\ndriver, he is told that that is no excuse; and then perhaps the\r\nreason is shifted, and it is said that there ought to be a remedy\r\nagainst some one who can pay the damages, or that such wrongful\r\nacts as by ordinary human laws are likely to happen in the course\r\nof the service are imputable to the service.\r\n\r\nNext, take a case where a limit has been set to liability which\r\nhad previously been unlimited. In 1851, Congress passed a law,\r\nwhich is still in force, and by which the owners of ships in all\r\nthe more common cases of maritime loss can surrender the vessel\r\nand her freight then pending to the losers; and it is provided\r\nthat, thereupon, further proceedings against the owners shall\r\ncease. The legislators to whom we owe this act argued that, if a\r\nmerchant embark a portion of his property upon a hazardous\r\nventure, it is reasonable that his stake should be confined to\r\nwhat [7] he puts at risk,--a principle similar to that on which\r\ncorporations have been so largely created in America during the\r\nlast fifty years.\r\n\r\nIt has been a rule of criminal pleading in England down into the\r\npresent century, that an indictment for homicide must set forth\r\nthe value of the instrument causing the death, in order that the\r\nking or his grantee might claim forfeiture of the deodand, \"as an\r\naccursed thing,\" in the language of Blackstone.\r\n\r\nI might go on multiplying examples; but these are enough to show\r\nthe remoteness of the points to be brought together.--As a first\r\nstep towards a generalization, it will be necessary to consider\r\nwhat is to be found in ancient and independent systems of law.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known passage in Exodus, /1/ which we shall have\r\nto remember later: \"If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they\r\ndie: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not\r\nbe eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.\" When we turn\r\nfrom the Jews to the Greeks, we find the principle of the passage\r\njust quoted erected into a system. Plutarch, in his Solon, tells\r\nus that a dog that had bitten a man was to be delivered up bound\r\nto a log four cubits long. Plato made elaborate provisions in his\r\nLaws for many such cases. If a slave killed a man, he was to be\r\ngiven up to the relatives of the deceased. /2/ If he wounded a\r\nman, he was to be given up to the injured party to use him as he\r\npleased. /3/ So if he did damage to which the injured party did\r\nnot contribute as a joint cause. In either case, if the owner [8]\r\nfailed to surrender the slave, he was bound to make good the\r\nloss. /1/ If a beast killed a man, it was to be slain and cast\r\nbeyond the borders. If an inanimate thing caused death, it was to\r\nbe cast beyond the borders in like manner, and expiation was to\r\nbe made. /2/ Nor was all this an ideal creation of merely\r\nimagined law, for it was said in one of the speeches of\r\nAeschines, that \"we banish beyond our borders stocks and stones\r\nand steel, voiceless and mindless things, if they chance to kill\r\na man; and if a man commits suicide, bury the hand that struck\r\nthe blow afar from its body.\" This is mentioned quite as an\r\nevery-day matter, evidently without thinking it at all\r\nextraordinary, only to point an antithesis to the honors heaped\r\nupon Demosthenes. /3/ As late as the second century after Christ\r\nthe traveller Pausanias observed with some surprise that they\r\nstill sat in judgment on inanimate things in the Prytaneum. /4/\r\nPlutarch attributes the institution to Draco. /5/\r\n\r\nIn the Roman law we find the similar principles of the noxoe\r\ndeditio gradually leading to further results. The Twelve Tables\r\n(451 B.C.) provided that, if an animal had done damage, either\r\nthe animal was to be surrendered or the damage paid for. /6/ We\r\nlearn from Gains that the same rule was applied to the torts of\r\nchildren or slaves, /7/ and there is some trace of it with regard\r\nto inanimate things.\r\n\r\nThe Roman lawyers, not looking beyond their own [9] system or\r\ntheir own time, drew on their wits for an explanation which would\r\nshow that the law as they found it was reasonable. Gaius said\r\nthat it was unjust that the fault of children or slaves should be\r\na source of loss to their parents or owners beyond their own\r\nbodies, and Ulpian reasoned that a fortiori this was true of\r\nthings devoid of life, and therefore incapable of fault. /1/ This\r\nway of approaching the question seems to deal with the right of\r\nsurrender as if it were a limitation of a liability incurred by a\r\nparent or owner, which would naturally and in the first instance\r\nbe unlimited. But if that is what was meant, it puts the cart\r\nbefore the horse. The right of surrender was not introduced as a\r\nlimitation of liability, but, in Rome and Greece alike, payment\r\nwas introduced as the alternative of a failure to surrender.\r\n\r\nThe action was not based, as it would be nowadays, on the fault\r\nof the parent or owner. If it had been, it would always have been\r\nbrought against the person who had control of the slave or animal\r\nat the time it did the harm complained of, and who, if any one,\r\nwas to blame for not preventing the injury. So far from this\r\nbeing the course, the person to be sued was the owner at the time\r\nof suing. The action followed the guilty thing into whosesoever\r\nhands it came. /2/ And in curious contrast with the principle as\r\ninverted to meet still more modern views of public policy, if the\r\nanimal was of a wild nature, that is, in the very case of the\r\nmost ferocious animals, the owner ceased to be liable the moment\r\nit escaped, because at that moment he ceased to be owner. /3/\r\nThere [10] seems to have been no other or more extensive\r\nliability by the old law, even where a slave was guilty with his\r\nmaster's knowledge, unless perhaps he was a mere tool in his\r\nmaster's hands. /1/ Gains and Ulpian showed an inclination to cut\r\nthe noxoe deditio down to a privilege of the owner in case of\r\nmisdeeds committed without his knowledge; but Ulpian is obliged\r\nto admit, that by the ancient law, according to Celsus, the\r\naction was noxal where a slave was guilty even with the privity\r\nof his master. /2/\r\n\r\nAll this shows very clearly that the liability of the owner was\r\nmerely a way of getting at the slave or animal which was the\r\nimmediate cause of offence. In other words, vengeance on the\r\nimmediate offender was the object of the Greek and early Roman\r\nprocess, not indemnity from the master or owner. The liability of\r\nthe owner was simply a liability of the offending thing. In the\r\nprimitive customs of Greece it was enforced by a judicial process\r\nexpressly directed against the object, animate or inanimate. The\r\nRoman Twelve Tables made the owner, instead of the thing itself,\r\nthe defendant, but did not in any way change the ground of\r\nliability, or affect its limit. The change was simply a device to\r\nallow the owner to protect his interest. /3/\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked how inanimate objects came to be [11] pursued\r\nin this way, if the object of the procedure was to gratify the\r\npassion of revenge. Learned men have been ready to find a reason\r\nin the personification of inanimate nature common to savages and\r\nchildren, and there is much to confirm this view. Without such a\r\npersonification, anger towards lifeless things would have been\r\ntransitory, at most. It is noticeable that the commonest example\r\nin the most primitive customs and laws is that of a tree which\r\nfalls upon a man, or from which he falls and is killed. We can\r\nconceive with comparative ease how a tree might have been put on\r\nthe same footing with animals. It certainly was treated like\r\nthem, and was delivered to the relatives, or chopped to pieces\r\nfor the gratification of a real or simulated passion. /1/\r\n\r\nIn the Athenian process there is also, no doubt, to be traced a\r\ndifferent thought. Expiation is one of the ends most insisted on\r\nby Plato, and appears to have been the purpose of the procedure\r\nmentioned by Aeschines. Some passages in the Roman historians\r\nwhich will be mentioned again seem to point in the same\r\ndirection. /2/\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity to be noticed is, that the liability seems to\r\nhave been regarded as attached to the body doing the damage, in\r\nan almost physical sense. An untrained intelligence only\r\nimperfectly performs the analysis by which jurists carry\r\nresponsibility back to the beginning of a chain of causation. The\r\nhatred for anything giving us pain, which wreaks itself on the\r\nmanifest cause, and which leads even civilized man to kick a door\r\nwhen it pinches his finger, is embodied in the noxoe deditio and\r\n[12] other kindred doctrines of early Roman law. There is a\r\ndefective passage in Gaius, which seems to say that liability may\r\nsometimes be escaped by giving up even the dead body of the\r\noffender. /1/ So Livy relates that, Brutulus Papins having caused\r\na breach of truce with the Romans, the Samnites determined to\r\nsurrender him, and that, upon his avoiding disgrace and\r\npunishment by suicide, they sent his lifeless body. It is\r\nnoticeable that the surrender seems to be regarded as the natural\r\nexpiation for the breach of treaty, /2/ and that it is equally a\r\nmatter of course to send the body when the wrong-doer has\r\nperished. /3/\r\n\r\nThe most curious examples of this sort occur in the region of\r\nwhat we should now call contract. Livy again furnishes an\r\nexample, if, indeed, the last is not one. The Roman Consul\r\nPostumius concluded the disgraceful peace of the Caudine Forks\r\n(per sponsionem, as Livy says, denying the common story that it\r\nwas per feedus), and he was sent to Rome to obtain the sanction\r\nof the people. When there however, he proposed that the persons\r\nwho had made the [13] contract, including himself, should be\r\ngiven up in satisfaction of it. For, he said, the Roman people\r\nnot having sanctioned the agreement, who is so ignorant of the\r\njus fetialium as not to know that they are released from\r\nobligation by surrendering us? The formula of surrender seems to\r\nbring the case within the noxoe deditio. /1/ Cicero narrates a\r\nsimilar surrender of Mancinus by the pater-patratus to the\r\nNumantines, who, however, like the Samnites in the former case,\r\nrefused to receive him. /2/\r\n\r\nIt might be asked what analogy could have been found between a\r\nbreach of contract and those wrongs which excite the desire for\r\nvengeance. But it must be remembered that the distinction between\r\ntort and breaches of contract, and especially between the\r\nremedies for the two, is not found ready made. It is conceivable\r\nthat a procedure adapted to redress for violence was extended to\r\nother cases as they arose. Slaves were surrendered for theft as\r\nwell as [14] for assault; /1/ and it is said that a debtor who\r\ndid not pay his debts, or a seller who failed to deliver an\r\narticle for which he had been paid, was dealt with on the same\r\nfooting as a thief. /2/ This line of thought, together with the\r\nquasi material conception of legal obligations as binding the\r\noffending body, which has been noticed, would perhaps explain the\r\nwell-known law of the Twelve Tables as to insolvent debtors.\r\nAccording to that law, if a man was indebted to several creditors\r\nand insolvent, after certain formalities they might cut up his\r\nbody and divide it among them. If there was a single creditor, he\r\nmight put his debtor to death or sell him as a slave. /3/\r\n\r\nIf no other right were given but to reduce a debtor to slavery,\r\nthe law might be taken to look only to compensation, and to be\r\nmodelled on the natural working of self-redress. /4/ The\r\nprinciple of our own law, that taking a man's body on execution\r\nsatisfies the debt, although he is not detained an hour, seems to\r\nbe explained in that way. But the right to put to death looks\r\nlike vengeance, and the division of the body shows that the debt\r\nwas conceived very literally to inhere in or bind the body with a\r\nvinculum juris.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the true explanation of surrender in connection\r\nwith contracts, for the present purpose we need not go further\r\nthan the common case of noxoe deditio for wrongs. Neither is the\r\nseeming adhesion of liability to the very body which did the harm\r\nof the first importance. [15] The Roman law dealt mainly with\r\nliving creatures,--with animals and slaves. If a man was run\r\nover, it did not surrender the wagon which crushed him, but the\r\nox which drew the wagon. /1/ At this stage the notion is easy to\r\nunderstand. The desire for vengeance may be felt as strongly\r\nagainst a slave as against a freeman, and it is not without\r\nexample nowadays that a like passion should be felt against an\r\nanimal. The surrender of the slave or beast empowered the injured\r\nparty to do his will upon them. Payment by the owner was merely a\r\nprivilege in case he wanted to buy the vengeance off.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be imagined that such a system as has been\r\ndescribed could not last when civilization had advanced to any\r\nconsiderable height. What had been the privilege of buying off\r\nvengeance by agreement, of paying the damage instead of\r\nsurrendering the body of the offender, no doubt became a general\r\ncustom. The Aquilian law, passed about a couple of centuries\r\nlater than the date of the Twelve Tables, enlarged the sphere of\r\ncompensation for bodily injuries. Interpretation enlarged the\r\nAquilian law. Masters became personally liable for certain wrongs\r\ncommitted by their slaves with their knowledge, where previously\r\nthey were only bound to surrender the slave. /2/ If a pack-mule\r\nthrew off his burden upon a passer-by because he had been\r\nimproperly overloaded, or a dog which might have been restrained\r\nescaped from his master and bit any one, the old noxal action, as\r\nit was called, gave way to an action under the new law to enforce\r\na general personal liability. /3/ Still later, ship-owners and\r\ninnkeepers were made liable [16] as if they were wrong-doers for\r\nwrongs committed by those in their employ on board ship or in the\r\ntavern, although of course committed without their knowledge. The\r\ntrue reason for this exceptional responsibility was the\r\nexceptional confidence which was necessarily reposed in carriers\r\nand innkeepers. /1/ But some of the jurists, who regarded the\r\nsurrender of children and slaves as a privilege intended to limit\r\nliability, explained this new liability on the ground that the\r\ninnkeeper or ship-owner was to a certain degree guilty of\r\nnegligence in having employed the services of bad men? This was\r\nthe first instance of a master being made unconditionally liable\r\nfor the wrongs of his servant. The reason given for it was of\r\ngeneral application, and the principle expanded to the scope of\r\nthe reason.\r\n\r\nThe law as to ship-owners and innkeepers introduced another and\r\nmore startling innovation. It made them responsible when those\r\nwhom they employed were free, as well as when they were slaves.\r\n/3/ For the first time one man was made answerable for the wrongs\r\nof another who was also answerable himself, and who had a\r\nstanding before the law. This was a great change from the bare\r\npermission to ransom one's slave as a privilege. But here we have\r\nthe history of the whole modern doctrine of master and servant,\r\nand principal and agent. All servants are now as free and as\r\nliable to a suit as their masters. Yet the principle introduced\r\non special grounds in a special case, when servants were slaves,\r\nis now the general law of this country and England, and under it\r\nmen daily have to pay large sums for other people's acts, in\r\nwhich they had no part and [17] for which they are in no sense to\r\nblame. And to this day the reason offered by the Roman jurists\r\nfor an exceptional rule is made to justify this universal and\r\nunlimited responsibility. /1/\r\n\r\nSo much for one of the parents of our common law. Now let us turn\r\nfor a moment to the Teutonic side. The Salic Law embodies usages\r\nwhich in all probability are of too early a date to have been\r\ninfluenced either by Rome or the Old Testament. The thirty-sixth\r\nchapter of the ancient text provides that, if a man is killed by\r\na domestic animal, the owner of the animal shall pay half the\r\ncomposition (which he would have had to pay to buy off the blood\r\nfeud had he killed the man himself), and for the other half give\r\nup the beast to the complainant. /2/ So, by chapter thirty-five,\r\nif a slave killed a freeman, he was to be surrendered for one\r\nhalf of the composition to the relatives of the slain man, and\r\nthe master was to pay the other half. But according to the gloss,\r\nif the slave or his master had been maltreated by the slain man\r\nor his relatives, the master had only to surrender the slave. /3/\r\nIt is interesting to notice that those Northern sources which\r\nWilda takes to represent a more primitive stage of German law\r\nconfine liability for animals to surrender alone. /4/ There is\r\nalso a trace of the master's having been able to free himself in\r\nsome cases, at a later date, by showing that the slave was no\r\nlonger in [18] his possession. /1/ There are later provisions\r\nmaking a master liable for the wrongs committed by his slave by\r\nhis command. /2/ In the laws adapted by the Thuringians from the\r\nearlier sources, it is provided in terms that the master is to\r\npay for all damage done by his slaves. /4/\r\n\r\nIn short, so far as I am able to trace the order of development\r\nin the customs of the German tribes, it seems to have been\r\nentirely similar to that which we have already followed in the\r\ngrowth of Roman law. The earlier liability for slaves and animals\r\nwas mainly confined to surrender; the later became personal, as\r\nat Rome.\r\n\r\nThe reader may begin to ask for the proof that all this has any\r\nbearing on our law of today. So far as concerns the influence of\r\nthe Roman law upon our own, especially the Roman law of master\r\nand servant, the evidence of it is to be found in every book\r\nwhich has been written for the last five hundred years. It has\r\nbeen stated already that we still repeat the reasoning of the\r\nRoman lawyers, empty as it is, to the present day. It will be\r\nseen directly whether the German folk-laws can also be followed\r\ninto England.\r\n\r\nIn the Kentish laws of Hlothhaere and Eadrie (A.D. 680) [19] it\r\nis said, \"If any one's slave slay a freeman, whoever it be, let\r\nthe owner pay with a hundred shillings, give up the slayer,\" &c.\r\n/1/ There are several other similar provisions. In the nearly\r\ncontemporaneous laws of Ine, the surrender and payment are simple\r\nalternatives. \"If a Wessex slave slay an Englishman, then shall\r\nhe who owns him deliver him up to the lord and the kindred, or\r\ngive sixty shillings for his life.\" /2/ Alfred's laws (A.D.\r\n871-901) have a like provision as to cattle. \"If a neat wound a\r\nman, let the neat be delivered up or compounded for.\" /3/ And\r\nAlfred, although two hundred years later than the first English\r\nlawgivers who have been quoted, seems to have gone back to more\r\nprimitive notions than we find before his time. For the same\r\nprinciple is extended to the case of a tree by which a man is\r\nkilled. \"If, at their common work, one man slay another\r\nunwilfully, let the tree be given to the kindred, and let them\r\nhave it off the land within thirty nights. Or let him take\r\npossession of it who owns the wood.\" /4/\r\n\r\nIt is not inapposite to compare what Mr. Tylor has mentioned\r\nconcerning the rude Kukis of Southern Asia. \"If a tiger killed a\r\nKuki, his family were in disgrace till they had retaliated by\r\nkilling and eating this tiger, or another; but further, if a man\r\nwas killed by a fall from a tree, his relatives would take their\r\nrevenge by cutting the tree down, and scattering it in chips.\"\r\n/5/\r\n\r\nTo return to the English, the later laws, from about a hundred\r\nyears after Alfred down to the collection known as the laws of\r\nHenry I, compiled long after the Conquest, [20] increase the\r\nlord's liability for his household, and make him surety for his\r\nmen's good conduct. If they incur a fine to the king and run\r\naway, the lord has to pay it unless he can clear himself of\r\ncomplicity. But I cannot say that I find until a later period the\r\nunlimited liability of master for servant which was worked out on\r\nthe Continent, both by the German tribes and at Rome. Whether the\r\nprinciple when established was an indigenous growth, or whether\r\nthe last step was taken under the influence of the Roman law, of\r\nwhich Bracton made great use, I cannot say. It is enough that the\r\nsoil was ready for it, and that it took root at an early day. /1/\r\nThis is all that need be said here with regard to the liability\r\nof a master for the misdeeds of his servants.\r\n\r\nIt is next to be shown what became of the principle as applied to\r\nanimals. Nowadays a man is bound at his peril to keep his cattle\r\nfrom trespassing, and he is liable for damage done by his dog or\r\nby any fierce animal, if he has notice of a tendency in the brute\r\nto do the harm complained of. The question is whether any\r\nconnection can be established between these very sensible and\r\nintelligible rules of modern law and the surrender directed by\r\nKing Alfred.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to one of the old books of the Scotch law, where the\r\nold principle still appears in full force and is stated with its\r\nreasons as then understood, /2/\r\n\r\n\"Gif ane wylde or head-strang horse, carries ane man [21] against\r\nhis will over an craig, or heuch, or to the water, and the man\r\nhappin to drowne, the horse sall perteine to the king as escheit.\r\n\r\n\"Bot it is otherwise of ane tame and dantoned horse; gif any man\r\nfulishlie rides, and be sharp spurres compelles his horse to take\r\nthe water, and the man drownes, the horse sould not be escheit,\r\nfor that comes be the mans fault or trespasse, and not of the\r\nhorse, and the man has receaved his punishment, in sa farre as he\r\nis perished and dead; and the horse quha did na fault, sould not\r\nbe escheit.\r\n\r\n\"The like reason is of all other beastes, quhilk slayes anie man,\r\n[it is added in a later work, \"of the quhilk slaughter they haue\r\ngilt,\"] for all these beasts sould be escheit.\" /1/\r\n\r\n\"The Forme and Maner of Baron Courts\" continues as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It is to witt, that this question is asked in the law, Gif ane\r\nlord hes ane milne, and any man fall in the damne, and be borne\r\ndown with the water quhill he comes to the quheill, and there be\r\nslaine to death with the quheill; quhither aught the milne to be\r\neseheir or not? The law sayes thereto nay, and be this reason,\r\nFor it is ane dead thing, and ane dead thing may do na fellony,\r\nnor be made escheit throw their gilt. Swa the milne in this case\r\nis not culpable, and in the law it is lawfull to the lord of the\r\nland to haue ane mylne on his awin water quhere best likes him.\"\r\n/2/\r\n\r\nThe reader will see in this passage, as has been remarked already\r\nof the Roman law, that a distinction is taken between things\r\nwhich are capable of guilt and those which [22] are not,--between\r\nliving and dead things; but he will also see that no difficulty\r\nwas felt in treating animals as guilty.\r\n\r\nTake next an early passage of the English law, a report of what\r\nwas laid down by one of the English judges. In 1333 it was stated\r\nfor law, that, \"if my dog kills your sheep, and I, freshly after\r\nthe fact, tender you the dog, you are without recovery against\r\nme.\" /1/ More than three centuries later, in 1676, it was said\r\nby Twisden, J. that, \"if one hath kept a tame fox, which gets\r\nloose and grows wild, he that hath kept him before shall not\r\nanswer for the damage the fox doth after he hath lost him, and he\r\nhath resumed his wild nature.\" /2/ It is at least doubtful\r\nwhether that sentence ever would have been written but for the\r\nlingering influence of the notion that the ground of the owner's\r\nliability was his ownership of the offending: thing and his\r\nfailure to surrender it. When the fox escaped, by another\r\nprinciple of law the ownership was at an end. In fact, that very\r\nconsideration was seriously pressed in England as late as 1846,\r\nwith regard to a monkey which escaped and bit the plaintiff, /3/\r\nSo it seems to be a reasonable conjecture, that it was this way\r\nof thinking which led Lord Holt, near the beginning of the last\r\ncentury, to intimate that one ground on which a man is bound at\r\nhis peril to restrain cattle from trespassing is that he has\r\nvaluable property in such animals, whereas he has not dogs, for\r\nwhich his responsibility is less. /4/ To this day, in fact,\r\ncautious judges state the law as to cattle to be, that, \"if I am\r\nthe owner of an animal in which by law the [23] right of property\r\ncan exist, I am bound to take care that it does not stray into\r\nthe land of my neighbor.\" /1/\r\n\r\nI do not mean that our modern law on this subject is only a\r\nsurvival, and that the only change from primitive notions was to\r\nsubstitute the owner for the offending animal. For although it is\r\nprobable that the early law was one of the causes which led to\r\nthe modern doctrine, there has been too much good sense in every\r\nstage of our law to adopt any such sweeping consequences as would\r\nfollow from the wholesale transfer of liability supposed. An\r\nowner is not bound at his peril to keep his cattle from harming\r\nhis neighbor's person. /2/ And in some of the earliest instances\r\nof personal liability, even for trespass on a neighbor's land,\r\nthe ground seems to have been the owner's negligence. /3/\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of those animals which the common law recognizes\r\nas the subject of ownership to stray, and when straying to do\r\ndamage by trampling down and eating crops. At the same time it is\r\nusual and easy to restrain them. On the other hand, a dog, which\r\nis not the subject of property, does no harm by simply crossing\r\nthe land of others than its owner. Hence to this extent the new\r\nlaw might have followed the old. The right of property in the\r\n[24] offending animal, which was the ancient ground of\r\nresponsibility, might have been adopted safely enough as the test\r\nof a liability based on the fault of the owner. But the\r\nresponsibility for damage of a kind not to be expected from such\r\nanimals is determined on grounds of policy comparatively little\r\ndisturbed by tradition. The development of personal liability for\r\nfierce wild animals at Rome has been explained. Our law seems to\r\nhave followed the Roman.\r\n\r\nWe will now follow the history of that branch of the primitive\r\nnotion which was least likely to survive,--the liability of\r\ninanimate things.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that King Alfred ordained the surrender of\r\na tree, but that the later Scotch law refused it because a dead\r\nthing could not have guilt. It will be remembered, also, that the\r\nanimals which the Scotch law forfeited were escheat to the king.\r\nThe same thing has remained true in England until well into this\r\ncentury, with regard even to inanimate objects. As long ago as\r\nBracton, /1/ in case a man was slain, the coroner was to value\r\nthe object causing the death, and that was to be forfeited sa\r\ndeodand \"pro rege.\" It was to be given to God, that is to say to\r\nthe Church, for the king, to be expended for the good of his\r\nsoul. A man's death had ceased to be the private affair of his\r\nfriends as in the time of the barbarian folk-laws. The king, who\r\nfurnished the court, now sued for the penalty. He supplanted the\r\nfamily in the claim on the guilty thing, and the Church\r\nsupplanted him.\r\n\r\nIn Edward the First's time some of the cases remind of the\r\nbarbarian laws at their rudest stage. If a man fell from a tree,\r\nthe tree was deodand. /2/ If he drowned in a [25] well, the well\r\nwas to be filled up. /1/ It did not matter that the forfeited\r\ninstrument belonged to an innocent person. \"Where a man killeth\r\nanother with the sword of John at Stile, the sword shall be\r\nforfeit as deodand, and yet no default is in the owner.\" /2/ That\r\nis from a book written in the reign of Henry VIII., about 1530.\r\nAnd it has been repeated from Queen Elizabeth's time /3/ to\r\nwithin one hundred years, /4/ that if my horse strikes a man, and\r\nafterwards I sell my horse, and after that the man dies, the\r\nhorse shall be forfeited. Hence it is, that, in all indictments\r\nfor homicide, until very lately it has been necessary to state\r\nthe instrument causing the death and its value, as that the\r\nstroke was given by a certain penknife, value sixpence, so as to\r\nsecure the forfeiture. It is said that a steam-engine has been\r\nforfeited in this way.\r\n\r\nI now come to what I regard as the most remarkable transformation\r\nof this principle, and one which is a most important factor in\r\nour law as it is today. I must for the moment leave the common\r\nlaw and take up the doctrines of the Admiralty. In the early\r\nbooks which have just been referred to, and long afterwards, the\r\nfact of motion is adverted to as of much importance. A maxim of\r\nHenry Spigurnel, a judge in the time of Edward I., is reported,\r\nthat \"where a man is killed by a cart, or by the fall of a house,\r\nor in other like manner, and the thing in motion is the cause of\r\nthe death, it shall be deodand.\" /5/ So it was [26] said in the\r\nnext reign that \"oinne illud quod mover cum eo quod occidit\r\nhomines deodandum domino Regi erit, vel feodo clerici.\" /1/ The\r\nreader sees how motion gives life to the object forfeited.\r\n\r\nThe most striking example of this sort is a ship. And accordingly\r\nthe old books say that, if a man falls from a ship and is\r\ndrowned, the motion of the ship must be taken to cause the death,\r\nand the ship is forfeited,--provided, however, that this\r\nhappens in fresh water. /2/ For if the death took place on the\r\nhigh seas, that was outside the ordinary jurisdiction. This\r\nproviso has been supposed to mean that ships at sea were not\r\nforfeited; /3/ but there is a long series of petitions to the\r\nking in Parliament that such forfeitures may be done away with,\r\nwhich tell a different story. /4/ The truth seems to be that the\r\nforfeiture took place, but in a different court. A manuscript of\r\nthe reign of Henry VI., only recently printed, discloses the fact\r\nthat, if a man was killed or drowned at sea by the motion of the\r\nship, the vessel was forfeited to the admiral upon a proceeding\r\nin the admiral's court, and subject to release by favor of the\r\nadmiral or the king. /5/\r\n\r\nA ship is the most living of inanimate things. Servants sometimes\r\nsay \"she\" of a clock, but every one gives a gender to vessels.\r\nAnd we need not be surprised, therefore, to find a mode of\r\ndealing which has shown such extraordinary vitality in the\r\ncriminal law applied with even more striking thoroughness in the\r\nAdmiralty. It is only by supposing [27] the ship to have been\r\ntreated as if endowed with personality, that the arbitrary\r\nseeming peculiarities of the maritime law can be made\r\nintelligible, and on that supposition they at once become\r\nconsistent and logical.\r\n\r\nBy way of seeing what those peculiarities are, take first a case\r\nof collision at sea. A collision takes place between two vessels,\r\nthe Ticonderoga and the Melampus, through the fault of the\r\nTiconderoga alone. That ship is under a lease at the time, the\r\nlessee has his own master in charge, and the owner of the vessel\r\nhas no manner of control over it. The owner, therefore, is not to\r\nblame, and he cannot even be charged on the ground that the\r\ndamage was done by his servants. He is free from personal\r\nliability on elementary principles. Yet it is perfectly settled\r\nthat there is a lien on his vessel for the amount of the damage\r\ndone, /1/ and this means that that vessel may be arrested and\r\nsold to pay the loss in any admiralty court whose process will\r\nreach her. If a livery-stable keeper lets a horse and wagon to a\r\ncustomer, who runs a man down by careless driving, no one would\r\nthink of claiming a right to seize the horse and wagon. It would\r\nbe seen that the only property which could be sold to pay for a\r\nwrong was the property of the wrong-doer.\r\n\r\nBut, again, suppose that the vessel, instead of being under\r\nlease, is in charge of a pilot whose employment is made\r\ncompulsory by the laws of the port which she is just entering.\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States holds the ship liable in\r\nthis instance also. /2/ The English courts would probably have\r\ndecided otherwise, and the matter is settled in England by\r\nlegislation. But there the court of appeal, the Privy Council,\r\nhas been largely composed of common-law [28]lawyers, and it has\r\nshown a marked tendency to assimilate common-law doctrine. At\r\ncommon law one who could not impose a personal liability on the\r\nowner could not bind a particular chattel to answer for a wrong\r\nof which it had been the instrument. But our Supreme Court has\r\nlong recognized that a person may bind a ship, when he could not\r\nbind the owners personally, because he was not the agent.\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that, if this doctrine were not supported by\r\nan appearance of good sense, it would not have survived. The ship\r\nis the only security available in dealing with foreigners, and\r\nrather than send one's own citizens to search for a remedy abroad\r\nin strange courts, it is easy to seize the vessel and satisfy the\r\nclaim at home, leaving the foreign owners to get their indemnity\r\nas they may be able. I dare say some such thought has helped to\r\nkeep the practice alive, but I believe the true historic\r\nfoundation is elsewhere. The ship no doubt, like a sword would\r\nhave been forfeited for causing death, in whosesoever hands it\r\nmight have been. So, if the master and mariners of a ship,\r\nfurnished with letters of reprisal, committed piracy against a\r\nfriend of the king, the owner lost his ship by the admiralty law,\r\nalthough the crime was committed without his knowledge or assent.\r\n/2/ It seems most likely that the principle by which the ship was\r\nforfeited to the king for causing death, or for piracy, was the\r\nsame as that by which it was bound to private sufferers for other\r\ndamage, in whose hands soever it might have been when it did the\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nIf we should say to an uneducated man today, \"She did it and she\r\nought to pay for it,\" it may be doubted [29] whether he would see\r\nthe fallacy, or be ready to explain that the ship was only\r\nproperty, and that to say, \"The ship has to pay for it,\" /1/ was\r\nsimply a dramatic way of saying that somebody's property was to\r\nbe sold, and the proceeds applied to pay for a wrong committed by\r\nsomebody else.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that a similar form of words has been enough to\r\nsatisfy the minds of great lawyers. The following is a passage\r\nfrom a judgment by Chief Justice Marshall, which is quoted with\r\napproval by Judge Story in giving the opinion of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States: \"This is not a proceeding against the\r\nowner; it is a proceeding against the vessel for an offence\r\ncommitted by the vessel; which is not the less an offence, and\r\ndoes not the less subject her to forfeiture, because it was\r\ncommitted without the authority and against the will of the\r\nowner. It is true that inanimate matter can commit no offence.\r\nBut this body is animated and put in action by the crew, who are\r\nguided by the master. The vessel acts and speaks by the master.\r\nShe reports herself by the master. It is, therefore, not\r\nunreasonable that the vessel should be affected by this report.\"\r\nAnd again Judge Story quotes from another case: \"The thing is\r\nhere primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence\r\nis primarily attached to the thing.\" /2/\r\n\r\nIn other words, those great judges, although of course aware that\r\na ship is no more alive than a mill-wheel, thought that not only\r\nthe law did in fact deal with it as if it were alive, but that it\r\nwas reasonable that the law should do so. The reader will observe\r\nthat they do not say simply that it is reasonable on grounds of\r\npolicy to [30] sacrifice justice to the owner to security for\r\nsomebody else but that it is reasonable to deal with the vessel\r\nas an offending thing. Whatever the hidden ground of policy may\r\nbe, their thought still clothes itself in personifying language.\r\n\r\nLet us now go on to follow the peculiarities of the maritime law\r\nin other directions. For the cases which have been stated are\r\nonly parts of a larger whole.\r\n\r\nBy the maritime law of the Middle Ages the ship was not only the\r\nsource, but the limit, of liability. The rule already prevailed,\r\nwhich has been borrowed and adopted by the English statutes and\r\nby our own act of Congress of 1851, according to which the owner\r\nis discharged from responsibility for wrongful acts of a master\r\nappointed by himself upon surrendering his interest in the vessel\r\nand the freight which she had earned. By the doctrines of agency\r\nhe would be personally liable for the whole damage. If the origin\r\nof the system of limited liability which is believed to be so\r\nessential to modern commerce is to be attributed to those\r\nconsiderations of public policy on which it would now be\r\nsustained, that system has nothing to do with the law of\r\ncollision. But if the limit of liability here stands on the same\r\nground as the noxoe deditio, confirms the explanation already\r\ngiven of the liability of the ship for wrongs done by it while\r\nout of the owner's hands, and conversely existence of that\r\nliability confirms the argument here.\r\n\r\nLet us now take another rule, for which, as usual, there is a\r\nplausible explanation of policy. Freight, it is said, the mother\r\nof wages; for, we are told, \"if the ship perished, [31] if the\r\nmariners were to have their wages in such cases, they would not\r\nuse their endeavors, nor hazard their lives, for the safety of\r\nthe ship.\" /1/ The best commentary on this reasoning is, that the\r\nlaw has recently been changed by statute. But even by the old law\r\nthere was an exception inconsistent with the supposed reason. In\r\ncase of shipwreck, which was the usual case of a failure to earn\r\nfreight, so long as any portion of the ship was saved, the lien\r\nof the mariners remained. I suppose it would have been said,\r\nbecause it was sound policy to encourage them to save all they\r\ncould. If we consider that the sailors were regarded as employed\r\nby the ship, we shall understand very readily both the rule and\r\nthe exception. \"The ship is the debtor,\" as was said in arguing a\r\ncase decided in the time of William III. /2/ If the debtor\r\nperished, there was an end of the matter. If a part came ashore,\r\nthat might be proceeded against.\r\n\r\nEven the rule in its modern form, that freight is the mother of\r\nwages, is shown by the explanation commonly given to have\r\nreference to the question whether the ship is lost or arrive\r\nsafe. In the most ancient source of the maritime law now extant,\r\nwhich has anything about the matter, so far as I have been able\r\nto discover, the statement is that the mariners will lose their\r\nwages when the ship is lost. /3/ In like manner, in what is said\r\nby its English [32] editor, Sir Travers Twiss, to be the oldest\r\npart of the Consulate of the Sea, /1/ we read that \"whoever the\r\nfreighter may be who runs away or dies, the ship is bound to pay:\r\nthe mariners.\" /2/ I think we may assume that the vessel was\r\nbound by the contract with the sailors, much in the same way as\r\nit was by the wrongs for which it was answerable, just as the\r\ndebtor's body was answerable for his debts, as well as for his\r\ncrimes, under the ancient law of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of other maritime dealings with the\r\nvessel, whether by way of contract or otherwise. If salvage\r\nservice is rendered to a vessel, the admiralty court will hold\r\nthe vessel, although it has been doubted whether an action of\r\ncontract would lie, if the owners were sued at law. So the ship\r\nis bound by the master's contract to carry cargo, just as in case\r\nof collision, although she was under lease at the time. In such\r\ncases, also, according to our Supreme Court, the master may bind\r\nthe vessel when he cannot bind the general owners. /4/ \"By custom\r\nthe ship is bound to the merchandise, and the merchandise to the\r\nship.\" /5/ \"By the maritime law every contract of the master\r\nimplies an hypothecation.\" /6/ It might be urged, no doubt, with\r\nforce, that, so far as the usual maritime contracts are\r\nconcerned, the dealing must be on the security of the ship or\r\nmerchandise in many cases, and therefore [33] that it is policy\r\nto give this security in all cases; that the risk to which it\r\nsubjects ship-owners is calculable, and that they must take it\r\ninto account when they let their vessels. Again, in many cases,\r\nwhen a party asserts a maritime lien by way of contract, he has\r\nimproved the condition of the thing upon which the lien is\r\nclaimed, and this has been recognized as a ground for such a lien\r\nin some systems. But this is not true universally, nor in the\r\nmost important cases. It must be left to the reader to decide\r\nwhether ground has not been shown for believing that the same\r\nmetaphysical confusion which naturally arose as to the ship's\r\nwrongful acts, affected the way of thinking as to her contracts.\r\nThe whole manner of dealing with vessels obviously took the form\r\nwhich prevailed in the eases first mentioned. Pardessus, a high\r\nauthority, says that the lien for freight prevails even against\r\nthe owner of stolen goods, \"as the master deals less with the\r\nperson than the thing.\" /2/ So it was said in the argument of a\r\nfamous English case, that \"the ship is instead of the owner, and\r\ntherefore is answerable.\" /3/ In many cases of contract, as well\r\nas tort, the vessel was not only the security for the debt, but\r\nthe limit of the owner's liability.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the admiralty are embodied in its form of\r\nprocedure. A suit may be brought there against a vessel by name,\r\nany person interested in it being at liberty to come in and\r\ndefend, but the suit, if successful, ending in a sale of the\r\nvessel and a payment of the plaintiff's claim out of the\r\nproceeds. As long ago as the time of James I. it was said that\r\n\"the libel ought to be only [34] against the ship and goods, and\r\nnot against the party.\" /1/ And authority for the statement was\r\ncited from the reign of Henry VI., the same reign when, as we\r\nhave seen, the Admiral claimed a forfeiture of ships for causing\r\ndeath. I am bound to say, however, that I cannot find such an\r\nauthority of that date.\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the development of the chief forms of\r\nliability in modern law for anything other than the immediate and\r\nmanifest consequences of a man's own acts. We have seen the\r\nparallel course of events in the two parents,--the Roman law and\r\nthe German customs, and in the offspring of those two on English\r\nsoil with regard to servants, animals, and inanimate things. We\r\nhave seen a single germ multiplying and branching into products\r\nas different from each other as the flower from the root. It\r\nhardly remains to ask what that germ was. We have seen that it\r\nwas the desire of retaliation against the offending thing itself.\r\nUndoubtedly, it might be argued that many of the rules stated\r\nwere derived from a seizure of the offending thing as security\r\nfor reparation, at first, perhaps, outside the law. That\r\nexplanation, as well as the one offered here; would show that\r\nmodern views of responsibility had not yet been attained, as the\r\nowner of the thing might very well not have been the person in\r\nfault. But such has not been the view of those most competent to\r\njudge. A consideration of the earliest instances will show, as\r\nmight have been expected, that vengeance, not compensation, and\r\nvengeance on the offending thing, was the original object. The ox\r\nin Exodus was to be stoned. The axe in the Athenian law was to be\r\nbanished. The tree, in Mr. Tylor's instance, was to be chopped to\r\npieces. The [35] slave under all the systems was to be\r\nsurrendered to the relatives of the slain man, that they might do\r\nwith him what they liked. /1/ The deodand was an accursed thing.\r\nThe original limitation of liability to surrender, when the owner\r\nwas before the court, could not be accounted for if it was his\r\nliability, and not that of his property, which was in question.\r\nEven where, as in some of the cases, expiation seems to be\r\nintended rather than vengeance, the object is equally remote from\r\nan extrajudicial distress.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing history, apart from the purposes for which it has\r\nbeen given, well illustrates the paradox of form and substance in\r\nthe development of law. In form its growth is logical. The\r\nofficial theory is that each new decision follows syllogistically\r\nfrom existing precedents. But just as the clavicle in the cat\r\nonly tells of the existence of some earlier creature to which a\r\ncollar-bone was useful, precedents survive in the law long after\r\nthe use they once served is at an end and the reason for them has\r\nbeen forgotten. The result of following them must often be\r\nfailure and confusion from the merely logical point of view.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in substance the growth of the law is\r\nlegislative. And this in a deeper sense than that what the courts\r\ndeclare to have always been the law is in fact new. It is\r\nlegislative in its grounds. The very considerations which judges\r\nmost rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the secret\r\nroot from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of\r\ncourse, considerations of what is expedient for the community\r\nconcerned. Every important principle which is developed by\r\nlitigation is in fact and at bottom the result of more or less\r\ndefinitely understood views of public policy; most generally, to\r\nbe sure, [36] under our practice and traditions, the unconscious\r\nresult of instinctive preferences and inarticulate convictions,\r\nbut none the less traceable to views of public policy in the last\r\nanalysis. And as the law is administered by able and experienced\r\nmen, who know too much to sacrifice good sense to a syllogism, it\r\nwill be found that, when ancient rules maintain themselves in the\r\nway that has been and will be shown in this book, new reasons\r\nmore fitted to the time have been found for them, and that they\r\ngradually receive a new content, and at last a new form, from the\r\ngrounds to which they have been transplanted.\r\n\r\nBut hitherto this process has been largely unconscious. It is\r\nimportant, on that account, to bring to mind what the actual\r\ncourse of events has been. If it were only to insist on a more\r\nconscious recognition of the legislative function of the courts,\r\nas just explained, it would be useful, as we shall see more\r\nclearly further on. /1/\r\n\r\nWhat has been said will explain the failure of all theories which\r\nconsider the law only from its formal side; whether they attempt\r\nto deduce the corpus from a priori postulates, or fall into the\r\nhumbler error of supposing the science of the law to reside in\r\nthe elegantia juris, or logical cohesion of part with part. The\r\ntruth is, that the law always approaching, and never reaching,\r\nconsistency. It is forever adopting new principles from life at\r\none end, and it always retains old ones from history at the\r\nother, which have not yet been absorbed or sloughed off. It\r\nwill become entirely consistent only when it ceases to grow.\r\n\r\nThe study upon which we have been engaged is necessary both for\r\nthe knowledge and for the revision of the law. [37] However much\r\nwe may codify the law into a series of seemingly self-sufficient\r\npropositions, those propositions will be but a phase in a\r\ncontinuous growth. To understand their scope fully, to know how\r\nthey will be dealt with by judges trained in the past which the\r\nlaw embodies, we must ourselves know something of that past. The\r\nhistory of what the law has been is necessary to the knowledge of\r\nwhat the law is.\r\n\r\nAgain, the process which I have described has involved the\r\nattempt to follow precedents, as well as to give a good reason\r\nfor them. When we find that in large and important branches of\r\nthe law the various grounds of policy on which the various rules\r\nhave been justified are later inventions to account for what are\r\nin fact survivals from more primitive times, we have a right to\r\nreconsider the popular reasons, and, taking a broader view of the\r\nfield, to decide anew whether those reasons are satisfactory.\r\nThey may be, notwithstanding the manner of their appearance. If\r\ntruth were not often suggested by error, if old implements could\r\nnot be adjusted to new uses, human progress would be slow. But\r\nscrutiny and revision are justified.\r\n\r\nBut none of the foregoing considerations, nor the purpose of\r\nshowing the materials for anthropology contained in the history\r\nof the law, are the immediate object here. My aim and purpose\r\nhave been to show that the various forms of liability known to\r\nmodern law spring from the common ground of revenge. In the\r\nsphere of contract the fact will hardly be material outside the\r\ncases which have been stated in this Lecture. But in the criminal\r\nlaw and the law of torts it is of the first importance. It shows\r\nthat they have started from a moral basis, from the thought that\r\nsome one was to blame.\r\n\r\n[38] It remains to be proved that, while the terminology of\r\nmorals is still retained, and while the law does still and\r\nalways, in a certain sense, measure legal liability by moral\r\nstandards, it nevertheless, by the very necessity of its nature,\r\nis continually transmuting those moral standards into external or\r\nobjective ones, from which the actual guilt of the party\r\nconcerned is wholly eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE II. -- THE CRIMINAL LAW.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the first Lecture it was shown that the\r\nappeals of the early law were directed only to intentional\r\nwrongs. The appeal was a far older form of procedure than the\r\nindictment, and may be said to have had a criminal as well as a\r\ncivil aspect. It had the double object of satisfying the private\r\nparty for his loss, and the king for the breach of his peace. On\r\nits civil side it was rooted in vengeance. It was a proceeding to\r\nrecover those compositions, at first optional, afterwards\r\ncompulsory, by which a wrong-doer bought the spear from his side.\r\nWhether, so far as concerned the king, it had the same object of\r\nvengeance, or was more particularly directed to revenue, does not\r\nmatter, since the claim of the king did not enlarge the scope of\r\nthe action.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be a fair inference that indictable offences\r\nwere originally limited in the same way as those which gave rise\r\nto an appeal. For whether the indictment arose by a splitting up\r\nof the appeal, or in some other way, the two were closely\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nAn acquittal of the appellee on the merits was a bar to an\r\nindictment; and, on the other hand, when an appeal was fairly\r\nstarted, although the appellor might fail to prosecute, or might\r\nbe defeated by plea, the cause might still be proceeded with on\r\nbehalf of the king. /1/\r\n\r\n[40] The presentment, which is the other parent of our criminal\r\nprocedure, had an origin distinct from the appeal. If, as has\r\nbeen thought, it was merely the successor of fresh suit and lynch\r\nlaw, /1/ this also is the child of vengeance, even more clearly\r\nthan the other.\r\n\r\nThe desire for vengeance imports an opinion that its object is\r\nactually and personally to blame. It takes an internal standard,\r\nnot an objective or external one, and condemns its victim by\r\nthat. The question is whether such a standard is still accepted\r\neither in this primitive form, or in some more refined\r\ndevelopment, as is commonly supposed, and as seems not\r\nimpossible, considering the relative slowness with which the\r\ncriminal law has improved.\r\n\r\nIt certainly may be argued, with some force, that it has never\r\nceased to be one object of punishment to satisfy the desire for\r\nvengeance. The argument will be made plain by considering those\r\ninstances in which, for one reason or another, compensation for a\r\nwrong is out of the question.\r\n\r\nThus an act may be of such a kind as to make indemnity impossible\r\nby putting an end to the principal sufferer, as in the case of\r\nmurder or manslaughter.\r\n\r\nAgain, these and other crimes, like forgery, although directed\r\nagainst an individual, tend to make others feel unsafe, and this\r\ngeneral insecurity does not admit of being paid for.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are cases where there are no means of enforcing\r\nindemnity. In Macaulay's draft of the Indian Penal Code, breaches\r\nof contract for the carriage of passengers, were made criminal.\r\nThe palanquin-bearers of India were too poor to pay damages, and\r\nyet had to be [41] trusted to carry unprotected women and\r\nchildren through wild and desolate tracts, where their desertion\r\nwould have placed those under their charge in great danger.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases punishment remains as an alternative. A pain\r\ncan be inflicted upon the wrong-doer, of a sort which does not\r\nrestore the injured party to his former situation, or to another\r\nequally good, but which is inflicted for the very purpose of\r\ncausing pain. And so far as this punishment takes the place of\r\ncompensation, whether on account of the death of the person to\r\nwhom the wrong was done, the indefinite number of persons\r\naffected, the impossibility of estimating the worth of the\r\nsuffering in money, or the poverty of the criminal, it may be\r\nsaid that one of its objects is to gratify the desire for\r\nvengeance. The prisoner pays with his body.\r\n\r\nThe statement may be made stronger still, and it may be said, not\r\nonly that the law does, but that it ought to, make the\r\ngratification of revenge an object. This is the opinion, at any\r\nrate, of two authorities so great, and so opposed in other views,\r\nas Bishop Butler and Jeremy Bentham. /1/ Sir James Stephen says,\r\n\"The criminal law stands to the passion of revenge in much the\r\nsame relation as marriage to the sexual appetite.\" /2/\r\n\r\nThe first requirement of a sound body of law is, that it should\r\ncorrespond with the actual feelings and demands of the community,\r\nwhether right or wrong. If people would gratify the passion of\r\nrevenge outside of the law, if the law did not help them, the law\r\nhas no choice but to satisfy the craving itself, and thus avoid\r\nthe greater evil of private [42] retribution. At the same time,\r\nthis passion is not one which we encourage, either as private\r\nindividuals or as lawmakers. Moreover, it does not cover the\r\nwhole ground. There are crimes which do not excite it, and we\r\nshould naturally expect that the most important purposes of\r\npunishment would be coextensive with the whole field of its\r\napplication. It remains to be discovered whether such a general\r\npurpose exists, and if so what it is. Different theories still\r\ndivide opinion upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that the purpose of punishment is to reform\r\nthe criminal; that it is to deter the criminal and others from\r\ncommitting similar crimes; and that it is retribution. Few would\r\nnow maintain that the first of these purposes was the only one.\r\nIf it were, every prisoner should be released as soon as it\r\nappears clear that he will never repeat his offence, and if he is\r\nincurable he should not be punished at all. Of course it would be\r\nhard to reconcile the punishment of death with this doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe main struggle lies between the other two. On the one side is\r\nthe notion that there is a mystic bond between wrong and\r\npunishment; on the other, that the infliction of pain is only a\r\nmeans to an end. Hegel, one of the great expounders of the former\r\nview, puts it, in his quasi mathematical form, that, wrong being\r\nthe negation of right, punishment is the negation of that\r\nnegation, or retribution. Thus the punishment must be equal, in\r\nthe sense of proportionate to the crime, because its only\r\nfunction is to destroy it. Others, without this logical\r\napparatus, are content to rely upon a felt necessity that\r\nsuffering should follow wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nIt is objected that the preventive theory is immoral, because it\r\noverlooks the ill-desert of wrong-doing, and furnishes [43] no\r\nmeasure of the amount of punishment, except the lawgiver's\r\nsubjective opinion in regard to the sufficiency of the amount of\r\npreventive suffering. /1/ In the language of Kant, it treats man\r\nas a thing, not as a person; as a means, not as an end in\r\nhimself. It is said to conflict with the sense of justice, and to\r\nviolate the fundamental principle of all free communities, that\r\nthe members of such communities have equal rights to life,\r\nliberty, and personal security. /2/\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, probably most English-speaking lawyers\r\nwould accept the preventive theory without hesitation. As to the\r\nviolation of equal rights which is charged, it may be replied\r\nthat the dogma of equality makes an equation between individuals\r\nonly, not between an individual and the community. No society has\r\never admitted that it could not sacrifice individual welfare to\r\nits own existence. If conscripts are necessary for its army, it\r\nseizes them, and marches them, with bayonets in their rear, to\r\ndeath. It runs highways and railroads through old family places\r\nin spite of the owner's protest, paying in this instance the\r\nmarket value, to be sure, because no civilized government\r\nsacrifices the citizen more than it can help, but still\r\nsacrificing his will and his welfare to that of the rest. /3/\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary to trench further upon the field of morals,\r\nit might be suggested that the dogma of equality applied even to\r\nindividuals only within the limits of ordinary dealings in the\r\ncommon run of affairs. You cannot argue with your neighbor,\r\nexcept on the admission for the [44] moment that he is as wise as\r\nyou, although you may by no means believe it. In the same way,\r\nyou cannot deal with him, where both are free to choose, except\r\non the footing of equal treatment, and the same rules for both.\r\nThe ever-growing value set upon peace and the social relations\r\ntends to give the law of social being the appearance of the law\r\nof all being. But it seems to me clear that the ultima ratio, not\r\nonly regum, but of private persons, is force, and that at the\r\nbottom of all private relations, however tempered by sympathy and\r\nall the social feelings, is a justifiable self-preference. If a\r\nman is on a plank in the deep sea which will only float one, and\r\na stranger lays hold of it, he will thrust him off if he can.\r\nWhen the state finds itself in a similar position, it does the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which answer the argument of equal rights also\r\nanswer the objections to treating man as a thing, and the like.\r\nIf a man lives in society, he is liable to find himself so\r\ntreated. The degree of civilization which a people has reached,\r\nno doubt, is marked by their anxiety to do as they would be done\r\nby. It may be the destiny of man that the social instincts shall\r\ngrow to control his actions absolutely, even in anti-social\r\nsituations. But they have not yet done so, and as the rules of\r\nlaw are or should be based upon a morality which is generally\r\naccepted, no rule founded on a theory of absolute unselfishness\r\ncan be laid down without a breach between law and working\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as I shall presently try to show, that the general\r\nprinciples of criminal and civil liability are the same, it will\r\nfollow from that alone that theory and fact agree in frequently\r\npunishing those who have been guilty [45] of no moral wrong, and\r\nwho could not be condemned by any standard that did not avowedly\r\ndisregard the personal peculiarities of the individuals\r\nconcerned. If punishment stood on the moral grounds which are\r\nproposed for it, the first thing to be considered would be those\r\nlimitations in the capacity for choosing rightly which arise from\r\nabnormal instincts, want of education, lack of intelligence, and\r\nall the other defects which are most marked in the criminal\r\nclasses. I do not say that they should not be, or at least I do\r\nnot need to for my argument. I do not say that the criminal law\r\ndoes more good than harm. I only say that it is not enacted or\r\nadministered on that theory.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be mentioned the affirmative argument in favor\r\nof the theory of retribution, to the effect that the fitness of\r\npunishment following wrong-doing is axiomatic, and is\r\ninstinctively recognized by unperverted minds. I think that it\r\nwill be seen, on self-inspection, that this feeling of fitness is\r\nabsolute and unconditional only in the case of our neighbors. It\r\ndoes not seem to me that any one who has satisfied himself that\r\nan act of his was wrong, and that he will never do it again,\r\nwould feel the least need or propriety, as between himself and an\r\nearthly punishing power alone, of his being made to suffer for\r\nwhat he had done, although, when third persons were introduced,\r\nhe might, as a philosopher, admit the necessity of hurting him to\r\nfrighten others. But when our neighbors do wrong, we sometimes\r\nfeel the fitness of making them smart for it, whether they have\r\nrepented or not. The feeling of fitness seems to me to be only\r\nvengeance in disguise, and I have already admitted that vengeance\r\nwas an element, though not the chief element, of punishment.\r\n\r\n[46] But, again, the supposed intuition of fitness does not seem\r\nto me to be coextensive with the thing to be accounted for. The\r\nlesser punishments are just as fit for the lesser crimes as the\r\ngreater for the greater. The demand that crime should be followed\r\nby its punishment should therefore be equal and absolute in both.\r\nAgain, a malum prohibitum is just as much a crime as a malum in\r\nse. If there is any general ground for punishment, it must apply\r\nto one case as much as to the other. But it will hardly be said\r\nthat, if the wrong in the case just supposed consisted of a\r\nbreach of the revenue laws, and the government had been\r\nindemnified for the loss, we should feel any internal necessity\r\nthat a man who had thoroughly repented of his wrong should be\r\npunished for it, except on the ground that his act was known to\r\nothers. If it was known, the law would have to verify its threats\r\nin order that others might believe and tremble. But if the fact\r\nwas a secret between the sovereign and the subject, the\r\nsovereign, if wholly free from passion, would undoubtedly see\r\nthat punishment in such a case was wholly without justification.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there can be no case in which the law-maker\r\nmakes certain conduct criminal without his thereby showing a wish\r\nand purpose to prevent that conduct. Prevention would accordingly\r\nseem to be the chief and only universal purpose of punishment.\r\nThe law threatens certain pains if you do certain things,\r\nintending thereby to give you a new motive for not doing them. If\r\nyou persist in doing them, it has to inflict the pains in order\r\nthat its threats may continue to be believed.\r\n\r\nIf this is a true account of the law as it stands, the law does\r\nundoubtedly treat the individual as a means to an [47] end, and\r\nuses him as a tool to increase the general welfare at his own\r\nexpense. It has been suggested above, that this course is\r\nperfectly proper; but even if it is wrong, our criminal law\r\nfollows it, and the theory of our criminal law must be shaped\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence that our law exceeds the limits of retribution,\r\nand subordinates consideration of the individual to that of the\r\npublic well-being, will be found in some doctrines which cannot\r\nbe satisfactorily explained on any other ground.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is, that even the deliberate taking of life\r\nwill not be punished when it is the only way of saving one's own.\r\nThis principle is not so clearly established as that next to be\r\nmentioned; but it has the support of very great authority. /1/ If\r\nthat is the law, it must go on one of two grounds, either that\r\nself-preference is proper in the case supposed, or that, even if\r\nit is improper, the law cannot prevent it by punishment, because\r\na threat of death at some future time can never be a sufficiently\r\npowerful motive to make a man choose death now in order to avoid\r\nthe threat. If the former ground is adopted, it admits that a\r\nsingle person may sacrifice another to himself, and a fortiori\r\nthat a people may. If the latter view is taken, by abandoning\r\npunishment when it can no longer be expected to prevent an act,\r\nthe law abandons the retributive and adopts the preventive\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe next doctrine leads to still clearer conclusions. Ignorance\r\nof the law is no excuse for breaking it. This substantive\r\nprinciple is sometimes put in the form of a rule of evidence,\r\nthat every one is presumed to know the [48] law. It has\r\naccordingly been defended by Austin and others, on the ground of\r\ndifficulty of proof. If justice requires the fact to be\r\nascertained, the difficulty of doing so is no ground for refusing\r\nto try. But every one must feel that ignorance of the law could\r\nnever be admitted as an excuse, even if the fact could be proved\r\nby sight and hearing in every case. Furthermore, now that parties\r\ncan testify, it may be doubted whether a man's knowledge of the\r\nlaw is any harder to investigate than many questions which are\r\ngone into. The difficulty, such as it is, would be met by\r\nthrowing the burden of proving ignorance on the lawbreaker.\r\n\r\nThe principle cannot be explained by saying that we are not only\r\ncommanded to abstain from certain acts, but also to find out that\r\nwe are commanded. For if there were such a second command, it is\r\nvery clear that the guilt of failing to obey it would bear no\r\nproportion to that of disobeying the principal command if known,\r\nyet the failure to know would receive the same punishment as the\r\nfailure to obey the principal law.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of the rule is the same as that which\r\naccounts for the law's indifference to a man's particular\r\ntemperament, faculties, and so forth. Public policy sacrifices\r\nthe individual to the general good. It is desirable that the\r\nburden of all should be equal, but it is still more desirable to\r\nput an end to robbery and murder. It is no doubt true that there\r\nare many cases in which the criminal could not have known that he\r\nwas breaking the law, but to admit the excuse at all would be to\r\nencourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined to make\r\nmen know and obey, and justice to the individual is rightly\r\noutweighed by the larger interests on the other side of the\r\nscales.\r\n\r\n[49] If the foregoing arguments are sound, it is already manifest\r\nthat liability to punishment cannot be finally and absolutely\r\ndetermined by considering the actual personal unworthiness of the\r\ncriminal alone. That consideration will govern only so far as the\r\npublic welfare permits or demands. And if we take into account\r\nthe general result which the criminal law is intended to bring\r\nabout, we shall see that the actual state of mind accompanying a\r\ncriminal act plays a different part from what is commonly\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the purpose of the criminal law is only to\r\ninduce external conformity to rule. All law is directed to\r\nconditions of things manifest to the senses. And whether it\r\nbrings those conditions to pass immediately by the use of force,\r\nas when it protects a house from a mob by soldiers, or\r\nappropriates private property to public use, or hangs a man in\r\npursuance of a judicial sentence, or whether it brings them about\r\nmediately through men's fears, its object is equally an external\r\nresult. In directing itself against robbery or murder, for\r\ninstance, its purpose is to put a stop to the actual physical\r\ntaking and keeping of other men's goods, or the actual poisoning,\r\nshooting, stabbing, and otherwise putting to death of other men.\r\nIf those things are not done, the law forbidding them is equally\r\nsatisfied, whatever the motive.\r\n\r\nConsidering this purely external purpose of the law together with\r\nthe fact that it is ready to sacrifice the individual so far as\r\nnecessary in order to accomplish that purpose, we can see more\r\nreadily than before that the actual degree of personal guilt\r\ninvolved in any particular transgression cannot be the only\r\nelement, if it is an element at all, in the liability incurred.\r\nSo far from its [50] being true, as is often assumed, that the\r\ncondition of a man's heart or conscience ought to be more\r\nconsidered in determining criminal than civil liability, it might\r\nalmost be said that it is the very opposite of truth. For civil\r\nliability, in its immediate working, is simply a redistribution\r\nof an existing loss between two individuals; and it will be\r\nargued in the next Lecture that sound policy lets losses lie\r\nwhere they fall, except where a special reason can be shown for\r\ninterference. The most frequent of such reasons is, that the\r\nparty who is charged has been to blame.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended to deny that criminal liability, as well as\r\ncivil, is founded on blameworthiness. Such a denial would shock\r\nthe moral sense of any civilized community; or, to put it another\r\nway, a law which punished conduct which would not be blameworthy\r\nin the average member of the community would be too severe for\r\nthat community to bear. It is only intended to point out that,\r\nwhen we are dealing with that part of the law which aims more\r\ndirectly than any other at establishing standards of conduct, we\r\nshould expect there more than elsewhere to find that the tests of\r\nliability are external, and independent of the degree of evil in\r\nthe particular person's motives or intentions. The conclusion\r\nfollows directly from the nature of the standards to which\r\nconformity is required. These are not only external, as was shown\r\nabove, but they are of general application. They do not merely\r\nrequire that every man should get as near as he can to the best\r\nconduct possible for him. They require him at his own peril to\r\ncome up to a certain height. They take no account of\r\nincapacities, unless the weakness is so marked as to fall into\r\nwell-known exceptions, such as infancy or madness. [51] They\r\nassume that every man is as able as every other to behave as they\r\ncommand. If they fall on any one class harder than on another, it\r\nis on the weakest. For it is precisely to those who are most\r\nlikely to err by temperament, ignorance, or folly, that the\r\nthreats of the law are the most dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation of the doctrine that liability is founded on\r\nblameworthiness with the existence of liability where the party\r\nis not to blame, will be worked out more fully in the next\r\nLecture. It is found in the conception of the average man, the\r\nman of ordinary intelligence and reasonable prudence. Liability\r\nis said to arise out of such conduct as would be blameworthy in\r\nhim. But he is an ideal being, represented by the jury when they\r\nare appealed to, and his conduct is an external or objective\r\nstandard when applied to any given individual. That individual\r\nmay be morally without stain, because he has less than ordinary\r\nintelligence or prudence. But he is required to have those\r\nqualities at his peril. If he has them, he will not, as a general\r\nrule, incur liability without blameworthiness.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to take up some crimes in detail, and to\r\ndiscover what analysis will teach with regard to them.\r\n\r\nI will begin with murder. Murder is defined by Sir James Stephen,\r\nin his Digest of Criminal Law, /1/ as unlawful homicide with\r\nmalice aforethought. In his earlier work, /2/ he explained that\r\nmalice meant wickedness, and that the law had determined what\r\nstates of mind were wicked in the necessary degree. Without the\r\nsame preliminary he continues in his Digest as follows:--\r\n\r\n[52] \"Malice aforethought means any one or more of the following\r\nstates of mind..... \"(a.) An intention to cause the death of, or\r\ngrievous bodily harm to, any person, whether such person is the\r\nperson actually killed or not; \"(b.) Knowledge that the act which\r\ncauses death will probably cause the death of, or grievous bodily\r\nharm to, some person, whether such person is the person actually\r\nkilled or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by\r\nindifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or\r\nnot, or by a wish that it may not be caused; \"(c.) An intent to\r\ncommit any felony whatever; \"(d.) An intent to oppose by force\r\nany officer of justice on his way to, in, or returning from the\r\nexecution of the duty of arresting, keeping in custody, or\r\nimprisoning any person whom he is lawfully entitled to arrest,\r\nkeep in custody, or imprison, or the duty of keeping the peace or\r\ndispersing an unlawful assembly, provided that the offender has\r\nnotice that the person killed is such an officer so employed.\"\r\n\r\nMalice, as used in common speech, includes intent, and something\r\nmore. When an act is said to be done with an intent to do harm,\r\nit is meant that a wish for the harm is the motive of the act.\r\nIntent, however, is perfectly consistent with the harm being\r\nregretted as such, and being wished only as a means to something\r\nelse. But when an act is said to be done maliciously, it is\r\nmeant, not only that a wish for the harmful effect is the motive,\r\nbut also that the harm is wished for its own sake, or, as Austin\r\nwould say with more accuracy, for the sake of the pleasurable\r\nfeeling which knowledge of the suffering caused by the act would\r\nexcite. Now it is apparent from Sir James [53] Stephen's\r\nenumeration, that of these two elements of malice the intent\r\nalone is material to murder. It is just as much murder to shoot a\r\nsentry for the purpose of releasing a friend, as to shoot him\r\nbecause you hate him. Malice, in the definition of murder, has\r\nnot the same meaning as in common speech, and, in view of the\r\nconsiderations just mentioned, it has been thought to mean\r\ncriminal intention. /1/\r\n\r\nBut intent again will be found to resolve itself into two things;\r\nforesight that certain consequences will follow from an act, and\r\nthe wish for those consequences working as a motive which induces\r\nthe act. The question then is, whether intent, in its turn,\r\ncannot be reduced to a lower term. Sir James Stephen's statement\r\nshows that it can be, and that knowledge that the act will\r\nprobably cause death, that is, foresight of the consequences of\r\nthe act, is enough in murder as in tort.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a newly born child is laid naked out of doors,\r\nwhere it must perish as a matter of course. This is none the less\r\nmurder, that the guilty party would have been very glad to have a\r\nstranger find the child and save it. /2/\r\n\r\nBut again, What is foresight of consequences? It is a picture of\r\na future state of things called up by knowledge of the present\r\nstate of things, the future being viewed as standing to the\r\npresent in the relation of effect to cause. Again, we must seek a\r\nreduction to lower terms. If the known present state of things is\r\nsuch that the act done will very certainly cause death, and the\r\nprobability is a matter of common knowledge, one who does the\r\nact, [54] knowing the present state of things, is guilty of\r\nmurder, and the law will not inquire whether he did actually\r\nforesee the consequences or not. The test of foresight is not\r\nwhat this very criminal foresaw, but what a man of reasonable\r\nprudence would have foreseen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there must be actual present knowledge of the\r\npresent facts which make an act dangerous. The act is not enough\r\nby itself. An act, it is true, imports intention in a certain\r\nsense. It is a muscular contraction, and something more. A spasm\r\nis not an act. The contraction of the muscles must be willed. And\r\nas an adult who is master of himself foresees with mysterious\r\naccuracy the outward adjustment which will follow his inward\r\neffort, that adjustment may be said to be intended. But the\r\nintent necessarily accompanying the act ends there. Nothing would\r\nfollow from the act except for the environment. All acts, taken\r\napart from their surrounding circumstances, are indifferent to\r\nthe law. For instance, to crook the forefinger with a certain\r\nforce is the same act whether the trigger of a pistol is next to\r\nit or not. It is only the surrounding circumstances of a pistol\r\nloaded and cocked, and of a human being in such relation to it,\r\nas to be manifestly likely to be hit, that make the act a wrong.\r\nHence, it is no sufficient foundation for liability, on any sound\r\nprinciple, that the proximate cause of loss was an act.\r\n\r\nThe reason for requiring an act is, that an act implies a choice,\r\nand that it is felt to be impolitic and unjust to make a man\r\nanswerable for harm, unless he might have chosen otherwise. But\r\nthe choice must be made with a chance of contemplating the\r\nconsequence complained of, or else it has no bearing on\r\nresponsibility for that consequence. [55] If this were not true,\r\na man might be held answerable for everything which would not\r\nhave happened but for his choice at some past time. For instance,\r\nfor having in a fit fallen on a man, which he would not have done\r\nhad he not chosen to come to the city where he was taken ill.\r\n\r\nAll foresight of the future, all choice with regard to any\r\npossible consequence of action, depends on what is known at the\r\nmoment of choosing. An act cannot be wrong, even when done under\r\ncircumstances in which it will be hurtful, unless those\r\ncircumstances are or ought to be known. A fear of punishment for\r\ncausing harm cannot work as a motive, unless the possibility of\r\nharm may be foreseen. So far, then, as criminal liability is\r\nfounded upon wrong-doing in any sense, and so far as the threats\r\nand punishments of the law are intended to deter men from\r\nbringing about various harmful results, they must be confined to\r\ncases where circumstances making the conduct dangerous were\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nStill, in a more limited way, the same principle applies to\r\nknowledge that applies to foresight. It is enough that such\r\ncircumstances were actually known as would have led a man of\r\ncommon understanding to infer from them the rest of the group\r\nmaking up the present state of things. For instance, if a workman\r\non a house-top at mid-day knows that the space below him is a\r\nstreet in a great city, he knows facts from which a man of common\r\nunderstanding would infer that there were people passing below.\r\nHe is therefore bound to draw that inference, or, in other words,\r\nis chargeable with knowledge of that fact also, whether he draws\r\nthe inference or not. If then, he throws down a heavy beam into\r\nthe street, he does an act [56] which a person of ordinary\r\nprudence would foresee is likely to cause death, or grievous\r\nbodily harm, and he is dealt with as if he foresaw it, whether he\r\ndoes so in fact or not. If a death is caused by the act, he is\r\nguilty of murder. /1/ But if the workman has reasonable cause to\r\nbelieve that the space below is a private yard from which every\r\none is excluded, and which is used as a rubbish heap, his act is\r\nnot blameworthy, and the homicide is a mere misadventure.\r\n\r\nTo make an act which causes death murder, then, the actor ought,\r\non principle, to know, or have notice of the facts which make the\r\nact dangerous. There are certain exceptions to this principle\r\nwhich will be stated presently, but they have less application to\r\nmurder than to some smaller statutory crimes. The general rule\r\nprevails for the most part in murder.\r\n\r\nBut furthermore, on the same principle, the danger which in fact\r\nexists under the known circumstances ought to be of a class which\r\na man of reasonable prudence could foresee. Ignorance of a fact\r\nand inability to foresee a consequence have the same effect on\r\nblameworthiness. If a consequence cannot be foreseen, it cannot\r\nbe avoided. But there is this practical difference, that whereas,\r\nin most cases, the question of knowledge is a question of the\r\nactual condition of the defendant's consciousness, the question\r\nof what he might have foreseen is determined by the standard of\r\nthe prudent man, that is, by general experience. For it is to be\r\nremembered that the object of the law is to prevent human life\r\nbeing endangered or taken; and that, although it so far considers\r\nblameworthiness in punishing as not to hold a man responsible for\r\nconsequences which [57] no one, or only some exceptional\r\nspecialist, could have foreseen, still the reason for this\r\nlimitation is simply to make a rule which is not too hard for the\r\naverage member of the community. As the purpose is to compel men\r\nto abstain from dangerous conduct, and not merely to restrain\r\nthem from evil inclinations, the law requires them at their peril\r\nto know the teachings of common experience, just as it requires\r\nthem to know the law. Subject to these explanations, it may be\r\nsaid that the test of murder is the degree of danger to life\r\nattending the act under the known circumstances of the case. /1/\r\n\r\nIt needs no further explanation to show that, when the particular\r\ndefendant does for any reason foresee what an ordinary man of\r\nreasonable prudence would not have foreseen, the ground of\r\nexemption no longer applies. A harmful act is only excused on the\r\nground that the party neither did foresee, nor could with proper\r\ncare have foreseen harm.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, at first sight, that the above analysis ought to\r\nexhaust the whole subject of murder. But it does not without some\r\nfurther explanation. If a man forcibly resists an officer\r\nlawfully making an arrest, and kills him, knowing him to be an\r\nofficer, it may be murder, although no act is done which, but for\r\nhis official function, would be criminal at all. So, if a man\r\ndoes an act with intent to commit a felony, and thereby\r\naccidentally kills another; for instance, if he fires at\r\nchickens, intending to steal them, and accidentally kills the\r\nowner, whom he does not see. Such a case as this last seems\r\nhardly to be reconcilable with the general principles which have\r\nbeen laid down. It has been argued somewhat as [58] follows:--The\r\nonly blameworthy act is firing at the chickens, knowing them to\r\nbelong to another. It is neither more nor less so because an\r\naccident happens afterwards; and hitting a man, whose presence\r\ncould not have been suspected, is an accident. The fact that the\r\nshooting is felonious does not make it any more likely to kill\r\npeople. If the object of the rule is to prevent such accidents,\r\nit should make accidental killing with firearms murder, not\r\naccidental killing in the effort to steal; while, if its object\r\nis to prevent stealing, it would do better to hang one thief in\r\nevery thousand by lot.\r\n\r\nStill, the law is intelligible as it stands. The general test of\r\nmurder is the degree of danger attending the acts under the known\r\nstate of facts. If certain acts are regarded as peculiarly\r\ndangerous under certain circumstances, a legislator may make them\r\npunishable if done under these circumstances, although the danger\r\nwas not generally known. The law often takes this step, although\r\nit does not nowadays often inflict death in such cases. It\r\nsometimes goes even further, and requires a man to find out\r\npresent facts, as well as to foresee future harm, at his peril,\r\nalthough they are not such as would necessarily be inferred from\r\nthe facts known.\r\n\r\nThus it is a statutory offence in England to abduct a girl under\r\nsixteen from the possession of the person having lawful charge of\r\nher. If a man does acts which induce a girl under sixteen to\r\nleave her parents, he is not chargeable, if he had no reason to\r\nknow that she was under the lawful charge of her parents, /1/ and\r\nit may be presumed that he would not be, if he had reasonable\r\ncause to believe that she was a boy. But if he knowingly abducts\r\na girl from [59] her parents, he must find out her age at his\r\nperil. It is no defence that he had every reason to think her\r\nover sixteen. /1/ So, under a prohibitory liquor law, it has been\r\nheld that, if a man sells \"Plantation Bitters,\" it is no defence\r\nthat he does not know them to be intoxicating. /2/ And there are\r\nother examples of the same kind.\r\n\r\nNow, if experience shows, or is deemed by the law-maker to show,\r\nthat somehow or other deaths which the evidence makes accidental\r\nhappen disproportionately often in connection with other\r\nfelonies, or with resistance to officers, or if on any other\r\nground of policy it is deemed desirable to make special efforts\r\nfor the prevention of such deaths, the lawmaker may consistently\r\ntreat acts which, under the known circumstances, are felonious,\r\nor constitute resistance to officers, as having a sufficiently\r\ndangerous tendency to be put under a special ban. The law may,\r\ntherefore, throw on the actor the peril, not only of the\r\nconsequences foreseen by him, but also of consequences which,\r\nalthough not predicted by common experience, the legislator\r\napprehends. I do not, however, mean to argue that the rules under\r\ndiscussion arose on the above reasoning, any more than that they\r\nare right, or would be generally applied in this country.\r\n\r\nReturning to the main line of thought it will be instructive to\r\nconsider the relation of manslaughter to murder. One great\r\ndifference between the two will be found to lie in the degree of\r\ndanger attaching to the act in the given state of facts. If a man\r\nstrikes another with a small stick which is not likely to kill,\r\nand which he has no reason to suppose will do more than slight\r\nbodily harm, but which [60] does kill the other, he commits\r\nmanslaughter, not murder. /1/ But if the blow is struck as hard\r\nas possible with an iron bar an inch thick, it is murder. /2/ So\r\nif, at the time of striking with a switch, the party knows an\r\nadditional fact, by reason of which he foresees that death will\r\nbe the consequence of a slight blow, as, for instance, that the\r\nother has heart disease, the offence is equally murder. /3/ To\r\nexplode a barrel of gunpowder in a crowded street, and kill\r\npeople, is murder, although the actor hopes that no such harm\r\nwill be done. /4/ But to kill a man by careless riding in the\r\nsame street would commonly be manslaughter. /5/ Perhaps, however,\r\na case could be put where the riding was so manifestly dangerous\r\nthat it would be murder.\r\n\r\nTo recur to an example which has been used already for another\r\npurpose: \"When a workman flings down a stone or piece of timber\r\ninto the street, and kills a man; this may be either\r\nmisadventure, manslaughter, or murder, according to the\r\ncircumstances under which the original act was done: if it were\r\nin a country village, where few passengers are, and he calls out\r\nto all people to have a care, it is misadventure only; but if it\r\nwere in London, or other populous town, where people are\r\ncontinually passing, it is manslaughter, though he gives loud\r\nwarning; and murder, if he knows of their passing, and gives no\r\nwarning at all.\" /6/\r\n\r\nThe law of manslaughter contains another doctrine [61] which\r\nshould be referred to in order to complete the understanding of\r\nthe general principles of the criminal law. This doctrine is,\r\nthat provocation may reduce an offence which would otherwise have\r\nbeen murder to manslaughter. According to current morality, a man\r\nis not so much to blame for an act done under the disturbance of\r\ngreat excitement, caused by a wrong done to himself, as when he\r\nis calm. The law is made to govern men through their motives, and\r\nit must, therefore, take their mental constitution into account.\r\n\r\nIt might be urged, on the other side, that, if the object of\r\npunishment is prevention, the heaviest punishment should be\r\nthreatened where the strongest motive is needed to restrain; and\r\nprimitive legislation seems sometimes to have gone on that\r\nprinciple. But if any threat will restrain a man in a passion, a\r\nthreat of less than death will be sufficient, and therefore the\r\nextreme penalty has been thought excessive.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the objective nature of legal standards is shown\r\neven here. The mitigation does not come from the fact that the\r\ndefendant was beside himself with rage. It is not enough that he\r\nhad grounds which would have had the same effect on every man of\r\nhis standing and education. The most insulting words are not\r\nprovocation, although to this day, and still more when the law\r\nwas established, many people would rather die than suffer them\r\nwithout action. There must be provocation sufficient to justify\r\nthe passion, and the law decides on general considerations what\r\nprovocations are sufficient.\r\n\r\nIt is said that even what the law admits to be \"provocation does\r\nnot extenuate the guilt of homicide, unless the person provoked\r\nis at the time when he does the deed [62] deprived of the power\r\nof self-control by the provocation which he has received.\" /1/\r\nThere are obvious reasons for taking the actual state of the\r\ndefendant's consciousness into account to this extent. The only\r\nground for not applying the general rule is, that the defendant\r\nwas in such a state that he could not be expected to remember or\r\nbe influenced by the fear of punishment; if he could be, the\r\nground of exception disappears. Yet even here, rightly or\r\nwrongly, the law has gone far in the direction of adopting\r\nexternal tests. The courts seem to have decided between murder\r\nand manslaughter on such grounds as the nature of the weapon\r\nused, /2/ or the length of time between the provocation and the\r\nact. /3/ But in other cases the question whether the prisoner was\r\ndeprived of self-control by passion has been left to the jury.\r\n/4/\r\n\r\nAs the object of this Lecture is not to give an outline of the\r\ncriminal law, but to explain its general theory, I shall only\r\nconsider such offences as throw some special light upon the\r\nsubject, and shall treat of those in such order as seems best\r\nfitted for that purpose. It will now be useful to take up\r\nmalicious mischief, and to compare the malice required to\r\nconstitute that offence with the malice aforethought of murder.\r\n\r\nThe charge of malice aforethought in an indictment for murder has\r\nbeen shown not to mean a state of the defendant's mind, as is\r\noften thought, except in the sense that he knew circumstances\r\nwhich did in fact make his conduct dangerous. It is, in truth, an\r\nallegation like that of negligence, which asserts that the party\r\naccused did not [63] come up to the legal standard of action\r\nunder the circumstances in which he found himself, and also that\r\nthere was no exceptional fact or excuse present which took the\r\ncase out of the general rule. It is an averment of a conclusion\r\nof law which is permitted to abridge the facts (positive and\r\nnegative) on which it is founded.\r\n\r\nWhen a statute punishes the \"wilfully and maliciously\" injuring\r\nanother's property, it is arguable, if not clear, that something\r\nmore is meant. The presumption that the second word was not added\r\nwithout some meaning is seconded by the unreasonableness of\r\nmaking every wilful trespass criminal. /1/ If this reasoning\r\nprevails, maliciously is here used in its popular sense, and\r\nimports that the motive for the defendant's act was a wish to\r\nharm the owner of the property, or the thing itself, if living,\r\nas an end, and for the sake of the harm. Malice in this sense has\r\nnothing in common with the malice of murder.\r\n\r\nStatutory law need not profess to be consistent with itself, or\r\nwith the theory adopted by judicial decisions. Hence there is\r\nstrictly no need to reconcile such a statute with the principles\r\nwhich have been explained. But there is no inconsistency.\r\nAlthough punishment must be confined to compelling external\r\nconformity to a rule of conduct, so far that it can always be\r\navoided by avoiding or doing certain acts as required, with\r\nwhatever intent or for whatever motive, still the prohibited\r\nconduct may not be hurtful unless it is accompanied by a\r\nparticular state of feeling.\r\n\r\nCommon disputes about property are satisfactorily settled by\r\ncompensation. But every one knows that sometimes secret harm is\r\ndone by neighbor to neighbor out of [64] pure malice and spite.\r\nThe damage can be paid for, but the malignity calls for revenge,\r\nand the difficulty of detecting the authors of such wrongs, which\r\nare always done secretly, affords a ground for punishment, even\r\nif revenge is thought insufficient.\r\n\r\nHow far the law will go in this direction it is hard to say. The\r\ncrime of arson is defined to be the malicious and wilful burning\r\nof the house of another man, and is generally discussed in close\r\nconnection with malicious mischief. It has been thought that the\r\nburning was not malicious where a prisoner set fire to his\r\nprison, not from a desire to consume the building, but solely to\r\neffect his escape. But it seems to be the better opinion that\r\nthis is arson, /1/ in which case an intentional burning is\r\nmalicious within the meaning of the rule. When we remember that\r\narson was the subject of one of the old appeals which take us far\r\nback into the early law, /2/ we may readily understand that only\r\nintentional burnings were redressed in that way. /3/ The appeal\r\nof arson was brother to the appeal de pace et plagis. As the\r\nlatter was founded on a warlike assault, the former supposed a\r\nhouse-firing for robbery or revenge, /4/ such as that by which\r\nNjal perished in the Icelandic Saga. But this crime seems to have\r\nhad the same history as others. As soon as intent is admitted to\r\nbe sufficient, the law is on the high-road to an external\r\nstandard. A man who intentionally sets fire to his own house,\r\nwhich is so near to other houses that the fire will manifestly\r\nendanger them, is guilty of arson if one of the other houses is\r\nburned in consequence. /5/ In this case, an act which would not\r\n[65] have been arson, taking only its immediate consequences into\r\naccount, becomes arson by reason of more remote consequences\r\nwhich were manifestly likely to follow, whether they were\r\nactually intended or not. If that may be the effect of setting\r\nfire to things which a man has a right to burn, so far as they\r\nalone are concerned, why, on principle, should it not be the\r\neffect of any other act which is equally likely under the\r\nsurrounding circumstances to cause the same harm. /1/ Cases may\r\neasily be imagined where firing a gun, or making a chemical\r\nmixture, or piling up oiled rags, or twenty other things, might\r\nbe manifestly dangerous in the highest degree and actually lead\r\nto a conflagration. If, in such cases, the crime is held to have\r\nbeen committed, an external standard is reached, and the analysis\r\nwhich has been made of murder applies here.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of cases in which intent plays an\r\nimportant part, for quite different reasons from those which have\r\nbeen offered to account for the law of malicious mischief. The\r\nmost obvious examples of this class are criminal attempts.\r\nAttempt and intent, of course, are two distinct things. Intent to\r\ncommit a crime is not itself criminal. There is no law against a\r\nman's intending to commit a murder the day after tomorrow. The\r\nlaw only deals with conduct. An attempt is an overt act. It\r\ndiffers from the attempted crime in this, that the act has failed\r\nto bring about the result which would have given it the character\r\nof the principal crime. If an attempt to murder results in death\r\nwithin a year and a day, it is murder. If an attempt to steal\r\nresults in carrying off the owner's goods, it is larceny.\r\n\r\nIf an act is done of which the natural and probable [66] effect\r\nunder the circumstances is the accomplishment of a substantive\r\ncrime, the criminal law, while it may properly enough moderate\r\nthe severity of punishment if the act has not that effect in the\r\nparticular case, can hardly abstain altogether from punishing it,\r\non any theory. It has been argued that an actual intent is all\r\nthat can give the act a criminal character in such instances. /1/\r\nBut if the views which I have advanced as to murder and\r\nmanslaughter are sound, the same principles ought logically to\r\ndetermine the criminality of acts in general. Acts should be\r\njudged by their tendency under the known circumstances, not by\r\nthe actual intent which accompanies them.\r\n\r\nIt may be true that in the region of attempts, as elsewhere, the\r\nlaw began with cases of actual intent, as those cases are the\r\nmost obvious ones. But it cannot stop with them, unless it\r\nattaches more importance to the etymological meaning of the word\r\nattempt than to the general principles of punishment. Accordingly\r\nthere is at least color of authority for the proposition that an\r\nact is punishable as an attempt, if, supposing it to have\r\nproduced its natural and probable effect, it would have amounted\r\nto a substantive crime. /2/\r\n\r\nBut such acts are not the only punishable attempts. There is\r\nanother class in which actual intent is clearly necessary, and\r\nthe existence of this class as well as the name (attempt) no\r\ndoubt tends to affect the whole doctrine. Some acts may be\r\nattempts or misdemeanors which [67] could not have effected the\r\ncrime unless followed by other acts on the part of the\r\nwrong-doer. For instance, lighting a match with intent to set\r\nfire to a haystack has been held to amount to a criminal attempt\r\nto burn it, although the defendant blew out the match on seeing\r\nthat he was watched. /1/ So the purchase of dies for making\r\ncounterfeit coin is a misdemeanor, although of course the coin\r\nwould not be counterfeited unless the dies were used. /2/\r\n\r\nIn such cases the law goes on a new principle, different from\r\nthat governing most substantive crimes. The reason for punishing\r\nany act must generally be to prevent some harm which is foreseen\r\nas likely to follow that act under the circumstances in which it\r\nis done. In most substantive crimes the ground on which that\r\nlikelihood stands is the common working of natural causes as\r\nshown by experience. But when an act is punished the natural\r\neffect of which is not harmful under the circumstances, that\r\nground alone will not suffice. The probability does not exist\r\nunless there are grounds for expecting that the act done will be\r\nfollowed by other acts in connection with which its effect will\r\nbe harmful, although not so otherwise. But as in fact no such\r\nacts have followed, it cannot, in general, be assumed, from the\r\nmere doing of what has been done, that they would have followed\r\nif the actor had not been interrupted. They would not have\r\nfollowed it unless the actor had chosen, and the only way\r\ngenerally available to show that he would have chosen to do them\r\nis by showing that he intended to do them when he did what he\r\ndid. The accompanying intent in that case renders the otherwise\r\n[68] innocent act harmful, because it raises a probability that\r\nit will be followed by such other acts and events as will all\r\ntogether result in harm. The importance of the intent is not to\r\nshow that the act was wicked, but to show that it was likely to\r\nbe followed by hurtful consequences.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen that there are limits to this kind of\r\nliability. The law does not punish every act which is done with\r\nthe intent to bring about a crime. If a man starts from Boston to\r\nCambridge for the purpose of committing a murder when he gets\r\nthere, but is stopped by the draw and goes home, he is no more\r\npunishable than if he had sat in his chair and resolved to shoot\r\nsomebody, but on second thoughts had given up the notion. On the\r\nother hand, a slave who ran after a white woman, but desisted\r\nbefore he caught her, has been convicted of an attempt to commit\r\nrape. /1/ We have seen what amounts to an attempt to burn a\r\nhaystack; but it was said in the same case, that, if the\r\ndefendant had gone no further than to buy a box of matches for\r\nthe purpose, he would not have been liable.\r\n\r\nEminent judges have been puzzled where to draw the line, or even\r\nto state the principle on which it should be drawn, between the\r\ntwo sets of cases. But the principle is believed to be similar to\r\nthat on which all other lines are drawn by the law. Public\r\npolicy, that is to say, legislative considerations, are at the\r\nbottom of the matter; the considerations being, in this case, the\r\nnearness of the danger, the greatness of the harm, and the degree\r\nof apprehension felt. When a man buys matches to fire a haystack,\r\nor starts on a journey meaning to murder at the end of it, there\r\nis still a considerable chance that he will [69] change his mind\r\nbefore he comes to the point. But when he has struck the match,\r\nor cocked and aimed the pistol, there is very little chance that\r\nhe will not persist to the end, and the danger becomes so great\r\nthat the law steps in. With an object which could not be used\r\ninnocently, the point of intervention might be put further back,\r\nas in the case of the purchase of a die for coining.\r\n\r\nThe degree of apprehension may affect the decision, as well as\r\nthe degree of probability that the crime will be accomplished. No\r\ndoubt the fears peculiar to a slaveowning community had their\r\nshare in the conviction which has just been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere is one doubtful point which should not be passed over. It\r\nhas been thought that to shoot at a block of wood thinking it to\r\nbe a man is not an attempt to murder, /1/ and that to put a hand\r\ninto an empty pocket, intending to pick it, is not an attempt to\r\ncommit larceny, although on the latter question there is a\r\ndifference of opinion. /2/ The reason given is, that an act which\r\ncould not have effected the crime if the actor had been allowed\r\nto follow it up to all results to which in the nature of things\r\nit could have led, cannot be an attempt to commit that crime when\r\ninterrupted. At some point or other, of course, the law must\r\nadopt this conclusion, unless it goes on the theory of\r\nretribution for guilt, and not of prevention of harm.\r\n\r\nBut even to prevent harm effectually it will not do to be too\r\nexact. I do not suppose that firing a pistol at a man with intent\r\nto kill him is any the less an attempt to murder because the\r\nbullet misses its aim. Yet there the act has produced the whole\r\neffect possible to it in the [70] course of nature. It is just as\r\nimpossible that that bullet under those circumstances should hit\r\nthat man, as to pick an empty pocket. But there is no difficulty\r\nin saying that such an act under such circumstances is so\r\ndangerous, so far as the possibility of human foresight is\r\nconcerned, that it should be punished. No one can absolutely\r\nknow, though many would be pretty sure, exactly where the bullet\r\nwill strike; and if the harm is done, it is a very great harm. If\r\na man fires at a block, no harm can possibly ensue, and no theft\r\ncan be committed in an empty pocket, besides that the harm of\r\nsuccessful theft is less than that of murder. Yet it might be\r\nsaid that even such things as these should be punished, in order\r\nto make discouragement broad enough and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nThere remain to be considered certain substantive crimes, which\r\ndiffer in very important ways from murder and the like, and for\r\nthe explanation of which the foregoing analysis of intent in\r\ncriminal attempts and analogous misdemeanors will be found of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe type of these is larceny. Under this name acts are punished\r\nwhich of themselves would not be sufficient to accomplish the\r\nevil which the law seeks to prevent, and which are treated as\r\nequally criminal, whether the evil has been accomplished or not.\r\nMurder, manslaughter, and arson, on the other hand, are not\r\ncommitted unless the evil is accomplished, and they all consist\r\nof acts the tendency of which under the surrounding circumstances\r\nis to hurt or destroy person or property by the mere working of\r\nnatural laws.\r\n\r\nIn larceny the consequences immediately flowing from the act are\r\ngenerally exhausted with little or no harm to the owner. Goods\r\nare removed from his possession by [71] trespass, and that is\r\nall, when the crime is complete. But they must be permanently\r\nkept from him before the harm is done which the law seeks to\r\nprevent. A momentary loss of possession is not what has been\r\nguarded against with such severe penalties. What the law means to\r\nprevent is the loss of it wholly and forever, as is shown by the\r\nfact that it is not larceny to take for a temporary use without\r\nintending to deprive the owner of his property. If then the law\r\npunishes the mere act of taking, it punishes an act which will\r\nnot of itself produce the evil effect sought to be prevented, and\r\npunishes it before that effect has in any way come to pass.\r\n\r\nThe reason is plain enough. The law cannot wait until the\r\nproperty has been used up or destroyed in other hands than the\r\nowner's, or until the owner has died, in order to make sure that\r\nthe harm which it seeks to prevent has been done. And for the\r\nsame reason it cannot confine itself to acts likely to do that\r\nharm. For the harm of permanent loss of property will not follow\r\nfrom the act of taking, but only from the series of acts which\r\nconstitute removing and keeping the property after it has been\r\ntaken. After these preliminaries, the bearing of intent upon the\r\ncrime is easily seen.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Bishop, larceny is \"the taking and removing, by\r\ntrespass, of personal property which the trespasser knows to\r\nbelong either generally or specially to another, with the intent\r\nto deprive such owner of his ownership therein; and perhaps it\r\nshould be added, for the sake of some advantage to the\r\ntrespasser, a proposition on which the decisions are not\r\nharmonious.\" /1/\r\n\r\nThere must be an intent to deprive such owner of his [72]\r\nownership therein, it is said. But why? Is it because the law is\r\nmore anxious not to put a man in prison for stealing unless he is\r\nactually wicked, than it is not to hang him for killing another?\r\nThat can hardly be. The true answer is, that the intent is an\r\nindex to the external event which probably would have happened,\r\nand that, if the law is to punish at all, it must, in this case,\r\ngo on probabilities, not on accomplished facts. The analogy to\r\nthe manner of dealing with attempts is plain. Theft may be called\r\nan attempt to permanently deprive a man of his property, which is\r\npunished with the same severity whether successful or not. If\r\ntheft can rightly be considered in this way, intent must play the\r\nsame part as in other attempts. An act which does not fully\r\naccomplish the prohibited result may be made wrongful by evidence\r\nthat but for some interference it would have been followed by\r\nother acts co-ordinated with it to produce that result. This can\r\nonly be shown by showing intent. In theft the intent to deprive\r\nthe owner of his property establishes that the thief would have\r\nretained, or would not have taken steps to restore, the stolen\r\ngoods. Nor would it matter that the thief afterwards changed his\r\nmind and returned the goods. From the point of view of attempt,\r\nthe crime was already complete when the property was carried off.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to this view, that, if intent is only a\r\nmakeshift which from a practical necessity takes the place of\r\nactual deprivation, it ought not to be required where the actual\r\ndeprivation is wholly accomplished, provided the same criminal\r\nact produces the whole effect. Suppose, for instance, that by one\r\nand the same motion a man seizes and backs another's horse over a\r\nprecipice. The whole evil which the law seeks to prevent is the\r\nnatural and manifestly [73] certain consequence of the act under\r\nthe known circumstances. In such a case, if the law of larceny is\r\nconsistent with the theories here maintained, the act should be\r\npassed upon according to its tendency, and the actual intent of\r\nthe wrong-doer not in any way considered. Yet it is possible, to\r\nsay the least, that even in such a case the intent would make all\r\nthe difference. I assume that the act was without excuse and\r\nwrongful, and that it would have amounted to larceny, if done for\r\nthe purpose of depriving the owner of his horse. Nevertheless, if\r\nit was done for the sake of an experiment, and without actual\r\nforesight of the destruction, or evil design against the owner,\r\nthe trespasser might not be held a thief.\r\n\r\nThe inconsistency, if there is one, seems to be explained by the\r\nway in which the law has grown. The distinctions of the common\r\nlaw as to theft are not those of a broad theory of legislation;\r\nthey are highly technical, and very largely dependent upon\r\nhistory for explanation. /1/\r\n\r\nThe type of theft is taking to one's own user It used to be, and\r\nsometimes still is, thought that the taking must be lucri catesa,\r\nfor the sake of some advantage to the thief. In such cases the\r\nowner is deprived of his property by the thief's keeping it, not\r\nby its destruction, and the permanence of his loss can only be\r\njudged of beforehand by the intent to keep. The intent is\r\ntherefore always necessary, and it is naturally stated in the\r\nform of a self-regarding intent. It was an advance on the old\r\nprecedents when it was decided that the intent to deprive the\r\nowner of his property was sufficient. As late as 1815 the English\r\njudges stood only six to five in favor of the proposition [74]\r\nthat it was larceny to take a horse intending to kill it for no\r\nother purpose than to destroy evidence against a friend. /1/ Even\r\nthat case, however, did not do away with the universality of\r\nintent as a test, for the destruction followed the taking, and it\r\nis an ancient rule that the criminality of the act must be\r\ndetermined by the state of things at the time of the taking, and\r\nnot afterwards. Whether the law of larceny would follow what\r\nseems to be the general principle of criminal law, or would be\r\nheld back by tradition, could only be decided by a case like that\r\nsupposed above, where the same act accomplishes both taking and\r\ndestruction. As has been suggested already, tradition might very\r\npossibly prevail.\r\n\r\nAnother crime in which the peculiarities noticed in larceny are\r\nstill more clearly marked, and at the same time more easily\r\nexplained, is burglary. It is defined as breaking and entering\r\nany dwelling-house by night with intent to commit a felony\r\ntherein. /2/ The object of punishing such a breaking and entering\r\nis not to prevent trespasses, even when committed by night, but\r\nonly such trespasses as are the first step to wrongs of a greater\r\nmagnitude, like robbery or murder. /3/ In this case the function\r\nof intent when proved appears more clearly than in theft, but it\r\nis precisely similar. It is an index to the probability of\r\ncertain future acts which the law seeks to prevent. And here the\r\nlaw gives evidence that this is the true explanation. For if the\r\napprehended act did follow, then it is no longer necessary to\r\nallege that the breaking and entering was with that intent. An\r\nindictment for burglary which charges that [75] the defendant\r\nbroke into a dwelling-house and stole certain property, is just\r\nas good as one which alleges that he broke in with intent to\r\nsteal. /1/\r\n\r\nIt is believed that enough has now been said to explain the\r\ngeneral theory of criminal liability, as it stands at common law.\r\nThe result may be summed up as follows. All acts are indifferent\r\nper se.\r\n\r\nIn the characteristic type of substantive crime acts are rendered\r\ncriminal because they are done finder circumstances in which they\r\nwill probably cause some harm which the law seeks to prevent.\r\n\r\nThe test of criminality in such cases is the degree of danger\r\nshown by experience to attend that act under those circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the mens rea, or actual wickedness of the party, is\r\nwholly unnecessary, and all reference to the state of his\r\nconsciousness is misleading if it means anything more than that\r\nthe circumstances in connection with which the tendency of his\r\nact is judged are the circumstances known to him. Even the\r\nrequirement of knowledge is subject to certain limitations. A man\r\nmust find out at his peril things which a reasonable and prudent\r\nman would have inferred from the things actually known. In some\r\ncases, especially of statutory crimes, he must go even further,\r\nand, when he knows certain facts, must find out at his peril\r\nwhether the other facts are present which would make the act\r\ncriminal. A man who abducts a girl from her parents in England\r\nmust find out at his peril whether she is under sixteen.\r\n\r\n[76] In some cases it may be that the consequence of the act,\r\nunder the circumstances, must be actually foreseen, if it is a\r\nconsequence which a prudent man would not have foreseen. The\r\nreference to the prudent man, as a standard, is the only form in\r\nwhich blameworthiness as such is an element of crime, and what\r\nwould be blameworthy in such a man is an element;--first, as a\r\nsurvival of true moral standards; second, because to punish what\r\nwould not be blameworthy in an average member of the community\r\nwould be to enforce a standard which was indefensible\r\ntheoretically, and which practically was too high for that\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, actual malice or intent, in the common meaning of\r\nthose words, is an element in crime. But it will be found that,\r\nwhen it is so, it is because the act when done maliciously is\r\nfollowed by harm which would not have followed the act alone, or\r\nbecause the intent raises a strong probability that an act,\r\ninnocent in itself, will be followed by other acts or events in\r\nconnection with which it will accomplish the result sought to be\r\nprevented by the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE III. -- TORTS.--TRESPASS AND NEGLIGENCE.\r\n\r\nThe object of the next two Lectures is to discover whether there\r\nis any common ground at the bottom of all liability in tort, and\r\nif so, what that ground is. Supposing the attempt to succeed, it\r\nwill reveal the general principle of civil liability at common\r\nlaw. The liabilities incurred by way of contract are more or less\r\nexpressly fixed by the agreement of the parties concerned, but\r\nthose arising from a tort are independent of any previous consent\r\nof the wrong-doer to bear the loss occasioned by his act. If A\r\nfails to pay a certain sum on a certain day, or to deliver a\r\nlecture on a certain night, after having made a binding promise\r\nto do so, the damages which he has to pay are recovered in\r\naccordance with his consent that some or all of the harms which\r\nmay be caused by his failure shall fall upon him. But when A\r\nassaults or slanders his neighbor, or converts his neighbor's\r\nproperty, he does a harm which he has never consented to bear,\r\nand if the law makes him pay for it, the reason for doing so must\r\nbe found in some general view of the conduct which every one may\r\nfairly expect and demand from every other, whether that other has\r\nagreed to it or not.\r\n\r\nSuch a general view is very hard to find. The law did not begin\r\nwith a theory. It has never worked one out. The point from which\r\nit started and that at which I shall [78] try to show that it has\r\narrived, are on different planes. In the progress from one to the\r\nother, it is to be expected that its course should not be\r\nstraight and its direction not always visible. All that can be\r\ndone is to point out a tendency, and to justify it. The tendency,\r\nwhich is our main concern, is a matter of fact to be gathered\r\nfrom the cases. But the difficulty of showing it is much enhanced\r\nby the circumstance that, until lately, the substantive law has\r\nbeen approached only through the categories of the forms of\r\naction. Discussions of legislative principle have been darkened\r\nby arguments on the limits between trespass and case, or on the\r\nscope of a general issue. In place of a theory of tort, we have a\r\ntheory of trespass. And even within that narrower limit,\r\nprecedents of the time of the assize and jurata have been applied\r\nwithout a thought of their connection with a long forgotten\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nSince the ancient forms of action have disappeared, a broader\r\ntreatment of the subject ought to be possible. Ignorance is the\r\nbest of law reformers. People are glad to discuss a question on\r\ngeneral principles, when they have forgotten the special\r\nknowledge necessary for technical reasoning. But the present\r\nwillingness to generalize is founded on more than merely negative\r\ngrounds. The philosophical habit of the day, the frequency of\r\nlegislation, and the ease with which the law may be changed to\r\nmeet the opinions and wishes of the public, all make it natural\r\nand unavoidable that judges as well as others should openly\r\ndiscuss the legislative principles upon which their decisions\r\nmust always rest in the end, and should base their judgments upon\r\nbroad considerations of policy to which the traditions of the\r\nbench would hardly have tolerated a reference fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n[79] The business of the law of torts is to fix the dividing\r\nlines between those cases in which a man is liable for harm which\r\nhe has done, and those in which he is not. But it cannot enable\r\nhim to predict with certainty whether a given act under given\r\ncircumstances will make him liable, because an act will rarely\r\nhave that effect unless followed by damage, and for the most\r\npart, if not always, the consequences of an act are not known,\r\nbut only guessed at as more or less probable. All the rules that\r\nthe law can lay down beforehand are rules for determining the\r\nconduct which will be followed by liability if it is followed by\r\nharm--that is, the conduct which a man pursues at his peril. The\r\nonly guide for the future to be drawn from a decision against a\r\ndefendant in an action of tort is that similar acts, under\r\ncircumstances which cannot be distinguished except by the result\r\nfrom those of the defendant, are done at the peril of the actor;\r\nthat if he escapes liability, it is simply because by good\r\nfortune no harm comes of his conduct in the particular event.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, there is any common ground for all liability in\r\ntort, we shall best find it by eliminating the event as it\r\nactually turns out, and by considering only the principles on\r\nwhich the peril of his conduct is thrown upon the actor. We are\r\nto ask what are the elements, on the defendant's side, which must\r\nall be present before liability is possible, and the presence of\r\nwhich will commonly make him liable if damage follows.\r\n\r\nThe law of torts abounds in moral phraseology. It has much to say\r\nof wrongs, of malice, fraud, intent, and negligence. Hence it may\r\nnaturally be supposed that the risk of a man's conduct is thrown\r\nupon him as the result of some moral short-coming. But while this\r\nnotion has been [80] entertained, the extreme opposite will be\r\nfound to have been a far more popular opinion;--I mean the notion\r\nthat a man is answerable for all the consequences of his acts,\r\nor, in other words, that he acts at his peril always, and wholly\r\nirrespective of the state of his consciousness upon the matter.\r\n\r\nTo test the former opinion it would be natural to take up\r\nsuccessively the several words, such as negligence and intent,\r\nwhich in the language of morals designate various well-understood\r\nstates of mind, and to show their significance in the law. To\r\ntest the latter, it would perhaps be more convenient to consider\r\nit under the head of the several forms of action. So many of our\r\nauthorities are decisions under one or another of these forms,\r\nthat it will not be safe to neglect them, at least in the first\r\ninstance; and a compromise between the two modes of approaching\r\nthe subject may be reached by beginning with the action of\r\ntrespass and the notion of negligence together, leaving wrongs\r\nwhich are defined as intentional for the next Lecture.\r\n\r\nTrespass lies for unintentional, as well as for intended wrongs.\r\nAny wrongful and direct application of force is redressed by that\r\naction. It therefore affords a fair field for a discussion of the\r\ngeneral principles of liability for unintentional wrongs at\r\ncommon law. For it can hardly be supposed that a man's\r\nresponsibility for the consequences of his acts varies as the\r\nremedy happens to fall on one side or the other of the penumbra\r\nwhich separates trespass from the action on the case. And the\r\ngreater part of the law of torts will be found under one or the\r\nother of those two heads.\r\n\r\nIt might be hastily assumed that the action on the case [81] is\r\nfounded on the defendant's negligence. But if that be so, the\r\nsame doctrine must prevail in trespass. It might be assumed that\r\ntrespass is founded on the defendant's having caused damage by\r\nhis act, without regard to negligence. But if that be true, the\r\nlaw must apply the same criterion to other wrongs differing from\r\ntrespass only in some technical point; as, for instance, that the\r\nproperty damaged was in the defendant's possession. Neither of\r\nthe above assumptions, however, can be hastily permitted. It\r\nmight very well be argued that the action on the case adopts the\r\nsevere rule just suggested for trespass, except when the action\r\nis founded on a contract. Negligence, it might be said, had\r\nnothing to do with the common-law liability for a nuisance, and\r\nit might be added that, where negligence was a ground of\r\nliability, a special duty had to be founded in the defendant's\r\nsuper se assumpsit, or public calling. /1/ On the other hand, we\r\nshall see what can be said for the proposition, that even in\r\ntrespass there must at least be negligence. But whichever\r\nargument prevails for the one form of action must prevail for the\r\nother. The discussion may therefore be shortened on its technical\r\nside, by confining it to trespass so far as may be practicable\r\nwithout excluding light to be got from other parts of the law.\r\n\r\nAs has just been hinted, there are two theories of the common-law\r\nliability for unintentional harm. Both of them seem to receive\r\nthe implied assent of popular textbooks, and neither of them is\r\nwanting in plausibility and the semblance of authority.\r\n\r\nThe first is that of Austin, which is essentially the theory of a\r\ncriminalist. According to him, the characteristic [82] feature of\r\nlaw, properly so called, is a sanction or detriment threatened\r\nand imposed by the sovereign for disobedience to the sovereign's\r\ncommands. As the greater part of the law only makes a man civilly\r\nanswerable for breaking it, Austin is compelled to regard the\r\nliability to an action as a sanction, or, in other words, as a\r\npenalty for disobedience. It follows from this, according to the\r\nprevailing views of penal law, that such liability ought only to\r\nbe based upon personal fault; and Austin accepts that conclusion,\r\nwith its corollaries, one of which is that negligence means a\r\nstate of the party's mind. /1/ These doctrines will be referred\r\nto later, so far as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe other theory is directly opposed to the foregoing. It seems\r\nto be adopted by some of the greatest common law authorities, and\r\nrequires serious discussion before it can be set aside in favor\r\nof any third opinion which may be maintained. According to this\r\nview, broadly stated, under the common law a man acts at his\r\nperil. It may be held as a sort of set-off, that he is never\r\nliable for omissions except in consequence of some duty\r\nvoluntarily undertaken. But the whole and sufficient ground for\r\nsuch liabilities as he does incur outside the last class is\r\nsupposed to be that he has voluntarily acted, and that damage has\r\nensued. If the act was voluntary, it is totally immaterial that\r\nthe detriment which followed from it was neither intended nor due\r\nto the negligence of the actor.\r\n\r\nIn order to do justice to this way of looking at the subject, we\r\nmust remember that the abolition of the common-law forms of\r\npleading has not changed the rules of substantive law. Hence,\r\nalthough pleaders now generally [83] allege intent or negligence,\r\nanything which would formerly have been sufficient to charge a\r\ndefendant in trespass is still sufficient, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the ancient form of action and declaration has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is said, consider generally the protection\r\ngiven by the law to property, both within and outside the limits\r\nof the last-named action. If a man crosses his neighbor's\r\nboundary by however innocent a mistake, or if his cattle escape\r\ninto his neighbor's field, he is said to be liable in trespass\r\nquare clausum fregit. If an auctioneer in the most perfect good\r\nfaith, and in the regular course of his business, sells goods\r\nsent to his rooms for the purpose of being sold, he may be\r\ncompelled to pay their full value if a third person turns out to\r\nbe the owner, although he has paid over the proceeds, and has no\r\nmeans of obtaining indemnity.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that, instead of a dealing with the plaintiff's\r\nproperty, the case is that force has proceeded directly from the\r\ndefendant's body to the plaintiff's body, it is urged that, as\r\nthe law cannot be less careful of the persons than of the\r\nproperty of its subjects, the only defences possible are similar\r\nto those which would have been open to an alleged trespass on\r\nland. You may show that there was no trespass by showing that the\r\ndefendant did no act; as where he was thrown from his horse upon\r\nthe plaintiff, or where a third person took his hand and struck\r\nthe plaintiff with it. In such cases the defendant's body is file\r\npassive instrument of an external force, and the bodily motion\r\nrelied on by the plaintiff is not his act at all. So you may show\r\na justification or excuse in the conduct of the plaintiff\r\nhimself. But if no such excuse is shown, and the defendant has\r\nvoluntarily acted, he must answer [84] for the consequences,\r\nhowever little intended and however unforeseen. If, for instance,\r\nbeing assaulted by a third person, the defendant lifted his stick\r\nand accidentally hit the plaintiff, who was standing behind him,\r\naccording to this view he is liable, irrespective of any\r\nnegligence toward the party injured.\r\n\r\nThe arguments for the doctrine under consideration are, for the\r\nmost part, drawn from precedent, but it is sometimes supposed to\r\nbe defensible as theoretically sound. Every man, it is said, has\r\nan absolute right to his person, and so forth, free from\r\ndetriment at the hands of his neighbors. In the cases put, the\r\nplaintiff has done nothing; the defendant, on the other hand, has\r\nchosen to act. As between the two, the party whose voluntary\r\nconduct has caused the damage should suffer, rather than one who\r\nhas had no share in producing it.\r\n\r\nWe have more difficult matter to deal with when we turn to the\r\npleadings and precedents in trespass. The declaration says\r\nnothing of negligence, and it is clear that the damage need not\r\nhave been intended. The words vi et armis and contra pacere,\r\nwhich might seem to imply intent, are supposed to have been\r\ninserted merely to give jurisdiction to the king's court.\r\nGlanvill says it belongs to the sheriff, in case of neglect on\r\nthe part of lords of franchise, to take cognizance of melees,\r\nblows, and even wounds, unless the accuser add a charge of breach\r\nof the king's peace (nisi accusator adjiciat de pace Domini Regis\r\ninfracta). /1/ Reeves observes, \"In this distinction between the\r\nsheriff's jurisdiction and that of the king, we see the reason of\r\nthe allegation in modern indictments and writs, vi et amis, of\r\n'the king's crown and dignity,' 'the king's [85] peace,' and 'the\r\npeace,'--this last expression being sufficient, after the peace\r\nof the sheriff had ceased to be distinguished as a separate\r\njurisdiction.\" /1/\r\n\r\nAgain, it might be said that, if the defendant's intent or\r\nneglect was essential to his liability, the absence of both would\r\ndeprive his act of the character of a trespass, and ought\r\ntherefore to be admissible under the general issue. But it is\r\nperfectly well settled at common law that \"Not guilty\" only\r\ndenies the act. /2/\r\n\r\nNext comes the argument from authority. I will begin with an\r\nearly and important case. /3/ It was trespass quare clausum. The\r\ndefendant pleaded that he owned adjoining land, upon which was a\r\nthorn hedge; that he cut the thorns, and that they, against his\r\nwill (ipso invito), fell on the plaintiff's land, and the\r\ndefendant went quickly upon the same, and took them, which was\r\nthe trespass complained of. And on demurrer judgment was given\r\nfor the plaintiff. The plaintiff's counsel put cases which have\r\nbeen often repeated. One of them, Fairfax, said: \"There is a\r\ndiversity between an act resulting in a felony, and one resulting\r\nin a trespass.... If one is cutting trees, and the boughs fall\r\non a man and wound him, in this case he shall have an action of\r\ntrespass, &c., and also, sir, if one is shooting at butts, and\r\nhis bow shakes in his hands, and kills a man, ipso invito, it is\r\nno felony, as has been said, [86] &c.; but if he wounds one by\r\nshooting, he shall have a good action of trespass against him,\r\nand yet the shooting was lawful, &c., and the wrong which the\r\nother receives was against his will, &c.; and so here, &c.\"\r\nBrian, another counsel, states the whole doctrine, and uses\r\nequally familiar illustrations. \"When one does a thing, he is\r\nbound to do it in such a way that by his act no prejudice or\r\ndamage shall be done to &c. As if I am building a house, and when\r\nthe timber is being put up a piece of timber falls on my\r\nneighbor's house and breaks his house, he shall have a good\r\naction, &c.; and yet the raising of the house was lawful, and the\r\ntimber fell, me invito, &c. And so if one assaults me and I\r\ncannot escape, and I in self-defence lift my stick to strike him,\r\nand in lifting it hit a man who is behind me, in this case he\r\nshall have an action against me, yet my raising my stick was\r\nlawful in self-defence, and I hit him, me invito, &c.; and so\r\nhere, &C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Littleton, J. to the same intent, and if a man is damaged he\r\nought to be recompensed.... If your cattle come on my land and\r\neat my grass, notwithstanding you come freshly and drive them\r\nout, you ought to make amends for what your cattle have done, be\r\nit more or less.... And, sir, if this should be law that he\r\nmight enter and take the thorns, for the same reason, if he cut a\r\nlarge tree, he might come with his wagons and horses to carry the\r\ntrees off, which is not reason, for perhaps he has corn or other\r\ncrops growing, &c., and no more here, for the law is all one in\r\ngreat things and small.... Choke, C. J. to the same intent, for\r\nwhen the principal thing was not lawful, that which depends upon\r\nit was not lawful; for when he cut the thorns and they fell on my\r\nland, [87] this falling was not lawful, and therefore his coming\r\nto take them out was not lawful. As to what was said about their\r\nfalling in ipso invito, that is no plea, but he ought to show\r\nthat he could not do it in any other way, or that he did all that\r\nwas in his power to keep them out.\"\r\n\r\nForty years later, /1/ the Year Books report Rede, J. as adopting\r\nthe argument of Fairfax in the last case. In trespass, he says,\r\n\"the intent cannot be construed; but in felony it shall be. As\r\nwhen a man shoots at butts and kills a man, it is not felony et\r\nil ser come n'avoit l'entent de luy tuer; and so of a tiler on a\r\nhouse who with a stone kills a man unwittingly, it is not felony.\r\n/2/ But when a man shoots at the butts and wounds a man, though\r\nit is against his will, he shall be called a trespasser against\r\nhis intent.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a series of later shooting cases, Weaver v. Ward, /3/\r\nDickenson v. Watson, /4/ and Underwood v. Hewson, /5/ followed by\r\nthe Court of Appeals of New York in Castle v. Duryee, /6/ in\r\nwhich defences to the effect that the damage was done\r\naccidentally and by misfortune, and against the will of the\r\ndefendant, were held insufficient.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was held that where a man with\r\na gun at the door of his house shot at a fowl, and thereby set\r\nfire to his own house and to the house of his neighbor, he was\r\nliable in an action on the case generally, the declaration not\r\nbeing on the custom of the realm, [88] \"viz. for negligently\r\nkeeping his fire.\" \"For the injury is the same, although this\r\nmischance was not by a common negligence, but by misadventure.\"\r\n/1/\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned instances of the stick and shooting at butts\r\nbecame standard illustrations; they are repeated by Sir Thomas\r\nRaymond, in Bessey v. Olliot, /2/ by Sir William Blackstone, in\r\nthe famous squib case, /3/ and by other judges, and have become\r\nfamiliar through the textbooks. Sir T. Raymond, in the above\r\ncase, also repeats the thought and almost the words of Littleton,\r\nJ., which have been quoted, and says further: \"In all civil acts\r\nthe law doth not so much regard the intent of the actor, as the\r\nloss and damage of the party suffering.\" Sir William Blackstone\r\nalso adopts a phrase from Dickenson v. Watson, just cited:\r\n\"Nothing but inevitable necessity\" is a justification. So Lord\r\nEllenborough, in Leame v. Bray: /4/ \"If the injury were received\r\nfrom the personal act of another, it was deemed sufficient to\r\nmake it trespass\"; or, according to the more frequently quoted\r\nlanguage of Grose, J., in the same case: \"Looking into all the\r\ncases from the Year Book in the 21 H. VII. down to the latest\r\ndecision on the subject, I find the principle to be, that if the\r\ninjury be done by the act of the party himself at the time, or he\r\nbe the immediate cause of it, though it happen accidentally or by\r\nmisfortune, yet he is answerable in trespass.\" Further citations\r\nare deemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of all the arguments which may be [89] urged\r\nfor the rule that a man acts at his peril, it has been rejected\r\nby very eminent courts, even under the old forms of action. In\r\nview of this fact, and of the further circumstance that, since\r\nthe old forms have been abolished, the allegation of negligence\r\nhas spread from the action on the case to all ordinary\r\ndeclarations in tort which do not allege intent, probably many\r\nlawyers would be surprised that any one should think it worth\r\nwhile to go into the present discussion. Such is the natural\r\nimpression to be derived from daily practice. But even if the\r\ndoctrine under consideration had no longer any followers, which\r\nis not the case, it would be well to have something more than\r\ndaily practice to sustain our views upon so fundamental a\r\nquestion; as it seems to me at least, the true principle is far\r\nfrom being articulately grasped by all who are interested in it,\r\nand can only be arrived at after a careful analysis of what has\r\nbeen thought hitherto. It might be thought enough to cite the\r\ndecisions opposed to the rule of absolute responsibility, and to\r\nshow that such a rule is inconsistent with admitted doctrines and\r\nsound policy. But we may go further with profit, and inquire\r\nwhether there are not strong grounds for thinking that the common\r\nlaw has never known such a rule, unless in that period of dry\r\nprecedent which is so often to be found midway between a creative\r\nepoch and a period of solvent philosophical reaction.\r\nConciliating the attention of those who, contrary to most modern\r\npractitioners, still adhere to the strict doctrine, by reminding\r\nthem once more that there are weighty decisions to be cited\r\nadverse to it, and that, if they have involved an innovation, the\r\nfact that it has been made by such magistrates as Chief Justice\r\nShaw goes far to prove that the change was politic, I [90] think\r\nI may assert that a little reflection will show that it was\r\nrequired not only by policy, but by consistency. I will begin\r\nwith the latter.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning which would make a man answerable in trespass\r\nfor all damage to another by force directly resulting from his\r\nown act, irrespective of negligence or intent, would make him\r\nanswerable in case for the like damage similarly resulting from\r\nthe act of his servant, in the course of the latter's employment.\r\nThe discussions of the company's negligence in many railway cases\r\nwould therefore be wholly out of place, for although, to be sure,\r\nthere is a contract which would make the company liable for\r\nnegligence, that contract cannot be taken to diminish any\r\nliability which would otherwise exist for a trespass on the part\r\nof its employees.\r\n\r\nMore than this, the same reasoning would make a defendant\r\nresponsible for all damage, however remote, of which his act\r\ncould be called the cause. So long, at least, as only physical or\r\nirresponsible agencies, however unforeseen, co-operated with the\r\nact complained of to produce the result, the argument which would\r\nresolve the case of accidentally striking the plaintiff, when\r\nlifting a stick in necessary self-defence, adversely to the\r\ndefendant, would require a decision against him in every case\r\nwhere his act was a factor in the result complained of. The\r\ndistinction between a direct application of force, and causing\r\ndamage indirectly, or as a more remote consequence of one's act,\r\nalthough it may determine whether the form of action should be\r\ntrespass or case, does not touch the theory of responsibility, if\r\nthat theory be that a man acts at his peril.\r\n\r\n[91] As was said at the outset, if the strict liability is to be\r\nmaintained at all, it must be maintained throughout. A principle\r\ncannot be stated which would retain the strict liability in\r\ntrespass while abandoning it in case. It cannot be said that\r\ntrespass is for acts alone, and case for consequences of those\r\nacts. All actions of trespass are for consequences of acts, not\r\nfor the acts themselves. And some actions of trespass are for\r\nconsequences more remote from the defendant's act than in other\r\ninstances where the remedy would be case.\r\n\r\nAn act is always a voluntary muscular contraction, and nothing\r\nelse. The chain of physical sequences which it sets in motion or\r\ndirects to the plaintiff's harm is no part of it, and very\r\ngenerally a long train of such sequences intervenes. An example\r\nor two will make this extremely clear.\r\n\r\nWhen a man commits an assault and battery with a pistol, his only\r\nact is to contract the muscles of his arm and forefinger in a\r\ncertain way, but it is the delight of elementary writers to point\r\nout what a vast series of physical changes must take place before\r\nthe harm is done. Suppose that, instead of firing a pistol, he\r\ntakes up a hose which is discharging water on the sidewalk, and\r\ndirects it at the plaintiff, he does not even set in motion the\r\nphysical causes which must co-operate with his act to make a\r\nbattery. Not only natural causes, but a living being, may\r\nintervene between the act and its effect. Gibbons v. Pepper, /1/\r\nwhich decided that there was no battery when a man's horse was\r\nfrightened by accident or a third person and ran away with him,\r\nand ran over the plaintiff, takes the distinction that, if the\r\nrider by spurring is the cause of [92] the accident, then he is\r\nguilty. In Scott v. Shepherd, /1/ already mentioned, trespass was\r\nmaintained against one who had thrown a squib into a crowd, where\r\nit was tossed from hand to hand in self-defence until it burst\r\nand injured the plaintiff. Here even human agencies were a part\r\nof the chain between the defendant's act and the result, although\r\nthey were treated as more or less nearly automatic, in order to\r\narrive at the decision.\r\n\r\nNow I repeat, that, if principle requires us to charge a man in\r\ntrespass when his act has brought force to bear on another\r\nthrough a comparatively short train of intervening causes, in\r\nspite of his having used all possible care, it requires the same\r\nliability, however numerous and unexpected the events between the\r\nact and the result. If running a man down is a trespass when the\r\naccident can be referred to the rider's act of spurring, why is\r\nit not a tort in every case, as was argued in Vincent v.\r\nStinehour, /2/ seeing that it can always be referred more\r\nremotely to his act of mounting and taking the horse out?\r\n\r\nWhy is a man not responsible for the consequences of an act\r\ninnocent in its direct and obvious effects, when those\r\nconsequences would not have followed but for the intervention of\r\na series of extraordinary, although natural, events? The reason\r\nis, that, if the intervening events are of such a kind that no\r\nforesight could have been expected to look out for them, the\r\ndefendant is not to blame for having failed to do so. It seems to\r\nbe admitted by the English judges that, even on the question\r\nwhether the acts of leaving dry trimmings in hot weather by the\r\nside of a railroad, and then sending an engine over the track,\r\nare [93] negligent,--that is, are a ground of liability,--the\r\nconsequences which might reasonably be anticipated are material.\r\n/1/ Yet these are acts which, under the circumstances, can hardly\r\nbe called innocent in their natural and obvious effects. The same\r\ndoctrine has been applied to acts in violation of statute which\r\ncould not reasonably have been expected to lead to the result\r\ncomplained of. /2/\r\n\r\nBut there is no difference in principle between the case where a\r\nnatural cause or physical factor intervenes after the act in some\r\nway not to be foreseen, and turns what seemed innocent to harm,\r\nand the case where such a cause or factor intervenes, unknown, at\r\nthe time; as, for the matter of that, it did in the English cases\r\ncited. If a man is excused in the one case because he is not to\r\nblame, he must be in the other. The difference taken in Gibbons\r\nv. Pepper, cited above, is not between results which are and\r\nthose which are not the consequences of the defendant's acts: it\r\nis between consequences which he was bound as a reasonable man to\r\ncontemplate, and those which he was not. Hard spurring is just so\r\nmuch more likely to lead to harm than merely riding a horse in\r\nthe street, that the court thought that the defendant would be\r\nbound to look out for the consequences of the one, while it would\r\nnot hold him liable for those resulting merely from the other;\r\n[94] because the possibility of being run away with when riding\r\nquietly, though familiar, is comparatively slight. If, however,\r\nthe horse had been unruly, and had been taken into a frequented\r\nplace for the purpose of being broken, the owner might have been\r\nliable, because \"it was his fault to bring a wild horse into a\r\nplace where mischief might probably be done.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the example of the accidental blow with a stick\r\nlifted in self-defence, there is no difference between hitting a\r\nperson standing in one's rear and hitting one who was pushed by a\r\nhorse within range of the stick just as it was lifted, provided\r\nthat it was not possible, under the circumstances, in the one\r\ncase to have known, in the other to have anticipated, the\r\nproximity. In either case there is wanting the only element which\r\ndistinguishes voluntary acts from spasmodic muscular contractions\r\nas a ground of liability. In neither of them, that is to say, has\r\nthere been an opportunity of choice with reference to the\r\nconsequence complained of,--a chance to guard against the result\r\nwhich has come to pass. A choice which entails a concealed\r\nconsequence is as to that consequence no choice.\r\n\r\nThe general principle of our law is that loss from accident must\r\nlie where it falls, and this principle is not affected by the\r\nfact that a human being is the instrument of misfortune. But\r\nrelatively to a given human being anything is accident which he\r\ncould not fairly have been expected to contemplate as possible,\r\nand therefore to avoid. In the language of the late Chief Justice\r\nNelson of New York: \"No case or principle can be found, or if\r\nfound can be maintained, subjecting an individual to liability\r\nfor [95] an act done without fault on his part.... All the cases\r\nconcede that an injury arising from inevitable accident, or,\r\nwhich in law or reason is the same thing, from an act that\r\nordinary human care and foresight are unable to guard against, is\r\nbut the misfortune of the sufferer, and lays no foundation for\r\nlegal responsibility.\" /1/ If this were not so, any act would be\r\nsufficient, however remote, which set in motion or opened the\r\ndoor for a series of physical sequences ending in damage; such as\r\nriding the horse, in the case of the runaway, or even coming to a\r\nplace where one is seized with a fit and strikes the plaintiff in\r\nan unconscious spasm. Nay, why need the defendant have acted at\r\nall, and why is it not enough that his existence has been at the\r\nexpense of the plaintiff? The requirement of an act is the\r\nrequirement that the defendant should have made a choice. But the\r\nonly possible purpose of introducing this moral element is to\r\nmake the power of avoiding the evil complained of a condition of\r\nliability. There is no such power where the evil cannot be\r\nforeseen. /2/ Here we reach the argument from policy, and I shall\r\naccordingly postpone for a moment the discussion of trespasses\r\nupon land, and of conversions, and will take up the liability for\r\ncattle separately at a later stage.\r\n\r\nA man need not, it is true, do this or that act, the term act\r\nimplies a choice,--but he must act somehow. Furthermore, the\r\npublic generally profits by individual activity. As action cannot\r\nbe avoided, and tends to the public good, there is obviously no\r\npolicy in throwing the hazard of what is at once desirable and\r\ninevitable upon the actor. [96] The state might conceivably make\r\nitself a mutual insurance company against accidents, and\r\ndistribute the burden of its citizens' mishaps among all its\r\nmembers. There might be a pension for paralytics, and state aid\r\nfor those who suffered in person or estate from tempest or wild\r\nbeasts. As between individuals it might adopt the mutual\r\ninsurance principle pro tanto, and divide damages when both were\r\nin fault, as in the rusticum judicium of the admiralty, or it\r\nmight throw all loss upon the actor irrespective of fault. The\r\nstate does none of these things, however, and the prevailing view\r\nis that its cumbrous and expensive machinery ought not to be set\r\nin motion unless some clear benefit is to be derived from\r\ndisturbing the status quo. State interference is an evil, where\r\nit cannot be shown to be a good. Universal insurance, if desired,\r\ncan be better and more cheaply accomplished by private\r\nenterprise. The undertaking to redistribute losses simply on the\r\nground that they resulted from the defendant's act would not only\r\nbe open to these objections, but, as it is hoped the preceding\r\ndiscussion has shown, to the still graver one of offending the\r\nsense of justice. Unless my act is of a nature to threaten\r\nothers, unless under the circumstances a prudent man would have\r\nforeseen the possibility of harm, it is no more justifiable to\r\nmake me indemnify my neighbor against the consequences, than to\r\nmake me do the same thing if I had fallen upon him in a fit, or\r\nto compel me to insure him against lightning.\r\n\r\nI must now recur to the conclusions drawn from innocent\r\ntrespasses upon land, and conversions, and the supposed analogy\r\nof those cases to trespasses against the person, lest the law\r\nconcerning the latter should be supposed to lie between two\r\nantinomies, each necessitating with equal cogency an opposite\r\nconclusion to the other.\r\n\r\n[97] Take first the case of trespass upon land attended by actual\r\ndamage. When a man goes upon his neighbor's land, thinking it is\r\nhis own, he intends the very act or consequence complained of. He\r\nmeans to intermeddle with a certain thing in a certain way, and\r\nit is just that intended intermeddling for which he is sued. /1/\r\nWhereas, if he accidentally hits a stranger as he lifts his staff\r\nin self defence, the fact, which is the gist of the\r\naction,--namely, the contact between the staff and his neighbor's\r\nhead,--was not intended, and could not have been foreseen. It\r\nmight be answered, to be sure, that it is not for intermeddling\r\nwith property, but for intermeddling with the plaintiff's\r\nproperty, that a man is sued; and that in the supposed cases,\r\njust as much as in that of the accidental blow, the defendant is\r\nignorant of one of the facts making up the total environment, and\r\nwhich must be present to make his action wrong. He is ignorant,\r\nthat is to say, that the true owner either has or claims any\r\ninterest in the property in question, and therefore he does not\r\nintend a wrongful act, because he does not mean to deal with his\r\nneighbor's property. But the answer to this is, that he does\r\nintend to do the damage complained of. One who diminishes the\r\nvalue of property by intentional damage knows it belongs to\r\nsomebody. If he thinks it belongs to himself, he expects whatever\r\nharm he may do to come out of his own pocket. It would be odd if\r\nhe were to get rid of the burden by discovering that it belonged\r\nto his neighbor. It is a very different thing to say that he who\r\nintentionally does harm must bear the loss, from saying that one\r\nfrom whose acts harm follows accidentally, as [98] a consequence\r\nwhich could not have been foreseen, must bear it.\r\n\r\nNext, suppose the act complained of is an exercise of dominion\r\nover the plaintiff's property, such as a merely technical\r\ntrespass or a conversion. If the defendant thought that the\r\nproperty belonged to himself, there seems to be no abstract\r\ninjustice in requiring him to know the limits of his own titles,\r\nor, if he thought that it belonged to another, in holding him\r\nbound to get proof of title before acting. Consider, too, what\r\nthe defendant's liability amounts to, if the act, whether an\r\nentry upon land or a conversion of chattels, has been unattended\r\nby damage to the property, and the thing has come back to the\r\nhands of the true owner. The sum recovered is merely nominal, and\r\nthe payment is nothing more than a formal acknowledgment of the\r\nowner's title; which, considering the effect of prescription and\r\nstatutes of limitation upon repeated acts of dominion, is no more\r\nthan right. /1/ All semblance of injustice disappears when the\r\ndefendant is allowed to avoid the costs of an action by tender or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the property has not come back to the hands of the\r\ntrue owner. If the thing remains in the hands of the defendant,\r\nit is clearly right that he should surrender it. And if instead\r\nof the thing itself he holds the proceeds of a sale, it is as\r\nreasonable to make him pay over its value in trover or assumpsit\r\nas it would have been to compel a surrender of the thing. But the\r\nquestion whether the defendant has subsequently paid over the\r\nproceeds of the sale of a chattel to a third person, cannot\r\naffect the rights of the true owner of the [99] chattel. In the\r\nsupposed case of an auctioneer, for instance, if he had paid the\r\ntrue owner, it would have been an answer to his bailor's claim.\r\nIf he has paid his bailor instead, he has paid one whom he was\r\nnot bound to pay, and no general principle requires that this\r\nshould be held to divest the plaintiff's right.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration affecting the argument that the law as to\r\ntrespasses upon property establishes a general principle, is that\r\nthe defendant's knowledge or ignorance of the plaintiff's title\r\nis likely to lie wholly in his own breast, and therefore hardly\r\nadmits of satisfactory proof. Indeed, in many cases it cannot\r\nhave been open to evidence at all at the time when the law was\r\nsettled, before parties were permitted to testify. Accordingly,\r\nin Basely v. Clarkson, /1/ where the defence set up to an action\r\nof trespass quare clausum was that the defendant in mowing his\r\nown land involuntarily and by mistake mowed down some of the\r\nplaintiff's grass, the plaintiff had judgment on demurrer. \"For\r\nit appears the fact was voluntary, and his intention and\r\nknowledge are not traversable; they can't be known.\"\r\n\r\nThis language suggests that it would be sufficient to explain the\r\nlaw of trespass upon property historically, without attempting to\r\njustify it. For it seems to be admitted that if the defendant's\r\nmistake could be proved it might be material. /2/ It will be\r\nnoticed, further, that any general argument from the law of\r\ntrespass upon laud to that governing trespass against the person\r\nis shown to be misleading by the law as to cattle. The owner is\r\nbound at his peril [100] to keep them off his neighbor's\r\npremises, but he is not bound at his peril in all cases to keep\r\nthem from his neighbor's person.\r\n\r\nThe objections to such a decision as supposed in the case of an\r\nauctioneer do not rest on the general theory of liability, but\r\nspring altogether from the special exigencies of commerce. It\r\ndoes not become unjust to hold a person liable for unauthorized\r\nintermeddling with another's property, until there arises the\r\npractical necessity for rapid dealing. But where this practical\r\nnecessity exists, it is not surprising to find, and we do find, a\r\ndifferent tendency in the law. The absolute protection of\r\nproperty, however natural to a primitive community more occupied\r\nin production than in exchange, is hardly consistent with the\r\nrequirements of modern business. Even when the rules which we\r\nhave been considering were established, the traffic of the public\r\nmarkets was governed by more liberal principles. On the continent\r\nof Europe it was long ago decided that the policy of protecting\r\ntitles must yield to the policy of protecting trade. Casaregis\r\nheld that the general principle nemo plus juris in alium\r\ntransferre potest quam ipse habet must give way in mercantile\r\ntransactions to possession vaut titre. /1/ In later times, as\r\nmarkets overt have lost their importance, the Factors' Acts and\r\ntheir successive amendments have tended more and more in the\r\ndirection of adopting the Continental doctrine.\r\n\r\nI must preface the argument from precedent with a reference to\r\nwhat has been said already in the first Lecture about early forms\r\nof liability, and especially about [101] the appeals. It was\r\nthere shown that the appeals de pace et plagis and of mayhem\r\nbecame the action of trespass, and that those appeals and the\r\nearly actions of trespass were always, so far as appears, for\r\nintentional wrongs. /1/\r\n\r\nThe contra pacem in the writ of trespass was no doubt inserted to\r\nlay a foundation for the king's writ; but there seems to be no\r\nreason to attribute a similar purpose to vi et armis, or cum vi\r\nsua, as it was often put. Glanvill says that wounds are within\r\nthe sheriff's jurisdiction, unless the appellor adds a charge of\r\nbreach of the king's peace. /2/ Yet the wounds are given vi et\r\narmis as much in the one case as in the other. Bracton says that\r\nthe lesser wrongs described by him belong to the king's\r\njurisdiction, \"because they are sometimes against the peace of\r\nour lord the king,\" /3/ while, as has been observed, they were\r\nsupposed to be always committed intentionally. It might even\r\nperhaps be inferred that the allegation contra pacem was\r\noriginally material, and it will be remembered that trespasses\r\nformerly involved the liability to pay a fine to the king. /4/\r\n\r\nIf it be true that trespass was originally confined to\r\nintentional wrongs, it is hardly necessary to consider the\r\nargument drawn from the scope of the general issue. In form it\r\nwas a mitigation of the strict denial de verbo in verbum of the\r\nancient procedure, to which the inquest given by the king's writ\r\nwas unknown. /5/ The strict form seems to have lasted in England\r\nsome time after the trial of the issue by recognition was\r\nintroduced. /6/ When [102] a recognition was granted, the inquest\r\nwas, of course, only competent to speak to the facts, as has been\r\nsaid above. /1/ When the general issue was introduced, trespass\r\nwas still confined to intentional wrongs.\r\n\r\nWe may now take up the authorities. It will be remembered that\r\nthe earlier precedents are of a date when the assize and jurata\r\nhad not given place to the modern jury. These bodies spoke from\r\ntheir own knowledge to an issue defined by the writ, or to\r\ncertain familiar questions of fact arising in the trial of a\r\ncause, but did not hear the whole case upon evidence adduced.\r\nTheir function was more limited than that which has been gained\r\nby the jury, and it naturally happened that, when they had\r\ndeclared what the defendant had done, the judges laid down the\r\nstandard by which those acts were to be measured without their\r\nassistance. Hence the question in the Year Books is not a loose\r\nor general inquiry of the jury whether they think the alleged\r\ntrespasser was negligent on such facts as they may find, but a\r\nwell-defined issue of law, to be determined by the court, whether\r\ncertain acts set forth upon the record are a ground of liability.\r\nIt is possible that the judges may have dealt pretty strictly\r\nwith defendants, and it is quite easy to pass from the premise\r\nthat defendants have been held trespassers for a variety of acts,\r\nwithout mention of neglect, to the conclusion that any act by\r\nwhich another was damaged will make the actor chargeable. But a\r\nmore exact scrutiny of the early books will show that liability\r\nin general, then as later, was [103] founded on the opinion of\r\nthe tribunal that the defendant ought to have acted otherwise,\r\nor, in other words, that he was to blame.\r\n\r\nReturning first to the case of the thorns in the Year Book, /1/\r\nit will be seen that the falling of the thorns into the\r\nplaintiff's close, although a result not wished by the defendant,\r\nwas in no other sense against his will. When he cut the thorns,\r\nhe did an act which obviously and necessarily would have that\r\nconsequence, and he must be taken to have foreseen and not to\r\nhave prevented it. Choke, C. J. says, \"As to what was said about\r\ntheir falling in, ipso invito, that is no plea, but he ought to\r\nshow that he could not do it in any other way, or that he did all\r\nin his power to keep them out\"; and both the judges put the\r\nunlawfulness of the entry upon the plaintiff's land as a\r\nconsequence of the unlawfulness of dropping the thorns there.\r\nChoke admits that, if the thorns or a tree had been blown over\r\nupon the plaintiff's land, the defendant might have entered to\r\nget them. Chief Justice Crew says of this case, in Millen v.\r\nFawdry, /2/ that the opinion was that \"trespass lies, because he\r\ndid not plead that he did his best endeavor to hinder their\r\nfalling there; yet this was a hard case.\" The statements of law\r\nby counsel in argument may be left on one side, although Brian is\r\nquoted and mistaken for one of the judges by Sir William\r\nBlackstone, in Scott v. Shepherd.\r\n\r\nThe principal authorities are the shooting cases, and, as\r\nshooting is an extra-hazardous act, it would not be surprising\r\nif it should be held that men do it at their peril in public\r\nplaces. The liability has been put on the general ground of\r\nfault, however, wherever the line of necessary [104] precaution\r\nmay be drawn. In Weaver v. Ward, /1/ the defendant set up that\r\nthe plaintiff and he were skirmishing in a trainband, and that\r\nwhen discharging his piece he wounded the plaintiff by accident\r\nand misfortune, and against his own will. On demurrer, the court\r\nsays that \"no man shall be excused of a trespass,... except it\r\nmay be judged utterly without his fault. As if a man by force\r\ntake my hand and strike you, or if here the defendant had said,\r\nthat the plaintiff ran cross his piece when it was discharging,\r\nor had set forth the case with the circumstances so as it had\r\nappeared to the court that it had been inevitable, and that the\r\ndefendant had committed no negligence to give occasion to the\r\nhurt.\" The later cases simply follow Weaver v. Ward.\r\n\r\nThe quotations which were made above in favor of the strict\r\ndoctrine from Sir T. Raymond, in Bessey v. Olliot, and from Sir\r\nWilliam Blackstone, in Scott v. Shepherd, are both taken from\r\ndissenting opinions. In the latter case it is pretty clear that\r\nthe majority of the court considered that to repel personal\r\ndanger by instantaneously tossing away a squib thrown by another\r\nupon one's stall was not a trespass, although a new motion was\r\nthereby imparted to the squib, and the plaintiff's eye was put\r\nout in consequence. The last case cited above, in stating the\r\narguments for absolute responsibility, was Leame v. Bray. /2/ The\r\nquestion under discussion was whether the action (for running\r\ndown the plaintiff) should not have been case rather than\r\ntrespass, the defendant founding his objection to trespass on the\r\nground that the injury happened through his neglect, but was not\r\ndone wilfully. There was therefore no question of absolute\r\nresponsibility for one's acts [105] before the court, as\r\nnegligence was admitted; and the language used is all directed\r\nsimply to the proposition that the damage need not have been done\r\nintentionally.\r\n\r\nIn Wakeman v. Robinson, /1/another runaway case, there was\r\nevidence that the defendant pulled the wrong rein, and that he\r\nought to have kept a straight course. The jury were instructed\r\nthat, if the injury was occasioned by an immediate act of the\r\ndefendant, it was immaterial whether the act was wilful or\r\naccidental. On motion for a new trial, Dallas, C. J. said, \"If\r\nthe accident happened entirely without default on the part of the\r\ndefendant, or blame imputable to him, the action does not lie\r\n....The accident was clearly occasioned by the default of the\r\ndefendant. The weight of evidence was all that way. I am now\r\ncalled upon to grant a new trial, contrary to the justice of the\r\ncase, upon the ground, that the jury were not called on to\r\nconsider whether the accident was unavoidable, or occasioned by\r\nthe fault of the defendant. There can be no doubt that the\r\nlearned judge who presided would have taken the opinion of the\r\njury on that ground, if he had been requested so to do.\" This\r\nlanguage may have been inapposite under the defendant's plea (the\r\ngeneral issue), but the pleadings were not adverted to, and the\r\ndoctrine is believed to be sound.\r\n\r\nIn America there have been several decisions to the point. In\r\nBrown v. Kendall, /2/ Chief Justice Shaw settled the question for\r\nMassachusetts. That was trespass for assault and battery, and it\r\nappeared that the defendant, while trying to separate two\r\nfighting dogs, had raised his stick over his shoulder in the act\r\nof striking, and had accidentally hit the plaintiff in the eye,\r\ninflicting upon him a [106] severe injury. The case was stronger\r\nfor the plaintiff than if the defendant had been acting in\r\nself-defence; but the court held that, although the defendant was\r\nbound by no duty to separate the dogs, yet, if he was doing a\r\nlawful act, he was not liable unless he was wanting in the care\r\nwhich men of ordinary prudence would use under the circumstances,\r\nand that the burden was on the plaintiff to prove the want of\r\nsuch care.\r\n\r\nIn such a matter no authority is more deserving of respect than\r\nthat of Chief Justice Shaw, for the strength of that great judge\r\nlay in an accurate appreciation of the requirements of the\r\ncommunity whose officer he was. Some, indeed many, English judges\r\ncould be named who have surpassed him in accurate technical\r\nknowledge, but few have lived who were his equals in their\r\nunderstanding of the grounds of public policy to which all laws\r\nmust ultimately be referred. It was this which made him, in the\r\nlanguage of the late Judge Curtis, the greatest magistrate which\r\nthis country has produced.\r\n\r\nBrown v. Kendall has been followed in Connecticut, /1/ in a case\r\nwhere a man fired a pistol, in lawful self-defence as he alleged,\r\nand hit a bystander. The court was strongly of opinion that the\r\ndefendant was not answerable on the general principles of\r\ntrespass, unless there was a failure to use such care as was\r\npracticable under the circumstances. The foundation of liability\r\nin trespass as well as case was said to be negligence. The\r\nSupreme Court of the United States has given the sanction of its\r\napproval to the same doctrine. /2/ The language of Harvey v.\r\nDunlop /3/ has been [107] quoted, and there is a case in Vermont\r\nwhich tends in the same direction. /1/\r\n\r\nSupposing it now to be conceded that the general notion upon\r\nwhich liability to an action is founded is fault or\r\nblameworthiness in some sense, the question arises, whether it is\r\nso in the sense of personal moral shortcoming, as would\r\npractically result from Austin's teaching. The language of Rede,\r\nJ., which has been quoted from the Year Book, gives a sufficient\r\nanswer. \"In trespass the intent\" (we may say more broadly, the\r\ndefendant's state of mind) \"cannot be construed.\" Suppose that a\r\ndefendant were allowed to testify that, before acting, he\r\nconsidered carefully what would be the conduct of a prudent man\r\nunder the circumstances, and, having formed the best judgment he\r\ncould, acted accordingly. If the story was believed, it would be\r\nconclusive against the defendant's negligence judged by a moral\r\nstandard which would take his personal characteristics into\r\naccount. But supposing any such evidence to have got before the\r\njury, it is very clear that the court would say, Gentlemen, the\r\nquestion is not whether the defendant thought his conduct was\r\nthat of a prudent man, but whether you think it was. /2/\r\n\r\nSome middle point must be found between the horns of this\r\ndilemma.\r\n\r\n[108 The standards of the law are standards of general\r\napplication. The law takes no account of the infinite varieties\r\nof temperament, intellect, and education which make the internal\r\ncharacter of a given act so different in different men. It does\r\nnot attempt to see men as God sees them, for more than one\r\nsufficient reason. In the first place, the impossibility of\r\nnicely measuring a man's powers and limitations is far clearer\r\nthan that of ascertaining his knowledge of law, which has been\r\nthought to account for what is called the presumption that every\r\nman knows the law. But a more satisfactory explanation is, that,\r\nwhen men live in society, a certain average of conduct, a\r\nsacrifice of individual peculiarities going beyond a certain\r\npoint, is necessary to the general welfare. If, for instance, a\r\nman is born hasty and awkward, is always having accidents and\r\nhurting himself or his neighbors, no doubt his congenital defects\r\nwill be allowed for in the courts of Heaven, but his slips are no\r\nless troublesome to his neighbors than if they sprang from guilty\r\nneglect. His neighbors accordingly require him, at his proper\r\nperil, to come up to their standard, and the courts which they\r\nestablish decline to take his personal equation into account.\r\n\r\nThe rule that the law does, in general, determine liability by\r\nblameworthiness, is subject to the limitation that minute\r\ndifferences of character are not allowed for. The law considers,\r\nin other words, what would be blameworthy in the average man, the\r\nman of ordinary intelligence and prudence, and determines\r\nliability by that. If we fall below the level in those gifts, it\r\nis our misfortune; so much as that we must have at our peril, for\r\nthe reasons just given. But he who is intelligent and prudent\r\ndoes not act at his peril, in theory of law. On the contrary, it\r\nis [109] only when he fails to exercise the foresight of which he\r\nis capable, or exercises it with evil intent, that he is\r\nanswerable for the consequences.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions to the principle that every man is presumed\r\nto possess ordinary capacity to avoid harm to his neighbors,\r\nwhich illustrate the rule, and also the moral basis of liability\r\nin general. When a man has a distinct defect of such a nature\r\nthat all can recognize it as making certain precautions\r\nimpossible, he will not be held answerable for not taking them. A\r\nblind man is not required to see at his peril; and although he\r\nis, no doubt, bound to consider his infirmity in regulating his\r\nactions, yet if he properly finds himself in a certain situation,\r\nthe neglect of precautions requiring eyesight would not prevent\r\nhis recovering for an injury to himself, and, it may be presumed,\r\nwould not make him liable for injuring another. So it is held\r\nthat, in cases where he is the plaintiff, an infant of very\r\ntender years is only bound to take the precautions of which an\r\ninfant is capable; the same principle may be cautiously applied\r\nwhere he is defendant. /1/ Insanity is a more difficult matter to\r\ndeal with, and no general rule can be laid down about it. There\r\nis no doubt that in many cases a man may be insane, and yet\r\nperfectly capable of taking the precautions, and of being\r\ninfluenced by the motives, which the circumstances demand. But if\r\ninsanity of a pronounced type exists, manifestly incapacitating\r\nthe sufferer from complying with the rule which he has broken,\r\ngood sense would require it to be admitted as an excuse.\r\n\r\nTaking the qualification last established in connection with the\r\ngeneral proposition previously laid down, it will [110] now be\r\nassumed that, on the one hand, the law presumes or requires a man\r\nto possess ordinary capacity to avoid harming his neighbors,\r\nunless a clear and manifest incapacity be shown; but that, on the\r\nother, it does not in general hold him liable for unintentional\r\ninjury, unless, possessing such capacity, he might and ought to\r\nhave foreseen the danger, or, in other words, unless a man of\r\nordinary intelligence and forethought would have been to blame\r\nfor acting as he did. The next question is, whether this vague\r\ntest is all that the law has to say upon the matter, and the same\r\nquestion in another form, by whom this test is to be applied.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the grounds of legal liability are\r\nmoral to the extent above explained, it must be borne in mind\r\nthat law only works within the sphere of the senses. If the\r\nexternal phenomena, the manifest acts and omissions, are such as\r\nit requires, it is wholly indifferent to the internal phenomena\r\nof conscience. A man may have as bad a heart as he chooses, if\r\nhis conduct is within the rules. In other words, the standards of\r\nthe law are external standards, and, however much it may take\r\nmoral considerations into account, it does so only for the\r\npurpose of drawing a line between such bodily motions and rests\r\nas it permits, and such as it does not. What the law really\r\nforbids, and the only thing it forbids, is the act on the wrong\r\nside of the line, be that act blameworthy or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAgain, any legal standard must, in theory, be one which would\r\napply to all men, not specially excepted, under the same\r\ncircumstances. It is not intended that the public force should\r\nfall upon an individual accidentally, or at the whim of any body\r\nof men. The standard, that is, [111] must be fixed. In practice,\r\nno doubt, one man may have to pay and another may escape,\r\naccording to the different feelings of different juries. But this\r\nmerely shows that the law does not perfectly accomplish its ends.\r\nThe theory or intention of the law is not that the feeling of\r\napprobation or blame which a particular twelve may entertain\r\nshould be the criterion. They are supposed to leave their\r\nidiosyncrasies on one side, and to represent the feeling of the\r\ncommunity. The ideal average prudent man, whose equivalent the\r\njury is taken to be in many cases, and whose culpability or\r\ninnocence is the supposed test, is a constant, and his conduct\r\nunder given circumstances is theoretically always the same.\r\n\r\nFinally, any legal standard must, in theory, be capable of being\r\nknown. When a man has to pay damages, he is supposed to have\r\nbroken the law, and he is further supposed to have known what the\r\nlaw was.\r\n\r\nIf, now, the ordinary liabilities in tort arise from failure to\r\ncomply with fixed and uniform standards of external conduct,\r\nwhich every man is presumed and required to know, it is obvious\r\nthat it ought to be possible, sooner or later, to formulate these\r\nstandards at least to some extent, and that to do so must at last\r\nbe the business of the court. It is equally clear that the\r\nfeatureless generality, that the defendant was bound to use such\r\ncare as a prudent man would do under the circumstances, ought to\r\nbe continually giving place to the specific one, that he was\r\nbound to use this or that precaution under these or those\r\ncircumstances. The standard which the defendant was bound to come\r\nup to was a standard of specific acts or omissions, with\r\nreference to the specific circumstances in which he found\r\nhimself. If in the whole department of [112] unintentional wrongs\r\nthe courts arrived at no further utterance than the question of\r\nnegligence, and left every case, without rudder or compass, to\r\nthe jury, they would simply confess their inability to state a\r\nvery large part of the law which they required the defendant to\r\nknow, and would assert, by implication, that nothing could be\r\nlearned by experience. But neither courts nor legislatures have\r\never stopped at that point.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Alfred to the present day, statutes and\r\ndecisions have busied themselves with defining the precautions to\r\nbe taken in certain familiar cases; that is, with substituting\r\nfor the vague test of the care exercised by a prudent man, a\r\nprecise one of specific acts or omissions. The fundamental\r\nthought is still the same, that the way prescribed is that in\r\nwhich prudent men are in the habit of acting, or else is one laid\r\ndown for cases where prudent men might otherwise be in doubt.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the existence of the external tests of\r\nliability which will be mentioned, while it illustrates the\r\ntendency of the law of tort to become more and more concrete by\r\njudicial decision and by statute, does not interfere with the\r\ngeneral doctrine maintained as to the grounds of liability. The\r\nargument of this Lecture, although opposed to the doctrine that a\r\nman acts or exerts force at his peril, is by no means opposed to\r\nthe doctrine that he does certain particular acts at his peril.\r\nIt is the coarseness, not the nature, of the standard which is\r\nobjected to. If, when the question of the defendant's negligence\r\nis left to a jury, negligence does not mean the actual state of\r\nthe defendant's mind, but a failure to act as a prudent man of\r\naverage intelligence would have done, he is required to conform\r\nto an objective standard at his [113] peril, even in that case.\r\nWhen a more exact and specific rule has been arrived at, he must\r\nobey that rule at his peril to the same extent. But, further, if\r\nthe law is wholly a standard of external conduct, a man must\r\nalways comply with that standard at his peril.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the process of specification will be useful. In\r\nLL. Alfred, 36, /1/ providing for the case of a man's staking\r\nhimself on a spear carried by another, we read, \"Let this\r\n(liability) be if the point be three fingers higher than the\r\nhindmost part of the shaft; if they be both on a level,... be\r\nthat without danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe rule of the road and the sailing rules adopted by Congress\r\nfrom England are modern examples of such statutes. By the former\r\nrule, the question has been narrowed from the vague one, Was the\r\nparty negligent? to the precise one, Was he on the right or left\r\nof the road? To avoid a possible misconception, it may be\r\nobserved that, of course, this question does not necessarily and\r\nunder all circumstances decide that of liability; a plaintiff may\r\nhave been on the wrong side of the road, as he may have been\r\nnegligent, and yet the conduct of the defendant may have been\r\nunjustifiable, and a ground of liability. /2/ So, no doubt, a\r\ndefendant could justify or excuse being on the wrong side, under\r\nsome circumstances. The difference between alleging that a\r\ndefendant was on the wrong side of the road, and that he was\r\nnegligent, is the difference between an allegation of facts\r\nrequiring to be excused by a counter allegation of further facts\r\nto prevent their being a ground of liability, and an allegation\r\nwhich involves a conclusion of law, and denies in advance the\r\nexistence of an [114] excuse. Whether the former allegation ought\r\nnot to be enough, and whether the establishment of the fact ought\r\nnot to shift the burden of proof, are questions which belong to\r\nthe theory of pleading and evidence, and could be answered either\r\nway consistently with analogy. I should have no difficulty in\r\nsaying that the allegation of facts which are ordinarily a ground\r\nof liability, and which would be so unless excused, ought to be\r\nsufficient. But the forms of the law, especially the forms of\r\npleading, do not change with every change of its substance, and a\r\nprudent lawyer would use the broader and safer phrase.\r\n\r\nThe same course of specification which has been illustrated from\r\nthe statute-book ought also to be taking place in the growth of\r\njudicial decisions. That this should happen is in accordance with\r\nthe past history of the law. It has been suggested already that\r\nin the days of the assize and jurata the court decided whether\r\nthe facts constituted a ground of liability in all ordinary\r\ncases. A question of negligence might, no doubt, have gone to the\r\njury. Common sense and common knowledge are as often sufficient\r\nto determine whether proper care has been taken of an animal, as\r\nthey are to say whether A or B owns it. The cases which first\r\narose were not of a kind to suggest analysis, and negligence was\r\nused as a proximately simple element for a long time before the\r\nneed or possibility of analysis was felt. Still, when an issue of\r\nthis sort is found, the dispute is rather what the acts or\r\nomissions of the defendant were than on the standard of conduct.\r\n/1/ The [115] distinction between the functions of court and jury\r\ndoes not come in question until the parties differ as to the\r\nstandard of conduct. Negligence, like ownership, is a complex\r\nconception. Just as the latter imports the existence of certain\r\nfacts, and also the consequence (protection against all the\r\nworld) which the law attaches to those facts; the former imports\r\nthe existence of certain facts (conduct) and also the consequence\r\n(liability) which the law attaches to those facts. In most cases\r\nthe question is upon the facts, and it is only occasionally that\r\none arises on the consequence.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed how the judges pass on the defendant's\r\nacts (on grounds of fault and public policy) in the case of the\r\nthorns, and that in Weaver v. Ward /1/it is said that the facts\r\nconstituting an excuse, and showing that the defendant was free\r\nfrom negligence, should have been spread upon the record, in\r\norder that the court might judge. A similar requirement was laid\r\ndown with regard to the defence of probable cause in an action\r\nfor malicious prosecution. /2/ And to this day the question of\r\nprobable cause is always passed on by the court. Later evidence\r\nwill be found in what follows.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an important consideration, which has not yet\r\nbeen adverted to. It is undoubtedly possible that those who have\r\nthe making of the law should deem it wise to put the mark higher\r\nin some cases than the point established by common practice at\r\nwhich blameworthiness begins. For instance, in Morris v. Platt,\r\n/2/ the court, while declaring in the strongest terms that, in\r\ngeneral, [116] negligence is the foundation of liability for\r\naccidental trespasses, nevertheless hints that, if a decision of\r\nthe point were necessary, it might hold a defendant to a stricter\r\nrule where the damage was caused by a pistol, in view of the\r\ndanger to the public of the growing habit of carrying deadly\r\nweapons. Again, it might well seem that to enter a man's house\r\nfor the purpose of carrying a present, or inquiring after his\r\nhealth when he was ill, was a harmless and rather praiseworthy\r\nact, although crossing the owner's boundary was intentional. It\r\nis not supposed that an action would lie at the present day for\r\nsuch a cause, unless the defendant had been forbidden the house.\r\nYet in the time of Henry VIII. it was said to be actionable if\r\nwithout license, \"for then under that color my enemy might be in\r\nmy house and kill me.\" /1/ There is a clear case where public\r\npolicy establishes a standard of overt acts without regard to\r\nfault in any sense. In like manner, policy established exceptions\r\nto the general prohibition against entering another's premises,\r\nas in the instance put by Chief Justice Choke in the Year Book,\r\nof a tree being blown over upon them, or when the highway became\r\nimpassable, or for the purpose of keeping the peace. /2/\r\n\r\nAnother example may perhaps be found in the shape which has been\r\ngiven in modern times to the liability for animals, and in the\r\nderivative principle of Rylands v. Fletcher, /3/ that when a\r\nperson brings on his lands, and collects and keeps there,\r\nanything likely to do mischief if it escapes, he must keep it in\r\nat his peril; and, if he does not do so, is prima facie\r\nanswerable for all the [117] damage which is the natural\r\nconsequence of its escape. Cases of this sort do not stand on the\r\nnotion that it is wrong to keep cattle, or to have a reservoir of\r\nwater, as might have been thought with more plausibility when\r\nfierce and useless animals only were in question. /1/ It may even\r\nbe very much for the public good that the dangerous accumulation\r\nshould be made (a consideration which might influence the\r\ndecision in some instances, and differently in different\r\njurisdictions); but as there is a limit to the nicety of inquiry\r\nwhich is possible in a trial, it may be considered that the\r\nsafest way to secure care is to throw the risk upon the person\r\nwho decides what precautions shall be taken. The liability for\r\ntrespasses of cattle seems to lie on the boundary line between\r\nrules based on policy irrespective of fault, and requirements\r\nintended to formulate the conduct of a prudent man.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the first Lecture how this liability for\r\ncattle arose in the early law, and how far the influence of early\r\nnotions might be traced in the law of today, Subject to what is\r\nthere said, it is evident that the early discussions turn on the\r\ngeneral consideration whether the owner is or is not to blame.\r\n/2/ But they do not stop there: they go on to take practical\r\ndistinctions, based on common experience. Thus, when the\r\ndefendant chased sheep out of his land with a dog, and as soon as\r\nthe sheep were out called in his dog, but the dog pursued them\r\ninto adjoining land, the chasing of the sheep beyond the\r\ndefendant's line was held no trespass, because \"the nature of a\r\ndog is such that he cannot be ruled suddenly.\" /3/\r\n\r\n[118] It was lawful in ploughing to turn the horses on adjoining\r\nland, and if while so turning the beasts took a mouthful of\r\ngrass, or subverted the soil with the plough, against the will of\r\nthe driver, he had a good justification, because the law will\r\nrecognize that a man cannot at every instant govern his cattle as\r\nhe will. /1/ So it was said that, if a man be driving cattle\r\nthrough a town, and one of them goes into another man's house,\r\nand he follows him, trespass does not lie for this. /2/ So it was\r\nsaid by Doderidge, J., in the same case, that if deer come into\r\nmy land out of the forest, and I chase them with dogs, it is\r\nexcuse enough for me to wind my horn to recall the dogs, because\r\nby this the warden of the forest has notice that a deer is being\r\nchased. /3/\r\n\r\nThe very case of Mason v. Keeling, /4/ which is referred to in\r\nthe first Lecture for its echo of primitive notions, shows that\r\nthe working rules of the law had long been founded on good sense.\r\nWith regard to animals not then treated as property, which in the\r\nmain were the wilder animals, the law was settled that, \"if they\r\nare of a tame nature, there must be notice of the ill quality;\r\nand the law takes notice, that a dog is not of a fierce nature,\r\nbut rather the contrary.\" /5/ If the animals \"are such as are\r\nnaturally [119] mischievous in their kind, he shall answer for\r\nhurt done by them, without any notice.\" /1/ The latter principle\r\nhas been applied to the case of a bear, /2/ and amply accounts\r\nfor the liability of the owner of such animals as horses and oxen\r\nin respect of trespasses upon land, although, as has been seen,\r\nit was at one time thought to stand upon his ownership. It is\r\nsaid to be the universal nature of cattle to stray, and, when\r\nstraying in cultivated land, to do damage by trampling down and\r\neating the crops, whereas a dog does no harm. It is also said to\r\nbe usual and easy to restrain them. /3/ If, as has been\r\nsuggested, the historical origin of the rule was different, it\r\ndoes not matter.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same line of thought, the owner of cattle is not\r\nheld absolutely answerable for all damage which they may do the\r\nperson. According to Lord Holt in the alcove opinion, these\r\nanimals, \"which are not so familiar to mankind\" as dogs, \"the\r\nowner ought to confine, and take all reasonable caution that they\r\ndo no mischief.... But... if the owner puts a horse or an ox to\r\ngrass in his field, which is adjoining to the highway, and the\r\nhorse or the ox breaks the hedge and runs into the highway, and\r\nkicks or gores some passenger, an action will not lie against the\r\nowner; otherwise, if he had notice that they had done such a\r\nthing before.\"\r\n\r\n[120] Perhaps the most striking authority for the position that\r\nthe judge's duties are not at an end when the question of\r\nnegligence is reached, is shown by the discussions concerning the\r\nlaw of bailment. Consider the judgment in Coggs v. Bernard, /1/\r\nthe treatises of Sir William Jones and Story, and the chapter of\r\nKent upon the subject. They are so many attempts to state the\r\nduty of the bailee specifically, according to the nature of the\r\nbailment and of the object bailed. Those attempts, to be sure,\r\nwere not successful, partly because they were attempts to engraft\r\nupon the native stock a branch of the Roman law which was too\r\nlarge to survive the process, but more especially because the\r\ndistinctions attempted were purely qualitative, and were\r\ntherefore useless when dealing with a jury. /2/ To instruct a\r\njury that they must find the defendant guilty of gross negligence\r\nbefore he can be charged, is open to the reproach that for such a\r\nbody the word \"gross\" is only a vituperative epithet. But it\r\nwould not be so with a judge sitting in admiralty without a jury.\r\nThe Roman law and the Supreme Court of the United States agree\r\nthat the word means something. /3/ Successful or not, it is\r\nenough for the present argument that the attempt has been made.\r\n\r\nThe principles of substantive law which have been established by\r\nthe courts are believed to have been somewhat obscured by having\r\npresented themselves oftenest in the form of rulings upon the\r\nsufficiency of evidence. When a judge rules that there is no\r\nevidence of negligence, he does something more than is embraced\r\nin an ordinary ruling that there is no evidence of a fact. He\r\nrules that [121] acts or omissions proved or in question do not\r\nconstitute a ground of legal liability, and in this way the law\r\nis gradually enriching itself from daily life, as it should.\r\nThus, in Crafton v. Metropolitan Railway Co., /1/ the plaintiff\r\nslipped on the defendant's stairs and was severely hurt. The\r\ncause of his slipping was that the brass nosing of the stairs had\r\nbeen worn smooth by travel over it, and a builder testified that\r\nin his opinion the staircase was unsafe by reason of this\r\ncircumstance and the absence of a hand-rail. There was nothing to\r\ncontradict this except that great numbers of persons had passed\r\nover the stairs and that no accident had happened there, and the\r\nplaintiff had a verdict. The court set the verdict aside, and\r\nordered a nonsuit. The ruling was in form that there was no\r\nevidence of negligence to go to the jury; but this was obviously\r\nequivalent to saying, and did in fact mean, that the railroad\r\ncompany had done all that it was bound to do in maintaining such\r\na staircase as was proved by the plaintiff. A hundred other\r\nequally concrete instances will be found in the text-books.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the court should rule that certain acts or\r\nomissions coupled with damage were conclusive evidence of\r\nnegligence unless explained, it would, in substance and in truth,\r\nrule that such acts or omissions were a ground of liability, /2/\r\nor prevented a recovery, as the case might be. Thus it is said to\r\nbe actionable negligence to let a house for a dwelling knowing it\r\nto be so infected with small-pox as to be dangerous to health,\r\nand concealing the knowledge. /3/ To explain the acts or\r\nomissions in such a [122] case would be to prove different\r\nconduct from that ruled upon, or to show that they were not,\r\njuridically speaking, the cause of the damage complained of. The\r\nruling assumes, for the purposes of the ruling, that the facts in\r\nevidence are all the facts.\r\n\r\nThe cases which have raised difficulties needing explanation are\r\nthose in which the court has ruled that there was prima facie\r\nevidence of negligence, or some evidence of negligence to go to\r\nthe jury.\r\n\r\nMany have noticed the confusion of thought implied in speaking of\r\nsuch cases as presenting mixed questions of law and fact. No\r\ndoubt, as has been said above, the averment that the defendant\r\nhas been guilty of negligence is a complex one: first, that he\r\nhas done or omitted certain things; second, that his alleged\r\nconduct does not come up to the legal standard. And so long as\r\nthe controversy is simply on the first half, the whole complex\r\naverment is plain matter for the jury without special\r\ninstructions, just as a question of ownership would be where the\r\nonly dispute was as to the fact upon which the legal conclusion\r\nwas founded. /1/ But when a controversy arises on the second\r\nhalf, the question whether the court or the jury ought to judge\r\nof the defendant's conduct is wholly unaffected by the accident,\r\nwhether there is or is not also a dispute as to what that conduct\r\nwas. If there is such a dispute, it is entirely possible to give\r\na series of hypothetical instructions adapted to every state of\r\nfacts which it is open to the jury to find. If there is no such\r\ndispute, the court may still take their opinion as to the\r\nstandard. The problem is [123] to explain the relative functions\r\nof court and jury with regard to the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen a case arises in which the standard of conduct, pure and\r\nsimple, is submitted to the jury, the explanation is plain. It is\r\nthat the court, not entertaining any clear views of public policy\r\napplicable to the matter, derives the rule to be applied from\r\ndaily experience, as it has been agreed that the great body of\r\nthe law of tort has been derived. But the court further feels\r\nthat it is not itself possessed of sufficient practical\r\nexperience to lay down the rule intelligently. It conceives that\r\ntwelve men taken from the practical part of the community can aid\r\nits judgment. /1/ Therefore it aids its conscience by taking the\r\nopinion of the jury.\r\n\r\nBut supposing a state of facts often repeated in practice, is it\r\nto be imagined that the court is to go on leaving the standard to\r\nthe jury forever? Is it not manifest, on the contrary, that if\r\nthe jury is, on the whole, as fair a tribunal as it is\r\nrepresented to be, the lesson which can be got from that source\r\nwill be learned? Either the court will find that the fair\r\nteaching of experience is that the conduct complained of usually\r\nis or is not blameworthy, and therefore, unless explained, is or\r\nis not a ground of liability; or it will find the jury\r\noscillating to and fro, and will see the necessity of making up\r\nits mind for itself. There is no reason why any other such\r\nquestion should not be settled, as well as that of liability for\r\nstairs with smooth strips of brass upon their edges. The\r\nexceptions would mainly be found where the standard was rapidly\r\nchanging, as, for instance, in some questions of medical\r\ntreatment. /2/\r\n\r\n[124] If this be the proper conclusion in plain cases, further\r\nconsequences ensue. Facts do not often exactly repeat themselves\r\nin practice; but cases with comparatively small variations from\r\neach other do. A judge who has long sat at nisi prius ought\r\ngradually to acquire a fund of experience which enables him to\r\nrepresent the common sense of the community in ordinary instances\r\nfar better than an average jury. He should be able to lead and to\r\ninstruct them in detail, even where he thinks it desirable, on\r\nthe whole, to take their opinion. Furthermore, the sphere in\r\nwhich he is able to rule without taking their opinion at all\r\nshould be continually growing.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said, that negligence is pure matter of fact,\r\nor that, after the court has declared the evidence to be such\r\nthat negligence may be inferred from it, the jury are always to\r\ndecide whether the inference shall be drawn. /1/ But it is\r\nbelieved that the courts, when they lay down this broad\r\nproposition, are thinking of cases where the conduct to be passed\r\nupon is not proved directly, and the main or only question is\r\nwhat that conduct was, not what standard shall be applied to it\r\nafter it is established.\r\n\r\nMost cases which go to the jury on a ruling that there is\r\nevidence from which they may find negligence, do not go to them\r\nprincipally on account of a doubt as to the standard, but of a\r\ndoubt as to the conduct. Take the case where the fact in proof is\r\nan event such as the dropping of a brick from a railway bridge\r\nover a highway upon the plaintiff, the fact must be inferred that\r\nthe dropping was [125] due, not to a sudden operation of weather,\r\nbut to a gradual falling out of repair which it was physically\r\npossible for the defendant to have prevented, before there can be\r\nany question as to the standard of conduct. /1/\r\n\r\nSo, in the case of a barrel falling from a warehouse window, it\r\nmust be found that the defendant or his servants were in charge\r\nof it, before any question of standard can arise. /2/ It will be\r\nseen that in each of these well-known cases the court assumed a\r\nrule which would make the defendant liable if his conduct was\r\nsuch as the evidence tended to prove. When there is no question\r\nas to the conduct established by the evidence, as in the case of\r\na collision between two trains belonging to the same company, the\r\njury have, sometimes at least, been told in effect that, if they\r\nbelieved the evidence, the defendant was liable. /3/\r\n\r\nThe principal argument that is urged in favor of the view that a\r\nmore extended function belongs to the jury as matter of right, is\r\nthe necessity of continually conforming our standards to\r\nexperience. No doubt the general foundation of legal liability in\r\nblameworthiness, as determined by the existing average standards\r\nof the community, should always be kept in mind, for the purpose\r\nof keeping such concrete rules as from time to time may be laid\r\ndown conformable to daily life. No doubt this conformity is the\r\npractical justification for requiring a man to know the civil\r\nlaw, as the fact that crimes are also generally sins is one of\r\nthe practical justifications for requiring a man to know the\r\ncriminal law. But these considerations only lead to [126] the\r\nconclusion that precedents should be overruled when they become\r\ninconsistent with present conditions; and this has generally\r\nhappened, except with regard to the construction of deeds and\r\nwills. On the other hand, it is very desirable to know as nearly\r\nas we can the standard by which we shall be judged at a given\r\nmoment, and, moreover, the standards for a very large part of\r\nhuman conduct do not vary from century to century.\r\n\r\nThe considerations urged in this Lecture are of peculiar\r\nimportance in this country, or at least in States where the law\r\nis as it stands in Massachusetts. In England, the judges at nisi\r\nprius express their opinions freely on the value and weight of\r\nthe evidence, and the judges in banc, by consent of parties,\r\nconstantly draw inferences of fact. Hence nice distinctions as to\r\nthe province of court and jury are not of the first necessity.\r\nBut when judges are forbidden by statute to charge the jury with\r\nrespect to matters of fact, and when the court in banc will never\r\nhear a case calling for inferences of fact, it becomes of vital\r\nimportance to understand that, when standards of conduct are left\r\nto the jury, it is a temporary surrender of a judicial function\r\nwhich may be resumed at any moment in any case when the court\r\nfeels competent to do so. Were this not so, the almost universal\r\nacceptance of the first proposition in this Lecture, that the\r\ngeneral foundation of liability for unintentional wrongs is\r\nconduct different from that of a prudent man under the\r\ncircumstances, would leave all our rights and duties throughout a\r\ngreat part of the law to the necessarily more or less accidental\r\nfeelings of a jury.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly consistent with the views maintained in this\r\nLecture that the courts have been very slow to withdraw questions\r\nof negligence from the jury, without distinguishing [127] nicely\r\nwhether the doubt concerned the facts or the standard to be\r\napplied. Legal, like natural divisions, however clear in their\r\ngeneral outline, will be found on exact scrutiny to end in a\r\npenumbra or debatable land. This is the region of the jury, and\r\nonly cases falling on this doubtful border are likely to be\r\ncarried far in court. Still, the tendency of the law must always\r\nbe to narrow the field of uncertainty. That is what analogy, as\r\nwell as the decisions on this very subject, would lead us to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the law is very apt to take place in this way. Two\r\nwidely different cases suggest a general distinction, which is a\r\nclear one when stated broadly. But as new eases cluster around\r\nthe opposite poles, and begin to approach each other, the\r\ndistinction becomes more difficult to trace; the determinations\r\nare made one way or the other on a very slight preponderance of\r\nfeeling, rather than of articulate reason; and at last a\r\nmathematical line is arrived at by the contact of contrary\r\ndecisions, which is so far arbitrary that it might equally well\r\nhave been drawn a little farther to the one side or to the other,\r\nbut which must have been drawn somewhere in the neighborhood of\r\nwhere it falls. /1/\r\n\r\nIn this way exact distinctions have been worked out upon\r\nquestions in which the elements to be considered are few. For\r\ninstance, what is a reasonable time for presenting negotiable\r\npaper, or what is a difference in kind and what a difference only\r\nin quality, or the rule against perpetuities.\r\n\r\nAn example of the approach of decisions towards each other from\r\nthe opposite poles, and of the function of the jury midway, is to\r\nbe found in the Massachusetts adjudications, [128] that, if a\r\nchild of two years and four months is unnecessarily sent\r\nunattended across and down a street in a large city, he cannot\r\nrecover for a negligent injury; /1/ that to allow a boy of eight\r\nto be abroad alone is not necessarily negligent; /2/ and that the\r\neffect of permitting a boy of ten to be abroad after dark is for\r\nthe jury; /3/ a coupled with the statement, which may be ventured\r\non without authority, that such a permission to a young man of\r\ntwenty possessed of common intelligence has no effect whatever.\r\n\r\nTake again the law of ancient lights in England. An obstruction\r\nto be actionable must be substantial. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances the erection of a structure a hundred yards off,\r\nand one foot above the ground, would not be actionable. One\r\nwithin a foot of the window, and covering it, would be, without\r\nany finding of a jury beyond these facts. In doubtful cases\r\nmidway, the question whether the interference was substantial has\r\nbeen left to the jury. /4/ But as the elements are few and\r\npermanent, an inclination has been shown to lay down a definite\r\nrule, that, in ordinary cases, the building complained of must\r\nnot be higher than the distance of its base from the dominant\r\nwindows. And although this attempt to work out an exact line\r\nrequires much caution, it is entirely philosophical in spirit.\r\n/5/\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to negligence. If the whole evidence\r\nin the case was that a party, in full command of [129] senses and\r\nintellect, stood on a railway track, looking at an approaching\r\nengine until it ran him down, no judge would leave it to the jury\r\nto say whether the conduct was prudent. If the whole evidence was\r\nthat he attempted to cross a level track, which was visible for\r\nhalf a mile each way, and on which no engine was in sight, no\r\ncourt would allow a jury to find negligence. Between these\r\nextremes are cases which would go to the jury. But it is obvious\r\nthat the limit of safety in such cases, supposing no further\r\nelements present, could be determined to a foot by mathematical\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with many cases of negligence is, that they are of a\r\nkind not frequently recurring, so as to enable any given judge to\r\nprofit by long experience with juries to lay down rules, and that\r\nthe elements are so complex that courts are glad to leave the\r\nwhole matter in a lump for the jury's determination.\r\n\r\nI reserve the relation between negligent and other torts for the\r\nnext Lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE IV. -- FRAUD, MALICE, AND INTENT.--THE THEORY OF TORTS.\r\n\r\n[130] The next subjects to be considered are fraud, malice, and\r\nintent. In the discussion of unintentional wrongs, the greatest\r\ndifficulty to be overcome was found to be the doctrine that a man\r\nacts always at his peril. In what follows, on the other hand, the\r\ndifficulty will be to prove that actual wickedness of the kind\r\ndescribed by the several words just mentioned is not an element\r\nin the civil wrongs to which those words are applied.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown, in dealing with the criminal law, that, when\r\nwe call an act malicious in common speech, we mean that harm to\r\nanother person was intended to come of it, and that such harm was\r\ndesired for its own sake as an end in itself. For the purposes of\r\nthe criminal law, however, intent alone was found to be\r\nimportant, and to have the same consequences as intent with\r\nmalevolence superadded. Pursuing the analysis, intent was found\r\nto be made up of foresight of the harm as a consequence, coupled\r\nwith a desire to bring it about, the latter being conceived as\r\nthe motive for the act in question. Of these, again, foresight\r\nonly seemed material. As a last step, foresight was reduced to\r\nits lowest term, and it was concluded that, subject to exceptions\r\nwhich were explained, the general basis of criminal liability was\r\nknowledge, at the time of action, [131] of facts from which\r\ncommon experience showed that certain harmful results were likely\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen whether a similar reduction is possible on\r\nthe civil side of the law, and whether thus fraudulent,\r\nmalicious, intentional, and negligent wrongs can be brought into\r\na philosophically continuous series.\r\n\r\nA word of preliminary explanation will be useful. It has been\r\nshown in the Lecture just referred to that an act, although\r\nalways importing intent, is per se indifferent to the law. It is\r\na willed, and therefore an intended coordination of muscular\r\ncontractions. But the intent necessarily imported by the act ends\r\nthere. And all muscular motions or co-ordinations of them are\r\nharmless apart from concomitant circumstances, the presence of\r\nwhich is not necessarily implied by the act itself. To strike out\r\nwith the fist is the same act, whether done in a desert or in a\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations which have been urged to show that an act\r\nalone, by itself, does not and ought not to impose either civil\r\nor criminal liability, apply, at least frequently, to a series of\r\nacts, or to conduct, although the series shows a further\r\nco-ordination and a further intent. For instance, it is the same\r\nseries of acts to utter a sentence falsely stating that a certain\r\nbarrel contains No. 1 Mackerel, whether the sentence is uttered\r\nin the secrecy of the closet, or to another man in the course of\r\na bargain. There is, to be sure, in either case, the further\r\nintent, beyond the co-ordination of muscles for a single sound,\r\nto allege that a certain barrel has certain contents,--an intent\r\nnecessarily shown by the ordering of the words. But both the\r\nseries of acts and the intent are per se indifferent. They are\r\ninnocent when spoken in solitude, and [132] are only a ground of\r\nliability when certain concomitant circumstances are shown.\r\n\r\nThe intent which is meant when spoken of as an element of legal\r\nliability is an intent directed toward the harm complained of, or\r\nat least toward harm. It is not necessary in every case to carry\r\nthe analysis back to the simple muscular contractions out of\r\nwhich a course of conduct is made up. On the same principle that\r\nrequires something more than an act followed by damage to make a\r\nman liable, we constantly find ourselves at liberty to assume a\r\nco-ordinated series of acts as a proximately simple element, per\r\nse indifferent, in considering what further circumstances or\r\nfacts must be present before the conduct in question is at the\r\nactor's peril. It will save confusion and the need of repetition\r\nif this is borne in mind in the following discussion.\r\n\r\nThe chief forms of liability in which fraud, malice, and intent\r\nare said to be necessary elements, are deceit, slander and libel,\r\nmalicious prosecution, and conspiracy, to which, perhaps, may be\r\nadded trover.\r\n\r\nDeceit is a notion drawn from the moral world, and in its popular\r\nsense distinctly imports wickedness. The doctrine of the common\r\nlaw with regard to it is generally stated in terms which are only\r\nconsistent with actual guilt, and all actual guilty intent. It is\r\nsaid that a man is liable to an action for deceit if he makes a\r\nfalse representation to another, knowing it to be false, but\r\nintending that the other should believe and act upon it, if the\r\nperson addressed believes it, and is thereby persuaded to act to\r\nhis own harm. This is no doubt the typical case, and it is a case\r\nof intentional moral wrong. Now, what is the party's conduct\r\nhere. It consists in uttering certain words, [133] so ordered\r\nthat the utterance of them imports a knowledge of the meaning\r\nwhich they would convey if heard. But that conduct with only that\r\nknowledge is neither moral nor immoral. Go one step further, and\r\nadd the knowledge of another's presence within hearing, still the\r\nact has no determinate character. The elements which make it\r\nimmoral are the knowledge that the statement is false, and the\r\nintent that it shall be acted on.\r\n\r\nThe principal question then is, whether this intent can be\r\nreduced to the same terms as it has been in other cases. There is\r\nno difficulty in the answer. It is perfectly clear that the\r\nintent that a false representation should be acted on would be\r\nconclusively established by proof that the defendant knew that\r\nthe other party intended to act upon it. If the defendant foresaw\r\nthe consequence of his acts, he is chargeable, whether his motive\r\nwas a desire to induce the other party to act, or simply an\r\nunwillingness for private reasons to state the truth. If the\r\ndefendant knew a present fact (the other party's intent), which,\r\naccording to common experience, made it likely that his act would\r\nhave the harmful consequence, he is chargeable, whether he in\r\nfact foresaw the consequence or not.\r\n\r\nIn this matter the general conclusion follows from a single\r\ninstance. For the moment it is admitted that in one case\r\nknowledge of a present fact, such as the other party's intent to\r\nact on the false statement, dispenses with proof of an intent to\r\ninduce him to act upon it, it is admitted that the lesser element\r\nis all that is necessary in the larger compound. For intent\r\nembraces knowledge sufficing for foresight, as has been shown.\r\nHence, when you prove intent you prove knowledge, and intent may\r\noften [134] be the easier to prove of the two. But when you prove\r\nknowledge you do not prove intent.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, however, that intent is implied or presumed in\r\nsuch a case as has been supposed. But this is only helping out a\r\nfalse theory by a fiction. It is very much like saying that a\r\nconsideration is presumed for an instrument under seal; which is\r\nmerely a way of reconciling the formal theory that all contracts\r\nmust have a consideration with the manifest fact that sealed\r\ninstruments do not require one. Whenever it is said that a\r\ncertain thing is essential to liability, but that it is\r\nconclusively presumed from something else, there is always ground\r\nfor suspicion that the essential clement is to be found in that\r\nsomething else, and not in what is said to be presumed from it.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the intent necessary to deceit, we need not stop\r\nwith the single instance which has been given. The law goes no\r\nfarther than to require proof either of the intent, or that the\r\nother party was justified in inferring such intention. So that\r\nthe whole meaning of the requirement is, that the natural and\r\nmanifest tendency of the representation, under the known\r\ncircumstances, must have been to induce the opinion that it was\r\nmade with a view to action, and so to induce action on the faith\r\nof it. The standard of what is called intent is thus really an\r\nexternal standard of conduct under the known circumstances, and\r\nthe analysis of the criminal law holds good here.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The law pursuing its course of specification, as\r\nexplained in the last Lecture, decides what is the tendency of\r\nrepresentations in certain cases,--as, for instance, that a horse\r\nis sound at the time of making a [135] sale; or, in general, of\r\nany statement of fact which it is known the other party intends\r\nto rely on. Beyond these scientific rules lies the vague realm of\r\nthe jury.\r\n\r\nThe other moral element in deceit is knowledge that the statement\r\nwas false. With this I am not strictly concerned, because all\r\nthat is necessary is accomplished when the elements of risk are\r\nreduced to action and knowledge. But it will aid in the general\r\nobject of showing that the tendency of the law everywhere is to\r\ntranscend moral and reach external standards, if this knowledge\r\nof falsehood can be transmuted into a formula not necessarily\r\nimporting guilt, although, of course, generally accompanied by it\r\nin fact. The moment we look critically at it, we find the moral\r\nside shade away.\r\n\r\nThe question is, what known circumstances are enough throw the\r\nrisk of a statement upon him who makes it, if it induces another\r\nman to act, and it turns out untrue. Now, it is evident that a\r\nman may take the risk of his statement by express agreement, or\r\nby an implied one which the law reads into his bargain. He may in\r\nlegal language warrant the truth of it, and if it is not true,\r\nthe law treats it as a fraud, just as much when he makes it fully\r\nbelieving it, as when he knows that it is untrue, and means to\r\ndeceive. If, in selling a horse, the seller warranted him to be\r\nonly five years old, and in fact he was thirteen, the seller\r\ncould be sued for a deceit at common law, although he thought the\r\nhorse was only five. /1/ The common-law liability for the truth\r\nof statements is, therefore, more extensive than the sphere of\r\nactual moral fraud. But, again, it is enough in general if a\r\nrepresentation [136] is made recklessly, without knowing whether\r\nit is true or false. Now what does \"recklessly\" mean. It does not\r\nmean actual personal indifference to the truth of the statement.\r\nIt means only that the data for the statement were so far\r\ninsufficient that a prudent man could not have made it without\r\nleading to the inference that he was indifferent. That is to say,\r\nrepeating an analysis which has been gone through with before, it\r\nmeans that the law, applying a general objective standard,\r\ndetermines that, if a man makes his statement on those data, he\r\nis liable, whatever was the state of his mind, and although he\r\nindividually may have been perfectly free from wickedness in\r\nmaking it.\r\n\r\nHence similar reasoning to that which has been applied already to\r\nintent may be applied to knowledge of falsity. Actual knowledge\r\nmay often be easier to prove than that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to warrant the statement, and when proved it\r\ncontains the lesser element. But as soon as the lesser element is\r\nshown to be enough, it is shown that the law is ready to apply an\r\nexternal or objective standard here also.\r\n\r\nCourts of equity have laid down the doctrine in terms which are\r\nso wholly irrespective of the actual moral condition of the\r\ndefendant as to go to an opposite extreme. It is said that \"when\r\na representation in a matter of business is made by one man to\r\nanother calculated to induce him to adapt his conduct to it, it\r\nis perfectly immaterial whether the representation is made\r\nknowing it to be untrue, or whether it is made believing it to be\r\ntrue, if, in fact, it was untrue.\" /1/\r\n\r\nPerhaps the actual decisions could be reconciled on a [137]\r\nnarrower principle, but the rule just stated goes the length of\r\nsaying that in business matters a man makes every statement (of a\r\nkind likely to be acted on) at his peril. This seems hardly\r\njustifiable in policy. The moral starting point of liability in\r\ngeneral should never be forgotten, and the law cannot without\r\ndisregarding it hold a man answerable for statements based on\r\nfacts which would have convinced a wise and prudent man of their\r\ntruth. The public advantage and necessity of freedom in imparting\r\ninformation, which privileges even the slander of a third person,\r\nought a fortiori, it seems to me, to privilege statements made at\r\nthe request of the party who complains of them.\r\n\r\nThe common law, at any rate, preserves the reference to morality\r\nby making fraud the ground on which it goes. It does not hold\r\nthat a man always speaks at his peril. But starting from the\r\nmoral ground, it works out an external standard of what would be\r\nfraudulent in the average prudent member of the community, and\r\nrequires every member at his peril to avoid that. As in other\r\ncases, it is gradually accumulating precedents which decide that\r\ncertain statements under certain circumstances are at the peril\r\nof the party who makes them.\r\n\r\nThe elements of deceit which throw the risk of his conduct upon a\r\nparty are these. First, making a statement of facts purporting to\r\nbe serious. Second, the known presence of another within hearing.\r\nThird, known facts sufficient to warrant the expectation or\r\nsuggest the probability that the other party will act on the\r\nstatement. (What facts are sufficient has been specifically\r\ndetermined by the courts in some instances; in others, no doubt,\r\nthe question would go to the jury on the principles heretofore\r\nexplained.) Fourth, the [138] falsehood of the statement. This\r\nmust be known, or else the known evidence concerning the matter\r\nof the statement must be such as would not warrant belief\r\naccording to the ordinary course of human experience. (On this\r\npoint also the court may be found to lay down specific rules in\r\nsome cases. /1/)\r\n\r\nI next take up the law of slander. It has often been said that\r\nmalice is one of the elements of liability, and the doctrine is\r\ncommonly stated in this way: that malice must exist, but that it\r\nis presumed by law from the mere speaking of the words; that\r\nagain you may rebut this presumption of malice by showing that\r\nthe words were spoken under circumstances which made the\r\ncommunication privileged,--as, for instance, by a lawyer in the\r\nnecessary course of his argument, or by a person answering in\r\ngood faith to inquiries as to the character of a former servant,--\r\nand then, it is said, the plaintiff may meet this defence in some\r\ncases by showing that the words were spoken with actual malice.\r\n\r\nAll this sounds as if at least actual intent to cause the damage\r\ncomplained of, if not malevolence, were at the bottom of this\r\nclass of wrongs. Yet it is not so. For although the use of the\r\nphrase \"malice\" points as usual to an original moral standard,\r\nthe rule that it is presumed upon proof of speaking certain words\r\nis equivalent to saying that the overt conduct of speaking those\r\nwords may be actionable whether the consequence of damage to the\r\nplaintiff was intended or not. And this fails in with the general\r\ntheory, because the manifest tendency of slanderous words is to\r\nharm the person of whom they are spoken. Again, the real\r\nsubstance of the defence is not that the damage [139] was not\r\nintended,--that would be no defence at all; but that, whether\r\nit was intended or not,--that is, even if the defendant foresaw\r\nit and foresaw it with pleasure,--the manifest facts and\r\ncircumstances under which he said it were such that the law\r\nconsidered the damage to the plaintiff of less importance than\r\nthe benefit of free speaking.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to apply the same analysis to the last stage\r\nof the process, but perhaps it is not impossible. It is said that\r\nthe plaintiff may meet a case of privilege thus made out on the\r\npart of the defendant, by proving actual malice, that is, actual\r\nintent to cause the damage complained of. But how is this actual\r\nmalice made out? It is by showing that the defendant knew the\r\nstatement which he made was false, or that his untrue statements\r\nwere grossly in excess of what the occasion required. Now is it\r\nnot very evident that the law is looking to a wholly different\r\nmatter from the defendant's intent? The fact that the defendant\r\nforesaw and foresaw with pleasure the damage to the plaintiff, is\r\nof no more importance in this case than it would be where the\r\ncommunication was privileged. The question again is wholly a\r\nquestion of knowledge, or other external standard. And what makes\r\neven knowledge important? It is that the reason for which a man\r\nis allowed in the other instances to make false charges against\r\nhis neighbors is wanting. It is for the public interest that\r\npeople should be free to give the best information they can under\r\ncertain circumstances without fear, but there is no public\r\nbenefit in having lies told at any time; and when a charge is\r\nknown to be false, or is in excess of what is required by the\r\noccasion, it is not necessary to make that charge in order to\r\nspeak freely, and [140] therefore it falls under the ordinary\r\nrule, that certain charges are made at the party's peril in case\r\nthey turn out to be false, whether evil consequences were\r\nintended or not. The defendant is liable, not because his intent\r\nwas evil, but because he made false charges without excuse.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the peril of conduct here begins farther\r\nback than with deceit, as the tendency of slander is more\r\nuniversally harmful. There must be some concomitant\r\ncircumstances. There must at least be a human being in existence\r\nwhom the statement designates. There must be another human being\r\nwithin hearing who understands the statement, and the statement\r\nmust be false. But it is arguable that the latter of these facts\r\nneed not be known, as certainly the falsity of the charge need\r\nnot be, and that a man must take the risk of even an idle\r\nstatement being heard, unless he made it under known\r\ncircumstances of privilege. It would be no great curtailment of\r\nfreedom to deny a man immunity in attaching a charge of crime to\r\nthe name of his neighbor, even when he supposes himself alone.\r\nBut it does not seem clear that the law would go quite so far as\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe next form of liability is comparatively insignificant. I mean\r\nthe action for malicious prosecution. A man may recover damages\r\nagainst another for maliciously and without probable cause\r\ninstituting a criminal, or, in some cases, a civil prosecution\r\nagainst him upon a false charge. The want of probable cause\r\nrefers, of course, only to the state of the defendant's\r\nknowledge, not to his intent. It means the absence of probable\r\ncause in the facts known to the defendant when he instituted the\r\nsuit. But the standard applied to the defendant's consciousness\r\nis external to it. The question is not whether he thought the\r\n[141] facts to constitute probable cause, but whether the court\r\nthinks they did.\r\n\r\nThen as to malice. The conduct of the defendant consists in\r\ninstituting proceedings on a charge which is in fact false, and\r\nwhich has not prevailed. That is the root of the whole matter. If\r\nthe charge was true, or if the plaintiff has been convicted, even\r\nthough he may be able now to prove that he was wrongly convicted,\r\nthe defendant is safe, however great his malice, and however\r\nlittle ground he had for his charge.\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that the charge is false, and does not prevail.\r\nIt may readily be admitted that malice did originally mean a\r\nmalevolent motive, an actual intent to harm the plaintiff by\r\nmaking a false charge. The legal remedy here, again, started from\r\nthe moral basis, the occasion for it, no doubt, being similar to\r\nthat which gave rise to the old law of conspiracy, that a man's\r\nenemies would sometimes seek his destruction by setting the\r\ncriminal law in motion against him. As it was punishable to\r\ncombine for such a purpose, it was concluded, with some\r\nhesitation, that, when a single individual wickedly attempted the\r\nsame thing, he should be liable on similar grounds. /1/ I must\r\nfully admit that there is weighty authority to the effect that\r\nmalice in its ordinary sense is to this day a distinct fact to be\r\nproved and to be found by the jury.\r\n\r\nBut this view cannot be accepted without hesitation. It is\r\nadmitted that, on the one side, the existence of probable cause,\r\nbelieved in, is a justification notwithstanding malice; /2/ that,\r\non the other, \"it is not enough to show [142] that the case\r\nappeared sufficient to this particular party, but it must be\r\nsufficient to induce a sober, sensible and discreet person to act\r\nupon it, or it must fail as a justification for the proceeding\r\nupon general grounds.\" /1/ On the one side, malice alone will not\r\nmake a man liable for instituting a groundless prosecution; on\r\nthe other, his justification will depend, not on his opinion of\r\nthe facts, but on that of the court. When his actual moral\r\ncondition is disregarded to this extent, it is a little hard to\r\nbelieve that the existence of an improper motive should be\r\nmaterial. Yet that is what malice must mean in this case, if it\r\nmeans anything. /2/ For the evil effects of a successful\r\nindictment are of course intended by one who procures all other\r\nto be indicted. I cannot but think that a jury would be told that\r\nknowledge or belief that the charge was false at the time of\r\nmaking it was conclusive evidence of malice. And if so, on\r\ngrounds which need not be repeated, malice is not the important\r\nthing, but the facts known to the defendant.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as it is obviously treading on delicate ground to\r\nmake it actionable to set the regular processes of the law in\r\nmotion, it is, of course, entirely possible to say that the\r\naction shall be limited to those cases where the charge was\r\npreferred from improper motives, at least if the defendant\r\nthought that there was probable cause. Such a limitation would\r\nstand almost alone in the law of civil liability. But the nature\r\nof the wrong is peculiar, and, moreover, it is quite consistent\r\nwith the theory of liability here advanced that it should be\r\nconfined in any given instance to actual wrong-doing in a moral\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nThe only other cause of action in which the moral condition [143]\r\nof the defendant's consciousness might seem to be important is\r\nconspiracy. The old action going by that name was much like\r\nmalicious prosecution, and no doubt was originally confined to\r\ncases where several persons had conspired to indict another from\r\nmalevolent motives. But in the modern action on the case, where\r\nconspiracy is charged, the allegation as a rule only means that\r\ntwo or more persons were so far co-operating in their acts that\r\nthe act of any one was the act of all. Generally speaking, the\r\nliability depends not on the co-operation or conspiring, but on\r\nthe character of the acts done, supposing them all to be done by\r\none man, or irrespective of the question whether they were done\r\nby one or several. There may be cases, to be sure, in which the\r\nresult could not be accomplished, or the offence could not\r\nordinarily be proved, without a combination of several; as, for\r\ninstance, the removal of a teacher by a school board. The\r\nconspiracy would not affect the case except in a practical way,\r\nbut the question would be raised whether, notwithstanding the\r\nright of the board to remove, proof that they were actuated by\r\nmalevolence would not make a removal actionable. Policy, it might\r\nbe said, forbids going behind their judgment, but actual evil\r\nmotives coupled with the absence of grounds withdraw this\r\nprotection, because policy, although it does not require them to\r\ntake the risk of being right, does require that they should judge\r\nhonestly on the merits. /1/\r\n\r\nOther isolated instances like the last might, perhaps, be found\r\nin different parts of the law, in which actual malevolence would\r\naffect a man's liability for his conduct. Again, in trover for\r\nthe conversion of another's chattel, where the dominion exercised\r\nover it was of a slight and ambiguous [144] nature, it has been\r\nsaid that the taking must be \"with the intent of exercising an\r\nownership over the chattel inconsistent with the real owner's\r\nright of possession.\" /1/ But this seems to be no more than a\r\nfaint shadow of the doctrine explained with regard to larceny,\r\nand does not require any further or special discussion. Trover is\r\ncommonly understood to go, like larceny, on the plaintiff's being\r\ndeprived of his property, although in practice every possessor\r\nhas the action, and, generally speaking, the shortest wrongful\r\nwithholding of possession is a conversion.\r\n\r\nBe the exceptions more or less numerous, the general purpose of\r\nthe law of torts is to secure a man indemnity against certain\r\nforms of harm to person, reputation, or estate, at the hands of\r\nhis neighbors, not because they are wrong, but because they are\r\nharms. The true explanation of the reference of liability to a\r\nmoral standard, in the sense which has been explained, is not\r\nthat it is for the purpose of improving men's hearts, but that it\r\nis to give a man a fair chance to avoid doing the harm before he\r\nis held responsible for it. It is intended to reconcile the\r\npolicy of letting accidents lie where they fall, and the\r\nreasonable freedom of others with the protection of the\r\nindividual from injury.\r\n\r\nBut the law does not even seek to indemnify a man from all harms.\r\nAn unrestricted enjoyment of all his possibilities would\r\ninterfere with other equally important enjoyments on the part of\r\nhis neighbors. There are certain things which the law allows a\r\nman to do, notwithstanding the fact that he foresees that harm to\r\nanother will follow from them. He may charge a man with crime if\r\nthe charge is true. He may establish himself in business where he\r\nforesees that [145] of his competition will be to diminish the\r\ncustom of another shopkeeper, perhaps to ruin him. He may a\r\nbuilding which cuts another off from a beautiful prospect, or he\r\nmay drain subterranean waters and thereby drain another's well;\r\nand many other cases might be put.\r\n\r\nAs any of these things may be done with foresight of their evil\r\nconsequences, it would seem that they might be done with intent,\r\nand even with malevolent intent, to produce them. The whole\r\nargument of this Lecture and the preceding tends to this\r\nconclusion. If the aim of liability is simply to prevent or\r\nindemnify from harm so far as is consistent with avoiding the\r\nextreme of making a man answer for accident, when the law permits\r\nthe harm to be knowingly inflicted it would be a strong thing if\r\nthe presence of malice made any difference in its decisions. That\r\nmight happen, to be sure, without affecting the general views\r\nmaintained here, but it is not to be expected, and the weight of\r\nauthority is against it.\r\n\r\nAs the law, on the one hand, allows certain harms to be inflicted\r\nirrespective of the moral condition of him who inflicts them, so,\r\nat the other extreme, it may on grounds of policy throw the\r\nabsolute risk of certain transactions on the person engaging in\r\nthem, irrespective of blameworthiness in any sense. Instances of\r\nthis sort have been mentioned in the last Lecture, /1/ and will\r\nbe referred to again.\r\n\r\nMost liabilities in tort lie between these two extremes, and are\r\nfounded on the infliction of harm which the defendant had a\r\nreasonable opportunity to avoid at the time of the acts or\r\nomissions which were its proximate cause. Rut as fast as specific\r\nrules are worked out in place of the [146] vague reference to the\r\nconduct of the average man, they range themselves alongside of\r\nother specific rules based on public policy, and the grounds from\r\nwhich they spring cease to be manifest. So that, as will be seen\r\ndirectly, rules which seem to lie outside of culpability in any\r\nsense have sometimes been referred to remote fault, while others\r\nwhich started from the general notion of negligence may with\r\nequal ease be referred to some extrinsic ground of policy.\r\n\r\nApart from the extremes just mentioned, it is now easy to see how\r\nthe point at which a man's conduct begins to be at his own peril\r\nis generally fixed. When the principle is understood on which\r\nthat point is determined by the law of torts, we possess a common\r\nground of classification, and a key to the whole subject, so far\r\nas tradition has not swerved the law from a consistent theory. It\r\nhas been made pretty clear from what precedes, that I find that\r\nground in knowledge of circumstances accompanying an act or\r\nconduct indifferent but for those circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut it is worth remarking, before that criterion is discussed,\r\nthat a possible common ground is reached at the preceding step in\r\nthe descent from malice through intent and foresight. Foresight\r\nis a possible common denominator of wrongs at the two extremes of\r\nmalice and negligence. The purpose of the law is to prevent or\r\nsecure a man indemnity from harm at the hands of his neighbors,\r\nso far as consistent with other considerations which have been\r\nmentioned, and excepting, of course, such harm as it permits to\r\nbe intentionally inflicted. When a man foresees that harm will\r\nresult from his conduct, the principle which exonerates him from\r\naccident no longer applies, and he is liable. But, as has been\r\nshown, he is bound to foresee [147] whatever a prudent and\r\nintelligent man would have foreseen, and therefore he is liable\r\nfor conduct from which such a man would have foreseen that harm\r\nwas liable to follow.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it would be possible to state all cases of\r\nnegligence in terms of imputed or presumed foresight. It would be\r\npossible even to press the presumption further, applying the very\r\ninaccurate maxim, that every man is presumed to intend the\r\nnatural consequences of his own acts; and this mode of expression\r\nwill, in fact, be found to have been occasionally used, /1/ more\r\nespecially in the criminal law, where the notion of intent has a\r\nstronger foothold. /2/ The latter fiction is more remote and less\r\nphilosophical than the former; but, after all, both are equally\r\nfictions. Negligence is not foresight, but precisely the want of\r\nit; and if foresight were presumed, the ground of the\r\npresumption, and therefore the essential element, would be the\r\nknowledge of facts which made foresight possible.\r\n\r\nTaking knowledge, then, as the true starting-point, the next\r\nquestion is how to determine the circumstances necessary to be\r\nknown in any given case in order to make a man liable for the\r\nconsequences of his act. They must be such as would have led a\r\nprudent man to perceive danger, although not necessarily to\r\nforesee the specific harm. But this is a vague test. How is it\r\ndecided what those circumstances are? The answer must be, by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nBut there is one point which has been left ambiguous in the\r\npreceding Lecture and here, and which must be touched upon. It\r\nhas been assumed that conduct which [148] the man of ordinary\r\nintelligence would perceive to be dangerous under the\r\ncircumstances, would be blameworthy if pursued by him. It might\r\nnot be so, however. Suppose that, acting under the threats of\r\ntwelve armed men, which put him in fear of his life, a man enters\r\nanother's close and takes a horse. In such a case, he actually\r\ncontemplates and chooses harm to another as the consequence of\r\nhis act. Yet the act is neither blameworthy nor punishable. But\r\nit might be actionable, and Rolle, C. J. ruled that it was so in\r\nGilbert v. Stone. /1/ If this be law, it goes the full length of\r\ndeciding that it is enough if the defendant has had a chance to\r\navoid inflicting the harm complained of. And it may well be\r\nargued that, although he does wisely to ransom his life as he\r\nbest may, there is no reason why he should be allowed to\r\nintentionally and permanently transfer his misfortunes to the\r\nshoulders of his neighbors.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be inferred, from the mere circumstance that certain\r\nconduct is made actionable, that therefore the law regards it as\r\nwrong, or seeks to prevent it. Under our mill acts a man has to\r\npay for flowing his neighbor's lands, in the same way that he has\r\nto pay in trover for converting his neighbor's goods. Yet the law\r\napproves and encourages the flowing of lands for the erection of\r\nmills.\r\n\r\nMoral predilections must not be allowed to influence our minds in\r\nsettling legal distinctions. If we accept the test of the\r\nliability alone, how do we distinguish between trover and the\r\nmill acts? Or between conduct which is prohibited, and that which\r\nis merely taxed? The only distinction which I can see is in the\r\ndifference of the collateral consequences attached to the two\r\nclasses of conduct. In the one, the maxim in pari delicto potior\r\nest [149] conditio defendentis, and the invalidity of contracts\r\ncontemplating it, show that the conduct is outside the protection\r\nof the law. In the other, it is otherwise. /1/ This opinion is\r\nconfirmed by the fact, that almost the only cases in which the\r\ndistinction between prohibition and taxation comes up concern the\r\napplication of these maxims.\r\n\r\nBut if this be true, liability to an action does not necessarily\r\nimport wrong-doing. And this may be admitted without at all\r\nimpairing the force of the argument in the foregoing Lecture,\r\nwhich only requires that people should not be made to pay for\r\naccidents which they could not have avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, whether the ruling of Chief Justice\r\nRolle would now be followed. The squib case, Scott v. Shepherd,\r\nand the language of some text-books, are more or less opposed to\r\nit. /2/ If the latter view is law, then an act must in general\r\nnot only be dangerous, but one which would be blameworthy on the\r\npart of the average man, in order to make the actor liable. But,\r\naside from such exceptional cases as Gilbert v. Stone, the two\r\ntests agree, and the difference need not be considered in what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nI therefore repeat, that experience is the test by which it is\r\ndecided whether the degree of danger attending given conduct\r\nunder certain known circumstances is sufficient to throw the risk\r\nupon the party pursuing it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, experience shows that a good many guns supposed to\r\nbe unloaded go off and hurt people. The ordinarily intelligent\r\nand prudent member of the community [150] would foresee the\r\npossibility of danger from pointing a gun which he had not\r\ninspected into a crowd, and pulling the trigger, although it was\r\nsaid to be unloaded. Hence, it may very properly be held that a\r\nman who does such a thing does it at his peril, and that, if\r\ndamage ensues, he is answerable for it. The co-ordinated acts\r\nnecessary to point a gun and pull a trigger, and the intent and\r\nknowledge shown by the co-ordination of those acts, are all\r\nconsistent with entire blamelessness. They threaten harm to no\r\none without further facts. But the one additional circumstance of\r\na man in the line and within range of the piece makes the conduct\r\nmanifestly dangerous to any one who knows the fact. There is no\r\nlonger any need to refer to the prudent man, or general\r\nexperience. The facts have taught their lesson, and have\r\ngenerated a concrete and external rule of liability. He who snaps\r\na cap upon a gun pointed in the direction of another person,\r\nknown by him to be present, is answerable for the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe question what a prudent man would do under given\r\ncircumstances is then equivalent to the question what are the\r\nteachings of experience as to the dangerous character of this or\r\nthat conduct under these or those circumstances; and as the\r\nteachings of experience are matters of fact, it is easy to see\r\nwhy the jury should be consulted with regard to them. They are,\r\nhowever, facts of a special and peculiar function. Their only\r\nbearing is on the question, what ought to have been done or\r\nomitted under the circumstances of the case, not on what was\r\ndone. Their function is to suggest a rule of conduct.\r\n\r\nSometimes courts are induced to lay down rules by facts of a more\r\nspecific nature; as that the legislature passed a certain\r\nstatute, and that the case at bar is within [151] the fair\r\nmeaning of its words; or that the practice of a specially\r\ninterested class, or of the public at large, has generated a rule\r\nof conduct outside the law which it is desirable that the courts\r\nshould recognize and enforce. These are matters of fact, and have\r\nsometimes been pleaded as such. But as their only importance is,\r\nthat, if believed, they will induce the judges to lay down a rule\r\nof conduct, or in other words a rule of law, suggested by them,\r\ntheir tendency in most instances is to disappear as fast as the\r\nrules suggested by them become settled. /1/ While the facts are\r\nuncertain, as they are still only motives for decision upon the\r\nlaw,--grounds for legislation, so to speak,--the judges may\r\nascertain them in any way which satisfies their conscience. Thus,\r\ncourts recognize the statutes of the jurisdiction judicially,\r\nalthough the laws of other jurisdictions, with doubtful wisdom,\r\nare left to the jury. /2/ They may take judicial cognizance of a\r\ncustom of merchants. /3/ In former days, at least, they might\r\ninquire about it in pais after a demurrer. /4/ They may act on\r\nthe statement of a special jury, as in the time of Lord Mansfield\r\nand his successors, or upon the finding of a common jury based on\r\nthe testimony of witnesses, as is the practice to-day in this\r\ncountry. But many instances will be found the text-books which\r\nshow that, when the facts are ascertained, they soon cease to be\r\nreferred to, and give place to a rule of law.\r\n\r\n[152] The same transition is noticeable with regard to the\r\nteachings of experience. There are many cases, no doubt, in which\r\nthe court would lean for aid upon a jury; but there are also many\r\nin which the teaching has been formulated in specific rules.\r\nThese rules will be found to vary considerably with regard to the\r\nnumber of concomitant circumstances necessary to throw the peril\r\nof conduct otherwise indifferent on the actor. As the\r\ncircumstances become more numerous and complex, the tendency to\r\ncut the knot with the jury becomes greater. It will be useful to\r\nfollow a line of cases up from the simple to the more\r\ncomplicated, by way of illustration. The difficulty of\r\ndistinguishing rules based on other grounds of policy from those\r\nwhich have been worked out in the field of negligence, will be\r\nparticularly noticed.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases it will be found that there has been a\r\nvoluntary act on the part of the person to be charged. The reason\r\nfor this requirement was shown in the foregoing Lecture.\r\nUnnecessary though it is for the defendant to have intended or\r\nforeseen the evil which he has caused, it is necessary that he\r\nshould have chosen the conduct which led to it. But it has also\r\nbeen shown that a voluntary act is not enough, and that even a\r\nco-ordinated series of acts or conduct is often not enough by\r\nitself. But the co-ordination of a series of acts shows a further\r\nintent than is necessarily manifested by any single act, and\r\nsometimes proves with almost equal certainty the knowledge of one\r\nor more concomitant circumstances. And there are cases where\r\nconduct with only the intent and knowledge thus necessarily\r\nimplied is sufficient to throw the risk of it on the actor.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a man does the series of acts called [153]\r\nwalking, it is assumed for all purposes of responsibility that he\r\nknows the earth is under his feet. The conduct per se is\r\nindifferent, to be sure. A man may go through the motions of\r\nwalking without legal peril, if he chooses to practise on a\r\nprivate treadmill; but if he goes through the same motions on the\r\nsurface of the earth, it cannot be doubted that he knows that the\r\nearth is there. With that knowledge, he acts at his peril in\r\ncertain respects. If he crosses his neighbor's boundary, he is a\r\ntrespasser. The reasons for this strict rule have been partially\r\ndiscussed in the last Lecture. Possibly there is more of history\r\nor of past or present notions of policy its explanation than is\r\nthere suggested, and at any rate I do not care to justify the\r\nrule. But it is intelligible. A man who walks knows that he is\r\nmoving over the surface of the earth, he knows that he is\r\nsurrounded by private estates which he has no right to enter, and\r\nhe knows that his motion, unless properly guided, will carry him\r\ninto those estates. He is thus warned, and the burden of his\r\nconduct is thrown upon himself.\r\n\r\nBut the act of walking does not throw the peril of all possible\r\nconsequences upon him. He may run a man down in the street, but\r\nhe is not liable for that unless he does it negligently. Confused\r\nas the law is with cross-lights of tradition, and hard as we may\r\nfind it to arrive at perfectly satisfactory general theory, it\r\ndoes distinguish in a pretty sensible way, according to the\r\nnature and degree of the different perils incident to a given\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nFrom the simple case of walking we may proceed to the more\r\ncomplex cases of dealings with tangible objects of property. It\r\nmay be said that, generally speaking, a man meddles with such\r\nthings at his own risk. It does not [154] matter how honestly he\r\nmay believe that they belong to himself, or are free to the\r\npublic, or that he has a license from the owner, or that the case\r\nis one in which the law has limited the rights of ownership; he\r\ntakes the chance of how the fact may turn out, and if the fact is\r\notherwise than as he supposes, he must answer for his conduct. As\r\nhas been already suggested, he knows that he is exercising more\r\nor less dominion over property, or that he is injuring it; he\r\nmust make good his right if it is challenged.\r\n\r\nWhether this strict rule is based on the common grounds of\r\nliability, or upon some special consideration of past or present\r\npolicy, policy has set some limits to it, as was mentioned in the\r\nforegoing Lecture.\r\n\r\nAnother case of conduct which is at the risk of the party without\r\nfurther knowledge than it necessarily imports, is the keeping of\r\na tiger or bear, or other animal of a species commonly known to\r\nbe ferocious. If such an animal escapes and does damage, the\r\nowner is liable simply on proof that he kept it. In this instance\r\nthe comparative remoteness of the moment of choice in the line of\r\ncausation from the effect complained of, will be particularly\r\nnoticed. Ordinary cases of liability arise out of a choice which\r\nwas the proximate cause of the harm upon which the action is\r\nfounded. But here there is usually no question of negligence in\r\nguarding the beast. It is enough in most, if not in all cases,\r\nthat the owner has chosen to keep it. Experience has shown that\r\ntigers and bears are alert to find means of escape, and that, if\r\nthey escape, they are very certain to do harm of a serious\r\nnature. The possibility of a great danger has the same effect as\r\nthe probability of a less one, and the law throws the risk of\r\n[155] the venture on the person who introduces the peril into the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThis remoteness of the opportunity of choice goes far to show\r\nthat this risk is thrown upon the owner for other reasons than\r\nthe ordinary one of imprudent conduct. It has been suggested that\r\nthe liability stood upon remote inadvertence. /1/ But the law\r\ndoes not forbid a man to keep a menagerie, or deem it in any way\r\nblameworthy. It has applied nearly as strict a rule to dealings\r\nwhich are even more clearly beneficial to the community than a\r\nshow of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be one of those cases where the ground of liability\r\nis to be sought in policy coupled with tradition, rather than in\r\nany form of blameworthiness, or the existence of such a chance to\r\navoid doing the harm as a man is usually allowed. But the fact\r\nthat remote inadvertence has been suggested for an explanation\r\nillustrates what has been said about the difficulty of deciding\r\nwhether a given rule is founded on special grounds, or has been\r\nworked out within the sphere of negligence, when once a special\r\nrule has been laid down.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be noticed that there is no question of the\r\ndefendant's knowledge of the nature of tigers, although without\r\nthat knowledge he cannot be said to have intelligently chosen to\r\nsubject the community to danger. Here again even in the domain of\r\nknowledge the law applies its principle of averages. The fact\r\nthat tigers and bears are dangerous is so generally known, that\r\na man who keeps them is presumed to know their peculiarities. In\r\nother words, he does actually know that he has an animal with\r\ncertain teeth, claws, and so forth, and he must find out the\r\n[156] rest of what an average member of the community would know,\r\nat his peril.\r\n\r\nWhat is true as to damages in general done by ferocious wild\r\nbeasts is true as to a particular class of damages done by\r\ndomestic cattle, namely, trespasses upon another's land. This has\r\nbeen dealt with in former Lectures, and it is therefore needless\r\nto do more than to recall it here, and to call attention to the\r\ndistinction based on experience and policy between damage which\r\nis and that which is not of a kind to be expected. Cattle\r\ngenerally stray and damage cultivated land when they get upon it.\r\nThey only exceptionally hurt human beings.\r\n\r\nI need not recur to the possible historical connection of either\r\nof these last forms of liability with the noxoe deditio, because,\r\nwhether that origin is made out or not, the policy of the rule\r\nhas been accepted as sound, and carried further in England within\r\nthe last few years by the doctrine that a man who brings upon his\r\nland and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escape,\r\nmust keep it in at his peril. /1/ The strictness of this\r\nprinciple will vary in different jurisdictions, as the balance\r\nvaries between the advantages to the public and the dangers to\r\nindividuals from the conduct in question. Danger of harm to\r\nothers is not the only thing to be considered, as has been said\r\nalready. The law allows some harms to be intentionally inflicted,\r\nand a fortiori some risks to be intentionally run. In some\r\nWestern States a man is not required to keep his cattle fenced\r\nin. Some courts have refused to follow Rylands v. Fletcher. /2/\r\nOn the other hand, the principle has been applied to artificial\r\n[157] reservoirs of water, to cesspools, to accumulations of snow\r\nand ice upon a building by reason of the form of its roof, and to\r\nparty walls. /1/\r\n\r\nIn these cases, as in that of ferocious animals, it is no excuse\r\nthat the defendant did not know, and could not have found out,\r\nthe weak point from which the dangerous object escaped. The\r\nperiod of choice was further back, and, although he was not to\r\nblame, he was bound at his peril to know that the object was a\r\ncontinual threat to his neighbors, and that is enough to throw\r\nthe risk of the business on him.\r\n\r\nI now pass to cases one degree more complex than those so far\r\nconsidered. In these there must be another concomitant\r\ncircumstance known to the party in addition to those of which the\r\nknowledge is necessarily or practically proved by his conduct.\r\nThe cases which naturally suggest themselves again concern\r\nanimals. Experience as interpreted by the English law has shown\r\nthat dogs, rams, and bulls are in general of a tame and mild\r\nnature, and that, if any one of them does by chance exhibit a\r\ntendency to bite, butt, or gore, it is an exceptional phenomenon.\r\nHence it is not the law that a man keeps dogs, rams, bulls, and\r\nother like tame animals at his peril as to the personal damages\r\nwhich they may inflict, unless he knows or has notice that the\r\nparticular animal kept by him has the abnormal tendency which\r\nthey do sometimes show. The law has, however, been brought a\r\nlittle nearer to actual experience by statute in many\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\nNow let us go one step farther still. A man keeps an unbroken and\r\nunruly horse, knowing it to be so. That is not enough to throw\r\nthe risk of its behavior on him. The [158] tendency of the known\r\nwildness is not dangerous generally, but only under particular\r\ncircumstances. Add to keeping, the attempt to break the horse;\r\nstill no danger to the public is disclosed. But if the place\r\nwhere the owner tries to break it is a crowded thoroughfare, the\r\nowner knows an additional circumstance which, according to common\r\nexperience, makes this conduct dangerous, and therefore must take\r\nthe risk of what harm may be done. /1/ On the other hand, if a\r\nman who was a good rider bought a horse with no appearance of\r\nvice and mounted it to ride home, there would be no such apparent\r\ndanger as to make him answerable if the horse became unruly and\r\ndid damage. /2/ Experience has measured the probabilities and\r\ndraws the line between the two cases.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the true explanation of the rule applied to\r\nkeeping tigers, or the principle of Rylands v. Fletcher, in the\r\nlast cases we have entered the sphere of negligence, and, if we\r\ntake a case lying somewhere between the two just stated, and add\r\nsomewhat to the complexity of the circumstances, we shall find\r\nthat both conduct and standard would probably be left without\r\nmuch discrimination to the jury, on the broad issue whether the\r\ndefendant had acted as a prudent man would have done under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAs to wrongs called malicious or intentional it is not necessary\r\nto mention the different classes a second time, and to find them\r\na place in this series. As has been seen, they vary in the number\r\nof circumstances which must be known. Slander is conduct which is\r\nvery generally at the risk of [159] the speaker, because, as\r\ncharges of the kind with which it deals are manifestly\r\ndetrimental, the questions which practically arise for the most\r\npart concern the defence of truth or privilege. Deceit requires\r\nmore, but still simple facts. Statements do not threaten the harm\r\nin question unless they are made under such circumstances as to\r\nnaturally lead to action, and are made on insufficient grounds.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, without significance, that certain wrongs are\r\ndescribed in language importing intent. The harm in such cases is\r\nmost frequently done intentionally, if intent to cause a certain\r\nharm is shown, there need to prove knowledge of facts which made\r\nit that harm would follow. Moreover, it is often much easier to\r\nprove intent directly, than to prove the knowledge which would\r\nmake it unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which a man is treated as the responsible cause of a\r\ngiven harm, on the one hand, extend beyond those in which his\r\nconduct was chosen in actual contemplation of that result, and in\r\nwhich, therefore, he may be to have chosen to cause that harm;\r\nand, on the other hand, they do not extend to all instances where\r\nthe damages would not have happened but for some remote election\r\nhis part. Generally speaking, the choice will be found to have\r\nextended further than a simple act, and to co-ordinated acts into\r\nconduct. Very commonly it will have extended further still, to\r\nsome external consequence. But generally, also, it will be found\r\nto have stopped short of the consequence complained of.\r\n\r\nThe question in each case is whether the actual choice, or, in\r\nother words, the actually contemplated result, was near enough to\r\nthe remoter result complained of to throw the peril of it upon\r\nthe actor.\r\n\r\n[160] Many of the cases which have been put thus far are cases\r\nwhere the proximate cause of the loss was intended to be produced\r\nby the defendant. But it will be seen that the same result may be\r\ncaused by a choice at different points. For instance, a man is\r\nsued for having caused his neighbor's house to burn down. The\r\nsimplest case is, that he actually intended to burn it down. If\r\nso, the length of the chain of physical causes intervening is of\r\nno importance, and has no bearing on the case.\r\n\r\nBut the choice may have stopped one step farther back. The\r\ndefendant may have intended to light a fire on his own land, and\r\nmay not have intended to burn the house. Then the nature of the\r\nintervening and concomitant physical causes becomes of the\r\nhighest importance. The question will be the degree of danger\r\nattending the contemplated (and therefore chosen) effect of the\r\ndefendant's conduct under the circumstances known to him. If this\r\nwas very plain and very great, as, for instance, if his conduct\r\nconsisted in lighting stubble near a haystack close to the house,\r\nand if the manifest circumstances were that the house was of\r\nwood, the stubble very dry, and the wind in a dangerous quarter,\r\nthe court would probably rule that he was liable. If the\r\ndefendant lighted an ordinary fire in a fireplace in an adjoining\r\nhouse, having no knowledge that the fireplace was unsafely\r\nconstructed, the court would probably rule that he was not\r\nliable. Midway, complicated and doubtful cases would go to the\r\njury.\r\n\r\nBut the defendant may not even have intended to set the fire, and\r\nhis conduct and intent may have been simply to fire a gun, or,\r\nremoter still, to walk across a room, in doing which he\r\ninvoluntarily upset a bottle of acid. So that cases may go to the\r\njury by reason of the remoteness [161] of the choice in the\r\nseries of events, as well as because of the complexity of the\r\ncircumstances attending the act or conduct. The difference is,\r\nperhaps, rather dramatic than substantial.\r\n\r\nBut the philosophical analysis of every wrong begins by\r\ndetermining what the defendant has actually chosen, that is to\r\nsay, what his voluntary act or conduct has been, and what\r\nconsequences he has actually contemplated as flowing from them,\r\nand then goes on to determine what dangers attended either the\r\nconduct under the known circumstances, or its contemplated\r\nconsequence under the contemplated circumstances.\r\n\r\nTake a case like the glancing of Sir Walter Tyrrel's arrow. If an\r\nexpert marksman contemplated that the arrow would hit a certain\r\nperson, cadit qucoestio. If he contemplated that it would glance\r\nin the direction of another person, but contemplated no more than\r\nthat, in order to judge of his liability we must go to the end of\r\nhis fore-sight, and, assuming the foreseen event to happen,\r\nconsider what the manifest danger was then. But if no such event\r\nwas foreseen, the marksman must be judged by the circumstances\r\nknown to him at the time of shooting.\r\n\r\nThe theory of torts may be summed up very simply. At the two\r\nextremes of the law are rules determined by policy without\r\nreference of any kind to morality. Certain harms a man may\r\ninflict even wickedly; for certain others he must answer,\r\nalthough his conduct has been prudent and beneficial to the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nBut in the main the law started from those intentional wrongs\r\nwhich are the simplest and most pronounced cases, as well as the\r\nnearest to the feeling of revenge which leads to self-redress. It\r\nthus naturally adopted the vocabulary, [162] and in some degree\r\nthe tests, of morals. But as the law has grown, even when its\r\nstandards have continued to model themselves upon those of\r\nmorality, they have necessarily become external, because they\r\nhave considered, not the actual condition of the particular\r\ndefendant, but whether his conduct would have been wrong in the\r\nfair average member of the community, whom he is expected to\r\nequal at his peril.\r\n\r\nIn general, this question will be determined by considering the\r\ndegree of danger attending the act or conduct under the known\r\ncircumstances. If there is danger that harm to another will\r\nfollow, the act is generally wrong in the sense of the law.\r\n\r\nBut in some cases the defendant's conduct may not have been\r\nmorally wrong, and yet he may have chosen to inflict the harm, as\r\nwhere he has acted in fear of his life. In such cases he will be\r\nliable, or not, according as the law makes moral blameworthiness,\r\nwithin the limits explained above, the ground of liability, or\r\ndeems it sufficient if the defendant has had reasonable warning\r\nof danger before acting. This distinction, however, is generally\r\nunimportant, and the known tendency of the act under the known\r\ncircumstances to do harm may be accepted as the general test of\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of a given act to cause harm under given\r\ncircumstances must be determined by experience. And experience\r\neither at first hand or through the voice of the jury is\r\ncontinually working out concrete rules, which in form are still\r\nmore external and still more remote from a reference to the moral\r\ncondition of the defendant, than even the test of the prudent man\r\nwhich makes the first stage of the division between law and\r\nmorals. It does this in the domain [163] of wrongs described as\r\nintentional, as systematically as in those styled unintentional\r\nor negligent.\r\n\r\nBut while the law is thus continually adding to its specific\r\nrules, it does not adopt the coarse and impolitic principle that\r\na man acts always at his peril. On the contrary, its concrete\r\nrules, as well as the general questions addressed to the jury,\r\nshow that the defendant must have had at least a fair chance of\r\navoiding the infliction of harm before he becomes answerable for\r\nsuch a consequence of his conduct. And it is certainly arguable\r\nthat even a fair chance to avoid bringing harm to pass is not\r\nsufficient to throw upon a person the peril of his conduct,\r\nunless, judged by average standards, he is also to blame for what\r\nhe does.\r\n\r\n[164]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE V. -- THE BAILEE AT COMMON LAW.\r\n\r\nSo far the discussion has been confined to the general principles\r\nof liability, and to the mode of ascertaining the point at which\r\na man begins to act at his own peril. But it does not matter to a\r\nman whether he acts at his own peril or not, unless harm comes of\r\nit, and there must always be some one within reach of the\r\nconsequences of the act before any harm can be done. Furthermore,\r\nand more to the point, there are certain forms of harm which are\r\nnot likely to be suffered, and which can never be complained of\r\nby any one except a person who stands in a particular relation to\r\nthe actor or to some other person or thing. Thus it is neither a\r\nharm nor a wrong to take fish from a pond unless the pond is\r\npossessed or owned by some one, and then only to the possessor or\r\nowner. It is neither a harm nor a wrong to abstain from\r\ndelivering a bale of wool at a certain time and place, unless a\r\nbinding promise has been made so to deliver it, and then it is a\r\nwrong only to the promisee.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be done is to analyze those special relations\r\nout of which special rights and duties arise. The chief of\r\nthem--and I mean by the word \"relations\" relations of fact\r\nsimply--are possession and contract, and I shall take up those\r\nsubjects successively.\r\n\r\nThe test of the theory of possession which prevails in any system\r\nof law is to be found in its mode of dealing [165] who have a\r\nthing within their power, but not own it, or assert the position\r\nof an owner for with regard to it, bailees, in a word. It is\r\ntherefore, as a preliminary to understanding the common-law\r\ntheory of possession, to study the common law with regard to\r\nbailees.\r\n\r\nThe state of things which prevailed on the border between England\r\nand Scotland within recent times, and which is brought back in\r\nthe flesh by the ballad of the Fray O'Suport, is very like that\r\nwhich in an earlier century left its skeleton in the folk-laws of\r\nGermany and England. Cattle were the principal property known,\r\nand cattle-stealing the principal form of wrongful taking of\r\nproperty. Of law there was very little, and what there was\r\ndepended almost wholly upon the party himself to enforce. The\r\nSalic Law of the fifth century and the Anglo-Saxon laws of Alfred\r\nare very full in their directions about following the trail. If\r\nthe cattle were come up with before three days were gone, the\r\npursuer had the fight to take and keep them, subject only to\r\nswearing that he lost them against his will. If more than three\r\ndays went by before the cattle were found, the defendant might\r\nswear, if he could, to facts which would disprove the claimant's\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nThis procedure was in truth a legal procedure; but it depended\r\nfor its beginning and for its execution on the party making the\r\nclaim. From its \"executive\" nature, it could hardly have been\r\nstarted by any other than the person on the spot, in whose\r\nkeeping the cattle were. The oath was to the effect that the\r\nparty had lost possession against his will. But if all that a man\r\nhad to swear was that he had lost possession against his will, it\r\nis a natural conclusion that the right to take the oath and make\r\nuse of [166] the procedure depended on possession, and not on\r\nownership. Possession was not merely sufficient, but it was\r\nessential. Only he who was in possession could say that he had\r\nlost the property against his will, just as only he who was on\r\nthe spot could follow the cattle. /1/\r\n\r\nThis, so far as known, was the one means afforded by the early\r\nlaw of our race for the recovery of property lost against one's\r\nwill. So that, in a word, this procedure, modelled on the\r\nself-redress natural to the case which gave rise to it, was the\r\nonly remedy, was confined to the man in possession, and was not\r\nopen to the owner unless he was that man.\r\n\r\nTo this primitive condition of society has been traced a rule\r\nwhich maintained itself to later times and a more civilized\r\nprocedure, that, if chattels were intrusted by their owner to\r\nanother person, the bailee, and not the bailor, was the proper\r\nparty to sue for their wrongful appropriation by a third. It\r\nfollowed that if the bailee, or person [167] so intrusted, sold\r\nor gave the goods in his charge to another, the owner could only\r\nlook to the bailee, and could not sue the stranger; not from any\r\nprinciple in favor of trade, intended to protect those who bought\r\nin good faith from parties in possession, but because there was\r\nno form of action known which was open to him. But as the\r\nremedies were all in the bailee's hands, it also followed that he\r\nwas bound to hold his bailor harmless. If the goods were lost, it\r\nwas no excuse that they were stolen without his fault. He alone\r\ncould recover the lost property, and therefore he was bound to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time this reason ceased to exist. An owner out\r\nof possession could sue the wrongful taker of his property, as\r\nwell as one who had possession. But the strict liability of the\r\nbailee remained, as such rules do remain in the law, long after\r\nthe causes which gave rise to it had disappeared, and at length\r\nwe find cause and effect inverted. We read in Beaumanoir (A.D.\r\n1283) that, if a hired thing is stolen, the suit belongs to the\r\nbailee, because he is answerable to the person from whom he\r\nhired. /1/ At first the bailee was answerable to the owner,\r\nbecause he was the only person who could sue. Now it was said he\r\ncould sue because he was answerable to the owner.\r\n\r\nAll the above peculiarities reappear in the Anglo-Norman law, and\r\nfrom that day to this all kinds of bailees have been treated as\r\nhaving possession in a legal sense, as I shall presently show.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to prove the native origin of our law of\r\nbailment, in order that, when theory comes to be considered,\r\nmodern German opinion may not be valued at more than its true\r\nworth. The only existing theories on [168] the subject come from\r\nGermany. The German philosophers who have written upon law have\r\nknown no other system than the Roman, and the German lawyers who\r\nhave philosophized have been professors of Roman law. Some rules\r\nwhich we think clear are against what the German civilians would\r\nregard as first principles. To test the value of those\r\nprinciples, or at least to prevent the hasty assumption that they\r\nare universal, toward which there is a slight tendency among\r\nEnglish writers, it is well to realize that we are dealing with a\r\nnew system, of which philosophy has not yet taken account.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we find an action to recover stolen property,\r\nwhich, like the Salic procedure, was based on possession, not on\r\ntitle. Bracton says that one may sue for his chattel as stolen,\r\nby the testimony of good men, and that it does not matter whether\r\nthe thing thus taken was his own property or another's, provided\r\nit was in his custody. /1/\r\n\r\nThe point of especial importance, it will be remembered, was the\r\noath. The oath of the probi homines would seem from the letter of\r\nBracton to have been that the thing was lost (adirata), and this\r\nwe are expressly told was the fact in a report of the year 1294.\r\n\"Note that where a man's chattel is lost (ou la chosse de un home\r\nest endire), he may count that he [the finder] tortiously detains\r\nit, &c., and tortiously for this that whereas he lost the said\r\nthing on such a day, &c., he [the loser] came on such a day, &c.\r\n[169] (la vynt yl e en jour), and found it in the house of such\r\nan one, and told him, &c., and prayed him to restore the Sing,\r\nbut that he would not restore it, &c., to his damage, &c.; and if\r\nhe, &c. In this case, the demandant must prove (his own hand the\r\ntwelfth) that he lost the thing.\" /1/\r\n\r\nAssuming that as the first step we find a procedure kindred to\r\nthat of the early German folk-laws, the more important question\r\nis whether we find any principles similar to those which have\r\njust been explained. One of these, it will be remembered,\r\nconcerned wrongful transfer by the bailee. We find it laid down\r\nin the Year Books that, if I deliver goods to a bailee to keep\r\nfor me, and he sells or gives them to a stranger, the property is\r\nvested in the stranger by the gift, and I cannot maintain\r\ntrespass against him; but that I have a good remedy against the\r\nbailee by writ of detinue (for his failure to return the goods).\r\n/2/ These cases have been understood, and it would seem on the\r\nwhole rightly, not merely to deny trespass to the bailor, but any\r\naction whatever. Modern writers have added, however, the\r\ncharacteristically modern qualification, that the purchase must\r\nbe bona fide, and without notice. /3/ It may be answered, that\r\nthe proposition extends to gifts as well as to sales by the\r\nbailee, that there is no such condition in the old books, and\r\nthat it is contrary to the spirit of the strict doctrines of the\r\ncommon law to read it in. No lawyer needs to be told that, even\r\nso qualified, this is no [170] longer the law. /1/ The doctrine\r\nof the Year Books must be regarded as a survival from the\r\nprimitive times when we have seen the same rule in force, unless\r\nwe are prepared to believe that in the fifteenth century they had\r\na nicer feeling for the rights of bona fide purchasers than at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe next point in logical order would be the degree of\r\nresponsibility to which the bailee was held as towards his bailor\r\nwho intrusted him. But for convenience I will consider first the\r\nexplanation which was given of the bailee's right of action\r\nagainst third persons wrongfully taking the goods from his\r\npossession. The inverted explanation of Beaumanoir will be\r\nremembered, that the bailee could sue because he was answerable\r\nover, in place of the original rule, that he was answerable over\r\nso strictly because only he could sue. We find the same reasoning\r\noften repeated in the Year Books, and, indeed, from that day to\r\nthis it has always been one of the commonplaces of the law. Thus\r\nHankford, then a judge of the Common Bench, says (circa A.D.\r\n1410), /2/ \"If a stranger takes beasts in my custody, I shall\r\nhave a writ of trespass against him, and shall recover the value\r\nof the beasts, because I am chargeable for the beasts to my\r\nbailor, who has the property.\" There are cases in which this\r\nreasoning was pushed to the conclusion, that if, by the terms of\r\nthe trust, the bailee was not answerable for the goods if stolen,\r\nhe would not have an action against the thief. /3/ The same\r\nexplanation is repeated to this day. Thus we read in a well-\r\nknown textbook, [171] \"For the bailee being responsible to the\r\nbailor, if the goods be lost or damaged by negligence, or if he\r\ndo not deliver them up on lawful demand, it is therefore\r\nreasonable that he should have a right of action,\" &c. /1/ In\r\ngeneral, nowadays, a borrower or hirer of property is not\r\nanswerable if it is taken from him against his will, and if the\r\nreason offered were a true one, it would follow that, as he was\r\nnot answerable over, he could not sue the wrong-doer. It would\r\nonly be necessary for the wrong-doer to commit a wrong so gross\r\nas to free the bailee from responsibility, in order to deprive\r\nhim of his right of action. The truth is, that any person in\r\npossession, whether intrusted and answerable over or not, a\r\nfinder of property as well as a bailee, can sue any one except\r\nthe true owner for interfering with his possession, as will be\r\nshown more particularly at the end of the next Lecture.\r\n\r\nThe bailor also obtained a right of action against the wrong-doer\r\nat a pretty early date. It is laid down by counsel in 48 Edward\r\nIII., /2/ in an action of trespass by an agister of cattle, that,\r\n\"in this case, he who has the property may have a writ of\r\ntrespass, and he who has the custody another writ of trespass.\r\nPersay: Sir, it is true. But [172] he who recovers first shall\r\noust the other of the action, and so it shall be in many cases,\r\nas if tenant by elegit is ousted, each shall have the assize,\r\nand, if the one recover first, the writ of the other is abated,\r\nand so here.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem from other books that this was spoken of bailments\r\ngenerally, and was not limited to those which are terminable at\r\nthe pleasure of the bailor. Thus in 22 Edward IV., counsel say,\r\n\"If I bail to you my goods, and another takes them out of your\r\npossession, I shall have good action of trespass quare vi et\r\narmis.\" /1/ And this seems to have been Rolle's understanding in\r\nthe passage usually relied on by modern courts. /2/\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that some action should be given to the\r\nbailor as soon as the law had got machinery which could be worked\r\nwithout help from the fresh pursuit and armed hands of the\r\npossessor and his friends. To allow the bailor to sue, and to\r\ngive him trespass, were pretty nearly the same thing before the\r\naction on the case was heard of. Many early writs will be found\r\nwhich show that trespass had not always the clear outline which\r\nit developed later. The point which seems to be insisted on in\r\nthe Year Books is, as Brooke sums it up in the margin of his\r\nAbridgment, that two shall have an action for a single act,--not\r\nthat both shall have trespass rather than case. /3/ It should be\r\nadded that the Year Books quoted do not go beyond the case of a\r\nwrongful taking out of the custody of the bailee, the old case of\r\nthe folk-laws. /4/ Even thus [173] the right to maintain trespass\r\nis now denied where bailee has the exclusive right to the goods\r\nby lease or lien; /1/ although the doctrine has been repeated\r\nwith reference to bailments terminable at the pleasure of the\r\nbailor. /2/ But the modified rule does not concern the present\r\ndiscussion, any more than the earlier form, because it still\r\nleaves open the possessory remedies to all bailees without\r\nexception. This appears from the relation of the modified rule to\r\nthe ancient law; from the fact that Baron Parke, in the just\r\ncited case of Manders v. Williams, hints that he would have been\r\nprepared to apply the old rule to its full extent but for Gordon\r\nv. Harper, and still more obviously from the fact, that the\r\nbailee's right to trespass and trover is asserted in the same\r\nbreath with that of the bailor, as well as proved by express\r\ndecisions to be cited.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in Lotan v. Cross, /3/ Lord Ellenborough ruled at\r\nnisi prius that a lender could maintain trespass for damage done\r\nto a chattel in the hands of a borrower, and that the case is\r\noften cited as authority without remark. Indeed, it is sometimes\r\nlaid down generally, in reputable text-books, that a gratuitous\r\nbailment does not change the possession, but leaves it in the\r\nbailor; /4/ that a gratuitous bailee is quasi a servant of the\r\nbailor, and the possession of one is the possession of the other;\r\nand that it is for this reason that, although the bailee may sue\r\non [174] his possession, the bailor has the same actions. /1/ A\r\npart of this confusion has already been explained, and the rest\r\nwill be when I come to speak of servants, between whom and all\r\nbailees there is a broad and well-known distinction. But on\r\nwhatever ground Lotan v. Cross may stand, if on any, it cannot\r\nfor a moment be admitted that borrowers in general have not\r\ntrespass and trover. A gratuitous deposit for the sole benefit of\r\nthe depositor is a much stronger case for the denial of these\r\nremedies to the depositary; yet we have a decision by the full\r\ncourt, in which Lord Ellenborough also took part, that a\r\ndepositary has case, the reasoning implying that a fortiori a\r\nborrower would have trespass. And this has always been the law.\r\n/2/ It has been seen that a similar doctrine necessarily resulted\r\nfrom the nature of the early German procedure; and the cases\r\ncited in the note show that, in this as in other respects, the\r\nEnglish followed the traditions of their race.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the rule that all bailees have the possessory\r\nremedies is, that in the theory of the common law every bailee\r\nhas a true possession, and that a bailee recovers on the strength\r\nof his possession, just as a finder does, and as even a wrongful\r\npossessor may have full damages or a return of the specific thing\r\nfrom a stranger to the title. On the other hand, so far as the\r\npossessory actions are still allowed to bailors, it is not on the\r\nground that they also have possession, but is probably by a\r\nsurvival, which [175] explained, and which in the modern form of\r\nthe an anomaly. /1/ The reason usually given is, that a right of\r\nimmediate possession is sufficient,--a reason which the notion\r\nthat the bailor is actually possessed.\r\n\r\nThe point which is essential to understanding the common-law\r\ntheory of possession is now established: that all bailees from\r\ntime immemorial have been regarded by the English law as\r\npossessors, and entitled to the possessory remedies. It is not\r\nstrictly necessary to go on and complete the proof that our law\r\nof bailment is of pure German descent. But, apart from curiosity,\r\nthe doctrine remaining to be discussed has had such important\r\ninfluence upon the law of the present day, that I shall follow it\r\nout with some care. That doctrine was the absolute responsibility\r\nof the bailee to the bailor, if the goods were wrongfully taken\r\nfrom him. /2/\r\n\r\nThe early text-writers are not as instructive as might be hoped,\r\nowing to the influence of the Roman law. Glanvil, however, says\r\nin terms that, if a borrowed thing be destroyed or lost in any\r\nway while in the borrower's custody, he is absolutely bound to\r\nreturn a reasonable price. /3/ So does Bracton, who partially\r\nrepeats but modifies the language of Justinian as to commodatum,\r\ndepositum, and pignus; /4/ and as to the duty of the hirer to use\r\nthe care of a diligentissimus paterfamilias. /5/\r\n\r\n[176] The language and decisions of the courts are perfectly\r\nclear; and there we find the German tradition kept alive for\r\nseveral centuries. I begin with the time of Edward II., about\r\n1315. In detinue the plea was that the plaintiff delivered the\r\ndefendant a chest locked with his key, that the chattels were in\r\nthe chest, and that they were taken from the defendant together\r\nwith his own goods by robbery. The replication was that the goods\r\nwere delivered to the defendant out of enclosure, and Fitzherbert\r\nsays the party was driven to that issue; /1/ which implies that,\r\nif not in the chest, but in the defendant's custody, he was\r\nliable. Lord Holt, in Coggs v. Bernard, /2/ denies that the chest\r\nwould make any difference; but the old books agree that there is\r\nno delivery if the goods are under lock and key; and this is the\r\norigin of the distinction as to carriers breaking bulk in modern\r\ncriminal law. /3/ In the reign of Edward III., /4/ the case of a\r\npledge came up, which seems always to have been regarded as a\r\nspecial bailment to keep as one's own goods. The defence was,\r\nthat the goods were stolen with the defendant's own. The\r\nplaintiff was driven to reply a tender before the theft, which\r\nwould have put an end to the pledge, and left the defendant a\r\ngeneral bailee. /5/ Issue was taken thereon, which confirms the\r\nother cases, by implying that in that event the defendant would\r\nbe liable.\r\n\r\nNext I take a case of the time of Henry VI., A.D. 1455. /6/ [177]\r\nwas an action of debt against the Marshal of the Marshalsea, or\r\njailer of the King's Bench prison, for an escape of a prisoner.\r\nJailers in charge of prisoners were governed by the same law as\r\nbailees in charge of cattle. The body of the prisoner was\r\ndelivered to the jailer to keep under the same liabilities that\r\ncows or goods might have been. /1/ He set up in defence that\r\nenemies of the king broke into the prison and carried off the\r\nprisoner, against the will of the defendant. The question was\r\nwhether this was a good defence. The court said that, if alien\r\nenemies of the king, for instance the French, released the\r\nprisoner, or perhaps if the burning of the prison gave him a\r\nchance to escape, the excuse would be good, \"because then [the\r\ndefendant] has remedy against no one.\" But if subjects of the\r\nking broke the prison, the defendant would be liable, for they\r\nare not enemies, but traitors, and then, it is implied, the\r\ndefendant would have a right of action against them, and\r\ntherefore would himself be answerable. In this case the court got\r\nvery near to the original ground of liability, and distinguished\r\naccordingly. The person intrusted was liable in those cases where\r\nhe had a remedy over against the wrong-doer (and in which,\r\noriginally, he was the only person who had such a remedy); and,\r\non the other hand, his liability, being founded on that\r\ncircumstance, ceased where the remedy ceased. The jailer could\r\nnot sue the soldiers of an invading army of Frenchmen; but in\r\ntheory he could sue any British subject who carried off the\r\nprisoner, however little it was likely that he would get much\r\nsatisfaction in that way.\r\n\r\nA few years later the law is stated the same way by the famous\r\nLittleton. He says that, if goods are delivered to [178] a man,\r\nhe shall have an action of trespass if they are carried off, for\r\nhe is chargeable over. /1/ That is, he is bound to make the loss\r\ngood to the party who intrusted him.\r\n\r\nIn 9 Edward IV., /2/ Danby says if a bailee received goods to\r\nkeep as his proper goods, then robbery shall excuse him,\r\notherwise not. Again, in a later case /3/ robbery is said not to\r\nbe an excuse. There may have been some hesitation as to robbery\r\nwhen the robber was unknown, and so the bailee had no remedy\r\nover, /4/ or even as to robbery generally, on the ground that by\r\nreason of the felony the bailee could not go against either the\r\nrobber's body or his estate; for the one was hanged and the other\r\nforfeited. /5/ But there is not a shadow of doubt that the bailee\r\nwas not excused by an ordinary wrongful taking. \"If the goods are\r\ntaken by a trespasser, of whom the bailee has conusance, he shall\r\nbe chargeable to his bailor, and shall have his action over\r\nagainst his trespasser.\" /6/ The same point was touched in other\r\npassages of the Year Books, /7/ and the rule of law is clearly\r\nimplied by the reason which was given for the bailee's right to\r\nsue in the cases cited above.\r\n\r\nThe principle was directly decided in accordance with the ancient\r\nlaw in the famous case of Southcote v. Bennet. /8/ This was\r\ndetinue of goods delivered to the defendant to [179] keep safely.\r\nThe defendant confessed the delivery, and set up he was robbed of\r\nthe goods by J.S. \"And, after argument at the bar, Gawdy and\r\nClench, ceteris absentibus, held that the plaintiff ought to\r\nrecover, because it was not a special bailment; that the\r\ndefendant accepted them to keep as his proper goods, and not\r\notherwise; but it is a delivery, which chargeth him to keep them\r\nat his peril. And it is not any plea in a detinue to say that he\r\nwas robbed by one such; for he hath his remedy over by trespass,\r\nor appeal, to have them again.\" The above from Croke's report\r\nimplies, what Lord Coke expressly says, that \"to be kept, and to\r\nbe kept safe, is all one,\" and both reports agree that the\r\nobligation was founded on the delivery alone. Croke's report\r\nconfirms the caution which Lord Coke adds to his report: \"Note,\r\nreader, it is good policy for him who takes any goods to keep, to\r\ntake them in special manner, scil. to keep them as he keeps his\r\nown goods,... or if they happen to be stolen or purloined, that\r\nhe shall not be answerable for them; for he who accepted them\r\nought to take them in such or the like manner, or otherwise he\r\nmay be charged by his general acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nDown to this time, at least, it was clear law that, if a person\r\naccepted the possession of goods to keep for another even as a\r\nfavor, and lost them by wrongful taking, wholly without his\r\nfault, he was bound to make good the loss, unless when he took\r\npossession he expressly stipulated against such a responsibility.\r\nThe attempts of Lord Holt in Coggs v. Bernard, and of Sir William\r\nJones in his book on Bailments, to show that Southcote v. Bennet\r\nwas not sustained by authority, were futile, as any one who will\r\nStudy the Year Books for himself may see. The same principle was\r\nlaid down seven years before by Peryam, [180] C. B., in Drake v.\r\nRoyman, /1/ and Southcote's Case was followed as a leading\r\nprecedent without question for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nThus the circle of analogies between the English and the early\r\nGerman law is complete. There is the same procedure for lost\r\nproperty, turning on the single question whether the plaintiff\r\nhad lost possession against his will; the same principle that, if\r\nthe person intrusted with the property parted with it to another,\r\nthe owner could not recover it, but must get his indemnity from\r\nhis bailee; the same inverted explanation, that the bailee could\r\nsue because he was answerable over, but the substance of the true\r\ndoctrine in the rule that when he had no remedy he was not\r\nanswerable; and, finally, the same absolute responsibility for\r\nloss, even when happening without fault on the part of the person\r\nintrusted. The last and most important of these principles is\r\nseen in force as late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth. We have\r\nnow to follow its later fortunes.\r\n\r\nA common carrier is liable for goods which are stolen from him,\r\nor otherwise lost from his charge except by the act of God or the\r\npublic enemy. Two notions have been entertained with regard to\r\nthe source of this rule: one, that it was borrowed from the Roman\r\nlaw; /2/ the other, that it was introduced by custom, as an\r\nexception to the general law of bailment, in the reigns of\r\nElizabeth and James I. /3/\r\n\r\nI shall try to show that both these notions are wrong, that this\r\nstrict responsibility is a fragmentary survival from the general\r\nlaw of bailment which I have just explained; [181] the\r\nmodifications which the old law has undergone were due in part to\r\na confusion of ideas which came the displacement of detinue by\r\nthe action on the case, in part to conceptions of public policy\r\nwhich were read into the precedents by Lord Holt, and in part to\r\nstill later conceptions of policy which have been read into the\r\nreasonings of Lord Holt by later judges.\r\n\r\nSouthcote's Case was decided in the forty-third year of Queen\r\nElizabeth (A.D. 1601). I think the first mention of a carrier,\r\npertinent to the question, occurs in Woodlife's Case, /1/ decided\r\nfour or five years earlier (38 or 39 Eliz., A.D. 1596 or 1597).\r\nIt was an action of account for merchandise delivered to the\r\ndefendant, it would seem as a factor (\"pur\r\nmerchandizer\")--clearly not as a carrier. Plea, robbery at sea\r\nwith defendant's own goods. Gawdy, one of the judges who decided\r\nSouthcote's Case, thought the plea bad; but Popham, C. J. said\r\nthat, though it would not be a good plea for a carrier because he\r\nis paid for his carriage, there was a difference in this respect\r\nbetween carriers and other servants and factors.\r\n\r\nThis is repeated in Southcote's Case, and appears to involve a\r\ndouble distinction,--first between paid and unpaid bailees, next\r\nbetween bailees and servants. If the defendant was a servant not\r\nhaving control over the goods, he might not fall within the law\r\nof bailment, and factors are treated on the footing of servants\r\nin the early law.\r\n\r\nThe other diversity marked the entrance of the doctrine of\r\nconsideration into the law of bailment. Consideration originally\r\nmeant quid pro quo, as will be explained hereafter. It was thus\r\ndealt with in Doctor and Student /2/ when the principle was still\r\nyoung. Chief Justice [183] Popham probably borrowed his\r\ndistinction between paid and unpaid bailees from that work, where\r\ncommon carriers are mentioned as an example of the former class.\r\nA little earlier, reward made no difference. /1/\r\n\r\nBut in Woodlife's Case, in reply to what the Chief Justice had\r\nsaid, Gawdy cited the case of the Marshal of the King's Bench,\r\n/2/ stated above, whereupon Popham fell back on the old\r\ndistinction that the jailer had a remedy over against the rebels,\r\nbut that there was no remedy over in the case at bar.\r\n\r\nThe other cases relied on were some of those on general bailment\r\ncollected above; the same authorities, in short, on which\r\nSouthcote's Case was founded. The principle adopted was the same\r\nas in Southcote's Case, subject only to the question whether the\r\ndefendant fell within it. Nothing was said of any custom of the\r\nrealm, or ever had been in any reported case before this time;\r\nand I believe this to be the first instance in which carriers are\r\nin any way distinguished from any other class of persons\r\nintrusted with goods. There is no hint of any special obligation\r\npeculiar to them in the old books; and it certainly is not true,\r\nthat this case introduced one. It will be noticed, with reference\r\nto what follows, that Popham does not speak of common carriers,\r\nbut of carriers.\r\n\r\nNext came Southcote's Case /3/ (43 Eliz., A.D. 1601), which\r\npresented the old law pure and simple, irrespective of reward or\r\nany modern innovation. In this and the earlier instances of loss\r\nby theft, the action was detinue, counting, we may presume,\r\nsimply on a delivery and wrongful detainer.\r\n\r\n[183] But about this time important changes took place in the\r\nprocedure usually adopted, which must be explained. If the\r\nchattel could be returned in specie, detinue afforded no\r\nsatisfaction for damage which it might have suffered through the\r\nbailee's neglect. /1/ The natural remedy for such damage was the\r\naction on the case. But before this could be made entirely\r\nsatisfactory, there were certain difficulties to be overcome. The\r\nneglect which occasioned the damage might be a mere omission, and\r\nwhat was there akin to trespass in a nonfeasance to sustain the\r\nanalogy upon which trespass on the case was founded? Moreover, to\r\ncharge a man for not acting, you must show that it was his duty\r\nto act. As pleadings were formerly construed, it would not have\r\nbeen enough to allege that the plaintiff's goods were damaged by\r\nthe defendant's negligence. /2/ These troubles had been got over\r\nby the well-known words, super se assumpsit, which will be\r\nexplained later. Assumpsit did not for a long time become an\r\nindependent action of contract, and the allegation was simply the\r\ninducement to an action of tort. The ground of liability was that\r\nthe defendant had started upon the undertaking, so that his\r\nnegligent omission, which let in the damage, could be connected\r\nwith his acts as a part of his dealing with the thing. /3/ We\r\nshall find Lord Holt recognizing this original purport of\r\nassumpsit when we come to Coggs v. Bernard. Of course it was not\r\nconfined to cases of bailment.\r\n\r\nBut there was another way besides this by which the defendant\r\ncould be charged with a duty and made liable [184] in case, and\r\nwhich, although less familiar to lawyers, has a special bearing\r\non the law of carriers in later times. If damage had been done or\r\noccasioned by the act or omission of the defendant in the pursuit\r\nof some of the more common callings, such as that of a farrier,\r\nit seems that the action could be maintained, without laying an\r\nassumpsit, on the allegation that he was a \"common\" farrier. /1/\r\nThe latter principle was also wholly independent of bailment. It\r\nexpressed the general obligation of those exercising a public or\r\n\"common\" business to practise their art on demand, and show skill\r\nin it. \"For,\" as Fitzherbert says, \"it is the duty of every\r\nartificer to exercise his art rightly and truly as he ought.\" /2/\r\n\r\nWhen it had thus been established that case would lie for damage\r\nwhen occasioned by the omission, as well as when caused by the\r\nact, of the defendant, there was no reason for denying it, even\r\nif the negligent custody had resulted in the destruction of the\r\nproperty. /3/ From this it was but a step to extend the same form\r\nof action to all cases of loss by a bailee, and so avoid the\r\ndefendant's right to wage his law. Detinue, the primitive remedy,\r\nretained that mark of primitive procedure. The last extension was\r\nmade about the time of Southcote's Case. /4/ But when the [185]\r\nsame form of action thus came to be used alike for damage or\r\ndestruction by the bailee's neglect and for loss by a wrong-doer\r\nagainst whom the bailee had a remedy over, a source was opened\r\nfor confusion with regard to the foundation and nature of the\r\ndefendant's duty.\r\n\r\nIn truth, there were two sets of duties,--one not peculiar to\r\nbailees, arising from the assumpsit or public calling of the\r\ndefendant, as just explained; the other, the ancient obligation,\r\npeculiar to them as such, of which Southcote's Case was an\r\nexample. But any obligation of a bailee might be conceived of as\r\npart of a contract of bailment, after assumpsit had become\r\nappropriated to contract, the doctrine of consideration had been\r\ndeveloped, (both of which had happened in Lord Coke's time,) it\r\nseemed unnecessary to distinguish nicely between the two sets of\r\nduties just mentioned, provided a consideration and special\r\npromise could be alleged. Furthermore, as formerly the\r\ndefendant's public calling had the same effect as an assumpsit\r\nfor the purpose of charging him in tort, it seems now to have\r\nbeen thought an equally good substitute for a special promise, in\r\norder to charge him in assumpsit. In Rogers v. Head, /1/ the\r\nargument was, that to charge one in assumpsit you must show\r\neither his public calling at the time of the delivery, or a\r\nspecial promise on sufficient consideration. This argument\r\nassumes that a bailee who received goods in the course of a\r\npublic employment, [186] for instance as a common carrier, could\r\nbe charged in this form of action for a breach of either of the\r\nabove sets of duties, by alleging either his public calling or\r\nhis reward and a special promise. It seems to have been admitted,\r\nas was repeatedly decided before and since that case, that one\r\nwho was not a common carrier could have been charged for\r\nnon-delivery in a special action; that is, in case as\r\ndistinguished from assumpsit.\r\n\r\nSuppose, next, that the plaintiff sued in case for a tort. As\r\nbefore, the breach of duty complained of might be such damage to\r\nproperty as had always been sued for in that form of action, or\r\nit might be a loss by theft for which detinue would formerly have\r\nbeen brought, and which fell on the bailee only by reason of the\r\nbailment. If the goods had been stolen, the bailee's liability\r\nrested neither on his common calling nor on his assumpsit and his\r\nneglect, but arose from the naked facts that he had accepted a\r\ndelivery and that the goods were gone, and in such cases it ought\r\nto have been enough to allege those facts in the declaration. /1/\r\nBut it was very natural that the time-honored foundations for the\r\naction on the case in its more limited application should still\r\nbe laid in the pleadings, even after the scope of the action had\r\nbeen enlarged. We shall have to inquire, later, whether the\r\nprinciples of Southcote's Case were not also extended in the\r\nopposite direction to cases not falling within it. The reasons\r\nfor the rule which it laid down had lost their meaning centuries\r\nbefore Gawdy and Clench were born, when owners had acquired the\r\nright to sue for the wrongful taking of property in the hands\r\n[187] and the rule itself was a dry precedent likely to be\r\nfollowed according to the letter because the spirit had departed.\r\nIt had begun to totter when the reporter cautioned bailees to\r\naccept in such terms as to get rid of it. /1/\r\n\r\nAccordingly, although that decision was the main authority relied\r\non for the hundred years between it and Coggs v. Bernard whenever\r\na peculiar responsibility was imposed upon bailees, we find that\r\nsometimes an assumpsit was laid as in the early precedents, /2/\r\nor more frequently that the bailee was alleged to be a common\r\nbargeman, or common carrier, or the like, without much reference\r\nto the special nature of the tort in question; and that the true\r\nbearing of the allegation was sometimes lost sight of. At first,\r\nhowever, there were only some slight signs of confusion in the\r\nlanguage of one or two cases, and if the duty was conceived to\r\nfall within the principle of Southcote's Case, pleaders did not\r\nalways allege the common or public calling which was held\r\nunnecessary. /3/ But they also adopted other devices from the\r\nprecedents in case, or to strengthen an obligation which they did\r\nnot well understand. Chief Justice Popham had sanctioned a\r\ndistinction between paid and unpaid bailees, hence it was deemed\r\nprudent to lay a reward. Negligence was of course averred; and\r\nfinally it became frequent to allege an obligation by the law and\r\ncustom of the realm. This last deserves a little further\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThere is no writ in the Register alleging any special obligation\r\nof common carriers by the custom of the realm. But the writ\r\nagainst innkeepers did lay a duly \"by the [188] law and custom of\r\nEngland,\" and it was easy to adopt the phrase. The allegation did\r\nnot so much imply the existence of a special principle, as state\r\na proposition of law in the form which was then usual. There are\r\nother writs of trespass which allege a common-law duty in the\r\nsame way, and others again setting forth a statutory obligation.\r\n/1/ So \"the judges were sworn to execute justice according to law\r\nand the custom of England.\" /2/\r\n\r\nThe duties of a common carrier, so far as the earlier evidence\r\ngoes, were simply those of bailees in general, coupled with the\r\nliabilities generally attached to the exercise of a public\r\ncalling. The word \"common\" addressed itself only to the latter\r\npoint, as has been shown above. This is further illustrated by\r\nthe fact that, when the duty was thus set forth, it was not\r\nalleged as an obligation peculiar to common carriers as such, but\r\nwas laid as the custom of law of common hoymen, or lightermen,\r\n&c., according to the business of the party concerned. It will be\r\nnoticed that Chief Justice Holt in Coggs v. Bernard states the\r\nliability as applicable to all bailees for reward, exercising a\r\npublic employment, and mentions common hoymen and masters of\r\nships alongside of, not as embraced under, common carriers. It\r\nwill also be noticed in the cases before that time, that there is\r\nno settled formula for the obligation in question, but that it is\r\nset forth in each case that the defendant was answerable for what\r\nhe was said to have done or omitted in the particular instance.\r\n/3/\r\n\r\n[189] Returning now to the succession of the cases, Rich v.\r\nKneeland is the next in order (11 Jac. I., A.D. 1613). It was an\r\naction on the case (tort), against a common hoyman. In Croke's\r\nreport nothing is said of custom; but the declaration avers that\r\nthe defendant was a common bargeman, that the plaintiff delivered\r\nhim a portmanteau, &c. to carry, and paid him for it, and that\r\nthe defendant tam negligenter custodivit, that it was taken from\r\nhim by persons unknown,--like the second count in Morse v. Slue,\r\nbelow. The plea was demurred to, and adjudged for the plaintiff.\r\nA writ of error being brought, it was assigned that \"this action\r\nlies not against a common bargeman without special promise. But\r\nall the Justices and Barons held, that it well lies as against a\r\ncommon carrier upon the land.\" If we follow this report, it seems\r\nat the first glance that importance was attributed to the common\r\ncalling. But as the loss was clearly within the principle of\r\nSouthcote's Case, which required neither special promise nor\r\ncommon calling for its application, and which remained\r\nunquestioned law for three quarters of a century later, the court\r\nmust have referred to the form of action employed (case), and not\r\nto the liability of the defendant in some form of action\r\n(detinue). The objection was that \"this action lies not,\" not\r\nthat the defendant not liable, \"without special promise.\" Even\r\nthus narrowed, it rather countenances the notion that allegations\r\nwhich were necessary to charge a man for damage happening through\r\nhis neglect, in the more ancient and use of this action, were\r\nalso necessary in this new [190] extension of it to a different\r\nclass of wrongs. As it was now pretty clear that case would lie\r\nfor a nonfeasance, the notion was mistaken, and we shall see that\r\nit was denied in subsequent decisions. /1/\r\n\r\nAccording to Hobart's report, it was alleged that the defendant\r\nwas a common hoyman, to carry goods by water, for hire, &c., that\r\nby the custom of England such carriers ought to keep the goods,\r\n&c., so as they should not be lost by the default of them or\r\ntheir servants, &c. \"And it was resolved that, though it was laid\r\nas a custom of the realm, yet indeed it is common law.\" This last\r\nresolution may only mean that the custom of the realm and the\r\ncommon law are the same thing, as had been said concerning\r\ninnkeepers long before. /2/ But the law as to innkeepers, which\r\nwas called the custom of the realm in the writ, had somewhat the\r\nair of a special principle extending beyond the law of bailment,\r\ninasmuch as their liability extended to goods within the inn, of\r\nwhich they had not the custody, and the court may have meant to\r\nmake an antithesis between such a special principle and the\r\ncommon law or general law of bailment governing the present case.\r\n\r\nWhatever doubts some of Croke's language might raise, standing\r\nalone, the fact remains indisputable, that for nearly a century\r\nfrom Woodlife's Case the liability of carriers for loss of goods,\r\nwhether the custom of the realm or the defendant's common calling\r\nwas alleged or not, was placed upon the authority and was\r\nintended to be decided on the principle of Southcote's Case.\r\n\r\n[191] Symons v. Darknell 1 (4 Car. I., A.D. 1628) is precisely in\r\npoint. The declaration was, that, by the common law, every\r\nlighterman ought so to manage his lighter that the goods carried\r\ntherein should not perish. \"And although no promise laid, it\r\nseemed to the court that the plaintiff should recover; and not\r\nalleging that defendant was common lighterman was no harm. Hyde,\r\nC. J., delivery makes the contract.\" This did not mean that\r\ndelivery was a good consideration for a promise; but, as was laid\r\ndown in Southcote's Case, that delivery, without a special\r\nacceptance to keep only as one's own goods, bound the bailee to\r\nkeep safely, and therefore made it unnecessary to allege either\r\nan assumpsit or the defendant's common calling. Whitlock, J.\r\ncalled attention to the fact that the action was tort, not\r\ncontract. \"Et en cest case... Southcote's Case fuit cite.\"\r\n\r\nThe same rule is stated as to bailments in general, the same\r\nyear, by Sergeant Maynard arguendo in Williams v. Hide, /2/ again\r\nciting Southcote's Case.\r\n\r\nIn Kenrig v. Eggleston /3/ (24 Car. I., A.D. 1648), \"case against\r\na country carrier for not delivering a box,\" &c., of which he was\r\nrobbed, nothing was said about custom, nor being a common\r\ncarrier, unless the above words imply that he was; but it was\r\nlaid down, as in Southcote's Case, that \"it must come on the\r\ncarrier's part acceptance\" if he would lessen his liability as\r\nbailee.\r\n\r\nNichols v. Moore /4/ (13 Car. II., A.D. 1661) was case against a\r\n\"water carrier,\" between Hull and London, laying a delivery to\r\nhim at York. It was moved in arrest of [192] judgment, that the\r\ndefendant did not undertake to carry the goods from York to Hull.\r\n\"But notwithstanding this per totam curiam, the defendant shall\r\nbe charged on his general receipt at York, according to\r\nSouthcote's Case.\"\r\n\r\nIt is fair to mention that in Matthews v. Hopkins /1/ (17 Car.\r\nII.)the declaration was on the custom of the realm against a\r\ncommon carrier, and there was a motion in arrest of judgment,\r\nbecause there was a misrecital of the custom of the realm, and\r\nthe defendant was not alleged to have been a carrier at the time\r\nof the receipt, and also because counts in trover, and in case on\r\nthe custom, were joined. Judgment was arrested, it would seem on\r\nthe latter ground, but the court continued: \"And, although the\r\ndeclaration may be good without recital of the custom of the\r\nrealm, as Hobart says, still it is the better way to recite it.\"\r\n\r\nWe now come to the great case of Morse v. Slue /2/ (23 & 24 Car.\r\nII., A.D. 1671, 1672). This was an action against the master of a\r\nship lying in the river Thames, for the loss of goods intrusted\r\nto him. The goods in question were taken away by robbers, and it\r\nwas found that the ship had the usual guard at the time. There\r\nseem to have been two counts, one on the law and custom of\r\nEngland (1 Vent. 190), for masters of ships \"carefully to govern,\r\npreserve, and defend goods shipped, so long as said ship should\r\nremain in the river Thames\" (2 Keb. 866); \"to keep safely [goods\r\nshipped to be carried from London beyond sea] without loss or\r\nsubtraction, ita quodpro defectu of them they may not come to any\r\ndamage\" (1 Vent. 190); \"to keep safely goods delivered to them to\r\ncarry, dangers [193] of the sea excepted\" (2 Levinz, 69; the\r\nexception last was perhaps drawn by the reporter from the usual\r\nbills of lading referred to in argument). The second count, which\r\nis usually overlooked, was a special count \"on delivery and being\r\nstolen by his neglect.\" /1/\r\n\r\nThe case was twice argued, and all the reports agree, as far as\r\nthey go, in their statements of the points insisted on.\r\n\r\nHolt, for the plaintiff, maintained: /2/ 1. That the master\r\nreceives goods generally, citing Southcote's Case, and that in\r\n\"only guardian in socage who hath the custody by law, who factor\r\nwho is servant at the master's dispose, and so cannot take care,\r\nare exempt.\" 2. That the master has a reward for his keeping, and\r\nis therefore a proper person to be sued. 3. That the master has a\r\nremedy over, citing the case of the Marshal of the King's Bench.\r\n/3/ That the mischief would be great if the master were not\r\nliable, as merchants put their trust in him, and no particular\r\ndefault be shown, as appears by the bill of lading, and, finally,\r\nthat neglect appeared.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, it was urged that no neglect was found, and\r\nthat the master was only a servant; so that, if any one was\r\nliable, the owners were. /4/ It was also suggested that, as there\r\nwould have been no liability if the goods had been taken at sea,\r\nwhen the case would have within the admiralty law, it was absurd\r\nthat a different rule should govern the beginning of the voyage\r\nfrom would have governed the rest of it. /5/\r\n\r\n[194] On the second argument, it was again maintained for the\r\nplaintiff that the defendant was liable \"at the common law on the\r\ngeneral bailment,\" citing Southcote's Case, and also that, by the\r\nRoman and maritime law, he was liable as a public carrier and\r\nmaster of a ship.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by Chief Justice Hale. It\r\nwas held that, the ship being within the body of the county, the\r\nadmiralty law did not apply; or, according to 1 Mod. 85, note a,\r\n\"the master could not avail himself of the rules of the civil\r\nlaw, by which masters are not chargeable pro damno fatali\"; that\r\nthe master was liable to an action because he took a reward; that\r\n\"he might have made a caution for himself, which he omitting and\r\ntaking in the goods generally, he shall answer for what happens.\"\r\n/1/ The case of Kenrig v. Eggleston /2/ seems also to have been\r\nreferred to. It was further said that the master was rather an\r\nofficer than a servant, and in effect received his wages from the\r\nmerchant who paid freight. Finally, on the question of\r\nnegligence, that it was not sufficient to have the usual number\r\nof men to guard the ship, but that it was neglect not to have\r\nenough to guard the goods, unless in case of the common enemies,\r\nciting the case of the Marshal, which it will be remembered was\r\nmerely the principle of Southcote's Case and the common law of\r\nbailment in another form. /3/\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this case did not go on any special\r\ncustom, either as to common carriers or shipmasters, but that all\r\nthe arguments and the opinion of the court assumed that, if the\r\ncase was to be governed by the common law, and not by the milder\r\nprovisions of the civil [195] law relied on for the defence, and\r\nif the defendant could be regarded as a bailee, and not merely a\r\nservant of the owners, then the general law of bailment would\r\napply, and the defendant would be charged, as in Southcote's\r\nCase, \"by his general acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed, however, that so enlightened a judge\r\nas Sir Matthew Hale would not have broken away the Year Books, if\r\na case had arisen before him where property had been received as\r\na pure favor to the plaintiff, without consideration or reward,\r\nand was taken from the defendant by robbery. Such a case was\r\ntried before Chief Justice Pemberton, and he very sensibly ruled\r\nthat no action lay, declining to follow the law of Lord Coke's\r\ntime to such extreme results /1/ (33 Car. II., A.D. 1681).\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, the defendant's common calling began to\r\nassume a new importance. The more important alternative\r\nallegation, the assumpsit, had the effect in the end of\r\nintroducing the not intrinsically objectionable doctrine that all\r\nduties arising from a bailment are founded on contract. /2/ But\r\nthis allegation, having now a special action to which it had\r\ngiven rise, was not much used where the action was tort, while\r\nthe other averment occurs with increasing frequency. The notion\r\nwas evidently gaining ground that the liability of common\r\ncarriers for loss of [196] goods, whatever the cause of the loss\r\nmight be, arose from a special principle peculiar to them, and\r\nnot applicable to bailees in general. The confusion of\r\nindependent duties which has been explained, and of which the\r\nfirst trace was seen in Rich v. Kneeland, was soon to become\r\ncomplete. /1/ Holt became Chief Justice. Three of the cases in\r\nthe last note were rulings of his. In Lane v. Cotton /2/ (13\r\nWill. III., A.D. 1701), he showed his disapproval of Southcote's\r\nCase, and his impression that the common law of bailment was\r\nborrowed from Rome. The overthrow of Southcote's Case and the old\r\ncommon law may be said to date from Coggs v. Bernard /3/ (2 Anne,\r\nA.D. 1703). Lord Holt's famous opinion in the latter case quotes\r\nlargely from the Roman law as it filtered to him through Bracton;\r\nbut, whatever influence that may have had upon his general views,\r\nthe point decided and the distinctions touching common carriers\r\nwere of English growth.\r\n\r\nThe action did not sound in contract. The cause was for damage to\r\nthe goods, and the plaintiff sued for a tort, laying an assumpsit\r\nby way of inducement to a charge of negligence, as in the days of\r\nHenry VI. The plea was not guilty. But after verdict for the\r\nplaintiff, there was a motion in arrest of judgment, \"for that it\r\nwas not alleged in the declaration that the defendant was a\r\ncommon porter, nor averred that he had anything for his pains.\"\r\nConsideration was never alleged or thought of in the primitive\r\nassumpsit, but in the modern action of contract in that form [197]\r\nit was required. Hence, it was inferred that, wherever an\r\nassumpsit was laid, even in all action of tort for damage to\r\nproperty, it was the allegation of a contract, and that a\r\nconsideration must be shown for the undertaking, although the\r\ncontrary had been decided in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. /1/\r\nBut the motion did not prevail, and judgment was given for the\r\nplaintiff. Lord Holt was well aware that the use of an assumpsit\r\nwas not confined to contract. It is true that he said, \"The\r\nowner's trusting [the defendant] with the goods is a sufficient\r\nconsideration to oblige him to a careful management,\" or to\r\nreturn them; but this means as distinguished from a consideration\r\nsufficient to oblige him to carry them, which he thought the\r\ndefendant would not have been bound to do. He then expressly\r\nsays, \"This is a different case, for assumpsit does not only\r\nsignify a future agreement, but, in such cases as this, it\r\nsignifies an actual entry upon the thing and taking the trust\r\nupon himself\"; following the earlier cases in the Year Books. /2/\r\nThis was enough for the decision, and the rule in Southcote's\r\nCase had nothing to do with the matter. But as the duty of common\r\ncarriers by reason of their calling was now supposed to extend to\r\nall kinds of losses, and the doctrine of Southcote's Case was\r\nprobably supposed to extend to many kinds of damage, it became\r\nnecessary, in a general discussion, to reconcile or elect between\r\nthe two principles.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice therefore proceeded to distinguish between\r\n[198] bailees for reward exercising a public employment, such as\r\ncommon carriers, common hoymen, masters of ships, &c., and other\r\nbailees; denied the rule in Southcote's Case as to the latter;\r\nsaid that the principle of strict responsibility was confined to\r\nthe former class, and was applied to them on grounds of public\r\npolicy, and that factors were exonerated, not because they were\r\nmere servants, as had always been laid down (among others, by\r\nhimself in arguing Morse v. Slue), but because they were not\r\nwithin the reason of the rule.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has followed the argument so far, will hardly need\r\nto be convinced that this did not mean the adoption of the\r\nPraetor's Edict. There is further evidence at hand if required.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as we have seen, there was a century of\r\nprecedents ending with Morse v. Slue, argued by Holt himself, in\r\nwhich the liability of masters of ships, hoymen, carriers, &c.\r\nhad been adjudicated. Morse v. Slue is cited and relied on, and\r\nthere is no hint of dissatisfaction with the other cases. On the\r\ncontrary, they furnished the examples of bailees for reward\r\nexercising a public calling. The distinction between bailees for\r\nreward and others is Chief Justice Popham's; the latter\r\nqualification (exercising a public calling) was also English, as\r\nhas partly appeared already, and as will be explained further on.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the strict rule is not confined to nautae,\r\ncaupones, and stabularii, nor even to common carriers; but is\r\napplied to all bailees for reward, exercising a public calling.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the degree of responsibility is precisely that\r\nof bailees in general, as worked out by the previous decisions;\r\nbut quite unlike and much more severe [199] than that imposed by\r\nthe Roman law, as others have observed. /1/\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the exemption from liability for acts of God or the\r\npublic enemy is characteristically English, as will be proved\r\nfurther on.\r\n\r\nBut it has been partially shown in this Lecture that the law of\r\nto-day has made the carrier's burden heavier than it was in the\r\ntime of the Year Books. Southcote's Case, and the earlier\r\nauthorities which have been cited, all refer to a loss by\r\nrobbery, theft, or trespass, and hold the bailee liable, where,\r\nin theory at least, he has a remedy over. It was with reference\r\nto such cases, as has been seen, that the rule arose, although it\r\nis not improbable that it would have been applied to an\r\nunexplained loss; the writ against innkeepers reads absque\r\nsubtractionie seu amissione custodire. In later times, the\r\nprinciple may have been extended from loss by theft to loss by\r\ndestruction. In Symons v. Darknoll /2/ (4 Car. I.), already cited\r\nas decided on the authority of Southcote's Case, the goods were\r\nspoiled, not stolen, and probably had not even perished in\r\nspecie. Before this time, the old rule had become an arbitrary\r\nprecedent, followed according to its form with little thought of\r\nits true intent.\r\n\r\nThe language of Coggs v. Bernard is, that \"the law charges the\r\nperson thus intrusted to carry goods as against all events but\r\nacts of God and the enemies of the king.\" This was adopted by\r\nsolemn decision in Lord Mansfield's time, and it is now settled\r\nthat the common carrier \"is liable for all losses which do not\r\nfall within the excepted [200] cases.\" /1/ That is to say, he has\r\nbecome an insurer to that extent, not only against the\r\ndisappearance or destruction, but against all forms of damage to\r\nthe goods except as excepted above.\r\n\r\nThe process by which this came to pass has been traced above, but\r\na few words may be added here. The Year Books, even in dealing\r\nwith the destruction (as distinguished from the conversion) of\r\nchattels in the hands of a bailee, always state his liability as\r\nbased upon his fault, although it must be admitted that the\r\nlanguage is used alio intuitu. /2/ A jettison, in tempest, seems\r\nto have been a good plea for a factor in the time of Edward III.;\r\n/3/ but that cannot be relied on for an analogy. The argument\r\nfrom the Marshal's case /4/ is stronger. There it appears to have\r\nbeen thought that burning of the prison was as good an excuse for\r\nan escape as a release by alien enemies. This must refer to an\r\naccidental fire, and would seem to imply that he was not liable\r\nin that event, if not in fault. The writs in the Register against\r\nbailees to keep or carry goods, all have the general allegation\r\nof negligence, and so do the older precedents of declarations, so\r\nfar as I have observed, whether stating the custom of the realm\r\nor not. /5/ But a bailee was answerable for goods wrongfully\r\ntaken from him, as an innkeeper was for goods stolen from his\r\ninn, irrespective of negligence. /6/\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Marshal's case speaks of his negligent [201]\r\nkeeping when the prisoners were released by rebels, (although\r\nthat was far less likely to result from negligence, one would\r\nthink, than a fire in the prison,) and that after Lord Coke's\r\ntime negligence was alleged, although the goods had been lost by\r\nwrongful taking. So the writ against innkeepers is pro defectu\r\nhujusmodi hospitatorum. In these instances, neglect only means a\r\nfailure de facto to keep safely. As was said at a much later\r\ndate, \"everything is a negligence in a carrier or hoyman that the\r\nlaw does not excuse.\" /1/ The allegation is simply the usual\r\nallegation of actions on the case, and seems to have extended\r\nitself from the earlier declarations for damage, when case\r\nsupplanted detinue and the use of the former action became\r\nuniversal. It can hardly have been immaterial to the case for\r\nwhich it was first introduced. But the short reason for\r\ndisbelieving that there was any warrant in the old law for making\r\nthe carrier an insurer against damage is, that there seem to be\r\nno early cases in which bailees were held to such a\r\nresponsibility, and that it was not within the principle on which\r\nthey were made answerable for a loss by theft.\r\n\r\nHaving traced the process by which a common carrier has been made\r\nan insurer, it only remains to say a word upon the origin of the\r\nadmitted exceptions from the risk assumed. It has been seen\r\nalready how loss by the public enemy came to be mentioned by\r\nChief Justice Holt. It is the old distinction taken in the\r\nMarshal's case that there the bailee has no remedy over.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the act of God, it was a general principle, not\r\npeculiar to carriers nor to bailees, that a duty was [202]\r\ndischarged if an act of God made it impossible of performance.\r\nLord Coke mentions the case of jettison from a Gravesend barge,\r\n/1/ and another of a party bound to keep and maintain sea-walls\r\nfrom overflowing, as subject to the same limitation, /2/ and a\r\nsimilar statement as to contracts in general will be found in the\r\nYear Books. /3/ It is another form of the principle which has\r\nbeen laboriously reargued in our own day, that parties are\r\nexcused from the performance of a contract which has become\r\nimpossible before breach from the perishing of the thing, or from\r\nchange of circumstances the continued existence of which was the\r\nfoundation of the contract, provided there was no warranty and no\r\nfault on the part of the contractor. Whether the act of God has\r\nnow acquired a special meaning with regard to common carriers may\r\nbe left for others to consider.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the foregoing evidence, that we cannot determine\r\nwhat classes of bailees are subject to the strict responsibility\r\nimposed on common carriers by referring to the Praetor's Edict\r\nand then consulting the lexicons under Nautoe, Caupones, or\r\nStabularii. The question of precedent is simply to what extent\r\nthe old common law of bailment still survives. We can only answer\r\nit by enumerating the decisions in which the old law is applied;\r\nand we shall find it hard to bring them together under a general\r\nprinciple. The rule in Southcote's Case has been done away with\r\nfor bailees in general: that is clear. But it is equally clear\r\nthat it has not maintained itself, even within the limits of the\r\npublic policy invented by Chief Justice [203] Holt. It is not\r\ntrue to-day that all bailees for reward exercising a public\r\ncalling are insurers. No such doctrine is applied to\r\ngrain-elevators or deposit-vaults. /1/\r\n\r\nHow Lord Holt came to distinguish between bailees for reward and\r\nothers has been shown above. It is more pertinent here to notice\r\nthat his further qualification, exercising a public calling, was\r\npart of a protective system which has passed away. One adversely\r\ninclined might say that it was one of many signs that the law was\r\nadministered in the interest of the upper classes. It has been\r\nshown above that if a man was a common farrier he could be\r\ncharged for negligence without an assumpsit. The same judge who\r\nthrew out that intimation established in another case that he\r\ncould be sued if he refused to shoe a horse on reasonable\r\nrequest. /2/ Common carriers and common innkeepers were liable in\r\nlike case, and Lord Holt stated the principle: \"If a man takes\r\nupon him a public employment, he is bound to serve the public as\r\nfar as the employment extends, and for refusal an action lies.\"\r\n/3/ An attempt to apply this doctrine generally at the present\r\nday would be thought monstrous. But it formed part of a\r\nconsistent scheme for holding those who followed useful callings\r\nup to the mark. Another part was the liability of persons\r\nexercising a public employment for loss or damage, enhanced in\r\ncases of bailment by what remained of the rule in Southcote's\r\nCase. The scheme has given way to more liberal notions; but the\r\ndisjecta membra still move.\r\n\r\nLord Mansfield stated his views of public policy in terms [204]\r\nnot unlike those used by Chief Justice Holt in Coggs v. Bernard,\r\nbut distinctly confines their application to common carriers.\r\n\"But there is a further degree of responsibility by the custom of\r\nthe realm, that is, by the common law; a carrier is in the nature\r\nof an insurer.... To prevent litigation, collusion, and the\r\nnecessity of going into circumstances impossible to be\r\nunravelled, the law presumes against the carrier, unless,\" &c.\r\n/1/\r\n\r\nAt the present day it is assumed that the principle is thus\r\nconfined, and the discussion is transferred to the question who\r\nare common carriers. It is thus conceded, by implication, that\r\nLord Holt's rule has been abandoned. But the trouble is, that\r\nwith it disappear not only the general system which we have seen\r\nthat Lord Holt entertained, but the special reasons repeated by\r\nLord Mansfield. Those reasons apply to other bailees as well as\r\nto common carriers. Besides, hoymen and masters of ships were not\r\noriginally held because they were common carriers, and they were\r\nall three treated as co-ordinate species, even in Coggs v.\r\nBernard, where they were mentioned only as so many instances of\r\nbailees exercising a public calling. We do not get a new and\r\nsingle principle by simply giving a single name to all the cases\r\nto be accounted for. If there is a sound rule of public policy\r\nwhich ought to impose a special responsibility upon common\r\ncarriers, as those words are now understood, and upon no others,\r\nit has never yet been stated. If, on the other hand, there are\r\nconsiderations which apply to a particular class among those so\r\ndesignated,--for instance, to railroads, who may have a private\r\nindividual at their mercy, or exercise a power too vast for the\r\ncommon welfare,--we do not prove that the [205] reasoning extends\r\nto a general ship or a public cab by calling all three common\r\ncarriers.\r\n\r\nIf there is no common rule of policy, and common carriers remain\r\na merely empirical exception from general doctrine, courts may\r\nwell hesitate to extend the significance of those words.\r\nFurthermore, notions of public policy which would not leave\r\nparties free to make their own bargains are somewhat discredited\r\nin most departments of the law. /1/ Hence it may perhaps be\r\nconcluded that, if any new case should arise, the degree of\r\nresponsibility, and the validity and interpretation of any\r\ncontract of bailment that there may be, should stand open to\r\nargument on general principles, and that the matter has been set\r\nat large so far as early precedent is concerned.\r\n\r\nI have treated of the law of carriers at greater length than is\r\nproportionate, because it seems to me an interesting example of\r\nthe way in which the common law has grown up, and, especially,\r\nbecause it is an excellent illustration of the principles laid\r\ndown at the end of the first Lecture. I now proceed to the\r\ndiscussion for the sake of which an account of the law of\r\nbailment was introduced, and to which an understanding of that\r\npart of the law is a necessary preliminary.\r\n\r\n[206]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE VI. -- POSSESSION.\r\n\r\nPOSSESSION is a conception which is only less important than\r\ncontract. But the interest attaching to the theory of possession\r\ndoes not stop with its practical importance in the body of\r\nEnglish law. The theory has fallen into the hands of the\r\nphilosophers, and with them has become a corner-stone of more\r\nthan one elaborate structure. It will be a service to sound\r\nthinking to show that a far more civilized system than the Roman\r\nis framed upon a plan which is irreconcilable with the a priori\r\ndoctrines of Kant and Hegel. Those doctrines are worked out in\r\ncareful correspondence with German views of Roman law. And most\r\nof the speculative jurists of Germany, from Savigny to Ihering,\r\nhave been at once professors of Roman law, and profoundly\r\ninfluenced if not controlled by some form of Kantian or\r\npost-Kantian philosophy. Thus everything has combined to give a\r\nspecial bent to German speculation, which deprives it of its\r\nclaim to universal authority.\r\n\r\nWhy is possession protected by the law, when the possessor is not\r\nalso an owner? That is the general problem which has much\r\nexercised the German mind. Kant, it is well known, was deeply\r\ninfluenced in his opinions upon ethics and law by the\r\nspeculations of Rousseau. Kant, Rousseau, and the Massachusetts\r\nBill of Rights agree that all men are born free and equal, and\r\none or the other branch of that declaration has afforded the\r\nanswer to the [207] question why possession should be protected\r\nfrom that day to this. Kant and Hegel start from freedom. The\r\nfreedom of the will, Kant said, is the essence of man. It is an\r\nend in itself; it is that which needs no further explanation,\r\nwhich is absolutely to be respected, and which it is the very end\r\nand object of all government to realize and affirm. Possession is\r\nto be protected because a man by taking possession of an object\r\nhas brought it within the sphere of his will. He has extended his\r\npersonality into or over that object. As Hegel would have said,\r\npossession is the objective realization of free will. And by\r\nKant's postulate, the will of any individual thus manifested is\r\nentitled to absolute respect from every other individual, and can\r\nonly be overcome or set aside by the universal will, that is, by\r\nthe state, acting through its organs, the courts.\r\n\r\nSavigny did not follow Kant on this point. He said that every act\r\nof violence is unlawful, and seemed to consider protection of\r\npossession a branch of protection to the person. /1/ But to this\r\nit was answered that possession was protected against disturbance\r\nby fraud as well as by force, and his view is discredited. Those\r\nwho have been contented with humble grounds of expediency seem to\r\nhave been few in number, and have recanted or are out of favor.\r\n\r\nThe majority have followed in the direction pointed out by Kant.\r\nBruns, an admirable writer, expresses a characteristic yearning\r\nof the German mind, when he demands an internal juristic\r\nnecessity drawn from the nature of possession itself, and\r\ntherefore rejects empirical reasons. /2/ He finds the necessity\r\nhe seeks in the freedom of the human will, which the whole legal\r\nsystem does but recognize [208] and carry out. Constraint of it\r\nis a wrong, which must be righted without regard to conformity of\r\nthe will to law, and so on in a Kantian vein. /1/ So Gans, a\r\nfavorite disciple of Hegel, \"The will is of itself a substantial\r\nthing to be protected, and this individual will has only to yield\r\nto the higher common will.\" /2/ So Puchta, a great master, \"The\r\nwill which wills itself, that is, the recognition of its own\r\npersonality, is to be protected.\" /3/\r\n\r\nThe chief variation from this view is that of Windscheid, a\r\nwriter now in vogue. He prefers the other branch of the\r\ndeclaration in the Bill of Rights. He thinks that the protection\r\nto possession stands on the same grounds as protection against\r\ninjuria, that every one is the equal of every other in the state,\r\nand that no one shall raise himself over the other. /4/ Ihering,\r\nto be sure, a man of genius, took an independent start, and said\r\nthat possession is ownership on the defensive; and that, in favor\r\nof the owner, he who is exercising ownership in fact (i. e. the\r\npossessor) is freed from the necessity of proving title against\r\none who is in an unlawful position. But to this it was well\r\nanswered by Bruns, in his later work, that it assumes the title\r\nof disseisors to be generally worse than that of disseisees,\r\nwhich cannot be taken for granted, and which probably is not true\r\nin fact. /5/\r\n\r\nIt follows from the Kantian doctrine, that a man in possession is\r\nto be confirmed and maintained in it until he is put out by an\r\naction brought for the purpose. Perhaps [209] another fact\r\nbesides those which have been mentioned has influenced this\r\nreasoning, and that is the accurate division between possessory\r\nand petitory actions or defences in Continental procedure. /1/\r\nWhen a defendant in a possessory action is not allowed to set up\r\ntitle in himself, a theorist readily finds a mystical importance\r\nin possession.\r\n\r\nBut when does a man become entitled to this absolute protection?\r\nOn the principle of Kant, it is not enough that he has the\r\ncustody of a thing. A protection based on the sacredness of man's\r\npersonality requires that the object should have been brought\r\nwithin the sphere of that personality, that the free will should\r\nhave unrestrainedly set itself into that object. There must be\r\nthen an intent to appropriate it, that is, to make it part of\r\none's self, or one's own.\r\n\r\nHere the prevailing view of the Roman law comes in to fortify\r\nprinciple with precedent. We are told that, of the many who might\r\nhave the actual charge or custody of a thing, the Roman law\r\nrecognized as possessor only the owner, or one holding as owner\r\nand on his way to become one by lapse of time. In later days it\r\nmade a few exceptions on practical grounds. But beyond the\r\npledgee and the sequester (a receiver appointed by the court)\r\nthese exceptions are unimportant and disputed. /2/ Some of the\r\nRoman jurists state in terms that depositaries and borrowers have\r\nnot possession of the things intrusted to them. /3/ Whether the\r\nGerman interpretation of the sources goes too far or not, it must\r\nbe taken account of in the examination of German theories.\r\n\r\n[210] Philosophy by denying possession to bailees in general\r\ncunningly adjusted itself to the Roman law, and thus put itself\r\nin a position to claim the authority of that law for the theory\r\nof which the mode of dealing with bailees was merely a corollary.\r\nHence I say that it is important to show that a far more\r\ndeveloped, more rational, and mightier body of law than the\r\nRoman, gives no sanction to either premise or conclusion as held\r\nby Kant and his successors.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the English law has always had the good sense\r\n/1/ to allow title to be set up in defence to a possessory\r\naction. In the assize of novel disseisin, which which was a true\r\npossessory action, the defendant could always rely on his title.\r\n/2/ Even when possession is taken or kept in a way which is\r\npunished by the criminal law, as in case of forcible entry and\r\ndetainer, proof of title allows the defendant to retain it, and\r\nin many cases has been held an answer to an action of trespass.\r\nSo in trespass for taking goods the defendant may set up title in\r\nhimself. There might seem to be a trace of the distinction in the\r\ngeneral rule, that the title cannot be tried in trespass quare\r\nclausum. But this is an exception commonly put on the ground that\r\nthe judgment cannot change the property, as trespass for chattels\r\nor trover can. /3/ The rule that you cannot go into title in a\r\npossessory action presupposes great difficulty in the proof, the\r\nprobatio diabolica of the Canon law, delays in the process, and\r\nimportance of possession [211] ad interim,--all of which mark a\r\nstage of society which has long been passed. In ninety-nine cases\r\nout of a hundred, it is about as easy and cheap to prove at least\r\na prima facie title as it is to prove possession.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, and this was the importance of the last\r\nLecture to this subject, the common law has always given the\r\npossessory remedies to all bailees without exception. The right\r\nto these remedies extends not only to pledgees, lessees, and\r\nthose having a lien, who exclude their bailor, but to simple\r\nbailees, as they have been called, who have no interest in the\r\nchattels, no right of detention as against the owner, and neither\r\ngive nor receive a reward. /1/\r\n\r\nModern German statutes have followed in the same path so far as\r\nto give the possessory remedies to tenants and some others. Bruns\r\nsays, as the spirit of the Kantian theory required him to say,\r\nthat this is a sacrifice of principle to convenience. /2/ But I\r\ncannot see what is left of a principle which avows itself\r\ninconsistent with convenience and the actual course of\r\nlegislation. The first call of a theory of law is that it should\r\nfit the facts. It must explain the observed course of\r\nlegislation. And as it is pretty certain that men will make laws\r\nwhich seem to them convenient without troubling themselves very\r\nmuch what principles are encountered by their legislation, a\r\nprinciple which defies convenience is likely to wait some time\r\nbefore it finds itself permanently realized.\r\n\r\nIt remains, then, to seek for some ground for the protection of\r\npossession outside the Bill of Rights or the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, which shall be consistent with the larger scope\r\ngiven to the conception in modern law.\r\n\r\n[212] The courts have said but little on the subject. It was laid\r\ndown in one case that it was an extension of the protection which\r\nthe law throws around the person, and on that ground held that\r\ntrespass quare clausum did not pass to an assignee in bankruptcy.\r\n/1/ So it has been said, that to deny a bankrupt trover against\r\nstrangers for goods coming to his possession after his bankruptcy\r\nwould be \"an invitation to all the world to scramble for the\r\npossession of them\"; and reference was made to \"grounds of policy\r\nand convenience.\" /2/ I may also refer to the cases of capture,\r\nsome of which will be cited again. In the Greenland\r\nwhale-fishery, by the English custom, if the first striker lost\r\nhis hold on the fish, and it was then killed by another, the\r\nfirst had no claim; but he had the whole if he kept fast to the\r\nwhale until it was struck by the other, although it then broke\r\nfrom the first harpoon. By the custom in the Gallipagos, on the\r\nother hand, the first striker had half the whale, although\r\ncontrol of the line was lost. /3/ Each of these customs has been\r\nsustained and acted on by the English courts, and Judge Lowell\r\nhas decided in accordance with still a third, which gives the\r\nwhale to the vessel whose iron first remains in it, provided\r\nclaim be made before cutting in. /4/ The ground as put by Lord\r\nMansfield is simply that, were it not for such customs, there\r\nmust be a sort of warfare perpetually subsisting between the\r\nadventurers. /5/ If courts adopt different rules on similar\r\nfacts, according to the point at which men will fight in the\r\n[213] several cases, it tends, so far as it goes, to shake an a\r\npriori theory of the matter.\r\n\r\nThose who see in the history of law the formal expression of the\r\ndevelopment of society will be apt to think that the proximate\r\nground of law must be empirical, even when that ground is the\r\nfact that a certain ideal or theory of government is generally\r\nentertained. Law, being a practical thing, must found itself on\r\nactual forces. It is quite enough, therefore, for the law, that\r\nman, by an instinct which he shares with the domestic dog, and of\r\nwhich the seal gives a most striking example, will not allow\r\nhimself to be dispossessed, either by force or fraud, of what he\r\nholds, without trying to get it back again. /1/ Philosophy may\r\nfind a hundred reasons to justify the instinct, but it would be\r\ntotally immaterial if it should condemn it and bid us surrender\r\nwithout a murmur. As long as the instinct remains, it will be\r\nmore comfortable for the law to satisfy it in an orderly manner,\r\nthan to leave people to themselves. If it should do otherwise, it\r\nwould become a matter for pedagogues, wholly devoid of reality.\r\n\r\nI think we are now in a position to begin the analysis of\r\npossession. It will be instructive to say a word in the first\r\nplace upon a preliminary question which has been debated with\r\nmuch zeal in Germany. Is possession a fact or a right? This\r\nquestion must be taken to mean, by possession and right, what the\r\nlaw means by those words, and not something else which\r\nphilosophers or moralists may mean by them; for as lawyers we\r\nhave nothing to do with either, except in a legal sense. If this\r\nhad always been borne steadily in mind, the question would hardly\r\nhave been asked.\r\n\r\n[214] A legal right is nothing but a permission to exercise\r\ncertain natural powers, and upon certain conditions to obtain\r\nprotection, restitution, or compensation by the aid of the public\r\nforce. Just so far as the aid of the public force is given a man,\r\nhe has a legal right, and this right is the same whether his\r\nclaim is founded in righteousness or iniquity. Just so far as\r\npossession is protected, it is as much a source of legal rights\r\nas ownership is when it secures the same protection.\r\n\r\nEvery right is a consequence attached by the law to one or more\r\nfacts which the law defines, and wherever the law gives any one\r\nspecial rights not shared by the body of the people, it does so\r\non the ground that certain special facts, not true of the rest of\r\nthe world, are true of him. When a group of facts thus singled\r\nout by the law exists in the case of a given person, he is said\r\nto be entitled to the corresponding rights; meaning, thereby,\r\nthat the law helps him to constrain his neighbors, or some of\r\nthem, in a way in which it would not, if all the facts in\r\nquestion were not true of him. Hence, any word which denotes such\r\na group of facts connotes the rights attached to it by way of\r\nlegal consequences, and any word which denotes the rights\r\nattached to a group of facts connotes the group of facts in like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe word \"possession\" denotes such a group of facts. Hence, when\r\nwe say of a man that he has possession, we affirm directly that\r\nall the facts of a certain group are true of him, and we convey\r\nindirectly or by implication that the law will give him the\r\nadvantage of the situation. Contract, or property, or any other\r\nsubstantive notion of the law, may be analyzed in the same way,\r\nand should be treated in the same order. The only difference is,\r\nthat, [215] while possession denotes the facts and connotes the\r\nconsequence, property always, and contract with more uncertainty\r\nand oscillation, denote the consequence and connote the facts.\r\nWhen we say that a man owns a thing, we affirm directly that he\r\nhas the benefit of the consequences attached to a certain group\r\nof facts, and, by implication, that the facts are true of him.\r\nThe important thing to grasp is, that each of these legal\r\ncompounds, possession, property, and contract, is to be analyzed\r\ninto fact and right, antecedent and consequent, in like manner as\r\nevery other. It is wholly immaterial that one element is accented\r\nby one word, and the other by the other two. We are not studying\r\netymology, but law. There are always two things to be asked:\r\nfirst, what are the facts which make up the group in question;\r\nand then, what are the consequences attached by the law to that\r\ngroup. The former generally offers the only difficulties.\r\n\r\nHence, it is almost tautologous to say that the protection which\r\nthe law attaches by way of consequence to possession, is as truly\r\na right in a legal sense as those consequences which are attached\r\nto adverse holding for the period of prescription, or to a\r\npromise for value or under seal. If the statement is aided by\r\ndramatic reinforcement, I may add that possessory rights pass by\r\ndescent or devise, as well as by conveyance, /1/ and that they\r\nare taxed as property in some of the States. /2/\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to analyze possession as understood by the\r\ncommon law. In order to discover the facts which constitute it,\r\nit will be found best to study them at the moment when possession\r\nis first gained. For then they must [216] all be present in the\r\nsame way that both consideration and promise must be present at\r\nthe moment of making a contract. But when we turn to the\r\ncontinuance of possessory rights, or, as is commonly said, the\r\ncontinuance of possession, it will be agreed by all schools that\r\nless than all the facts required to call those rights into being\r\nneed continue presently true in order to keep them alive.\r\n\r\nTo gain possession, then, a man must stand in a certain physical\r\nrelation to the object and to the rest of the world, and must\r\nhave a certain intent. These relations and this intent are the\r\nfacts of which we are in search.\r\n\r\nThe physical relation to others is simply a relation of\r\nmanifested power coextensive with the intent, and will need to\r\nhave but little said about it when the nature of the intent is\r\nsettled. When I come to the latter, I shall not attempt a similar\r\nanalysis to that which has been pursued with regard to intent as\r\nan element of liability. For the principles developed as to\r\nintent in that connection have no relation to the present\r\nsubject, and any such analysis so far as it did not fail would be\r\nlittle more than a discussion of evidence. The intent inquired\r\ninto here must be overtly manifested, perhaps, but all theories\r\nof the grounds on which possession is protected would seem to\r\nagree in leading to the requirement that it should be actual,\r\nsubject, of course, to the necessary limits of legal\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nBut, besides our power and intent as towards our fellow-men,\r\nthere must be a certain degree of power over the object. If there\r\nwere only one other man in the world, and he was safe under lock\r\nand key in jail, the person having the key would not possess the\r\nswallows that flew over the prison. This element is illustrated\r\nby cases of capture, [217] although no doubt the point at which\r\nthe line is drawn is affected by consideration of the degree of\r\npower obtained as against other people, as well as by that which\r\nhas been gained over the object. The Roman and the common law\r\nagree that, in general, fresh pursuit of wild animals does not\r\ngive the pursuer the rights of possession. Until escape has been\r\nmade impossible by some means, another may step in and kill or\r\ncatch and carry off the game if he can. Thus it has been held\r\nthat an action does not lie against a person for killing and\r\ntaking a fox which had been pursued by another, and was then\r\nactually in the view of the person who had originally found,\r\nstarted, and chased it. /1/ The Court of Queen's Bench even went\r\nso far as to decide, notwithstanding a verdict the other way,\r\nthat when fish were nearly surrounded by a seine, with an opening\r\nof seven fathoms between the ends, at which point boats were\r\nstationed to frighten them from escaping, they were not reduced\r\nto possession as against a stranger who rowed in through the\r\nopening and helped himself. /2/ But the difference between the\r\npower over the object which is sufficient for possession, and\r\nthat which is not, is clearly one of degree only, and the line\r\nmay be drawn at different places at different times on grounds\r\njust referred to. Thus we are told that the legislature of New\r\nYork enacted, in 1844, that any one who started and pursued deer\r\nin certain counties of that State should be deemed in possession\r\nof the game so long as he continued in fresh pursuit of it, /3/\r\nand to that extent modified the New York decisions just cited.\r\nSo, while Justinian decided that a wild beast so [218] badly\r\nwounded that it might easily be taken must be actually taken\r\nbefore it belongs to the captors, /1/ Judge Lowell, with equal\r\nreason, has upheld the contrary custom of the American whalemen\r\nin the Arctic Ocean, mentioned above, which gives a whale to the\r\nvessel whose iron first remains in it, provided claim be made\r\nbefore cutting in. /2/\r\n\r\nWe may pass from the physical relation to the object with these\r\nfew examples, because it cannot often come into consideration\r\nexcept in the case of living and wild things. And so we come to\r\nthe intent, which is the really troublesome matter. It is just\r\nhere that we find the German jurists unsatisfactory, for reasons\r\nwhich I have already explained. The best known theories have been\r\nframed as theories of the German interpretation of the Roman law,\r\nunder the influence of some form of Kantian or post-Kantian\r\nphilosophy. The type of Roman possession, according to German\r\nopinion, was that of an owner, or of one on his way to become\r\nowner. Following this out, it was said by Savigny, the only\r\nwriter on the subject with whom English readers are generally\r\nacquainted, that the animus domini, or intent to deal with the\r\nthing as owner, is in general necessary to turn a mere physical\r\ndetention into juridical possession. /3/ We need not stop to\r\ninquire whether this modern form or the [Greek characters]\r\n(animus dominantis, animus dominandi) of Theophilus /4/ and the\r\nGreek sources is more exact; for either excludes, as the\r\ncivilians and canonists do, and as the [219] German theories\r\nmust, most bailees and termors from the list of possessors. /1/\r\n\r\nThe effect of this exclusion as interpreted by the Kantian\r\nphilosophy of law, has been to lead the German lawyers to\r\nconsider the intent necessary to possession as primarily\r\nself-regarding. Their philosophy teaches them that a man's\r\nphysical power over an object is protected because he has the\r\nwill to make it his, and it has thus become a part of his very\r\nself, the external manifestation of his freedom. /2/ The will of\r\nthe possessor being thus conceived as self-regarding, the intent\r\nwith which he must hold is pretty clear: he must hold for his own\r\nbenefit. Furthermore, the self-regarding intent must go to the\r\nheight of an intent to appropriate; for otherwise, it seems to be\r\nimplied, the object would not truly be brought under the\r\npersonality of the possessor.\r\n\r\nThe grounds for rejecting the criteria of the Roman law have been\r\nshown above. Let us begin afresh. Legal duties are logically\r\nantecedent to legal rights. What may be their relation to moral\r\nrights if there are any, and whether moral rights are not in like\r\nmanner logically the offspring of moral duties, are questions\r\nwhich do not concern us here. These are for the philosopher, who\r\napproaches the law from without as part of a larger series of\r\nhuman manifestations. The business of the jurist is to make known\r\nthe content of the law; that is, to work upon it from within, or\r\nlogically, arranging and distributing it, in order, from its\r\nstemmum genus to its infima species, so far as practicable. Legal\r\nduties then come before legal [220] rights. To put it more\r\nbroadly, and avoid the word duty, which is open to objection, the\r\ndirect working of the law is to limit freedom of action or choice\r\non the part of a greater or less number of persons in certain\r\nspecified ways; while the power of removing or enforcing this\r\nlimitation which is generally confided to certain other private\r\npersons, or, in other words, a right corresponding to the burden,\r\nis not a necessary or universal correlative. Again, a large part\r\nof the advantages enjoyed by one who has a right are not created\r\nby the law. The law does not enable me to use or abuse this book\r\nwhich lies before me. That is a physical power which I have\r\nwithout the aid of the law. What the law does is simply to\r\nprevent other men to a greater or less extent from interfering\r\nwith my use or abuse. And this analysis and example apply to the\r\ncase of possession, as well as to ownership.\r\n\r\nSuch being the direct working of the law in the case of\r\npossession, one would think that the animus or intent most nearly\r\nparallel to its movement would be the intent of which we are in\r\nsearch. If what the law does is to exclude others from\r\ninterfering with the object, it would seem that the intent which\r\nthe law should require is an intent to exclude others. I believe\r\nthat such an intent is all that the common law deems needful, and\r\nthat on principle no more should be required.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether this is not simply the animus domini\r\nlooked at from the other side. If it were, it would nevertheless\r\nbe better to look at the front of the shield than at the reverse.\r\nBut it is not the same if we give to the animus domini the\r\nmeaning which the Germans give it, and which denies possession to\r\nbailees in general. The intent to appropriate or deal with a\r\nthing as owner can [221] hardly exist without an intent to\r\nexclude others, and something more; but the latter may very well\r\nbe where there is no intent to hold as owner. A tenant for years\r\nintends to exclude all persons, including the owner, until the\r\nend of his term; yet he has not the animus domini in the sense\r\nexplained. Still less has a bailee with a lien, who does not even\r\nmean to use, but only to detain the thing for payment. But,\r\nfurther, the common law protects a bailee against strangers, when\r\nit would not protect him against the owner, as in the case of a\r\ndeposit or other bailment terminable at pleasure; and we may\r\ntherefore say that the intent even to exclude need not be so\r\nextensive as would be implied in the animus domini. If a bailee\r\nintends to exclude strangers to the title, it is enough for\r\npossession under our law, although he is perfectly ready to give\r\nthe thing up to its owner at any moment; while it is of the\r\nessence of the German view that the intent must not be relative,\r\nbut an absolute, self-regarding intent to take the benefit of the\r\nthing. Again, if the motives or wishes, and even the intentions,\r\nmost present to the mind of a possessor, were all self-regarding,\r\nit would not follow that the intent toward others was not\r\nthe important thing in the analysis of the law. But, as we\r\nhave seen, a depositary is a true possessor under the common-law\r\ntheory, although his intent is not self-regarding, and he holds\r\nsolely for the benefit of the owner.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of cases besides those of bailees and tenants,\r\nwhich will probably, although not necessarily, be decided one way\r\nor the other, as we adopt the test of an intent to exclude, or of\r\nthe animus domini. Bridges v. Hawkesworth /1/ will serve as a\r\nstarting-point. There, [222] a pocket-book was dropped on the\r\nfloor of a shop by a customer, and picked up by another customer\r\nbefore the shopkeeper knew of it. Common-law judges and civilians\r\nwould agree that the finder got possession first, and so could\r\nkeep it as against the shopkeeper. For the shopkeeper, not\r\nknowing of the thing, could not have the intent to appropriate\r\nit, and, having invited the public to his shop, he could not have\r\nthe intent to exclude them from it. But suppose the pocket-book\r\nhad been dropped in a private room, how should the case be\r\ndecided? There can be no animus domini unless the thing is known\r\nof; but an intent to exclude others from it may be contained in\r\nthe larger intent to exclude others from the place where it is,\r\nwithout any knowledge of the object's existence.\r\n\r\nIn McAvoy v. Medina, /1/ a pocket-book had been left upon a\r\nbarber's table, and it was held that the barber had a better\r\nright than the finder. The opinion is rather obscure. It takes a\r\ndistinction between things voluntarily placed on a table and\r\nthings dropped on the floor, and may possibly go on the ground\r\nthat, when the owner leaves a thing in that way, there is an\r\nimplied request to the shopkeeper to guard it, which will give\r\nhim a better right than one who actually finds it before him.\r\nThis is rather strained, however, and the court perhaps thought\r\nthat the barber had possession as soon as the customer left the\r\nshop. A little later, in a suit for a reward offered to the\r\nfinder of a pocket-book, brought by one who discovered it where\r\nthe owner had left it, on a desk for the use of customers in a\r\nbank outside the teller's counter, the same court said that this\r\nwas not the finding of a lost article, and that \"the occupants of\r\nthe banking house, and not [223] the plaintiff, were the proper\r\ndepositaries of an article so left.\" /1/ This language might\r\nseem to imply that the plaintiff was not the person who got\r\npossession first after the defendant, and that, although the\r\nfloor of a shop may be likened to a street, the public are to be\r\ndeemed excluded from the shop's desks, counters, and tables\r\nexcept for the specific use permitted. Perhaps, however, the case\r\nonly decides that the pocket-book was not lost within the\r\ncondition of the offer.\r\n\r\nI should not have thought it safe to draw any conclusion from\r\nwreck cases in England, which are mixed up with questions of\r\nprescription and other rights. But the precise point seems to\r\nhave been adjudicated here. For it has been held that, if a stick\r\nof timber comes ashore on a man's land, he thereby acquires a\r\n\"right of possession\" as against an actual finder who enters for\r\nthe purpose of removing it. /2/ A right of possession is said to\r\nbe enough for trespass; but the court seems to have meant\r\npossession by the phrase, inasmuch as Chief Justice Shaw states\r\nthe question to be which of the parties had \"the preferable\r\nclaim, by mere naked possession, without other title,\" and as\r\nthere does not seem to have been any right of possession in the\r\ncase unless there was actual possession.\r\n\r\nIn a criminal case, the property in iron taken from the bottom of\r\na canal by a stranger was held well laid in the canal company,\r\nalthough it does not appear that the company knew of it, or had\r\nany lien upon it. /3/\r\n\r\n[224] The only intent concerning the thing discoverable in such\r\ninstances is the general intent which the occupant of land has to\r\nexclude the public from the land, and thus, as a consequence, to\r\nexclude them from what is upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Roman lawyers would probably have decided all these cases\r\ndifferently, although they cannot be supposed to have worked out\r\nthe refined theories which have been built upon their remains.\r\n/1/\r\n\r\nI may here return to the case of goods in a chest delivered under\r\nlock and key, or in a bale, and the like. It is a rule of the\r\ncriminal law, that, if a bailee of such a chest or bale\r\nwrongfully sells the entire chest or bale, he does not commit\r\nlarceny, but if he breaks bulk he does, because in the former\r\ncase he does not, and in the latter he does, commit a trespass.\r\n/2/ The reason sometimes offered is, that, by breaking bulk, the\r\nbailee determines the bailment, and that the goods at once revest\r\nin the possession of the bailor. This is, perhaps, an\r\nunnecessary, as well as inadequate fiction. /3/ The rule comes\r\nfrom the Year Books, and the theory of the Year Books was, that,\r\nalthough the chest was delivered to the bailee, the goods inside\r\nof it were not, and this theory was applied to civil as well as\r\ncriminal cases. The bailor has the power and intent to exclude\r\nthe bailee from the goods, and therefore may be said to be in\r\npossession of them as against the bailee. /4/\r\n\r\n[225] On the other hand, a case in Rhode Island /1/ is against\r\nthe view here taken. A man bought a safe, and then, wishing to\r\nsell it again, sent it to the defendant, and gave him leave to\r\nkeep his books in it until sold. The defendant found some\r\nbank-notes stuck in a crevice of the safe, which coming to the\r\nplaintiff's ears he demanded the safe and the money. The\r\ndefendant sent back the safe, but refused to give up the money,\r\nand the court sustained him in his refusal. I venture to think\r\nthis decision wrong. Nor would my opinion be changed by assuming,\r\nwhat the report does not make perfectly clear, that the defendant\r\nreceived the safe as bailee, and not as servant or agent, and\r\nthat his permission to use the safe was general. The argument of\r\nthe court goes on the plaintiff's not being a finder. The\r\nquestion is whether he need be. It is hard to believe that, if\r\nthe defendant had stolen the bills from the safe while it was in\r\nthe owner's hands, the property could not have been laid in the\r\nsafe-owner, /2/ or that the latter could not have maintained\r\ntrover for them if converted under those circumstances. Sir James\r\nStephen seems to have drawn a similar conclusion from Cartwright\r\nv. Green and Merry v. Green; /3/ but I believe that no warrant\r\nfor it can be found in the cases, and still less for the reason\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood, however, that Durfee v. Jones is perfectly\r\nconsistent with the view here maintained of the [226] general\r\nnature of the necessary intent, and that it only touches the\r\nsubordinate question, whether the intent to exclude must be\r\ndirected to the specific thing, or may be even unconsciously\r\nincluded in a larger intent, as I am inclined to believe.\r\n\r\nThus far, nothing has been said with regard to the custody of\r\nservants. It is a well-known doctrine of the criminal law, that a\r\nservant who criminally converts property of his master intrusted\r\nto him and in his custody as servant, is guilty of theft, because\r\nhe is deemed to have taken the property from his master's\r\npossession. This is equivalent to saying that a servant, having\r\nthe custody of his master's property as servant, has not\r\npossession of that property, and it is so stated in the Year\r\nBooks. /1/\r\n\r\nThe anomalous distinction according to which, if the servant\r\nreceives the thing from another person for his master, the\r\nservant has the possession, and so cannot commit theft, /2/ is\r\nmade more rational by the old cases. For the distinction taken in\r\nthem is, that, while the servant is in the house or with his\r\nmaster, the latter retains possession, but if he delivers his\r\nhorse to his servant to ride to market, or gives him a bag to\r\ncarry to London, then the thing is out of the master's possession\r\nand in the servant's. /3/ In this more intelligible form, the\r\nrule would not now prevail. But one half of it, that a guest at a\r\ntavern has not possession of the plate with which he is served,\r\nis no doubt still law, [227] for guests in general are likened to\r\nservants in their legal position. /1/\r\n\r\nThere are few English decisions, outside the criminal on the\r\nquestion whether a servant has possession. But the Year Books do\r\nnot suggest any difference between civil and criminal cases, and\r\nthere is an almost tradition of courts and approved writers that\r\nhe has not, in any case. A master has maintained trespass against\r\na servant for converting cloth which he was employed to sell, /2/\r\nand the American cases go the full length of the old doctrine. It\r\nhas often been remarked that a servant must be distinguished from\r\na bailee.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked how the denial of possession to servants can\r\nbe made to agree with the test proposed, and it will be said with\r\ntruth that the servant has as much the intent to exclude the\r\nworld at large as a borrower. The law of servants is\r\nunquestionably at variance with that test; and there can be no\r\ndoubt that those who have built their theories upon the Roman law\r\nhave been led by this fact, coupled with the Roman doctrine as to\r\nbailees in general, to seek the formula of reconciliation where\r\nthey have. But, in truth, the exception with regard to servants\r\nstands on purely historical grounds. A servant is denied\r\npossession, not from any peculiarity of intent with regard to the\r\nthings in his custody, either towards his master or other people,\r\nby which he is distinguished [228] from a depositary, but simply\r\nas one of the incidents of his status. It is familiar that the\r\nstatus of a servant maintains many marks of the time when he was\r\na slave. The liability of the master for his torts is one\r\ninstance. The present is another. A slave's possession was his\r\nowner's possession on the practical ground of the owner's power\r\nover him, /1/ and from the fact that the slave had no standing\r\nbefore the law. The notion that his personality was merged in\r\nthat of his family head survived the era of emancipation.\r\n\r\nI have shown in the first Lecture /2/ that agency arose out of\r\nthe earlier relation in the Roman law, through the extension pro\r\nhac vice to a freeman of conceptions derived from that source.\r\nThe same is true, I think, of our own law, the later development\r\nof which seems to have been largely under Roman influence. As\r\nlate as Blackstone, agents appear under the general head of\r\nservants, and the first precedents cited for the peculiar law of\r\nagents were cases of master and servant. Blackstone's language is\r\nworth quoting: \"There is yet a fourth species of servants, if\r\nthey may be so called, being rather in a superior, a ministerial\r\ncapacity; such as stewards, factors, and bailiffs: whom, however,\r\nthe law considers as servants pro tempore, with regard to such of\r\ntheir acts as affect their master's or employer's property.\" /3/\r\n\r\n[229] It is very true that in modern times many of the effects of\r\neither relation--master and servant or principal and agent--may\r\nbe accounted for as the result of acts done by the master\r\nhimself. If a man tells another to make a contract in his name,\r\nor commands him to commit a tort, no special conception is needed\r\nto explain why he is held; although even in such cases, where the\r\nintermediate party was a freeman, the conclusion was not reached\r\nuntil the law had become somewhat mature. But, if the title\r\nAgency deserves to stand in the law at all, it must be because\r\nsome peculiar consequences are attached to the fact of the\r\nrelation. If the mere power to bind a principal to an authorized\r\ncontract were all, we might as well have a chapter on ink and\r\npaper as on agents. But it is not all. Even in the domain of\r\ncontract, we find the striking doctrine that an undisclosed\r\nprincipal has the rights as well as the obligations of a known\r\ncontractor,--that he can be sued, and, more remarkable, can sue\r\non his agent's contract. The first precedent cited for the\r\nproposition that a promise to an agent may be laid as a promise\r\nto the principal, is a case of master and servant. /1/\r\n\r\nAs my present object is only to show the meaning of the doctrine\r\nof identification in its bearing upon the theory of possession,\r\nit would be out of place to consider at any length how far that\r\ndoctrine must be invoked to explain the liability of principals\r\nfor their agents' torts, or whether a more reasonable rule\r\ngoverns other cases than that applied where the actor has a\r\ntolerably defined status as a [230] servant. I allow myself a few\r\nwords, because I shall not be able to return to the subject.\r\n\r\nIf the liability of a master for the torts of his servant had\r\nhitherto been recognized by the courts as the decaying remnant of\r\nan obsolete institution, it would not be surprising to find it\r\nconfined to the cases settled by ancient precedent. But such has\r\nnot been the fact. It has been extended to new relations by\r\nanalogy, /1/ It exists where the principal does not stand in the\r\nrelation of paterfamilias to the actual wrong-doer. /2/ A man may\r\nbe held for another where the relation was of such a transitory\r\nnature as to exclude the conception of status, as for the\r\nnegligence of another person's servant momentarily acting for the\r\ndefendant, or of a neighbor helping him as a volunteer; /3/ and,\r\nso far as known, no principal has ever escaped on the ground of\r\nthe dignity of his agent's employment. /4/ The courts habitually\r\nspeak as if the same rules applied to brokers and other agents,\r\nas to servants properly so called. /5/ Indeed, it [231] has been\r\nlaid down in terms, that the liability of employers is not\r\nconfined to the case of servants, /1/ although the usual cases\r\nare, of course, those of menial servants, and the like, who could\r\nnot pay a large verdict.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the peculiar doctrines of agency are\r\nanomalous, and form, as I believe, the vanishing point of the\r\nservile status, it may well happen that common sense will refuse\r\nto carry them out to their furthest applications. Such conflicts\r\nbetween tradition and the instinct of justice we may see upon the\r\nquestion of identifying a principal who knows the truth with an\r\nagent who makes a false representation, in order to make out a\r\nfraud, as in Cornfoot v. Fowke, /2/ or upon that as to the\r\nliability of a principal for the frauds of his agent discussed in\r\nmany English cases. /3/ But, so long as the fiction which makes\r\nthe root of a master's liability is left alive, it is as hopeless\r\nto reconcile the differences by logic as to square the circle.\r\n\r\nIn an article in the American Law Review /4/ I referred [232] to\r\nan expression of Godefroi with regard to agents; eadem est\r\npersona domini et procuratoris. /1/ This notion of a fictitious\r\nunity of person has been pronounced a darkening of counsel in a\r\nrecent useful work. /2/ But it receives the sanction of Sir Henry\r\nMaine, /3/ and I believe that it must stand as expressing an\r\nimportant aspect of the law, if, as I have tried to show, there\r\nis no adequate and complete explanation of the modern law, except\r\nby the survival in practice of rules which lost their true\r\nmeaning when the objects of them ceased to be slaves. There is no\r\ntrouble in understanding what is meant by saying that a slave has\r\nno legal standing, but is absorbed in the family which his master\r\nrepresents before the law. The meaning seems equally clear when\r\nwe say that a free servant, in his relations as such, is in many\r\nrespects likened by the law to a slave (not, of course, to his\r\nown detriment as a freeman). The next step is simply that others\r\nnot servants in a general sense may be treated as if servants in\r\na particular connection. This is the progress of ideas as shown\r\nus by history; and this is what is meant by saying that the\r\ncharacteristic feature which justifies agency as a title of the\r\nlaw is the absorption pro hac vice of the agent's legal\r\nindividuality in that of his principal.\r\n\r\nIf this were carried out logically, it would follow that an agent\r\nconstituted to hold possession in his principal's name would not\r\nbe regarded as having the legal possession, or as entitled to\r\ntrespass. But, after what has been said, no opinion can be\r\nexpressed whether the law would go so far, unless it is shown by\r\nprecedent. /4/ The nature of the case [233] will be observed. It\r\nis that of an agent constituted for the very point and purpose of\r\npossession. A bailee may be an agent for some other purpose. A\r\nfree servant may be made a bailee. But the bailee holds in his\r\nown as we say, following the Roman idiom, and the servant or\r\nagent holding as such does not.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be worth while, if space allowed, to search the\r\nbooks on this subject, because of the great confusion of language\r\nto be found in them. It has been said, for instance, in this\r\nconnection, that a carrier is a servant; /1/ while nothing can be\r\nclearer than that, while goods are in custody, they are in his\r\npossession. /2/ So where goods remain in the custody of a vendor,\r\nappropriation to the contract and acceptance have been confounded\r\nwith delivery. /3/ Our law has adopted the Roman doctrine, /4/\r\nthat there may be a delivery, that is, a change of possession, by\r\na change in the character in which the vendor holds, but has not\r\nalways imitated the caution of the civilians with regard to what\r\namounts to such a change. /5/ Bailees are constantly spoken of as\r\nif they were agents to possess,--a confusion made [234] easier by\r\nthe fact that they generally are agents for other purposes. Those\r\ncases which attribute possession to a transferee of goods in the\r\nhands of a middleman, /1/ without distinguishing whether the\r\nmiddleman holds in his own name or the buyer's, are generally\r\nright in the result, no doubt, but have added to the confusion of\r\nthought upon the subject.\r\n\r\nGerman writers are a little apt to value a theory of possession\r\nsomewhat in proportion to the breadth of the distinction which it\r\ndraws between juridical possession and actual detention; but,\r\nfrom the point of view taken here, it will be seen that the\r\ngrounds for denying possession and the possessory remedies to\r\nservants and agents holding as such--if, indeed, the latter have\r\nnot those remedies--are merely historical, and that the general\r\ntheory can only take account of the denial as an anomaly. It will\r\nalso be perceived that the ground on which servants and\r\ndepositaries have been often likened to each other, namely, that\r\nthey both hold for the benefit of another and not for themselves,\r\nis wholly without influence on our law, which has always treated\r\ndepositaries as having possession; and is not the true\r\nexplanation of the Roman doctrine, which did not decide either\r\ncase upon that ground, and which decided each for reasons\r\ndifferent from those on which it decided the other.\r\n\r\nIt will now be easy to deal with the question of power as to\r\nthird persons. This is naturally a power coextensive with the\r\nintent. But we must bear in mind that the law deals only or\r\nmainly with manifested facts; and hence, when we speak of a power\r\nto exclude others, we mean no more than a power which so appears\r\nin its manifestation. [235] A ruffian may be within equal reach\r\nand sight when a child picks up a pocket-book; but if he does\r\nnothing, the child has manifested the needful power as well as if\r\nit had been backed by a hundred policemen. Thus narrowed, it\r\nmight be suggested that the manifestation of is only important as\r\na manifestation of intent. But the two things are distinct, and\r\nthe former becomes decisive when there are two contemporaneous\r\nand conflicting intents. Thus, where two parties, neither having\r\ntitle, claimed a crop of corn adversely to each other, and\r\ncultivated it alternately, and the plaintiff gathered and threw\r\nit in small piles in the same field, where it lay for a week, and\r\nthen each party simultaneously began to carry it away, it was\r\nheld the plaintiff had not gained possession. /1/ But the first\r\ninterference of the defendant had been after the gathering into\r\npiles, the plaintiff would probably have recovered. /2/ So where\r\ntrustees possessed of a schoolroom put in a schoolmaster, and he\r\nwas afterwards dismissed, but the next day (June 30) re-entered\r\nby force; on the fourth of July he was required by notice to\r\ndepart, and was not ejected until the eleventh; it was considered\r\nthat the schoolmaster never got possession as against the\r\ntrustees. /3/\r\n\r\nWe are led, in this connection, to the subject of the continuance\r\nof the rights acquired by gaining possession. To gain possession,\r\nit has been seen, there must be certain physical relations, as\r\nexplained, and a certain intent. It remains to be inquired, how\r\nfar these facts must continue [236] to be presently true of a\r\nperson in order that he may keep the rights which follow from\r\ntheir presence. The prevailing view is that of Savigny. He thinks\r\nthat there must be always the same animus as at the moment of\r\nacquisition, and a constant power to reproduce at will the\r\noriginal physical relations to the object. Every one agrees that\r\nit is not necessary to have always a present power over the\r\nthing, otherwise one could only possess what was under his hand.\r\nBut it is a question whether we cannot dispense with even more.\r\nThe facts which constitute possession are in their nature capable\r\nof continuing presently true for a lifetime. Hence there has\r\narisen an ambiguity of language which has led to much confusion\r\nof thought. We use the word \"possession,\" indifferently, to\r\nsignify the presence of all the facts needful to gain it, and\r\nalso the condition of him who, although some of them no longer\r\nexist, is still protected as if they did. Consequently it has\r\nbeen only too easy to treat the cessation of the facts as the\r\nloss of the right, as some German writers very nearly do. /1/\r\n\r\nBut it no more follows, from the single circumstance that certain\r\nfacts must concur in order to create the rights incident to\r\npossession, that they must continue in order to keep those rights\r\nalive, than it does, from the necessity of a consideration and a\r\npromise to create a right ex contractu, that the consideration\r\nand promise must continue moving between the parties until the\r\nmoment of performance. When certain facts have once been made\r\nmanifest which confer a right, there is no general ground on\r\nwhich the law need hold the right at an end except the\r\nmanifestation of some fact inconsistent with its continuance,\r\n[237] the reasons for conferring the particular right have great\r\nweight in determining what facts shall be to be so. Cessation of\r\nthe original physical relations to the object might be treated as\r\nsuch a fact; but it never has been, unless in times of more\r\nungoverned violence than the present. On the same principle, it\r\nis only a question of tradition or policy whether a cessation of\r\nthe power to reproduce the original physical relations shall\r\naffect the continuance of the rights. It does not stand on the\r\nsame ground as a new possession adversely taken by another. We\r\nhave adopted the Roman law as to animals ferae naturae, but the\r\ngeneral tendency of our law is to favor appropriation. It abhors\r\nthe absence of proprietary or possessory rights as a kind of\r\nvacuum. Accordingly, it has been expressly decided, where a man\r\nfound logs afloat and moored them, but they again broke loose and\r\nfloated away, and were found by another, that the first finder\r\nretained the rights which sprung from his having taken\r\npossession, and that he could maintain trover against the second\r\nfinder, who refused to give them up. /1/\r\n\r\nSuppose that a finder of a purse of gold has left it in his\r\ncountry-house, which is lonely and slightly barred, and he is a\r\nhundred miles away, in prison. The only person within twenty\r\nmiles is a thoroughly equipped burglar at his front door, who has\r\nseen the purse through a window, and who intends forthwith to\r\nenter and take it. The finder's power to reproduce his former\r\nphysical relation to the gold is rather limited, yet I believe\r\nthat no one would say that his possession was at an end until the\r\nburglar, by an overt [238] act, had manifested his power and\r\nintent to exclude others from the purse. The reason for this is\r\nthe same which has been put with regard to the power to exclude\r\nat the moment of gaining possession. The law deals, for the most\r\npart, with overt acts and facts which can be known by the senses.\r\nSo long as the burglar has not taken the purse, he has not\r\nmanifested his intent; and until he breaks through the barrier\r\nwhich measures the present possessor's power of excluding him, he\r\nhas not manifested his power. It may be observed further, that,\r\naccording to the tests adopted in this Lecture, the owner of the\r\nhouse has a present possession in the strictest sense, because,\r\nalthough he has not the power which Savigny says is necessary, he\r\nhas the present intent and power to exclude others.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that the common law should go so far as to deal\r\nwith possession in the same way as a title, and should hold that,\r\nwhen it has once been acquired, rights are acquired which\r\ncontinue to prevail against all the world but one, until\r\nsomething has happened sufficient to divest ownership.\r\n\r\nThe possession of rights, as it is called, has been a\r\nfighting-ground for centuries on the Continent. It is not\r\nuncommon for German writers to go so far as to maintain that\r\nthere may be a true possession of obligations; this seeming to\r\naccord with a general view that possession and right are in\r\ntheory coextensive terms; that the mastery of the will over an\r\nexternal object in general (be that object a thing or another\r\nwill), when in accord with the general will, and consequently\r\nlawful, is called right, when merely de facto is possession. /1/\r\nBearing in mind what was [239] said on the question whether\r\npossession was a fact or right, it will be seen that such an\r\nantithesis between possession and right cannot be admitted as a\r\nlegal distinction. The facts constituting possession generate\r\nrights as truly as do the facts which constitute ownership,\r\nalthough the rights a mere possessor are less extensive than\r\nthose of an owner.\r\n\r\nConversely, rights spring from certain facts supposed to be true\r\nof the person entitled to such rights. Where these facts are of\r\nsuch a nature that they can be made successively true of\r\ndifferent persons, as in the case of the occupation of land, the\r\ncorresponding rights may be successively enjoyed. But when the\r\nfacts are past and gone, such as the giving of a consideration\r\nand the receiving of a promise, there can be no claim to the\r\nresulting rights set up by any one except the party of whom the\r\nfacts were originally true--in the case supposed, the original\r\ncontractee,--because no one but the original contractee can fill\r\nthe situation from which they spring.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be granted by English readers, that one of the\r\nessential constituent facts consists in a certain relation to a\r\nmaterial object. But this object may be a slave, as well as a\r\nhorse; /1/ and conceptions originated in this way may be extended\r\nby a survival to free services. It is noticeable that even Bruns,\r\nin the application of his theory, does not seem to go beyond\r\ncases of status and those where, in common language, land is\r\nbound for the services in question, as it is for rent. Free\r\nservices being [240] so far treated like servile, even by our\r\nlaw, that the master has a right of property in them against all\r\nthe world, it is only a question of degree where the line shall\r\nbe drawn. It would be possible to hold that, as one might be in\r\npossession of a slave without title, so one might have all the\r\nrights of an owner in free services rendered without contract.\r\nPerhaps there is something of that sort to be seen when a parent\r\nrecovers for the seduction of a daughter over twenty-one,\r\nalthough there is no actual contract of service. /1/ So,\r\nthroughout the whole course of the canon law and in the early law\r\nof England, rents were regarded as so far a part of the realty as\r\nto be capable of possession and disseisin, and they could be\r\nrecovered like land by all assize. /2/\r\n\r\nBut the most important case of the so-called possession of rights\r\nin our law, as in the Roman, occurs with regard to easements. An\r\neasement is capable of possession in a certain sense. A man may\r\nuse land in a certain way, with the intent to exclude all others\r\nfrom using it in any way inconsistent with his own use, but no\r\nfurther. If this be true possession, however, it is a limited\r\npossession of land, not of a right, as others have shown. But\r\nwhere an easement has been actually created, whether by deed or\r\nprescription, although it is undoubtedly true that any possessor\r\nof the dominant estate would be protected in its enjoyment, it\r\nhas not been so protected in the past on the ground that the\r\neasement was in itself an object of possession, but by the\r\nsurvival of precedents explained in a later [241] Lecture. Hence,\r\nto test the existence of a mere possession of this sort which the\r\nlaw will protect, we will take the case of a way used de facto\r\nfor four years, but in which no easement has yet been acquired,\r\nand ask whether the possessor of the quasi dominant tenement\r\nwould be protected in his use as against third persons. It is\r\nconceivable that he should be, but I believe that he would not.\r\n/2/\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the doctrine seems to be, that there is\r\nalmost a contradiction between the assertions that one man has a\r\ngeneral power and intent to exclude the world from dealing with\r\nthe land, and that another has the power to use it in a\r\nparticular way, and to exclude the from interfering with that.\r\nThe reconciliation of the two needs somewhat artificial\r\nreasoning. However, it should be borne in mind that the question\r\nin every case is not what was the actual power of the parties\r\nconcerned, but what was their manifested power. If the latter\r\nstood thus balanced, the law might recognize a kind of split\r\npossession. But if it does not recognize it until a right is\r\nacquired, then the protection of a disseisor in the use of an\r\neasement must still be explained by a reference to the facts\r\nmentioned in the Lecture referred to.\r\n\r\nThe consequences attached to possession are substantially those\r\nattached to ownership, subject to the question the continuance of\r\npossessory rights which I have touched upon above. Even a\r\nwrongful possessor of a [242] chattel may have full damages for\r\nits conversion by a stranger to the title, or a return of the\r\nspecific thing. /1/\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed, to be sure, that a \"special property\" was\r\nnecessary in order to maintain replevin /2/ or trover. /3/ But\r\nmodern cases establish that possession is sufficient, and an\r\nexamination of the sources of our law proves that special\r\nproperty did not mean anything more. It has been shown that the\r\nprocedure for the recovery of chattels lost against one's will,\r\ndescribed by Bracton, like its predecessor on the Continent, was\r\nbased upon possession. Yet Bracton, in the very passage in which\r\nhe expressly makes that statement, uses a phrase which, but for\r\nthe explanation, would seem to import ownership,--\"Poterit rem\r\nsuam petere.\" /4/ The writs of later days used the same language,\r\nand when it was objected, as it frequently was, to a suit by a\r\nbailee for a taking of bona et catalla sua, that it should have\r\nbeen for bona in custodia sua existentia, it was always answered\r\nthat those in the Chancery would not frame a writ in that form.\r\n/5/\r\n\r\nThe substance of the matter was, that goods in a man's possession\r\nwere his (sua), within the meaning of the writ. But it was very\r\nnatural to attempt a formal reconciliation between that formal\r\nword and the fact by saying that, although the plaintiff had not\r\nthe general property in the [243] chattels, yet he had a property\r\nas against strangers, /1/ or a special property. This took place,\r\nand, curiously enough, two of the earliest instances in which I\r\nhave found the latter phrase used are cases of a depositary, /2/\r\nand a borrower. /3/ Brooke says that a wrongful taker \"has title\r\nagainst all but the true owner.\" /4/ In this sense the special\r\nproperty was better described as a \"possessory property,\" as it\r\nwas, in deciding that, in an indictment for larceny, the property\r\ncould be laid in the bailee who suffered the trespass. /5/\r\n\r\nI have explained the inversion by which a bailee's right of\r\naction against third persons was supposed to stand on his\r\nresponsibility over, although in truth it was the foundation of\r\nthat responsibility, and arose simply from his possession. The\r\nstep was short, from saying that bailees could sue because they\r\nwere answerable over, /6/ to saying that they had the property as\r\nagainst strangers, or a special property, because they were\r\nanswerable over, /7/ and that they could sue because they had a\r\nspecial property and were answerable over. /8/ And thus the\r\nnotion that special property meant something more than\r\npossession, and was a requisite to maintaining an action, got\r\ninto the law.\r\n\r\nThe error was made easier by a different use of the phrase in a\r\ndifferent connection. A bailee was in general liable for goods\r\nstolen from his custody, whether he had a lien or not. But the\r\nlaw was otherwise as to a [244] pledgee, if he had kept the\r\npledge with his own goods, and the two were stolen together. /1/\r\nThis distinction was accounted for, at least in Lord Coke's time,\r\nby saying that the pledge was, in a sense, the pledgee's own,\r\nthat he had a special property in it, and thus that the ordinary\r\nrelation of bailment did not exist, or that the undertaking was\r\nonly to keep as his own goods. /2/ The same expression was used\r\nin discussing the pledgee's right to assign the pledge, /3/ In\r\nthis sense the term applied only to pledges, but its significance\r\nin a particular connection was easily carried over into the\r\nothers in which it was used, with the result that the special\r\nproperty which was requisite to maintain the possessory actions\r\nwas supposed to mean a qualified interest in the goods.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the legal consequences of possession, it only\r\nremains to mention that the rules which have been laid down with\r\nregard to chattels also prevail with regard to land. For although\r\nthe plaintiff in ejectment must recover on the strength of his\r\nown title as against a defendant in possession, it is now settled\r\nthat prior possession is enough if the defendant stands on his\r\npossession alone Possession is of course sufficient for\r\ntrespass.5 And although the early remedy by assize was restricted\r\nto those who had a technical seisin, this was for reasons which\r\ndo not affect the general theory.\r\n\r\nBefore closing I must say a word concerning ownership and kindred\r\nconceptions. Following the order of analysis [245] which has been\r\npursued with regard to possession, the first question must be,\r\nWhat are the facts to which the rights called ownership are\r\nattached as a legal consequence? The most familiar mode of\r\ngaining ownership is by conveyance from the previous owner. But\r\nthat presupposes ownership already existing, and the problem is\r\nto discover what calls it into being.\r\n\r\nOne fact which has this effect is first possession. The captor of\r\nwild animals, or the taker of fish from the ocean, has not merely\r\npossession, but a title good against all the world. But the most\r\ncommon mode of getting an original and independent title is by\r\ncertain proceedings, in court or out of it, adverse to all the\r\nworld. At one extreme of these is the proceeding in rem of the\r\nadmiralty, which conclusively disposes of the property in its\r\npower, and, when it sells or condemns it, does not deal with this\r\nor that man's title, but gives a new title paramount to all\r\nprevious interests, whatsoever they may be. The other and more\r\nfamiliar case is prescription, where a public adverse holding for\r\na certain time has a similar effect. A title by prescription is\r\nnot a presumed conveyance from this or owner alone, it\r\nextinguishes all previous and inconsistent claims. The two\r\ncoalesce in the ancient fine with proclamations where the\r\ncombined effect of the judgment and the lapse of a year and a day\r\nwas to bar claims. /1/\r\n\r\nSo rights analogous to those of ownership may be given by the\r\nlegislature to persons of whom some other set of facts is true.\r\nFor instance, a patentee, or one to whom the government has\r\nissued a certain instrument, and who in fact has made a\r\npatentable invention.\r\n\r\n[246] But what are the rights of ownership? They are\r\nsubstantially the same as those incident to possession. Within\r\nthe limits prescribed by policy, the owner is allowed to exercise\r\nhis natural powers over the subject-matter uninterfered with, and\r\nis more or less protected in excluding other people from such\r\ninterference. The owner is allowed to exclude all, and is\r\naccountable to no one. The possessor is allowed to exclude all\r\nbut one, and is accountable to no one but him. The great body of\r\nquestions which have made the subject of property so large and\r\nimportant are questions of conveyancing, not necessarily or\r\ngenerally dependent on ownership as distinguished from\r\npossession. They are questions of the effect of not having an\r\nindependent and original title, but of coming in under a title\r\nalready in existence, or of the modes in which an original title\r\ncan be cut up among those who come in under it. These questions\r\nwill be dealt with and explained where they belong, in the\r\nLectures on Successions.\r\n\r\n[247]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE VII. -- CONTRACT.--I. HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of contract has been so thoroughly remodelled to\r\nmeet the needs of modern times, that there is less here than\r\nelsewhere for historical research. It has been so ably discussed\r\nthat there is less room here elsewhere for essentially new\r\nanalysis. But a short of the growth of modern doctrines, whether\r\nnecessary or not, will at least be interesting, while an analysis\r\nof their main characteristics cannot be omitted, and may present\r\nsome new features.\r\n\r\nIt is popularly supposed that the oldest forms of contract known\r\nto our law are covenant and debt, and they are of early date, no\r\ndoubt. But there are other contracts still in use which, although\r\nthey have in some degree put on modern forms, at least suggest\r\nthe question whether they were not of equally early appearance.\r\n\r\nOne of these, the promissory oath, is no longer the foundation of\r\nany rights in private law. It is used, but as mainly as a\r\nsolemnity connected with entering upon a public office. The judge\r\nswears that he will execute justice according to law, the juryman\r\nthat he will find his verdict according to law and the evidence,\r\nthe newly adopted citizen that he will bear true faith and\r\nallegiance to the government of his choice.\r\n\r\nBut there is another contract which plays a more important part.\r\nIt may, perhaps, sound paradoxical to mention [248] the contract\r\nof suretyship. Suretyship, nowadays, is only an accessory\r\nobligation, which presupposes a principal undertaking, and which,\r\nso far as the nature of the contract goes, is just like any\r\nother. But, as has been pointed out by Laferriere, /1/ and very\r\nlikely by earlier writers, the surety of ancient law was the\r\nhostage, and the giving of hostages was by no means confined to\r\ninternational dealings.\r\n\r\nIn the old metrical romance of Huon of Bordeaux, Huon, having\r\nkilled the son of Charlemagne, is required by the Emperor to\r\nperform various seeming impossibilities as the price of\r\nforgiveness. Huon starts upon the task, leaving twelve of his\r\nknights as hostages. /2/ He returns successful, but at first the\r\nEmperor is made to believe that his orders have been disobeyed.\r\nThereupon Charlemagne cries out, \"I summon hither the pledges for\r\nHuon. I will hang them, and they shall have no ransom.\" /3/ So,\r\nwhen Huon is to fight a duel, by way of establishing the truth or\r\nfalsehood of a charge against him, each party begins by producing\r\nsome of his friends as hostages.\r\n\r\nWhen hostages are given for a duel which is to determine the\r\ntruth or falsehood of an accusation, the transaction is very near\r\nto the giving of similar security in the trial of a cause in\r\ncourt. This was in fact the usual course of the Germanic\r\nprocedure. It will be remembered that the earliest appearance of\r\nlaw was as a substitute for the private feuds between families or\r\nclans. But while a defendant who did not peaceably submit to the\r\njurisdiction of the court might be put outside the protection of\r\nthe law, so that any man might kill him at sight, there was at\r\nfirst [249] no way of securing the indemnity to which the\r\nplaintiff was entitled unless the defendant chose to give such\r\nsecurity. /1/\r\n\r\nEnglish customs which have been preserved to us are somewhat more\r\nadvanced, but one of the noticeable features in their procedure\r\nis the giving of security at every step. All lawyers will\r\nremember a trace of this in the fiction of John Doe and Richard\r\nRoe, the plaintiff's pledges to prosecute his action. But a more\r\nsignificant example is found in the rule repeated in many of the\r\nearly laws, that a defendant accused of a wrong must either find\r\nsecurity or go to prison. /2/ This security was the hostage of\r\nearlier days, and later, when the actions for punishment and for\r\nredress were separated from each other, became the bail of the\r\ncriminal law. The liability was still conceived in the same way\r\nas when the bail actually put his own body into the power of the\r\nparty secured.\r\n\r\nOne of Charlemagne's additions to the Lex Salica speaks of a\r\nfreeman who has committed himself to the power of another by way\r\nof surety. /3/ The very phrase is copied in the English laws of\r\nHenry I. /4/ We have seen what this meant in the story of Huon of\r\nBordeaux. The Mirror of Justices /5/ says that King Canute used\r\nto judge the mainprisors according as the principals when their\r\nprincipals not in judgment, but that King Henry I. confined\r\nCanute's rule to mainprisors who were consenting to the fact.\r\n\r\nAs late as the reign of Edward III., Shard, an English judge,\r\nafter stating the law as it still is, that bail are a prisoner's\r\n[250] keepers, and shall be charged if he escapes, observes, that\r\nsome say that the bail shall be hanged in his place. /1/ This was\r\nthe law in the analogous case of a jailer. /2/ The old notion is\r\nto be traced in the form still given by modern writers for the\r\nundertaking of bail for felony. They are bound \"body for body,\"\r\n/3/ and modern law-books find it necessary to state that this\r\ndoes not make them liable to the punishment of the principal\r\noffender if he does not appear, but only to a fine. /4/ The\r\ncontract also differed from our modern ideas in the mode of\r\nexecution. It was simply a solemn admission of liability in the\r\npresence of the officer authorized to take it. The signature of\r\nthe bail was not necessary, /5/ and it was not requisite that the\r\nperson bailed should bind himself as a party. /6/\r\n\r\nBut these peculiarities have been modified or done away with by\r\nstatute, and I have dwelt upon the case, not so much as a special\r\nform of contract differing from all others as because the history\r\nof its origin shows one of the first appearances of contract in\r\nour law. It is to be traced to the gradual increase of faith in\r\nthe honor of a hostage if the case calling for his surrender\r\nshould arrive, and to the consequent relaxation of actual\r\nimprisonment. An illustration may be found in the parallel mode\r\nof dealing with the prisoner himself. His bail, to whom his body\r\nis supposed to be delivered, have a right to seize him at any\r\ntime and anywhere, but he is allowed to go at large until [251]\r\nsurrendered. It will be noticed that this form of contract, like\r\ndebt as dealt with by the Roman law of the Twelve Tables, and for\r\nthe same motive, although by a different process, looked to the\r\nbody of the contracting party as the satisfaction.\r\n\r\nDebt is another and more popular candidate for the honors of\r\npriority. Since the time of Savigny, the first appearance of\r\ncontract both in Roman and German law has often been attributed\r\nto the case of a sale by some accident remaining incomplete. The\r\nquestion does not seem to be of great philosophical significance.\r\nFor to explain how mankind first learned to promise, we must go\r\nto metaphysics, and find out how it ever came to frame a future\r\ntense. The nature of the particular promise which was first\r\nenforced in a given system can hardly lead to any truth of\r\ngeneral importance. But the history of the action of debt is\r\ninstructive, although in a humbler way. It is necessary to know\r\nsomething about it in order to understand the enlightened rules\r\nwhich make up the law of contract at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn Glanvill's treatise the action of debt is found already to be\r\none of the well-known remedies. But the law of those days was\r\nstill in a somewhat primitive state, and it will easily be\r\nimagined that a form of action which goes back as far as that was\r\nnot founded on any very delicate discriminations. It was, as I\r\nshall try to show directly, simply the general form in which any\r\nmoney claim was collected, except unliquidated claims for damages\r\nby force, for which there was established the equally general\r\nremedy of trespass.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that the action was adopted from the then\r\nmore civilized procedure of the Roman law. A [252] natural\r\nopinion, seeing that all the early English law-writers adopt\r\ntheir phraseology and classification from Rome. Still it seems\r\nmuch more probable that the action is of pure German descent. It\r\nhas the features of the primitive procedure which is found upon\r\nthe Continent, as described by Laband. /1/\r\n\r\nThe substance of the plaintiff's claim as set forth in the writ\r\nof debt is that the defendant owes him so much and wrongfully\r\nwithholds it. It does not matter, for a claim framed like that,\r\nhow the defendant's duty arises. It is not confined to contract.\r\nIt is satisfied if there is a duty to pay on any ground. It\r\nstates a mere conclusion of law, not the facts upon which that\r\nconclusion is based, and from which the liability arises. The old\r\nGerman complaint was, in like manner, \"A owes me so much.\"\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the German procedure that the defendant\r\ncould meet that complaint by answering, in an equally general\r\nform, that he did not owe the plaintiff. The plaintiff had to do\r\nmore than simply allege a debt, if he would prevent the defendant\r\nfrom escaping in that way. In England, if the plaintiff had not\r\nsomething to show for his debt, the defendant's denial turned him\r\nout of court; and even if he had, he was liable to be defeated by\r\nthe defendant's swearing with some of his friends to back him\r\nthat he owed nothing. The chief reason why debt was supplanted\r\nfor centuries by a later remedy, assumpsit, was the survival of\r\nthis relic of early days.\r\n\r\nFinally, in England as in Germany, debt for the detention of\r\nmoney was the twin brother of the action brought for wrongfully\r\nwithholding any other kind of chattel. The gist of the complaint\r\nin either case was the same.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that this crude product of the infancy of law\r\nshould have any importance for us at the present time. Yet\r\nwhenever we trace a leading doctrine of substantive law far\r\nenough back, we are very likely to find some forgotten\r\ncircumstance of procedure at its source. Illustrations of this\r\ntruth have been given already. The action of debt and the other\r\nactions of contract will furnish others. Debt throws most light\r\nupon the doctrine of consideration.\r\n\r\nOur law does not enforce every promise which a man may make.\r\nPromises made as ninety-nine promises out of a hundred are, by\r\nword of mouth or simple writing, are not binding unless there is\r\na consideration for them. That is, as it is commonly explained,\r\nunless the promisee has either conferred a benefit on the\r\npromisor, or incurred a detriment, as the inducement to the\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that this rule was borrowed from Roman law by\r\nthe Chancery, and, after undergoing some modification there,\r\npassed into the common law.\r\n\r\nBut this account of the matter is at least questionable. So far\r\nas the use of words goes, I am not aware that consideration is\r\ndistinctly called cause before the reign of Elizabeth; in the\r\nearlier reports it always appears as quid pro quo. Its first\r\nappearance, so far as I know, is in Fleta's account of the action\r\nof debt, /1/ and although I am inclined to believe that Fleta's\r\nstatement is not to be trusted, a careful consideration of the\r\nchronological order of the cases in the Year Books will show, I\r\nthink, that the doctrine was fully developed in debt before any\r\nmention of it in equity can be found. One of the earliest [254]\r\nreferences to what a promisor was to have for his undertaking was\r\nin the action of assumpsit. /1/ But the doctrine certainly did\r\nnot originate there. The first mention of consideration in\r\nconnection with equity which I have seen is in the form of quid\r\npro quo, /2/ and occurs after the requirement had been thoroughly\r\nestablished in debt. /3/\r\n\r\nThe single fact that a consideration was never required for\r\ncontracts under seal, unless Fleta is to be trusted against the\r\ngreat weight of nearly contemporaneous evidence, goes far to show\r\nthat the rule cannot have originated on grounds of policy as a\r\nrule of substantive law. And conversely, the coincidence of the\r\ndoctrine with a peculiar mode of procedure points very strongly\r\nto the probability that the peculiar requirement and the peculiar\r\nprocedure were connected. It will throw light on the question to\r\nput together a few undisputed facts, and to consider what\r\nconsequences naturally followed. It will therefore be desirable\r\nto examine the action of debt a little further. But it is only\r\nfair to admit, at the outset, that I offer the explanation which\r\nfollows with great hesitation, and, I think, with a full\r\nappreciation of the objections which might be urged.\r\n\r\nIt was observed a moment ago, that, in order to recover against a\r\ndefendant who denied his debt, the plaintiff had to show\r\nsomething for it; otherwise he was turned over to the limited\r\njurisdiction of the spiritual tribunals. /4/ This requirement did\r\nnot mean evidence in the modern sense. It meant simply that he\r\nmust maintain his cause in one of the ways then recognized by\r\nlaw. These were three, the [255] duel, a writing, and witnesses.\r\nThe duel need not be discussed, as it soon ceased to be used in\r\ndebt, and has no bearing on what I have to say. Trial by writing\r\nand by witnesses, on the other hand, must both be carefully\r\nstudied. It will be convenient to consider the latter first and\r\nto find out what these witnesses were.\r\n\r\nOne thing we know at the start; they were not witnesses as we\r\nunderstand the term. They were not produced before a jury for\r\nexamination and cross-examination, nor did their testimony\r\ndepend for its effect on being believed by the court that heard\r\nit. Nowadays, a case is not decided by the evidence, but by a\r\nverdict, or a finding of facts, followed by a judgment. The oath\r\nof a witness has no effect unless it is believed. But in the time\r\nof Henry II. our trial by jury did not exist. When an oath was\r\nallowed to be sworn it had the same effect, whether it was\r\nbelieved or not. There was no provision for sifting it by a\r\nsecond body. In those cases where a trial by witnesses was\r\npossible, if the party called on to go forward could find a\r\ncertain number of men who were willing to swear in a certain\r\nform, there was an end of the matter.\r\n\r\nNow this seems like a more primitive way of establishing a debt\r\nthan the production of the defendant's written acknowledgement,\r\nand it is material to discover its origin.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which this mode of trial was used appear from the\r\nearly books and reports to have been almost wholly confined to\r\nclaims arising out of a sale or loan. And the question at once\r\noccurs, whether we are not upon traces of an institution which\r\nwas already ancient when Glanvill wrote. For centuries before the\r\nConquest Anglo-Saxon law /1/ had required the election of a\r\ncertain [256] number of official witnesses, two or three of whom\r\nwere to be called in to every bargain of sale. The object for\r\nwhich these witnesses were established is not commonly supposed\r\nto have been the proof of debts. They go back to a time when\r\ntheft and similar offences were the chief ground of litigation,\r\nand the purpose for which they were appointed was to afford a\r\nmeans of deciding whether a person charged with having stolen\r\nproperty had come by it rightfully or not. A defendant could\r\nclear himself of the felony by their oath that he had bought or\r\nreceived the thing openly in the way appointed by law.\r\n\r\nHaving been present at the bargain, the witnesses were able to\r\nswear to what they had seen and heard, if any question arose\r\nbetween the parties. Accordingly, their use was not confined to\r\ndisposing of a charge of felony. But that particular service\r\nidentifies the transaction witnesses of the Saxon period. Now we\r\nknow that the use of these witnesses did not at once disappear\r\nunder Norman influence. They are found with their old function in\r\nthe laws of William the Conqueror. /1/ The language of Glanvill\r\nseems to prove that they were still known under Henry II. He says\r\nthat, if a purchaser cannot summon in the man from whom he\r\nbought, to warrant the property to him and defend the suit, (for\r\nif he does, the peril is shifted to the seller,) then if the\r\npurchaser has sufficient proof of his having lawfully bought the\r\nthing, de legittimo marcatu suo, it will clear him of felony. But\r\nif he have not sufficient suit, he will be in danger. /2/ This is\r\nthe law of William over again. It follows that purchasers still\r\nused the transaction witnesses.\r\n\r\nBut Glanvill also seems to admit the use of witness to establish\r\ndebts. /1/ As the transaction witnesses were formerly available\r\nfor this purpose, I see no reason to doubt that they still were,\r\nand that he is speaking of them here also. /2/ Moreover, for a\r\nlong time after Henry II., whenever an action was brought for a\r\ndebt of which there was no written evidence, the plaintiff, when\r\nasked what he had to show for it, always answered \"good suit,\"\r\nand tendered his witnesses, who were sometimes examined by the\r\ncourt. /3/ I think it is not straining the evidence to infer that\r\nthe \"good suit\" of the later reports was the descendant of the\r\nSaxon transaction witnesses, as it has been shown that Glanvill's\r\nsecta was. /4/\r\n\r\nAssuming this step in the argument to have been taken, it will be\r\nwell to recall again for a moment the original nature of the\r\nwitness oath. It was confined to facts within the witnesses'\r\nknowledge by sight and hearing. But as the purposes for which\r\nwitnesses were provided only required their presence when\r\nproperty changed hands, the principal case in which they could be\r\nof service between the parties [258] to a bargain was when a debt\r\nwas claimed by reason of the delivery of property. The purpose\r\ndid not extend to agreements which were executory on both sides,\r\nbecause there no question of theft could arise. And Glanvill\r\nshows that in his time the King's Court did not enforce such\r\nagreements. /1/ Now, if the oath of the secta could only be used\r\nto establish a debt where the transaction witnesses could have\r\nsworn, it will be seen, readily enough, how an accident of\r\nprocedure may have led to a most important rule of substantive\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe rule that witnesses could only swear to facts within their\r\nknowledge, coupled with the accident that these witnesses were\r\nnot used in transactions which might create a debt, except for a\r\nparticular fact, namely, the delivery of property, together with\r\nthe further accident that this delivery was quid pro quo, was\r\nequivalent to the rule that, when a debt was proved by witnesses\r\nthere must be quid pro quo. But these debts proved by witnesses,\r\ninstead of by deed are what we call simple contract debts, and\r\nthus beginning with debt, and subsequently extending itself to\r\nother contracts, is established our peculiar and most important\r\ndoctrine that every simple contract must have a consideration.\r\nThis was never the law as to debts or contracts proved in the\r\nusual way by the defendant's seal, and the fact that it applied\r\nonly to obligations which were formerly established by a\r\nprocedure of limited use, [259] goes far to show that the\r\nconnection with procedure was not accidental.\r\n\r\nThe mode of proof soon changed, but as late as the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth we find a trace of this original connection. It is\r\nsaid, \"But the common law requires that there should be a new\r\ncause (i. e. consideration), whereof the country may have\r\nintelligence or knowledge for the trial of it, if need be, so\r\nthat it is necessary for the Public-weal.\" /1/ Lord Mansfield\r\nshowed his intuition of the historical grounds of our law when he\r\nsaid, \"I take it that the ancient notion about the want of\r\nconsideration was for the sake of evidence only; for when it is\r\nreduced into writing, as in covenants, specialties, bonds, etc.,\r\nthere was no objection to the want of consideration.\" /2/\r\n\r\nIf it should be objected that the preceding argument is\r\nnecessarily confined to debt, whereas the requirement of\r\nconsideration applies equally to all simple contracts, the answer\r\nis, that in all probability the rule originated with debt, and\r\nspread from debt to other contracts.\r\n\r\nBut, again, it may be asked whether there were no other contracts\r\nproved by witness except those which have been mentioned. Were\r\nthere no contracts proved in that way to which the accidental\r\nconsideration was wanting? To this also there is an easy answer.\r\nThe contracts enforced by the civil courts, even as late as Henry\r\nII., were few and simple. The witness procedure was no doubt\r\nbroad enough for all the contracts which were made in early\r\ntimes. Besides those of sale, loan, and the like, which have been\r\nmentioned, I find but two contractual [260] obligations. These\r\nwere the warranties accompanying a sale and suretyship which was\r\nreferred to at the beginning of the Lecture. Of the former,\r\nwarranty of title was rather regarded as an obligation raised by\r\nthe law out of the relation of buyer and seller than as a\r\ncontract. Other express warranties were matters within the\r\nknowledge of the transaction witnesses, and were sworn to by them\r\nin Saxon times. /1/\r\n\r\nBut in the Norman period warranty is very little heard of, except\r\nwith regard to land, and then it was decided by the duel. It so\r\nwholly disappeared, except where it was embodied in a deed, that\r\nit can have had no influence upon the law of consideration. I\r\nshall therefore assume, without more detail, that it does not\r\nbear upon the case.\r\n\r\nThen as to the pledge or surety. He no longer paid with his body,\r\nunless in very exceptional cases, but his liability was\r\ntranslated into money, and enforced in an action of debt. This\r\ntime-honored contract, like the other debts of Glanvill's time,\r\ncould be established by witness without a writing, /2/ and in\r\nthis case there was not such a consideration, such a benefit to\r\nthe promisor, as the law required when the doctrine was first\r\nenunciated. But this also is unimportant, because his liability\r\non the oath of witness came to an end, as well as that of the\r\nwarrantor, before the foundations were laid for the rule which I\r\nam seeking to explain. A writing soon came to be required, as\r\nwill be seen in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe result so far is, that the only action of contract in\r\nGlanvill's time was debt, that the only debts recovered [261]\r\nwithout writing were those which have been described, and that\r\nthe only one of these for which there was not quid pro quo ceased\r\nto be recoverable in that way by the reign of Edward III.\r\n\r\nBut great changes were beginning in the reign of Henry II. More\r\nvarious and complex contracts soon came to be enforced. It may be\r\nasked, Why was not the scope of the witness oath enlarged, or, if\r\nany better proof were forthcoming, why was not the secta done\r\naway with, and other oral testimony admitted? In any event, what\r\ncan the law of Henry II.'s time have to do with consideration,\r\nwhich not heard of until centuries later?\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that a witness oath, which disposes of a case by\r\nthe simple fact that it is sworn, is not a satisfactory mode of\r\nproof. A written admission of debt produced in court, and\r\nsufficiently identified as issuing from the defendant, is\r\nobviously much better. The only weak point about a writing is the\r\nmeans of identifying it as the defendant's, and this difficulty\r\ndisappeared as soon as the use of seals became common. This had\r\nmore or less taken place in Glanvill's time, and then all that a\r\nparty had to do was to produce the writing and satisfy the court\r\nby inspection that the impression on the wax fitted his\r\nopponent's seal. /1/ The oath of the secta could always be\r\nsuccessfully met by wager of law, /2/ that is, by a counter oath\r\nthe part of the defendant, with the same or double the number of\r\nfellow-swearers produced by the plaintiff. But a writing proved\r\nto be the defendant's could not be contradicted. [262] /1/ For if\r\na man said he was bound, he was bound. There was no question of\r\nconsideration, because there was as yet no such doctrine. He was\r\nequally bound if he acknowledged all obligation in any place\r\nhaving a record, such as the superior courts, by which his\r\nacknowledgment could be proved. Indeed, to this day some\r\nsecurities are taken simply by an oral admission before the clerk\r\nof a court noted by him in his papers. The advantage of the\r\nwriting was not only that it furnished better proof in the old\r\ncases, but also that it made it possible to enforce obligations\r\nfor which there would otherwise have been no proof at all.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said sufficiently explains the preference of proof\r\nby writing to proof by the old-fashioned witness oath. But there\r\nwere other equally good reasons why the latter should not be\r\nextended beyond its ancient limits. The transaction witnesses\r\nwere losing their statutory and official character. Already in\r\nGlanvill's time the usual modes of proving a debt were by the\r\nduel or by writing. /2/ A hundred years later Bracton shows that\r\nthe secta had degenerated to the retainers and household of the\r\nparty, and he says that their oath raises but a slight\r\npresumption. /3/\r\n\r\nMoreover, a new mode of trial was growing up, which, although it\r\nwas not made use of in these cases /4/ for a good while, must\r\nhave tended to diminish the estimate set on the witness oath by\r\ncontrast. This was the beginning of our trial by jury. It was at\r\nfirst an inquest of the neighbors [263] most likely to know about\r\na disputed matter of fact. They spoke from their own knowledge,\r\nbut they were selected by an officer of the court instead of by\r\nthe interested party, and were intended to be impartial. /1/ Soon\r\nwitnesses were summoned before them, not, as of old, to the case\r\nby their oath, but to aid the inquest to find a verdict by their\r\ntestimony. With the advent of this enlightened procedure, the\r\nsecta soon ceased to decide the case, and it may well be asked\r\nwhy it did not disappear and leave no traces.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the conservatism of the English law, and the\r\nfact that, before deeds came in, the only debts for which there\r\nhad been a remedy were debts proved by the transaction witnesses,\r\nit would not have been a surprise to find the tender of suit\r\npersisting in those cases. But there was another reason still\r\nmore imperative. The defence in debt where there was no deed was\r\nby wager of law. /2/ A section of Magna Charta was interpreted to\r\nprohibit a man's being put to his law on the plaintiff's own\r\nstatement without good witness. /3/ Hence, the statute required\r\nwitness--that is, the secta--in every case of debt where the\r\nplaintiff did not rely upon a writing. Thus it happened that suit\r\ncontinued to be tendered in those cases where it had been of old,\r\n/4/ and as the defendant, if he did not admit the debt in such\r\ncases, always waged his law, it was long before the inquest got\r\nmuch foothold.\r\n\r\nTo establish a debt which arose merely by way of promise or\r\nacknowledgment, and for which there had formerly [264] been no\r\nmode of trial provided, you must have a writing, the new form of\r\nproof which introduced it into the law. The rule was laid down,\r\n\"by parol the party is not obliged.\" /1/ But the old debts were\r\nnot conceived of as raised by a promise. /2/ They were a \"duty\"\r\nspringing from the plaintiff's receipt of property, a fact which\r\ncould be seen and sworn to. In these cases the old law maintained\r\nand even extended itself a little by strict analogy.\r\n\r\nBut the undertaking of a surety, in whatever form it was clothed,\r\ndid not really arise out of any such fact. It had become of the\r\nsame nature as other promises, and it was soon doubted whether it\r\nshould not be proved by the same evidence. /3/ By the reign of\r\nEdward III., it was settled that a deed was necessary, /4/ except\r\nwhere the customs of particular cities had kept the old law in\r\nforce. /5/\r\n\r\nThis reign may be taken as representing the time when the\r\ndivisions and rules of procedure were established which have\r\nlasted until the present day. It is therefore worth while to\r\nrepeat and sum up the condition of the law at that time.\r\n\r\nIt was still necessary that the secta should be tendered in every\r\naction of debt for which no writing was produced. For this, as\r\nwell as for the other reasons which have been mentioned, the\r\nsphere of such actions was not materially enlarged beyond those\r\ncases which had formerly been established by the witness-oath.\r\nAs suretyship was no [265] longer one of these, they became\r\nstrictly limited to cases in which the debt arose from the\r\nreceipt of a quid pro quo. Moreover there was no other action of\r\ncontract which could be maintained without a writing. New species\r\nof contracts were now enforced by an action of covenant, but\r\nthere a deed was always necessary. At the same time the secta had\r\nshrunk to a form, although it was still argued that its function\r\nwas more important in contract than elsewhere. It could no longer\r\nbe examined before the court. /1/ It was a mere survival, and the\r\ntransaction witness had ceased to be an institution. Hence, the\r\nnecessity of tendering the witness oath did not fix the limit of\r\ndebt upon simple contract except by tradition, and it is not\r\nsurprising to find that the action was slightly extended by\r\nanalogy from its scope in Glanvill's time.\r\n\r\nBut debt remained substantially at the point which I have\r\nindicated, and no new action available for simple contracts was\r\nintroduced for a century. In the mean time the inversion which I\r\nhave explained took place, and what was an accident of procedure\r\nhad become a doctrine of substantive law. The change was easy\r\nwhen the debts which could be enforced without deed all sprung\r\nfrom a benefit to the debtor.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Roman law, no doubt, aided in bringing about\r\nthis result. It will be remembered that in the reign of Henry II.\r\nmost simple contracts and debts for which there was not the\r\nevidence of deed or witness were left to be enforced by the\r\necclesiastical courts, so far as their jurisdiction extended. /2/\r\nPerhaps it was this circumstance [266] which led Glanvill and his\r\nsuccessors to apply the terminology of the civilians to\r\ncommon-law debts. But whether he borrowed it from the\r\necclesiastical courts, or went directly to the fountain-head,\r\ncertain it is that Glanvill makes use of the classification and\r\ntechnical language of the Corpus Juris throughout his tenth book.\r\n\r\nThere were certain special contracts in the Roman system called\r\nreal, which bound the contractor either to return a certain thing\r\nput into his hands by the contractee, as in a case of lease or\r\nloan, or to deliver other articles of the same kind, as when\r\ngrain, oil, or money was lent. This class did not correspond,\r\nexcept in the most superficial way, with the common-law debts.\r\nBut Glanvill adopted the nomenclature, and later writers began to\r\ndraw conclusions from it. The author of Fleta, a writer by no\r\nmeans always intelligent in following and adopting his\r\npredecessors' use of the Roman law, /1/ says that to raise a debt\r\nthere must be not only a certain thing promised, but a certain\r\nthing promised in return. /2/\r\n\r\nIf Fleta had confined his statement to debts by simple contract,\r\nit might well have been suggested by the existing state of the\r\nlaw. But as he also required a writing and a seal, in addition to\r\nthe matter given or promised in return, the doctrine laid down by\r\nhim can hardly have prevailed at any time. It was probably\r\nnothing more than a slight vagary of reasoning based upon the\r\nRoman elements which he borrowed from Bracton.\r\n\r\n[267] It only remains to trace the gradual appearance of\r\nconsideration in the decisions. A case of the reign of Edward\r\nIII. /1/ seems to distinguish between a parol obligation founded\r\non voluntary payments by the obligee and one founded on a payment\r\nat the obligor's request. It also speaks of the debt or \"duty\" in\r\nthat case as arising by cause of payments. Somewhat similar\r\nlanguage is used in the next reign. /2/ So, in the twelfth year\r\nof Henry IV., /3/ there is an approach to the thought: \"If money\r\nis promised to a man for making a release, and he makes the\r\nrelease, he will have a good action of debt in the matter.\" In\r\nthe next reign /4/ it was decided that, in such a case, the\r\nplaintiff could not recover without having executed the release,\r\nwhich is explained by the editor on the ground that ex nudo pacto\r\nnon oritur actio. But the most important fact is, that from\r\nEdward I. to Henry VI. we find no case where a debt was\r\nrecovered, unless a consideration had in fact been received.\r\n\r\nAnother fact to be noticed is, that since Edward III. debts\r\narising from a transaction without writing are said to arise from\r\ncontract, as distinguished from debts arising from an obligation.\r\n/5/ Hence, when consideration was required as such, it was\r\nrequired in contracts not under seal, whether debts or not. Under\r\nHenry VI. quid pro quo became a necessity in all such contracts.\r\nIn the third year of that reign /6/ it was objected to au action\r\nupon an [268] assumpsit for not building a mill, that it was not\r\nshown what the defendant was to have for doing it. In the\r\nthirty-sixth year of the same reign (A.D. 1459), the doctrine\r\nappears full grown, and is assumed to be familiar. /1/\r\n\r\nThe case turned upon a question which was debated for centuries\r\nbefore it was settled, whether debt would lie for a sum of money\r\npromised by the defendant to the plaintiff if he would marry the\r\ndefendant's daughter. But whereas formerly the debate had been\r\nwhether the promise was not so far incident to the marriage that\r\nit belonged exclusively to the jurisdiction of the spiritual\r\ncourts, it now touched the purely mundane doubt whether the\r\ndefendant had had quid pro quo.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the fact formerly sworn to by the\r\ntransaction witnesses was a benefit to the defendant, namely, a\r\ndelivery of the things sold or the money lent to him. Such cases,\r\nalso, offer the most obvious form of consideration. The natural\r\nquestion is, what the promisor was to have for his promise. /2/\r\nIt is only by analysis that the supposed policy of the law is\r\nseen to be equally satisfied by a detriment incurred by the\r\npromisee. It therefore not unnaturally happened that the judges,\r\nwhen they first laid down the law that there must be quid pro\r\nquo, were slow to recognize a detriment to the contractee as\r\nsatisfying the requirement which had been laid down. In the case\r\nwhich I have mentioned some of the judges were inclined to hold\r\nthat getting rid of his daughter was a sufficient benefit to the\r\ndefendant to make him a debtor for the money which he promised;\r\nand there was even some hint of the opinion, that marrying the\r\nlady was a [269] consideration, because it was a detriment to the\r\npromisee. /1/ But the other opinion prevailed, at least for a\r\ntime, because the defendant had had nothing from the plaintiff to\r\nraise a debt. /2/\r\n\r\nSo it was held that a service rendered to a third person upon the\r\ndefendant's request and promise of a reward would not be enough,\r\n/3/ although not without strong opinions to the contrary, and for\r\na time the precedents were settled. It became established law\r\nthat an action of debt would only lie upon a consideration\r\nactually received by and enuring to the benefit of the debtor.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, no peculiarity of either the action or contract\r\nof debt which led to this view, but the imperfectly developed\r\ntheory of consideration prevailing between the reigns of Henry\r\nVI. and Elizabeth. The theory the same in assumpsit, /4/ and in\r\nequity. /5/ Wherever consideration was mentioned, it was always\r\nas quid pro quo, as what the contractor was to have for his\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nMoreover, before consideration was ever heard of, debt was the\r\ntime-honored remedy on every obligation to pay money enforced by\r\nlaw, except the liability to damages for a wrong. /6/ It has been\r\nshown already that a surety could be sued in debt until the time\r\nof Edward III. without a writing, yet a surety receives no\r\nbenefit from the dealing with his principal. For instance, if a\r\nman sells corn to A, [270] and B says, \"I will pay if A does\r\nnot,\" the sale does B no good so far as appears by the terms of\r\nthe bargain. For this reason, debt cannot now be maintained\r\nagainst a surety in such a case.\r\n\r\nIt was not always so. It is not so to this day if there is an\r\nobligation under seal. In that case, it does not matter how the\r\nobligation arose, or whether there was any consideration for it\r\nor not. But a writing was a more general way of establishing a\r\ndebt in Glanvill's time than witness, and it is absurd to\r\ndetermine the scope of the action by considering only a single\r\nclass of debts enforced by it. Moreover, a writing for a long\r\ntime was only another, although more conclusive, mode of proof.\r\nThe foundation of the action was the same, however it was proved.\r\nThis was a duty or \"duity\" /1/ to the plaintiff, in other words,\r\nthat money was due him, no matter how, as any one may see by\r\nreading the earlier Year Books. Hence it was, that debt lay\r\nequally upon a judgment, /2/ which established such a duty by\r\nmatter of record, or upon the defendant's admission recorded in\r\nlike manner. /3/\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the action of debt has passed through three stages. At\r\nfirst, it was the only remedy to recover money due, except when\r\nthe liability was simply to pay damages for a wrongful act. It\r\nwas closely akin to--indeed it was but a branch of--the action\r\nfor any form of personal property which the defendant was bound\r\nby contract or otherwise to hand over to the plaintiff. /4/ If\r\nthere was a contract to pay money, the only question was how you\r\n[271] could prove it. Any such contract, which could be proved by\r\nany of the means known to early law, constituted a debt. There\r\nwas no theory of consideration, and therefore, of course, no\r\nlimit to either the action or the contract based upon the nature\r\nof the consideration received.\r\n\r\nThe second stage was when the doctrine of consideration was\r\nintroduced in its earlier form of a benefit to the promisor. This\r\napplied to all contracts not under seal while it prevailed, but\r\nit was established while debt was the only action for money\r\npayable by such contracts. The precedents are, for the most part,\r\nprecedents in debt.\r\n\r\nThe third stage was reached when a larger view was taken of\r\nconsideration, and it was expressed in terms of detriment to the\r\npromisee. This change was a change in substantive law, and\r\nlogically it should have been applied throughout. But it arose in\r\nanother and later form of action, under circumstances peculiarly\r\nconnected with that action, as will be explained hereafter. The\r\nresult was that the new doctrine prevailed in the new action, and\r\nthe old in the old, and that what was really the anomaly of\r\ninconsistent theories carried out side by side disguised itself\r\nin the form of a limitation upon the action of debt. That action\r\ndid not remain, as formerly, the remedy for all binding contracts\r\nto pay money, but, so far as parol contracts were concerned,\r\ncould only be used where the consideration was a benefit actually\r\nreceived by the promisor. With regard to obligations arising in\r\nany other way, it has remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nI must now devote a few words to the effect upon our law of the\r\nother mode of proof which I have mentioned. I mean charters. A\r\ncharter was simply a writing. As few could write, most people had\r\nto authenticate a document [272] in some other way, for instance,\r\nby making their mark. This was, in fact, the universal practice\r\nin England until the introduction of Norman customs. /1/ With\r\nthem seals came in. But as late as Henry II. they were said by\r\nthe Chief Justice of England to belong properly only to kings and\r\nto very great men. /2/ I know no ground for thinking that an\r\nauthentic charter had any less effect at that time when not under\r\nseal than when it was sealed. /3/ It was only evidence either\r\nway, and is called so in many of the early cases. /4/ It could be\r\nwaived, and suit tendered in its place. /5/ Its conclusive effect\r\nwas due to the satisfactory nature of the evidence, not to the\r\nseal. /6/\r\n\r\nBut when seals came into use they obviously made the evidence of\r\nthe charter better, in so far as the seal was more difficult to\r\nforge than a stroke of the pen. Seals acquired such importance,\r\nthat, for a time, a man was bound by his seal, although it was\r\naffixed without his consent. /7/ At last a seal came to be\r\nrequired, in order that a charter should have its ancient effect.\r\n/8/\r\n\r\nA covenant or contract under seal was no longer a promise well\r\nproved; it was a promise of a distinct nature, for which a\r\ndistinct form of action came to be provided. [273] /1/ I have\r\nshown how the requirement of consideration became a rule of\r\nsubstantive law, and also why it never had any foothold in the\r\ndomain of covenants. The exception of covenants from the\r\nrequirement became a rule of substantive law also. The man who\r\nhad set his hand to a charter, from being bound because he had\r\nconsented to be, and because there was a writing to prove it, /2/\r\nwas now held by force of the seal and by deed alone as\r\ndistinguished from all other writings. And to maintain the\r\nintegrity of an inadequate theory, a seal was said to a\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it is sometimes thought more philosophical to say that\r\na covenant is a formal contract, which survives alongside of the\r\nordinary consensual contract, just as happened in the Roman law.\r\nBut this is not a very instructive way of putting it either. In\r\none sense, everything is form which the law requires in order to\r\nmake a promise binding over and above the mere expression of the\r\npromisor's will. Consideration is a form as much as a seal. The\r\nonly difference is, that one form is of modern introduction, and\r\nhas a foundation in good sense, or at least in with our common\r\nhabits of thought, so that we do not notice it, whereas the other\r\nis a survival from an older condition of the law, and is less\r\nmanifestly sensible, or less familiar. I may add, that, under the\r\ninfluence of the latter consideration, the law of covenants is\r\nbreaking down. In many States it is held that a mere scroll or\r\nflourish of the pen is a sufficient seal. From this it is a short\r\nstep to abolish the distinction between sealed and unsealed\r\ninstruments altogether, and this has been done in some of the\r\nWestern States.\r\n\r\n[274] While covenants survive in a somewhat weak old age, and\r\ndebt has disappeared, leaving a vaguely disturbing influence\r\nbehind it, the whole modern law of contract has grown up through\r\nthe medium of the action of Assumpsit, which must now be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nAfter the Norman conquest all ordinary actions were begun by a\r\nwrit issuing from the king, and ordering the defendant to be\r\nsummoned before the court to answer the plaintiff. These writs\r\nwere issued as a matter of course, in the various well-known\r\nactions from which they took their names. There were writs of\r\ndebt and of covenant; there were writs of trespass for forcible\r\ninjuries to the plaintiff's person, or to property in his\r\npossession, and so on. But these writs were only issued for the\r\nactions which were known to the law, and without a writ the court\r\nhad no authority to try a case. In the time of Edward I. there\r\nwere but few of such actions. The cases in which you could\r\nrecover money of another fell into a small number of groups, for\r\neach of which there was a particular form of suing and stating\r\nyour claim.\r\n\r\nThese forms had ceased to be adequate. Thus there were many cases\r\nwhich did not exactly fall within the definition of a trespass,\r\nbut for which it was proper that a remedy should be furnished. In\r\norder to furnish a remedy, the first thing to be done was to\r\nfurnish a writ. Accordingly, the famous statute of 13 Edward I.,\r\nc. 24, authorized the office from which the old writs issued to\r\nframe new ones in cases similar in principle to those for which\r\nwrits were found, and requiring like remedy, but not exactly\r\nfalling within the scope of the writs already in use.\r\n\r\nThus writs of trespass on the case began to make their\r\nappearance; that is, writs stating a ground of complaint [275] to\r\na trespass, but not quite amounting to a trespass as it had been\r\nsued for in the older precedents. To take an instance which is\r\nsubstantially one of the earliest cases, suppose that a man left\r\na horse with a blacksmith to be shod, and he negligently drove a\r\nnail into the horse's foot. It might be that the owner of the\r\nhorse could not have one of the old writs, because the horse was\r\nnot in his possession when the damage was done. A strict trespass\r\nproperty could only be committed against the person in possession\r\nof it. It could not be committed by one who was in possession\r\nhimself. /1/ But as laming the horse was equally a wrong, whether\r\nthe owner held the horse by the bridle or left it with the smith,\r\nand as the wrong was closely analogous to a trespass, although\r\nnot one, the law gave the owner a writ of trespass on the case.\r\n/2/\r\n\r\nAn example like this raises no difficulty; it is as much an\r\naction of tort for a wrong as trespass itself. No contract was\r\nstated, and none was necessary on principle. But this does not\r\nbelong to the class of cases to be considered, for the problem\r\nbefore us is to trace the origin of assumpsit, which is an action\r\nof contract. Assumpsit, however, began as an action of trespass\r\non the case, and the thing to be discovered is how trespass on\r\nthe case ever became available for a mere breach of agreement.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to examine some of the earliest cases in which an\r\nundertaking (assumpsit) was alleged. The first reported in the\r\nbooks is of the reign of Edward III. /3/ The plaintiff alleged\r\nthat the defendant undertook to carry the plaintiff's horse\r\nsafely across the Humber, but surcharged [276] the boat, by\r\nreason of which the horse perished. It was objected that the\r\naction should have been either covenant for breach of the\r\nagreement, or else trespass. But it was answered that the\r\ndefendant committed a wrongful act when he surcharged the boat,\r\nand the objection was overruled. This case again, although an\r\nundertaking was stated, hardly introduced a new principle. The\r\nforce did not proceed directly from the defendant, to be sure,\r\nbut it was brought to bear by the combination of his overloading\r\nand then pushing into the stream.\r\n\r\nThe next case is of the same reign, and goes further. /1/ The\r\nwrit set forth that the defendant undertook to cure the\r\nplaintiff's horse of sickness (manucepit equum praedicti W. de\r\ninfirmirate), and did his work so negligently that the horse\r\ndied. This differs from the case of laming the horse with a nail\r\nin two respects. It does not charge any forcible act, nor indeed\r\nany act at all, but a mere omission. On the other hand, it states\r\nan undertaking, which the other did not. The defendant at once\r\nobjected that this was an action for a breach of an undertaking,\r\nand that the plaintiff should have brought covenant. The\r\nplaintiff replied, that he could not do that without a deed, and\r\nthat the action was for negligently causing the death of the\r\nhorse; that is, for a tort, not for a breach of contract. Then,\r\nsaid the defendant, you might have had trespass. But the\r\nplaintiff answered that by saying that the horse was not killed\r\nby force, but died per def. de sa cure; and upon this argument\r\nthe writ was adjudged good, Thorpe, J. saying that he had seen a\r\nman indicted for killing a patient by want of care (default in\r\ncuring), whom he had undertaken to cure.\r\n\r\n[277] Both these cases, it will be seen, were dealt with by the\r\ncourt as pure actions of tort, notwithstanding the allegation of\r\nan undertaking on the part of the defendant. But it will also be\r\nseen that they are successively more remote from an ordinary case\r\nof trespass. In the case last stated, especially, the destroying\r\nforce did not proceed from the defendant in any sense. And thus\r\nwe are confronted with the question, What possible analogy could\r\nhave been found between a wrongful act producing harm, and a\r\nfailure to act at all?\r\n\r\nI attempt to answer it, let me illustrate a little further by\r\nexamples of somewhat later date. Suppose a man undertook to work\r\nupon another's house, and by his unskilfulness spoiled his\r\nemployer's timbers; it would be like a trespass, although not\r\none, and the employer would sue in trespass on the case. This was\r\nstated as clear law by one of the judges in the reign of Henry\r\nIV. /1/ But suppose that, instead of directly spoiling the\r\nmaterials, the carpenter had simply left a hole in the roof\r\nthrough which the rain had come in and done the damage. The\r\nanalogy to the previous case is marked, but we are a step farther\r\naway from trespass, because the force does not come from the\r\ndefendant. Yet in this instance also the judges thought that\r\ntrespass on the case would lie. /2/ In the time of Henry IV. the\r\naction could not have been maintained for a simple refusal to\r\nbuild according to agreement; but it was suggested by the court,\r\nthat, if the writ had mentioned \"that the thing had been\r\ncommenced and then by not done, it would have been otherwise.\"\r\n/3/\r\n\r\n[278] I now recur to the question, What likeness could there have\r\nbeen between an omission and a trespass sufficient to warrant a\r\nwrit of trespass on the case? In order to find an answer it is\r\nessential to notice that in all the earlier cases the omission\r\noccurred in the course of dealing with the plaintiff's person or\r\nproperty, and occasioned damage to the one or the other. In view\r\nof this fact, Thorpe's reference to indictments for killing a\r\npatient by want of care, and the later distinction between\r\nneglect before and after the task is commenced, are most\r\npregnant. The former becomes still more suggestive when it is\r\nremembered that this is the first argument or analogy to be found\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of that analogy is plain. Although a man has a\r\nperfect right to stand by and see his neighbor's property\r\ndestroyed, or, for the matter of that, to watch his neighbor\r\nperish for want of his help, yet if he once intermeddles he has\r\nno longer the same freedom. He cannot withdraw at will. To give a\r\nmore specific example, if a surgeon from benevolence cuts the\r\numbilical cord of a newly-born child, he cannot stop there and\r\nwatch the patient bleed to death. It would be murder wilfully to\r\nallow death to come to pass in that way, as much as if the\r\nintention had been entertained at the time of cutting the cord.\r\nIt would not matter whether the wickedness began with the act, or\r\nwith the subsequent omission.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning applies to civil liability. A carpenter need\r\nnot go to work upon another man's house at all, but if he accepts\r\nthe other's confidence and intermeddles, he cannot stop at will\r\nand leave the roof open to the weather. So in the case of the\r\nfarrier, when he had taken charge of the horse, he could not stop\r\nat the critical moment [279] and leave the consequences to\r\nfortune. So, still more clearly, when the ferryman undertook to\r\ncarry a horse across the Humber, although the water drowned the\r\nhorse, his remote acts of overloading his boat and pushing it\r\ninto the stream in that condition occasioned the loss, and he was\r\nanswerable for it.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases the duty was independent of contract, or\r\nat least was so regarded by the judges who decided them, and\r\nstood on the general rules applied to human conduct even by the\r\ncriminal law. The immediate occasion of the damage complained of\r\nmay have been a mere omission letting in the operation of natural\r\nforces. But if you connect it, as it was connected in fact, with\r\nthe previous dealings, you have a course of action and conduct\r\nwhich, taken as a whole, has caused or occasioned the harm.\r\n\r\nThe objection may be urged, to be sure, that there is a\r\nconsiderable step from holding a man liable for the consequences\r\nof his acts which he might have prevented, to making him\r\nanswerable for not having interfered with the course of nature\r\nwhen he neither set it in motion nor opened the door for it to do\r\nharm, and that there is just that difference between making a\r\nhole in a roof and leaving it open, or cutting the cord and\r\nletting it bleed, on the one side, and the case of a farrier who\r\nreceives a sick horse and omits proper precautions, on the other.\r\n/1/\r\n\r\nThere seem to be two answers to this. First, it is not clear that\r\nsuch a distinction was adverted to by the court which decided the\r\ncase which I have mentioned. It was alleged that the defendant\r\nperformed his cure so negligently that the horse died. It might\r\nnot have occurred to [280] the judges that the defendant's\r\nconduct possibly went no further than the omission of a series of\r\nbeneficial measures. It was probably assumed to have consisted of\r\na combination of acts and neglects, which taken as a whole\r\namounted to an improper dealing with the thing.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, it is doubtful whether the distinction is a\r\nsound one on practical grounds. It may well be that, so long as\r\none allows a trust to be reposed in him, he is bound to use such\r\nprecautions as are known to him, although he has made no\r\ncontract, and is at liberty to renounce the trust in any\r\nreasonable manner. This view derives some support from the issue\r\non which the parties went to trial, which was that the defendant\r\nperformed the cure as well as he knew how, without this, that the\r\nhorse died for default of his care (cure?). /1/\r\n\r\nBut it cannot be denied that the allegation of an undertaking\r\nconveyed the idea of a promise, as well as that of an entering\r\nupon the business in hand. Indeed, the latter element is\r\nsufficiently conveyed, perhaps, without it. It may be asked,\r\ntherefore, whether the promise did not count for something in\r\nraising a duty to act. So far as this involves the consequence\r\nthat the action was in fact for the breach of a contract, the\r\nanswer has been given already, and is sustained by too great a\r\nweight of authority to be doubted. /2/ To bind the defendant by a\r\ncontract, an instrument under seal was essential. As has been\r\nshown, already, even the ancient sphere of debt had been limited\r\nby this requirement, and in the time of Edward III. a deed was\r\nnecessary even to bind a surety. It was so [281] a fortiori to\r\nintroduce a liability upon promises not enforced by the ancient\r\nlaw. Nevertheless, the suggestion was made at an early date, that\r\nan action on the case for damage by negligence, that is, by an\r\nomission of proper precautions, alleging an undertaking by way of\r\ninducement, was in fact an action of contract.\r\n\r\nFive years after the action for negligence in curing a horse,\r\nwhich has been stated, an action was brought /1/ in form against\r\na surgeon, alleging that he undertook to cure the plaintiff's\r\nhand, and that by his negligence the hand was maimed. There was,\r\nhowever, this difference, that it was set forth that the\r\nplaintiff's hand had been wounded by one T.B. And hence it\r\nappeared that, however much the bad treatment may have aggravated\r\nmatters, the maiming was properly attributable to T.B., and that\r\nthe plaintiff had an action against him. This may have led the\r\ndefendant to adopt the course he did, because he felt uncertain\r\nwhether any action of tort would lie. He took issue on the\r\nundertaking, assuming that to be essential to the plaintiff's\r\ncase, and then objected that the writ did not show the place of\r\nthe undertaking, and hence was bad, because it did not show\r\nwhence the inquest should be summoned to speak to that point. The\r\nwrit was adjudged bad on that ground, which seems as if the court\r\nsanctioned the defendant's view. Indeed, one of the judges called\r\nit an action of covenant, and said that \"of necessity it was\r\nmaintainable without specialty, because for so small a matter a\r\nman cannot always have a clerk at hand to write a deed\" (pur\r\nfaire especially). At the same time the earlier cases which [282]\r\nhave been mentioned were cited and relied on, and it is evident\r\nthat the court was not prepared to go beyond them, or to hold\r\nthat the action could be maintained on its merits apart from the\r\ntechnical objection. In another connection it seems to have\r\nconsidered the action from the point of view of trespass. /1/\r\n\r\nWhatever questions this case may suggest, the class of actions\r\nwhich alleged an undertaking on the part of the defendant\r\ncontinued to be dealt with as actions of tort for a long time\r\nafter Edward III. The liability was limited to damage to person\r\nor property arising after the defendant had entered upon the\r\nemployment. And it was mainly through reasoning drawn from the\r\nlaw of tort that it was afterwards extended, as will be seen.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the reign of Henry VI. it was probably still\r\nthe law that the action would not lie for a simple failure to\r\nkeep a promise. /2/ But it had been several times suggested, as\r\nhas been shown, that it would be otherwise if the omission or\r\nneglect occurred in the course of performance, and the\r\ndefendant's conduct had been followed by physical damage. /3/\r\nThis suggestion took its most striking form in the early years of\r\nHenry VI., when the case of the carpenter leaving a hole in the\r\nroof was put. /4/ When the courts had got as far as this, it was\r\neasy to go one step farther, and to allow the same effect to an\r\nomission at any stage, followed by similar damage.\r\n\r\n[283] What is the difference in principle, it was asked, a few\r\nyears later, /1/ between the cases where it is admitted that the\r\naction will lie, and that of a smith who undertakes to shoe a\r\nhorse and does not, by reason of which the horse goes lame,--or\r\nthat of a lawyer, who undertakes to argue your case, and, after\r\nthus inducing you to rely upon him, neglects to be present, so\r\nthat you lose it? It was said that in the earlier instances the\r\nduty was dependent on or accessory to the covenant, and that, if\r\nthe action would lie on the accessory matter, it would lie on the\r\nprincipal. /2/ It was held on demurrer that an action would lie\r\nfor not procuring certain releases which the defendant had\r\nundertaken to get.\r\n\r\nFive years later another case /3/ came up, which was very like\r\nthat of the farrier in the reign of Edward III. It was alleged\r\nthat the defendant undertook to cure the plaintiff's horse, and\r\napplied medicine so negligently that the horse died. In this, as\r\nin the earlier case, the issue was taken on the assumpsit. And\r\nnow the difference between an omission and an act was clearly\r\nstated, the declaration was held not to mean necessarily anything\r\nmore than an omission, and it was said that but for the\r\nundertaking the defendant would have owed no duty to act. Hence\r\nthe allegation of the defendant's promise was material, and an\r\nissue could properly be taken on it.\r\n\r\nThis decision distinctly separated from the mass of actions on\r\nthe case a special class arising out of a promise as the source\r\nof the defendant's obligation, and it was only a matter of time\r\nfor that class to become a new and distinct [284] action of\r\ncontract. Had this change taken place at once, the doctrine of\r\nconsideration, which was first definitely enunciated about the\r\nsame time, would no doubt have been applied, and a quid pro quo\r\nwould have been required for the undertaking. /1/ But the notion\r\nof tort was not at once abandoned. The law was laid down at the\r\nbeginning of the reign of Henry VII., in accordance with the\r\nearlier decisions, and it was said that the action would not lie\r\nfor a failure to keep a promise, but only for negligence after\r\nthe defendant had entered upon his undertaking. /2/\r\n\r\nSo far as the action did not exceed the true limits of tort, it\r\nwas immaterial whether there was a consideration for the\r\nundertaking or not. But when the mistake was made of supposing\r\nthat all cases, whether proper torts or not, in which an\r\nassumpsit was alleged, were equally founded on the promise, one\r\nof two erroneous conclusions was naturally thought to follow.\r\nEither no assumpsit needed any quid pro quo, /3/ as there was\r\nclearly none in the older precedents, (they being cases of pure\r\ntort,) or else those precedents were wrong, and a quid pro quo\r\nshould be alleged in every case. It was long recognized with more\r\nor less understanding of the true limit, that, in cases where the\r\ngist of the action was negligent damage to property, a\r\nconsideration was not necessary. /4/ And there are some traces of\r\nthe notion that it was always superfluous, as late as Charles I.\r\n\r\n[285] In a case of that reign, the defendant retained an attorney\r\nto act in a suit for a third person, and promised to pay him all\r\nhis fees and expenses. The attorney rendered the service, and\r\nthen brought debt. It was objected that debt did not lie, because\r\nthere was no contract between the parties, and the defendant had\r\nnot any quid pro quo. The court adopted the argument, and said\r\nthat there was no contract or consideration to ground this\r\naction, but that the plaintiff might have sued in assumpsit. /1/\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, the lingering of this idea, and the often\r\nrepeated notion that an assumpsit was not a contract, /2/ to\r\nwhich was attributable a more enlarged theory of consideration\r\nthan prevailed in debt. It was settled that assumpsit would lie\r\nfor a mere omission or nonfeasance. The cases which have been\r\nmentioned of the reign of Henry VI. were followed by others in\r\nthe latter years of Henry VII., /3/ and it was never again\r\ndoubted. An action for such a cause was clearly for a breach of\r\npromise, as had been recognized from the time of Edward III. If\r\nso, a consideration was necessary. /4/ Notwithstanding occasional\r\nvagaries, that also had been settled or taken for granted in many\r\ncases of Queen Elizabeth's time. But the bastard origin of the\r\naction which gave rise to the doubt how far any consideration at\r\nall was necessary, made it possible to hold considerations\r\nsufficient which had been in debt.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance may not have been without its influence. It\r\nwould seem that, in the period when assumpsit [286] was just\r\ngrowing into its full proportions, there was some little\r\ninclination to identify consideration with the Roman causa, taken\r\nin its broadest sense. The word \"cause\" was used for\r\nconsideration in the early years of Elizabeth, with reference to\r\na covenant to stand seized to uses. /1/ It was used in the same\r\nsense in the action of assumpsit. /2/ In the last cited report,\r\nalthough the principal case only laid down a doctrine that would\r\nbe followed to-day, there was also stated an anonymous case which\r\nwas interpreted to mean that an executed consideration furnished\r\nupon request, but without any promise of any kind, would support\r\na subsequent promise to pay for it. /3/ Starting from this\r\nauthority and the word \"cause,\" the conclusion was soon reached\r\nthat there was a great difference between a contract and an\r\nassumpsit; and that, whereas in contracts \"everything which is\r\nrequisite ought to concur and meet together, viz. the\r\nconsideration of the one side, and the sale or the promise on the\r\nother side,... to maintain an action upon an assumpsit, the same\r\nis not requisite, for it is sufficient if there be a moving cause\r\nor consideration precedent; for which cause or consideration the\r\npromise was made.\" /4/\r\n\r\nThus, where the defendant retained the plaintiff to be [287] to\r\nhis aunt at ten shillings a week, it was held that assumpsit\r\nwould lie, because the service, though not beneficial to the\r\ndefendant, was a charge or detriment to the plaintiff. /1/ The\r\nold questions were reargued, and views which were very near\r\nprevailing in debt under Henry VI., prevailed in assumpsit under\r\nElizabeth and James.\r\n\r\nA surety could be sued in assumpsit, although he had ceased to be\r\nliable in debt. /2/ There was the same remedy on a promise in\r\nconsideration that the plaintiff would marry the defendant's\r\ndaughter. /3/ The illusion that assumpsit thus extended did not\r\nmean contract, could not be kept up. In view of this admission\r\nand of the ancient precedents, the law oscillated for a time in\r\nthe direction of reward as the true essence of consideration. /4/\r\nBut the other view prevailed, and thus, in fact, made a change in\r\nthe substantive law. A simple contract, to be recognized as\r\nbinding by the courts of Henry VI., must have been based upon a\r\nbenefit to the debtor; now a promise might be enforced in\r\nconsideration of a detriment to the promisee. But in the true\r\narchaic spirit the doctrine was not separated or distinguished\r\nfrom the remedy which introduced it, and thus debt in modern\r\ntimes has presented the altered appearance of a duty limited to\r\ncases where the consideration was of a special sort.\r\n\r\nThe later fortunes of assumpsit can be briefly told. It\r\nintroduced bilateral contracts, because a promise was a [288]\r\ndetriment, and therefore a sufficient consideration for another\r\npromise. It supplanted debt, because the existence of the duty to\r\npay was sufficient consideration for a promise to pay, or rather\r\nbecause, before a consideration was required, and as soon as\r\nassumpsit would lie for a nonfeasance, this action was used to\r\navoid the defendant's wager of law. It vastly extended the number\r\nof actionable contracts, which had formerly been confined to\r\ndebts and covenants, whereas nearly any promise could be sued in\r\nassumpsit; and it introduced a theory which has had great\r\ninfluence on modern law,--that all the liabilities of a bailee\r\nare founded on contract. /1/ Whether the prominence which was\r\nthus given to contract as the foundation of legal rights and\r\nduties had anything to do with the similar prominence which it\r\nsoon acquired in political speculation, it is beyond my province\r\nto inquire.\r\n\r\n[289]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE VIII. -- CONTRACT. II. ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\nTHE general method to be pursued in the analysis of contract is\r\nthe same as that already explained with regard to possession.\r\nWherever the law gives special rights to one, or imposes special\r\nburdens on another, it does so on the ground that certain special\r\nfacts are true of those individuals. In all such cases,\r\ntherefore, there is a twofold task. First, to determine what are\r\nthe facts to which the special consequences are attached; second,\r\nto ascertain the consequences. The first is the main field of\r\nlegal argument. With regard to contracts the facts are not always\r\nthe same. They may be that a certain person has signed, sealed,\r\nand delivered a writing of a certain purport. They may be that he\r\nhas made an oral promise, and that the promisee has furnished him\r\na consideration.\r\n\r\nThe common element of all contracts might be said to be a\r\npromise, although even a promise was not necessary to a liability\r\nin debt as formerly understood. But as it will not be possible to\r\ndiscuss covenants further, and as consideration formed the main\r\ntopic of the last Lecture, I will take up that first.\r\nFurthermore, as there is an historical difference between\r\nconsideration in debt and in assumpsit, I shall confine myself to\r\nthe latter, which is the later and more philosophical form.\r\n\r\nIt is said that any benefit conferred by the promisee on the\r\npromisor, or any detriment incurred by the promisee, [290] may be\r\na consideration. It is also thought that every consideration may\r\nbe reduced to a case of the latter sort, using the word\r\n\"detriment\" in a somewhat broad sense.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the general doctrine, suppose that a man is\r\ndesirous of having a cask of brandy carried from Boston to\r\nCambridge, and that a truckman, either out of kindness or from\r\nsome other motive, says that he will carry it, and it is\r\ndelivered to him accordingly. If he carelessly staves in the\r\ncask, there would perhaps be no need to allege that he undertook\r\nto carry it, and on principle, and according to the older cases,\r\nif an undertaking was alleged, no consideration for the assumpsit\r\nneed be stated. /1/ The ground of complaint in that case would be\r\na wrong, irrespective of contract. But if the complaint was that\r\nhe did not carry it as agreed, the plaintiff's difficulty would\r\nbe that the truckman was not bound to do so unless there was a\r\nconsideration for his promise. Suppose, therefore, that it was\r\nalleged that he promised to do so in consideration of the\r\ndelivery to him. Would this be a sufficient consideration? The\r\noldest cases, going on the notion of benefit to the promisor,\r\nsaid that it could not be, for it was a trouble, not a benefit.\r\n/2/ Then take it from the side of detriment. The delivery is a\r\nnecessary condition to the promisor's doing the kindness, and if\r\nhe does it, the delivery, so far from being a detriment to the\r\npromisee, is a clear benefit to him.\r\n\r\nBut this argument is a fallacy. Clearly the delivery would be\r\nsufficient consideration to enable the owner to declare in\r\nassumpsit for the breach of those duties which [291] arose,\r\nirrespective of contract, from the defendant's having undertaken\r\nto deal with the thing. /1/ It would be a sufficient\r\nconsideration for any promise not involving a dealing with the\r\nthing for its performance, for instance, to pay a thousand\r\ndollars. /2/ And the law has not pronounced the consideration\r\ngood or bad according to the nature of the promise founded upon\r\nit. The delivery is a sufficient consideration for any promise.\r\n/3/\r\n\r\nThe argument on the other side leaves out of sight the point of\r\ntime at which the sufficiency of the consideration is to be\r\ndetermined. This is the moment when the consideration is\r\nfurnished. At that moment the delivery of the cask is a detriment\r\nin the strictest sense. The owner of the cask has given up a\r\npresent control over it, which he has a right to keep, and he has\r\ngot in return, not a performance for which a delivery was\r\nnecessary, but a mere promise of performance. The performance is\r\nstill future. /4/\r\n\r\nBut it will be seen that, although the delivery may be a\r\nconsideration, it will not necessarily be one. A promise to carry\r\nmight be made and accepted on the understanding that it was mere\r\nmatter of favor, without consideration, and not legally binding.\r\nIn that case the detriment of delivery would be incurred by the\r\npromisee as before, but obviously it would be incurred for the\r\nsole purpose of enabling the promisor to carry as agreed.\r\n\r\n[292] It appears to me that it has not always been sufficiently\r\nborne in mind that the same thing may be a consideration or not,\r\nas it is dealt with by the parties. The popular explanation of\r\nCoggs v. Bernard is, that the delivery was a consideration for a\r\npromise to carry the casks safely. I have given what I believe to\r\nbe the true explanation, and that which I think Lord Holt had in\r\nview, in the fifth Lecture. /1/ But whether that which I have\r\noffered be true or not, a serious objection to the one which is\r\ncommonly accepted is that the declaration does not allege that\r\nthe delivery was the consideration.\r\n\r\nThe same caution should be observed in construing the terms of an\r\nagreement. It is hard to see the propriety of erecting any\r\ndetriment which an instrument may disclose or provide for, into a\r\nconsideration, unless the parties have dealt with it on that\r\nfooting. In many cases a promisee may incur a detriment without\r\nthereby furnishing a consideration. The detriment may be nothing\r\nbut a condition precedent to performance of the promise, as where\r\na man promises another to pay him five hundred dollars if he\r\nbreaks his leg. /2/\r\n\r\nThe courts, however, have gone far towards obliterating this\r\ndistinction. Acts which by a fair interpretation of language\r\nwould seem to have been contemplated as only the compliance with\r\na condition, have been treated as the consideration of the\r\npromise. /3/ And so have counter promises in an agreement which\r\nexpressly stated other matters as the consideration. /4/ So it\r\nshould be mentioned, subject [293] to the question whether there\r\nmay not be a special explanation for the doctrine, that it is\r\nsaid that an assignment of a leasehold cannot be voluntary under\r\nthe statute of 27 Elizabeth, c. 4, because the assignee comes\r\ninto the obligations of the tenant. /1/ Yet the assignee's\r\nincurring this detriment may not be contemplated as the\r\ninducement of the assignment, and in many cases only amounts to a\r\ndeduction from the benefit conferred, as a right of way would be,\r\nespecially if the only obligation is to pay rent, which issues\r\nout of the land in theory of law.\r\n\r\nBut although the courts may have sometimes gone a little far in\r\ntheir anxiety to sustain agreements, there can be no doubt of the\r\nPrinciple which I have laid down, that the same thing may be a\r\nconsideration or not, as it is dealt with by the parties. This\r\nraises the question how a thing must be dealt with, in order to\r\nmake it a consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is said that consideration must not be confounded with motive.\r\nIt is true that it must not be confounded with what may be the\r\nprevailing or chief motive in actual fact. A man may promise to\r\npaint a picture for five hundred dollars, while his chief motive\r\nmay be a desire for fame. A consideration may be given and\r\naccepted, in fact, solely for the purpose of making a promise\r\nbinding. But, nevertheless, it is the essence of a consideration,\r\nthat, by the terms of the agreement, it is given and accepted as\r\nthe motive or inducement of the promise. Conversely, the promise\r\nmust be made and accepted as the conventional motive or\r\ninducement for furnishing the consideration. The root of the\r\nwhole matter is the relation of reciprocal [294] conventional\r\ninducement, each for the other, between consideration and\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nA good example of the former branch of the proposition is to be\r\nfound in a Massachusetts case. The plaintiff refused to let\r\ncertain wood be removed from his land by one who had made an oral\r\nbargain and given his note for it, unless he received additional\r\nsecurity. The purchaser and the plaintiff accordingly went to the\r\ndefendant, and the defendant put his name upon the note. The\r\nplaintiff thereupon let the purchaser carry off the wood. But,\r\naccording to the testimony, the defendant signed without knowing\r\nthat the plaintiff was to alter his position in any way on the\r\nfaith of the signature, and it was held that, if that story was\r\nbelieved, there was no consideration. /1/\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the other half of the rule is to be found in\r\nthose cases where a reward is offered for doing something, which\r\nis afterwards done by a person acting in ignorance of the offer.\r\nIn such a case the reward cannot be claimed, because the alleged\r\nconsideration has not been furnished on the faith of the offer.\r\nThe tendered promise has not induced the furnishing of the\r\nconsideration. The promise cannot be set up as a conventional\r\nmotive when it was not known until after the alleged\r\nconsideration was performed. /2/\r\n\r\nBoth sides of the relation between consideration and promise, and\r\nthe conventional nature of that relation, may be illustrated by\r\nthe case of the cask. Suppose that the [295] truckman is willing\r\nto carry the cask, and the owner to let him carry it, without any\r\nbargain, and that each knows the other's state of mind; but that\r\nthe truckman, seeing his own advantage in the matter, says to the\r\nowner, \"In consideration of your delivering me the cask, and\r\nletting me carry it, I promise to carry it,\" and that the owner\r\nthereupon delivers it. I suppose that the promise would be\r\nbinding. The promise is offered in terms as the inducement for\r\nthe delivery, and the delivery is made in terms as the inducement\r\nfor the promise. It may be very probable that the delivery would\r\nhave been made without a promise, and that the promise would have\r\nbeen made in gratuitous form if it had not been accepted upon\r\nconsideration; but this is only a guess after all. The delivery\r\nneed not have been made unless the owner chose, and having been\r\nmade as the term of a bargain, the promisor cannot set up what\r\nmight have happened to destroy the effect of what did happen. It\r\nwould seem therefore that the same transaction in substance and\r\nspirit might be voluntary or obligatory, according to the form of\r\nwords which the parties chose to employ for the purpose of\r\naffecting the legal consequences.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing principles be accepted, they will be seen to\r\nexplain a doctrine which has given the courts some trouble to\r\nestablish. I mean the doctrine that an executed consideration\r\nwill not sustain a subsequent promise. It has been said, to be\r\nsure, that such a consideration was sufficient if preceded by a\r\nrequest. But the objections to the view are plain. If the request\r\nwas of such a nature, and so put, as reasonably to imply that the\r\nother person was to have a reward, there was an express promise,\r\nalthough not put in words, and that promise was made at [296] the\r\nsame time the consideration was given, and not afterwards. If, on\r\nthe other hand, the words did not warrant the understanding that\r\nthe service was to be paid for, the service was a gift, and a\r\npast gift can no more be a consideration than any other act of\r\nthe promisee not induced by the promise.\r\n\r\nThe source of the error can be traced partially, at least, in\r\nhistory. Some suggestions touching the matter were made in the\r\nlast Lecture. A few words should be added here. In the old cases\r\nof debt, where there was some question whether the plaintiff had\r\nshowed enough to maintain his action, a \"contract precedent\" was\r\nspoken of several times as raising the duty. Thus, where a man\r\nhad granted that he would be bound in one hundred shillings to\r\npay his servant on a certain day for his services, and for\r\npayments made by the servant on his account, it was argued that\r\nthere was no contract precedent, and that by parol the party is\r\nnot obliged; and, further, that, so far as appeared, the payments\r\nwere made by the servant out of his own head and at no request,\r\nfrom which no duty could commence. /1/\r\n\r\nSo when debt was brought on a deed to pay the plaintiff ten\r\nmarks, if he would take the defendant's daughter to wife, and it\r\nwas objected that the action should have been covenant, it was\r\nanswered that the plaintiff had a contract precedent which gave\r\nhim debt. /2/\r\n\r\nThe first case in assumpsit /3/ only meant to adopt this long\r\nfamiliar thought. A man went bail for his friend's servant, who\r\nhad been arrested. Afterwards the master [297] promised to\r\nindemnify the bail, and on his failure to do so was sued by him\r\nin assumpsit. It was held that there was no consideration\r\nwherefore the defendant should be charged unless the master had\r\nfirst promised to indemnify the plaintiff before the servant was\r\nbailed; \"for the master did never make request to the plaintiff\r\nfor his servant to do so much, but he did it of his own head.\"\r\nThis is perfectly plain sailing, and means no more than the case\r\nin the Year Books. The report, however, also states a case in\r\nwhich it was held that a subsequent promise, in consideration\r\nthat the plaintiff at the special instance of the defendant had\r\nmarried the defendant's cousin, was binding, and that the\r\nmarriage was \"good cause... because [it] ensued the request of\r\nthe defendant.\" Whether this was intended to establish a general\r\nprinciple, or was decided with reference to the peculiar\r\nconsideration of marriage, /1/ it was soon interpreted in the\r\nbroader sense, as was shown in the last Lecture. It was several\r\ntimes adjudged that a past and executed matter was a sufficient\r\nconsideration for a promise at a later day, if only the matter\r\nrelied on had been done or furnished at the request of the\r\npromisor. /2/\r\n\r\nIt is now time to analyze the nature of a promise, which is the\r\nsecond and most conspicuous element in a simple contract. The\r\nIndian Contract Act, 1872, Section 2,8 says:--\r\n\r\n \"(a.) When one person signifies to another his willingness [298]\r\nto do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining\r\nthe assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to\r\nmake a proposal:\r\n\r\n \"(b.) When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his\r\nassent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal\r\nwhen accepted becomes a promise.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to this definition the scope of promises is confined to\r\nconduct on the part of the promisor. If this only meant that the\r\npromisor alone must bear the legal burden which his promise may\r\ncreate, it would be true. But this is not the meaning. For the\r\ndefinition is of a promise, not of a legally binding promise. We\r\nare not seeking for the legal effects of a contract, but for the\r\npossible contents of a promise which the law may or may not\r\nenforce. We must therefore only consider the question what can\r\npossibly be promised in a legal sense, not what will be the\r\nsecondary consequence of a promise binding, but not performed.\r\n\r\nAn assurance that it shall rain to-morrow, /1/ or that a third\r\nperson shall paint a picture, may as well be a promise as one\r\nthat the promisee shall receive from some source one hundred\r\nbales of cotton, or that the promisor will pay the promisee one\r\nhundred dollars. What is the difference in the cases? It is only\r\nin the degree of power possessed by the promisor over the event.\r\nHe has none in the first case. He has equally little legal\r\nauthority to make a man paint a picture, although he may have\r\nlarger means of persuasion. He probably will be able to make sure\r\nthat the promisee has the cotton. Being a rich man, he is certain\r\n[299] to be able to pay the one hundred dollars, except in the\r\nevent of some most improbable accident.\r\n\r\nBut the law does not inquire, as a general thing, how far the\r\naccomplishment of an assurance touching the future is within the\r\npower of the promisor. In the moral world it may be that the\r\nobligation of a promise is confined to what lies within reach of\r\nthe will of the promisor (except so far as the limit is unknown\r\non one side, and misrepresented on the other). But unless some\r\nconsideration of public policy intervenes, I take it that a man\r\nmay bind himself at law that any future event shall happen. He\r\ncan therefore promise it in a legal sense. It may be said that\r\nwhen a man covenants that it shall rain to-morrow, or that A\r\nshall paint a picture, he only says, in a short form, I will pay\r\nif it does not rain, or if A does not paint a picture. But that\r\nis not necessarily so. A promise could easily be framed which\r\nwould be broken by the happening of fair weather, or by A not\r\npainting. A promise, then, is simply an accepted assurance that a\r\ncertain event or state of things shall come to pass.\r\n\r\nBut if this be true, it has more important bearings than simply\r\nto enlarge the definition of the word promise. It concerns the\r\ntheory of contract. The consequences of a binding promise at\r\ncommon law are not affected by the degree of power which the\r\npromisor possesses over the promised event. If the promised event\r\ndoes not come to pass, the plaintiff's property is sold to\r\nsatisfy the damages, within certain limits, which the promisee\r\nhas suffered by the failure. The consequences are the same in\r\nkind whether the promise is that it shall rain, or that another\r\nman shall paint a picture, or that the promisor will deliver a\r\nbale of cotton.\r\n\r\n[300] If the legal consequence is the same in all cases, it seems\r\nproper that all contracts should be considered from the same\r\nlegal point of view. In the case of a binding promise that it\r\nshall rain to-morrow, the immediate legal effect of what the\r\npromisor does is, that he takes the risk of the event, within\r\ncertain defined limits, as between himself and the promisee. He\r\ndoes no more when he promises to deliver a bale of cotton.\r\n\r\nIf it be proper to state the common-law meaning of promise and\r\ncontract in this way, it has the advantage of freeing the subject\r\nfrom the superfluous theory that contract is a qualified\r\nsubjection of one will to another, a kind of limited slavery. It\r\nmight be so regarded if the law compelled men to perform their\r\ncontracts, or if it allowed promisees to exercise such\r\ncompulsion. If, when a man promised to labor for another, the law\r\nmade him do it, his relation to his promisee might be called a\r\nservitude ad hoc with some truth. But that is what the law never\r\ndoes. It never interferes until a promise has been broken, and\r\ntherefore cannot possibly be performed according to its tenor. It\r\nis true that in some instances equity does what is called\r\ncompelling specific performance. But, in the first place, I am\r\nspeaking of the common law, and, in the next, this only means\r\nthat equity compels the performance of certain elements of the\r\ntotal promise which are still capable of performance. For\r\ninstance, take a promise to convey land within a certain time, a\r\ncourt of equity is not in the habit of interfering until the time\r\nhas gone by, so that the promise cannot be performed as made. But\r\nif the conveyance is more important than the time, and the\r\npromisee prefers to have it late rather than never, the law may\r\ncompel the performance of [301] that. Not literally compel even\r\nin that case, however, but put the promisor in prison unless he\r\nwill convey. This remedy is an exceptional one. The only\r\nuniversal consequence of a legally binding promise is, that the\r\nlaw makes the promisor pay damages if the promised event does not\r\ncome to pass. In every case it leaves him free from interference\r\nuntil the time for fulfilment has gone by, and therefore free to\r\nbreak his contract if he chooses.\r\n\r\nA more practical advantage in looking at a contract as the taking\r\nof a risk is to be found in the light which it throws upon the\r\nmeasure of damages. If a breach of contract were regarded in the\r\nsame light as a tort, it would seem that if, in the course of\r\nperformance of the contract the promisor should be notified of\r\nany particular consequence which would result from its not being\r\nperformed, he should be held liable for that consequence in the\r\nevent of non-performance. Such a suggestion has been made. /1/\r\nBut it has not been accepted as the law. On the contrary,\r\naccording to the opinion of a very able judge, which seems to be\r\ngenerally followed, notice, even at the time of making the\r\ncontract, of special circumstances out of which special damages\r\nwould arise in case of breach, is not sufficient unless the\r\nassumption of that risk is to be taken as having fairly entered\r\ninto the contract. /2/ If a carrier should undertake to carry the\r\nmachinery of a saw-mill from Liverpool to Vancouver's Island, and\r\nshould fail [302] to do so, he probably would not be held liable\r\nfor the rate of hire of such machinery during the necessary\r\ndelay, although he might know that it could not be replaced\r\nwithout sending to England, unless he was fairly understood to\r\naccept \"the contract with the special condition attached to it.\"\r\n/1/\r\n\r\nIt is true that, when people make contracts, they usually\r\ncontemplate the performance rather than the breach. The express\r\nlanguage used does not generally go further than to define what\r\nwill happen if the contract is fulfilled. A statutory requirement\r\nof a memorandum in writing would be satisfied by a written\r\nstatement of the promise as made, because to require more would\r\nbe to run counter to the ordinary habits of mankind, as well as\r\nbecause the statement that the effect of a contract is the\r\nassumption of the risk of a future event does not mean that there\r\nis a second subsidiary promise to assume that risk, but that the\r\nassumption follows as a consequence directly enforced by the law,\r\nwithout the promisor's co-operation. So parol evidence would be\r\nadmissible, no doubt, to enlarge or diminish the extent of the\r\nliability assumed for nonperformance, where it would be\r\ninadmissible to affect the scope of the promise.\r\n\r\nBut these concessions do not affect the view here taken. As the\r\nrelation of contractor and contractee is voluntary, the\r\nconsequences attaching to the relation must be voluntary. What\r\nthe event contemplated by the promise is, or in other words what\r\nwill amount to a breach of contract, is a matter of\r\ninterpretation and construction. What consequences of the breach\r\nare assumed is more remotely, in like manner, a matter of\r\nconstruction, having regard [303] to the circumstances under\r\nwhich the contract is made. Knowledge of what is dependent upon\r\nperformance is one of those circumstances. It is not necessarily\r\nconclusive, but it may have the effect of enlarging the risk\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nThe very office of construction is to work out, from what is\r\nexpressly said and done, what would have been said with regard to\r\nevents not definitely before the minds of the parties, if those\r\nevents had been considered. The price paid in mercantile\r\ncontracts generally excludes the construction that exceptional\r\nrisks were intended to be assumed. The foregoing analysis is\r\nbelieved to show that the result which has been reached by the\r\ncourts on grounds of practical good sense, falls in with the true\r\ntheory of contract under the common law.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the nature of a promise has led me to analyze\r\ncontract and the consequences of contract somewhat in advance of\r\ntheir place. I must say a word more concerning the facts which\r\nconstitute a promise. It is laid down, with theoretical truth,\r\nthat, besides the assurance or offer on the one side, there must\r\nbe an acceptance on the other. But I find it hard to think of a\r\ncase where a simple contract fails to be made, which could not be\r\naccounted for on other grounds, generally by the want of relation\r\nbetween assurance or offer and consideration as reciprocal\r\ninducements each of the other. Acceptance of an offer usually\r\nfollows by mere implication from the furnishing of the\r\nconsideration; and inasmuch as by our law an accepted offer, or\r\npromise, until the consideration is furnished, stands on no\r\ndifferent footing from an offer not yet accepted, each being\r\nsubject to revocation until that time, and each continuing [304]\r\nuntil then unless it has expired or has been revoked, the\r\nquestion of acceptance is rarely of practical importance.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the general nature of consideration and promise is\r\nunderstood, some questions peculiar to bilateral contracts remain\r\nto be considered. These concern the sufficiency of the\r\nconsideration and the moment when the contract is made.\r\n\r\nA promise may be a consideration for a promise, although not\r\nevery promise for every other. It may be doubted whether a\r\npromise to make a gift of one hundred dollars would be supported\r\nby a promise to accept it. But in a case of mutual promises\r\nrespectively to transfer and to accept unpaid shares in a railway\r\ncompany, it has been held that a binding contract was made. Here\r\none party agrees to part with something which may prove valuable,\r\nand the other to assume a liability which may prove onerous. /1/\r\n\r\nBut now suppose that there is no element of uncertainty except in\r\nthe minds of the parties. Take, for instance, a wager on a past\r\nhorse-race. It has been thought that this would amount to an\r\nabsolute promise on one side, and no promise at all on the other.\r\n/2/ But this does not seem to me sound. Contracts are dealings\r\nbetween men, by which they make arrangements for the future. In\r\nmaking such arrangements the important thing is, not what is\r\nobjectively true, but what the parties know. Any present fact\r\nwhich is unknown to the parties is just as uncertain for the\r\npurposes of making an arrangement at this moment, as any future\r\nfact. It is therefore a detriment to undertake to be ready to pay\r\nif the event turns out not [305] to have been as expected. This\r\nseems to be the true explanation why forbearance to sue upon a\r\nclaim believed the plaintiff to be good is a sufficient\r\nconsideration, although the claim was bad in fact, and known by\r\nthe defendant to be bad. /1/ Were this view unsound, it is hard\r\nto see how wagers on any future event, except a miracle, could be\r\nsustained. For if the happening or not happening of the event is\r\nsubject to the law of causation, the only uncertainty about it is\r\nin our foresight, not in its happening.\r\n\r\nThe question when a contract is made arises for the most part\r\nwith regard to bilateral contracts by letter, the doubt being\r\nwhether the contract is complete at the moment when the return\r\npromise is put into the post, or at the moment when it is\r\nreceived. If convenience preponderates in favor of either view,\r\nthat is a sufficient reason for its adoption. So far as merely\r\nlogical grounds go, the most ingenious argument in favor of the\r\nlater moment is Professor Langdell's. According to him the\r\nconclusion follows from the fact that the consideration which\r\nmakes the offer binding is itself a promise. Every promise, he\r\nsays, is an offer before it is a promise, and the essence of an\r\noffer is that it should be communicated. /2/ But this reasoning\r\nseems unsound. When, as in the case supposed, the consideration\r\nfor the return promise has been put into the power of the offeree\r\nand the return promise has been accepted in advance, there is not\r\nan instant, either in time or logic, when the return promise is\r\nan offer. It is a promise and a term of a binding contract as\r\nsoon as it is anything. An offer is a revocable and unaccepted\r\ncommunication of willingness to promise. [306] When an offer of a\r\ncertain bilateral contract has been made, the same contract\r\ncannot be offered by the other side. The so-called offer would\r\nneither be revocable nor unaccepted. It would complete the\r\ncontract as soon as made.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that it is of the essence of a promise to be\r\ncommunicated, whether it goes through the stage of offer or not,\r\nmeaning by communicated brought to the actual knowledge of the\r\npromisee, the law is believed to be otherwise. A covenant is\r\nbinding when it is delivered and accepted, whether it is read or\r\nnot. On the same principle, it is believed that, whenever the\r\nobligation is to be entered into by a tangible sign, as, in the\r\ncase supposed, by letter containing the return promise, and the\r\nconsideration for and assent to the promise are already given,\r\nthe only question is when the tangible sign is sufficiently put\r\ninto the power of the promisee. I cannot believe that, if the\r\nletter had been delivered to the promisee and was then snatched\r\nfrom his hands before he had read it, there would be no contract.\r\n/1/ If I am right, it appears of little importance whether the\r\npost-office be regarded as agent or bailee for the offerer, or as\r\na mere box to which he has access. The offeree, when he drops the\r\nletter containing the counter-promise into the letter-box, does\r\nan overt act, which by general understanding renounces control\r\nover the letter, and puts it into a third hand for the benefit of\r\nthe offerer, with liberty to the latter at any moment thereafter\r\nto take it.\r\n\r\nThe principles governing revocation are wholly different. One to\r\nwhom an offer is made has a right to assume that it remains open\r\naccording to its terms until he has actual [307] notice to the\r\ncontrary. The effect of the communication must be destroyed by a\r\ncounter communication. But the making of a contract does not\r\ndepend on the state of the parties' minds, it depends on their\r\novert acts. When the sign of the counter promise is a tangible\r\nobject, the contract is completed when the dominion over that\r\nobject changes.\r\n\r\n[308]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE IX. -- CONTRACT.--III. VOID AND VOIDABLE.\r\n\r\nTHE elements of fact necessary to call a contract into existence,\r\nand the legal consequences of a contract when formed, have been\r\ndiscussed. It remains to consider successively the cases in which\r\na contract is said to be void, and those in which it is said to\r\nbe voidable,--in which, that is, a contract fails to be made when\r\nit seems to have been, or, having been made, can be rescinded by\r\none side or the other, and treated as if it had never been. I\r\ntake up the former class of cases first.\r\n\r\nWhen a contract fails to be made, although the usual forms have\r\nbeen gone through with, the ground of failure is commonly said to\r\nbe mistake, misrepresentation, or fraud. But I shall try to show\r\nthat these are merely dramatic circumstances, and that the true\r\nground is the absence of one or more of the primary elements,\r\nwhich have been shown, or are seen at once, to be necessary to\r\nthe existence of a contract.\r\n\r\nIf a man goes through the form of making a contract with A\r\nthrough B as A's agent, and B is not in fact the agent of A,\r\nthere is no contract, because there is only one party. The\r\npromise offered to A has not been accepted by him, and no\r\nconsideration has moved from him. In such a case, although there\r\nis generally mistake on one side and fraud on the other, it is\r\nvery clear that no special [309] doctrine need be resorted to,\r\nbecause the primary elements of a contract explained in the last\r\nLecture are not yet present.\r\n\r\nTake next a different case. The defendant agreed to buy, and the\r\nplaintiff agreed to sell, a cargo of cotton, \"to arrive ex\r\nPeerless from Bombay.\" There were two such vessels sailing from\r\nBombay, one in October, the other in December. The plaintiff\r\nmeant the latter, the defendant the former. It was held that the\r\ndefendant was not bound to accept the cotton. /1/ It is commonly\r\nsaid that such a contract is void, because of mutual mistake as\r\nto the subject-matter, and because therefore the parties did not\r\nconsent to the same thing. But this way of putting it seems to me\r\nmisleading. The law has nothing to do with the actual state of\r\nthe parties' minds. In contract, as elsewhere, it must go by\r\nexternals, and judge parties by their conduct. If there had been\r\nbut one \"Peerless,\" and the defendant had said \"Peerless\" by\r\nmistake, meaning \"Peri,\" he would have been bound. The true\r\nground of the decision was not that each party meant a different\r\nthing from the other, as is implied by the explanation which has\r\nbeen mentioned, but that each said a different thing. The\r\nplaintiff offered one thing, the defendant expressed his assent\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nA proper name, when used in business or in pleading, /2/ means\r\none individual thing, and no other, as every one knows, and\r\ntherefore one to whom such a name is used must find out at his\r\nperil what the object designated is. If there are no\r\ncircumstances which make the use deceptive on either side, each\r\nis entitled to insist on the [310] meaning favorable to him for\r\nthe word as used by him, and neither is entitled to insist on\r\nthat meaning for the word as used by the other. So far from\r\nmistake having been the ground of decision, as mistake, its only\r\nbearing, as it seems to me, was to establish that neither party\r\nknew that he was understood by the other to use the word\r\n\"Peerless \"in the sense which the latter gave to it. In that\r\nevent there would perhaps have been a binding contract, because,\r\nif a man uses a word to which he knows the other party attaches,\r\nand understands him to attach, a certain meaning, he may be held\r\nto that meaning, and not be allowed to give it any other. /1/\r\n\r\nNext, suppose a case in which the offer and acceptance do not\r\ndiffer, and in which both parties have used the same words in the\r\nsame sense. Suppose that A agreed to buy, and B agreed to sell,\r\n\"these barrels of mackerel,\" and that the barrels in question\r\nturn out to contain salt. There is mutual mistake as to the\r\ncontents of the barrels, and no fraud on either side. I suppose\r\nthe contract would be void. /2/\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that the failure of the contract in such a\r\ncase is due to the fact of a difference in kind between the\r\nactual subject-matter and that to which the intention of the\r\nparties was directed. It is perhaps more instructive to say that\r\nthe terms of the supposed contract, although seemingly\r\nconsistent, were contradictory, in matters that went to the root\r\nof the bargain. For, by one of the essential terms, the\r\nsubject-matter of the agreement was the contents of certain\r\nbarrels, and nothing else, and, by another equally important, it\r\nwas mackerel, and nothing else; [311] while, as a matter of fact,\r\nit could not be both, because the contents of the barrels were\r\nsalt. As neither term could be left out without forcing on the\r\nparties a contract which they did not make, it follows that A\r\ncannot be required to accept, nor B to deliver either these\r\nbarrels of salt, or other barrels of mackerel; and without\r\nomitting one term, the promise is meaningless.\r\n\r\nIf there had been fraud on the seller's part, or if he had known\r\nwhat the barrels really contained, the buyer might have had a\r\nright to insist on delivery of the inferior article. Fraud would\r\nperhaps have made the contract valid at his option. Because, when\r\na man qualifies sensible words with others which he knows, on\r\nsecret grounds, are insensible when so applied, he may fairly be\r\ntaken to authorize his promisee to insist on the possible part of\r\nhis promise being performed, if the promisee is willing to forego\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nTake one more illustration like the last case. A policy of\r\ninsurance is issued on a certain building described in the policy\r\nas a machine-shop. In fact the building is not a machine-shop,\r\nbut an organ factory, which is a greater risk. The contract is\r\nvoid, not because of any misrepresentation, but, as before,\r\nbecause two of its essential terms are repugnant, and their union\r\nis insensible. /1/\r\n\r\nOf course the principle of repugnancy last explained might be\r\nstretched to apply to any inconsistency between the different\r\nterms of a contract. It might be said, for instance, that if a\r\npiece of gold is sold as eighteen-carat gold, and it is in fact\r\nnot so pure, or if a cow is sold as yielding an average of twelve\r\nquarts of milk a day, and in fact she yields only six quarts,\r\nthere is no logical difference, [312] according to the\r\nexplanation which has just been offered, between those cases and\r\nthat of the barrel of salt sold for mackerel. Yet those bargains\r\nwould not be void. At the most, they would only be voidable, if\r\nthe buyer chose to throw them up.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions of the law are founded on experience, not on\r\nlogic. It therefore does not make the dealings of men dependent\r\non a mathematical accuracy. Whatever is promised, a man has a\r\nright to be paid for, if it is not given; but it does not follow\r\nthat the absence of some insignificant detail will authorize him\r\nto throw up the contract, still less that it will prevent the\r\nformation of a contract, which is the matter now under\r\nconsideration. The repugnant terms must both be very\r\nimportant,--so important that the court thinks that, if either is\r\nomitted, the contract would be different in substance from that\r\nwhich the words of the parties seemed to express.\r\n\r\nA term which refers directly to an identification by the senses\r\nhas always this degree of importance. If a promise is made to\r\nsell this cow, or this mackerel, to this man, whatever else may\r\nbe stricken from the contract, it can never be enforced except\r\ntouching this object and by this man. If this barrel of salt is\r\nfraudulently sold for a barrel of mackerel, the buyer may perhaps\r\nelect to take this barrel of salt if he chooses, but he cannot\r\nelect to take another barrel of mackerel. If the seller is\r\nintroduced by the name B, and the buyer supposes him to be\r\nanother person of the same name, and under that impression\r\ndelivers his written promise to buy of B, the B to whom the\r\nwriting is delivered is the contractee, if any one is, and,\r\nnotwithstanding what has been said of the use of proper names, I\r\nshould suppose [313] a contract would be made. /1/ For it is\r\nfurther to be said that, so far as by one of the terms of a\r\ncontract the thing promised or the promisee is identified by\r\nsight and hearing, that term so far preponderates over all others\r\nthat it is very rare for the failure of any other element of\r\ndescription to prevent the making of a contract. /2/ The most\r\nobvious of seeming exceptions is where the object not in fact so\r\nidentified, but only its covering or wrapper.\r\n\r\nOf course the performance of a promise may be made conditional on\r\nall the terms stipulated from the other side being complied with,\r\nbut conditions attaching to performance can never come into\r\nconsideration until a contract has been made, and so far the\r\nquestion has been touching the existence of a contract in the\r\nfirst instance.\r\n\r\nA different case may be suggested from any yet considered.\r\nInstead of a repugnancy between offer and assent which prevents\r\nan agreement, or between the terms of an agreement which makes it\r\ninsensible on its fact, there may be a like repugnancy between a\r\nterm of the contract and a previous representation of fact which\r\nis not expressly made a part of the contract. The representation\r\nmay have been the chief inducement and very foundation of the\r\nbargain. It may be more important than any of the expressed\r\nterms, and yet the contract may have [314] been reduced to\r\nwriting in words which cannot fairly be construed to include it.\r\nA vendor may have stated that barrels filled with salt contain\r\nmackerel, but the contract may be only for the barrels and their\r\ncontents. An applicant for insurance may have misstated facts\r\nessential to the risk, yet the policy may simply insure a certain\r\nbuilding or a certain life. It may be asked whether these\r\ncontracts are not void also.\r\n\r\nThere might conceivably be cases in which, taking into account\r\nthe nature of the contract, the words used could be said to\r\nembody the representation as a term by construction. For\r\ninstance, it might be said that the true and well-understood\r\npurport of a contract of insurance is not, as the words seem to\r\nsay, to take the risk of any loss by fire or perils of the sea,\r\nhowever great the risk may be, but to take a risk of a certain\r\nmagnitude, and no other, which risk has been calculated\r\nmathematically from the statements of the party insured. The\r\nextent of the risk taken is not specified in the policy, because\r\nthe old forms and established usage are otherwise, but the\r\nmeaning is perfectly understood.\r\n\r\nIf this reasoning were adopted, there would be an equal\r\nrepugnancy in the terms of the contract, whether the nature of\r\nthe risk were written in the policy or fixed by previous\r\ndescription. But, subject to possible exceptions of this kind, it\r\nwould seem that a contract would be made, and that the most that\r\ncould be claimed would be a right to rescind. Where parties\r\nhaving power to bind themselves do acts and use words which are\r\nfit to create an obligation, I take it that an obligation arises.\r\nIf there is a mistake as to a fact not mentioned in the contract,\r\nit goes only to the motives for making the contract. But a [315]\r\ncontract is not prevented from being made by the mere fact that\r\none party would not have made it if he had known the truth. In\r\nwhat cases a mistake affecting motives is a ground for avoidance,\r\ndoes not concern this discussion, because the subject now under\r\nconsideration is when a contract is made, and the question of\r\navoiding or rescinding it presupposes that it has been made.\r\n\r\nI think that it may now be assumed that, when fraud,\r\nmisrepresentation, or mistake is said to make a contract void,\r\nthere is no new principle which comes in to set aside an\r\notherwise perfect obligation, but that in every such case there\r\nis wanting one or more of the first elements which were explained\r\nin the foregoing Lecture. Either there is no second party, or the\r\ntwo parties say different things, or essential terms seemingly\r\nconsistent are really inconsistent as used.\r\n\r\nWhen a contract is said to be voidable, it is assumed that a\r\ncontract has been made, but that it is subject to being unmade at\r\nthe election of one party. This must be because of the breach of\r\nsome condition attached to its existence either expressly or by\r\nimplication.\r\n\r\nIf a condition is attached to the contract's coming into being,\r\nthere is as yet no contract. Either party may withdraw, at will,\r\nuntil the condition is determined. There is no obligation,\r\nalthough there may be an offer or a promise, and hence there is\r\nno relation between the parties which requires discussion here.\r\nBut some conditions seemingly arising out of a contract already\r\nmade are conditions of this sort. Such is always the case if the\r\ncondition of a promise lies within the control of the promisor's\r\nown will. For instance, a promise to pay for clothes if made to\r\nthe customer's satisfaction, has been held in Massachusetts to\r\n[316] make the promisor his own final judge. /1/ So interpreted,\r\nit appears to me to be no contract at all, until the promisor's\r\nsatisfaction is expressed. His promise is only to pay if he sees\r\nfit, and such a promise cannot be made a contract because it\r\ncannot impose any obligation. /2/ If the promise were construed\r\nto mean that the clothes should be paid for provided they were\r\nsuch as ought to satisfy the promisor, /3/ and thus to make the\r\njury the arbiter, there would be a contract, because the promisor\r\ngives up control over the event, but it would be subject to a\r\ncondition in the sense of the present analysis.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which a contract may contain have been divided by\r\ntheorists into conditions precedent and conditions subsequent.\r\nThe distinction has even been pronounced of great importance. It\r\nmust be admitted that, if the course of pleading be taken as a\r\ntest, it is so. In some cases, the plaintiff has to state that a\r\ncondition has been performed in order to put the defendant to his\r\nanswer; in others, it is left to the defendant to set up that a\r\ncondition has been broken.\r\n\r\nIn one sense, all conditions are subsequent; in another, all are\r\nprecedent. All are subsequent to the first stage of the\r\nobligation. /4/ Take, for instance, the case of a promise to pay\r\nfor work if done to the satisfaction of an architect. The\r\ncondition is a clear case of what is called a condition\r\nprecedent. There can be no duty to pay until the architect is\r\nsatisfied. But there can be a [317] contract before that moment,\r\nbecause the determination whether the promisor shall pay or not\r\nis no longer within his control. Hence the condition is\r\nsubsequent to the existence of the obligation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, every condition subsequent is precedent to the\r\nincidence of the burden of the law. If we look at the law as it\r\nwould be regarded by one who had no scruples against doing\r\nanything which he could do without incurring legal consequences,\r\nit is obvious that the main consequence attached by the law to a\r\ncontract is a greater or less possibility of having to pay money.\r\nThe only question from the purely legal point of view is whether\r\nthe promisor will be compelled to pay. And the important moment\r\nis that at which that point is settled. All conditions are\r\nprecedent to that.\r\n\r\nBut all conditions are precedent, not only in this extreme sense,\r\nbut also to the existence of the plaintiff's cause of action. As\r\nstrong a case as can be put is that of a policy of insurance\r\nconditioned to be void if not sued upon within one year from a\r\nfailure to pay as agreed. The condition does not come into play\r\nuntil a loss has occurred, the duty to pay has been neglected,\r\nand a cause of action has arisen. Nevertheless, it is precedent\r\nto the plaintiff's cause of action. When a man sues, the question\r\nis not whether he has had a cause of action in the past, but\r\nwhether he has one then. He has not one then, unless the year is\r\nstill running. If it were left for the defendant to set up the\r\nlapse of the year, that would be due to the circumstance that the\r\norder of pleading does not require a plaintiff to meet all\r\npossible defences, and to set out a case unanswerable except by\r\ndenial. The point at which the law calls on the defendant for an\r\nanswer varies [318] in different cases. Sometimes it would seem\r\nto be governed simply by convenience of proof, requiring the\r\nparty who has the affirmative to plead and prove it. Sometimes\r\nthere seems to be a reference to the usual course of events, and\r\nmatters belong to the defence because they are only exceptionally\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThe most logical distinction would be between conditions which\r\nmust be satisfied before a promise can be broken, and those\r\nwhich, like the last, discharge the liability after a breach has\r\noccurred. /1/ But this is of the slightest possible importance,\r\nand it may be doubted whether another case like the last could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIt is much more important to mark the distinction between a\r\nstipulation which only has the effect of confining a promise to\r\ncertain cases, and a condition properly so called. Every\r\ncondition, it is true, has this effect upon the promise to which\r\nit is attached, so that, whatever the rule of pleading may be,\r\n/2/ a promise is as truly kept and performed by doing nothing\r\nwhere the condition of the stipulated act has been broken, as it\r\nwould have been by doing the act if the condition had been\r\nfulfilled. But if this were all, every clause in a contract which\r\nshowed what the promisor did not promise would be a condition,\r\nand the word would be worse than useless. The characteristic\r\nfeature is quite different.\r\n\r\nA condition properly so called is an event, the happening of\r\nwhich authorizes the person in whose favor the condition is\r\nreserved to treat the contract as if it had not been made,--to\r\navoid it, as is commonly said,--that is, to insist on both\r\nparties being restored to the position in [319] which they stood\r\nbefore the contract was made. When a condition operates as such,\r\nit lets in an outside force to destroy the existing state of\r\nthings. For although its existence is due to consent of parties,\r\nits operation depends on the choice of one of them. When a\r\ncondition is broken, the person entitled to insist on it may do\r\nso if he chooses; but he may, if he prefers, elect to keep the\r\ncontract on foot. He gets his right to avoid it from the\r\nagreement, but the avoidance comes from him.\r\n\r\nHence it is important to distinguish those stipulations which\r\nhave this extreme effect from those which only interpret the\r\nextent of a promise, or define the events to which it applies.\r\nAnd as it has just been shown that a condition need not be\r\ninsisted on as such, we must further distinguish between its\r\noperation by way of avoidance, which is peculiar to it, and its\r\nincidental working by way of interpretation and definition, in\r\ncommon with other clauses not conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is best illustrated by taking a bilateral contract between A\r\nand B, where A's undertaking is conditional on B's doing what he\r\npromises to do, and where, after A has got a certain distance in\r\nhis task, B breaks his half of the bargain. For instance, A is\r\nemployed as a clerk by B, and is wrongfully dismissed in the\r\nmiddle of a quarter. In favor of A, the contract is conditional\r\non B's keeping his agreement to employ him. Whether A insists on\r\nthe condition or not, he is not bound to do any more. /1/ So far,\r\nthe condition works simply by way of definition. It establishes\r\nthat A has not promised to act in the case which has happened.\r\nBut besides this, for which a condition [320] was not necessary,\r\nA may take his choice between two courses. In the first place, he\r\nmay elect to avoid the contract. In that case the parties stand\r\nas if no contract had been made, and A, having done work for B\r\nwhich was understood not to be gratuitous, and for which no rate\r\nof compensation has been fixed, can recover what the jury think\r\nhis services were reasonably worth. The contract no longer\r\ndetermines the quid pro quo. But as an alternative course A may\r\nstand by the contract if he prefers to do so, and sue B for\r\nbreaking it. In that case he can recover as part of his damages\r\npay at the contract rate for what he had done, as well as\r\ncompensation for his loss of opportunity to finish it. But the\r\npoints which are material for the present discussion are, that\r\nthese two remedies are mutually exclusive, /1/ one supposing the\r\ncontract to be relied on, the other that it is set aside, but\r\nthat A's stopping work and doing no more after B's breach is\r\nequally consistent with either choice, and has in fact nothing to\r\ndo with the matter.\r\n\r\nOne word should be added to avoid misapprehension. When it is\r\nsaid that A has done all that he promised to do in the case which\r\nhas happened, it is not meant that he is necessarily entitled to\r\nthe same compensation as if he had done the larger amount of\r\nwork. B's promise in the case supposed was to pay so much a\r\nquarter for services; and although the consideration of the\r\npromise was the promise by A to perform them, the scope of it was\r\nlimited to the case of their being performed in fact. Hence A\r\ncould not simply wait till the end of his term, and then recover\r\nthe full amount which he would have had if the employment had\r\ncontinued. Nor is he any more entitled to do so from [321] the\r\nfact that it was B's fault that the services were not rendered.\r\nB's answer to any such claim is perfect. He is only liable upon a\r\npromise, and he in his turn only promised to pay in a case which\r\nhas not happened. He did promise to employ, however, and for not\r\ndoing that he is liable in damages.\r\n\r\nOne or two more illustrations will be useful. A promises to\r\ndeliver, and B promises to accept and pay for, certain goods at a\r\ncertain time and place. When the time comes, neither party is on\r\nhand. Neither would be liable to an action, and, according to\r\nwhat has been said, each has done all that he promised to do in\r\nthe event which has happened, to wit, nothing. It might be\r\nobjected that, if A has done all that he is bound to do, he ought\r\nto be able to sue B, since performance or readiness to perform\r\nwas all that was necessary to give him that right, and conversely\r\nthe same might be said of B. On the other hand, considering\r\neither B or A as defendant, the same facts would be a complete\r\ndefence. The puzzle is largely one of words.\r\n\r\nA and B have, it is true, each performed all that they promised\r\nto do at the present stage, because they each only promised to\r\nact in the event of the other being ready and willing to act at\r\nthe same time. But the readiness and willingness, although not\r\nnecessary to the performance of either promise, and therefore not\r\na duty, was necessary in order to present a case to which the\r\npromise of action on the other side would apply. Hence, although\r\nA and B have each performed their own promise, they have not\r\nperformed the condition to their right of demanding more from the\r\nother side. The performance of that condition is purely optional\r\nuntil one side has brought it within the [322] scope of the\r\nother's undertaking by performing it himself. But it is\r\nperformance in the latter sense, that is, the satisfying of all\r\nconditions, as well as the keeping of his own promises, which is\r\nnecessary to give A or B a right of action.\r\n\r\nConditions may be created by the very words of a contract. Of\r\nsuch cases there is nothing to be said, for parties may agree to\r\nwhat they choose. But they may also be held to arise by\r\nconstruction, where no provision is made in terms for rescinding\r\nor avoiding the contract in any case. The nature of the\r\nconditions which the law thus reads in needs explanation. It may\r\nbe said, in a general way, that they are directed to the\r\nexistence of the manifest grounds for making the bargain on the\r\nside of the rescinding party, or the accomplishment of its\r\nmanifest objects. But that is not enough. Generally speaking, the\r\ndisappointment must be caused by the wrong-doing of the person on\r\nthe other side; and the most obvious cases of such wrong-doing\r\nare fraud and misrepresentation, or failure to perform his own\r\npart of the contract.\r\n\r\nFraud and misrepresentation thus need to be considered once more\r\nin this connection. I take the latter first. In dealing with it\r\nthe first question which arises is whether the representation is,\r\nor is not, part of the contract. If the contract is in writing\r\nand the representation is set out on the face of the paper, it\r\nmay be material or immaterial, but the effect of its untruth will\r\nbe determined on much the same principles as govern the failure\r\nto perform a promise on the same side. If the contract is made by\r\nword of mouth, there may be a large latitude in connecting words\r\nof representation with later words of promise; but when they are\r\ndetermined to be a part of the contract [323], the same\r\nprinciples apply as if the whole were in writing.\r\n\r\nThe question now before us is the effect of a misrepresentation\r\nwhich leads to, but is not a part of, the contract. Suppose that\r\nthe contract is in writing, but does not contain it, does such a\r\nprevious misrepresentation authorize rescission in any case? and\r\nif so, does it in any case except where it goes to the height of\r\nfraud? The promisor might say, It does not matter to me whether\r\nyou knew that your representation was false or not; the only\r\nthing I am concerned with is its truth. If it is untrue, I suffer\r\nequally whether you knew it to be so or not. But it has been\r\nshown, in an earlier Lecture, that the law does not go on the\r\nprinciple that a man is answerable for all the consequences of\r\nall his acts. An act is indifferent in itself. It receives its\r\ncharacter from the concomitant facts known to the actor at the\r\ntime. If a man states a thing reasonably believing that he is\r\nspeaking from knowledge, it is contrary to the analogies of the\r\nlaw to throw the peril of the truth upon him unless he agrees to\r\nassume that peril, and he did not do so in the case supposed, as\r\nthe representation was not made part of the contract.\r\n\r\nIt is very different when there is fraud. Fraud may as well lead\r\nto the making of a contract by a statement outside the contract\r\nas by one contained in it. But the law would hold the contract\r\nnot less conditional on good faith in one case than in the other.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, we may take a somewhat extreme case. A says to B,\r\nI have not opened these barrels myself, but they contain No. 1\r\nmackerel: I paid so much for them to so and so, naming a\r\nwell-known dealer. Afterwards A writes B, I will sell the barrels\r\nwhich you saw, and their [324] contents, for so much; and B\r\naccepts. The barrels turn out to contain salt. I suppose the\r\ncontract would be binding if the statements touching the contents\r\nwere honest, and voidable if they were fraudulent.\r\n\r\nFraudulent representations outside a contract can never, it would\r\nseem, go to anything except the motives for making it. If outside\r\nthe contract, they cannot often affect its interpretation. A\r\npromise in certain words has a definite meaning, which the\r\npromisor is presumed to understand. If A says to B, I promise you\r\nto buy this barrel and its contents, his words designate a person\r\nand thing identified by the senses, and they signify nothing\r\nmore. There is no repugnancy, and if that person is ready to\r\ndeliver that thing, the purchaser cannot say that any term in the\r\ncontract itself is not complied with. He may have been\r\nfraudulently induced to believe that B was another B, and that\r\nthe barrel contained mackerel; but however much his belief on\r\nthose points may have affected his willingness to make the\r\npromise, it would be somewhat extravagant to give his words a\r\ndifferent meaning on that account. \"You\" means the person before\r\nthe speaker, whatever his name, and \"contents\" applies to salt,\r\nas well as to mackerel.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt only by reason of a condition construed into the\r\ncontract that fraud is a ground of rescission. Parties could\r\nagree, if they chose, that a contract should be binding without\r\nregard to truth or falsehood outside of it on either part.\r\n\r\nBut, as has been said before in these Lectures, although the law\r\nstarts from the distinctions and uses the language of morality,\r\nit necessarily ends in external standards not dependent on the\r\nactual consciousness of the individual. [325] So it has happened\r\nwith fraud. If a man makes a representation, knowing facts which\r\nby the average standard of the community are sufficient to give\r\nhim warning that it is probably untrue, and it is untrue, he is\r\nguilty of fraud in theory of law whether he believes his\r\nstatement or not. The courts of Massachusetts, at least, go much\r\nfurther. They seem to hold that any material statement made by a\r\nman as of his own knowledge, or in such a way as fairly to be\r\nunderstood as made of his own knowledge, is fraudulent if untrue,\r\nirrespective of the reasons he may have had for believing it and\r\nfor believing that he knew it. /1/ It is clear, therefore, that a\r\nrepresentation may be morally innocent, and yet fraudulent in\r\ntheory of law. Indeed, the Massachusetts rule seems to stop\r\nlittle short of the principle laid down by the English courts of\r\nequity, which has been criticised in an earlier Lecture, /2/\r\nsince most positive affirmations of facts would at least warrant\r\na jury in finding that they were reasonably understood to be made\r\nas of the party's own knowledge, and might therefore warrant a\r\nrescission if they turned out to be untrue. The moral phraseology\r\nhas ceased to be apposite, and an external standard of\r\nresponsibility has been reached. But the starting-point is\r\nnevertheless fraud, and except on the ground of fraud, as defined\r\nby law, I do not think that misrepresentations before the\r\ncontract affect its validity, although they lead directly to its\r\nmaking. But neither the contract nor the implied condition calls\r\nfor the existence of the facts as to which the false\r\nrepresentations were made. They call only for the absence of\r\ncertain false representations. The condition is not that the\r\npromisee shall be a certain other B, or that the contents of the\r\nbarrel shall be mackerel, [326] but that the promisee has not\r\nlied to him about material facts.\r\n\r\nThen the question arises, How do you determine what facts are\r\nmaterial? As the facts are not required by the contract, the only\r\nway in which they can be material is that a belief in their being\r\ntrue is likely to have led to the making of the contract.\r\n\r\nIt is not then true, as it is sometimes said, that the law does\r\nnot concern itself with the motives for making contracts. On the\r\ncontrary, the whole scope of fraud outside the contract is the\r\ncreation of false motives and the removal of true ones. And this\r\nconsideration will afford a reasonable test of the cases in which\r\nfraud will warrant rescission. It is said that a fraudulent\r\nrepresentation must be material to have that effect. But how are\r\nwe to decide whether it is material or not? If the above argument\r\nis correct, it must be by an appeal to ordinary experience to\r\ndecide whether a belief that the fact was as represented would\r\nnaturally have led to, or a contrary belief would naturally have\r\nprevented, the making of the contract.\r\n\r\nIf the belief would not naturally have had such an effect, either\r\nin general or under the known circumstances of the particular\r\ncase, the fraud is immaterial. If a man is induced to contract\r\nwith another by a fraudulent representation of the latter that he\r\nis a great-grandson of Thomas Jefferson, I do not suppose that\r\nthe contract would be voidable unless the contractee knew that,\r\nfor special reasons, his lie would tend to bring the contract\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThe conditions or grounds for avoiding a contract which have been\r\ndealt with thus far are conditions concerning the conduct of the\r\nparties outside of the itself. [327] Still confining myself to\r\nconditions arising by construction of law,--that is to say, not\r\ndirectly and in terms attached to a promise by the literal\r\nmeaning of the words in which it is expressed,--I now come to\r\nthose which concern facts to which the contract does in some way\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions may be found in contracts where the promise is\r\nonly on one side. It has been said that where the contract is\r\nunilateral, and its language therefore is all that of the\r\npromisor, clauses in his favor will be construed as conditions\r\nmore readily than the same words in a bilateral contract; indeed,\r\nthat they must be so construed, because, if they do not create a\r\ncondition, they do him no good, since ex hypothesi they are not\r\npromises by the other party. /1/ How far this ingenious\r\nsuggestion has had a practical effect on doctrine may perhaps be\r\ndoubted.\r\n\r\nBut it will be enough for the purposes of this general survey to\r\ndeal with bilateral contracts, where there are undertakings on\r\nboth sides, and where the condition implied in favor of one party\r\nis that the other shall make good what he on his part has\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nThe undertakings of a contract may be for the existence of a fact\r\nin the present or in the future. They can be promises only in the\r\nlatter case; but in the former, they be equally essential terms\r\nin the bargain.\r\n\r\nHere again we come on the law of representations, but in a new\r\nphase. Being a part of the contract, it is always possible that\r\ntheir truth should make a condition of the contract wholly\r\nirrespective of any question of fraud. And it often is so in\r\nfact. It is not, however, every representation embodied in the\r\nwords used on one side which will [328] make a condition in favor\r\nof the other party. Suppose A agrees to sell, and B agrees to\r\nbuy, \"A's seven-year-old sorrel horse Eclipse, now in the\r\npossession of B on trial,\" and in fact the horse is\r\nchestnut-colored, not sorrel. I do not suppose that B could\r\nrefuse to pay for the horse on that ground. If the law were so\r\nfoolish as to aim at merely formal consistency, it might indeed\r\nbe said that there was as absolute a repugnancy between the\r\ndifferent terms of this contract as in the ease of an agreement\r\nto sell certain barrels of mackerel, where the barrels turned out\r\nto contain salt. If this view were adopted, there would not be a\r\ncontract subject to a condition, there would be no contract at\r\nall. But in truth there is a contract, and there is not even a\r\ncondition. As has been said already, it is not every repugnancy\r\nthat makes a contract void, and it is not every failure in the\r\nterms of the counter undertaking that makes it voidable. Here it\r\nplainly appears that the buyer knows exactly what he is going to\r\nget, and therefore that the mistake of color has no bearing on\r\nthe bargain. /1/\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, a contract contained a representation\r\nwhich was fraudulent, and which misled the party to whom it was\r\nmade, the contract would be voidable on the same principles as if\r\nthe representation had been made beforehand. But words of\r\ndescription in a contract are very frequently held to amount to\r\nwhat is sometimes called a warranty, irrespective of fraud.\r\nWhether they do so or not is a question to be determined by the\r\ncourt on grounds of common sense, looking to the meaning of the\r\nwords, the importance in the transaction of the facts [329] which\r\nthe words convey, and so forth. But when words of description are\r\ndetermined to be a warranty, the meaning of the decision is not\r\nmerely that the party using them binds himself to answer for\r\ntheir truth, but that their truth is a condition of the contract.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in a leading case /1/ the agreement was that the\r\nplaintiff's ship, then in the port of Amsterdam, should, with all\r\npossible despatch, proceed direct to Newport, England, and there\r\nload a cargo of coals for Hong Kong. At the date of the\r\ncharter-party the vessel was not in Amsterdam, but she arrived\r\nthere four days later. The plaintiff had notice that the\r\ndefendant considered time important. It was held that the\r\npresence of the vessel in the port of Amsterdam at the date of\r\nthe contract was a condition, the breach of which entitled the\r\ndefendant to refuse to load, and to rescind the contract. If the\r\nview were adopted that a condition must be a future event, and\r\nthat a promise purporting to be conditional on a past or present\r\nevent is either absolute or no promise at all, it would follow\r\nthat in this case the defendant had never made a promise. /2/ He\r\nhad only promised if circumstances existed which did not exist. I\r\nhave already stated my objections to this way of looking at such\r\ncases, /2/ and will only add that the courts, so far as I am\r\naware, do not sanction it, and certainly did not in this\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nThere is another ground for holding the charter-party void and no\r\ncontract, instead of regarding it as only voidable, which is\r\nequally against authority, which nevertheless I have never been\r\nable to answer wholly to my satisfaction. In the case put, the\r\nrepresentation of the lessor of the vessel [330] concerned the\r\nvessel itself, and therefore entered into the description of the\r\nthing the lessee agreed to take. I do not quite see why there is\r\nnot as fatal a repugnancy between the different terms of this\r\ncontract as was found in that for the sale of the barrels of salt\r\ndescribed as containing mackerel. Why is the repugnancy between\r\nthe two terms,--first, that the thing sold is the contents of\r\nthese barrels, and, second, that it is mackerel--fatal to the\r\nexistence of a contract? It is because each of those terms goes\r\nto the very root and essence of the contract, /1/--because to\r\ncompel the buyer to take something answering to one, but not to\r\nthe other requirement, would be holding him to do a substantially\r\ndifferent thing from what he promised, and because a promise to\r\ntake one and the same thing answering to both requirements is\r\ntherefore contradictory in a substantial matter. It has been seen\r\nthat the law does not go on any merely logical ground, and does\r\nnot hold that every slight repugnancy will make a contract even\r\nvoidable. But, on the other hand, when the repugnancy is between\r\nterms which are both essential, it is fatal to the very existence\r\nof the contract. How then do we decide whether a given term is\r\nessential? Surely the best way of finding out is by seeing how\r\nthe parties have dealt with it. For want of any expression on\r\ntheir part we may refer to the speech and dealings of every day,\r\n/2/ and say that, if its absence would make the subject-matter a\r\ndifferent thing, its presence is essential to the existence of\r\nthe agreement. But the parties may agree that anything, however\r\ntrifling, shall be essential, as well [331] as that anything,\r\nhowever important, shall not be; and if that essential is part of\r\nthe contract description of a specific thing which is also\r\nidentified by reference to the senses, how can there be a\r\ncontract in its absence any more than if the thing is in popular\r\nspeech different in kind from its description? The qualities that\r\nmake sameness or difference of kind for the purposes of a\r\ncontract are not determined by Agassiz or Darwin, or by the\r\npublic at large, but by the will of the parties, which decides\r\nthat for their purposes the characteristics insisted on are such\r\nand such. /1/1 Now, if this be true, what evidence can there be\r\nthat a certain requirement is essential, that without it the\r\nsubject-matter will be different in kind from the description,\r\nbetter than that one party has required and the other given a\r\nwarranty of its presence? Yet the contract description of the\r\nspecific vessel as now in the port of Amsterdam, although held to\r\nbe an implied warranty, does not seem to have been regarded as\r\nmaking the contract repugnant and void, but only as giving the\r\ndefendant the option of avoiding it. /2/ Even an express warranty\r\nof quality in sales does not have this effect, and in England,\r\nindeed, it does not allow the purchaser to rescind in case of\r\nbreach. On this last point the law of Massachusetts is different.\r\n\r\nThe explanation has been offered of the English doctrine with\r\nregard to sales, that, when the title has passed, the purchaser\r\nhas already had some benefit from the contract, and therefore\r\ncannot wholly replace the seller in statu quo, as must be done\r\nwhen a contract is rescinded. /3/ This reasoning [332] seems\r\ndoubtful, even to show that the contract is not voidable, but has\r\nno bearing on the argument that it is void. For if the contract\r\nis void, the title does not pass.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that there is no repugnancy in the charterer's\r\npromise, because he only promises to load a certain ship, and\r\nthat the words \"now in the port of Amsterdam\" are merely matter\r\nof history when the time for loading comes, and no part of the\r\ndescription of the vessel which he promised to load. But the\r\nmoment those words are decided to be essential they become part\r\nof the description, and the promise is to load a certain vessel\r\nwhich is named the Martaban, and which was in the port of\r\nAmsterdam at the date of the contract. So interpreted, it is\r\nrepugnant.\r\n\r\nProbably the true solution is to be found in practical\r\nconsiderations. At any rate, the fact is that the law has\r\nestablished three degrees in the effect of repugnancy. If one of\r\nthe repugnant terms is wholly insignificant, it is simply\r\ndisregarded, or at most will only found a claim for damages. The\r\nlaw would be loath to hold a contract void for repugnancy in\r\npresent terms, when if the same terms were only promised a\r\nfailure of one of them would not warrant a refusal to perform on\r\nthe other side. If, on the other hand, both are of the extremest\r\nimportance, so that to enforce the rest of the promise or bargain\r\nwithout one of them would not merely deprive one party of a\r\nstipulated incident, but would force a substantially different\r\nbargain on him, the promise will be void. There is an\r\nintermediate class of cases where it is left to the disappointed\r\nparty to decide. But as the lines between the three are of this\r\nvague kind, it is not surprising that they have been differently\r\ndrawn in different jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n[333] The examples which have been given of undertakings for a\r\npresent state of facts have been confined to those touching the\r\npresent condition of the subject-matter of the contract. Of\r\ncourse there is no such limit to the scope of their employment. A\r\ncontract may warrant the existence of other facts as well, and\r\nexamples of this kind probably might be found or imagined where\r\nit would be clear that the only effect of the warranty was to\r\nattach a condition to the contract, in favor of the other side,\r\nand where the question would be avoided whether there was not\r\nsomething more than a condition,--a repugnancy which prevented\r\nthe formation of any contract at all. But the preceding\r\nillustrations are enough for the present purpose.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass from undertakings that certain facts are true at\r\nthe time of making the contract, to undertakings that certain\r\nfacts shall be true at some later time,--that is, to promises\r\nproperly so called. The question is when performance of the\r\npromise on one side is a condition to the obligation of the\r\ncontract on the other. In practice, this question is apt to be\r\ntreated as identical with another, which, as has been shown\r\nearlier, is a distinct point; namely, when performance on one\r\nside is a condition of the right to call for performance on the\r\nother. It is of course conceivable that a promise should be\r\nlimited to the case of performance of the things promised on the\r\nother side, and yet that a failure of the latter should not\r\nwarrant a rescission of the contract. Wherever one party has\r\nalready received a substantial benefit under a contract of a kind\r\nwhich cannot be restored, it is too late to rescind, however\r\nimportant a breach may be committed later by the other side. Yet\r\nhe may be [334] excused from going farther. Suppose a contract is\r\nmade for a month's labor, ten dollars to be paid down, not to be\r\nrecovered except in case of rescission for the laborer's fault,\r\nand thirty dollars at the end of the month. If the laborer should\r\nwrongfully stop work at the end of a fortnight, I do not suppose\r\nthat the contract could be rescinded, and that the ten dollars\r\ncould be recovered as money had and received; /1/ but, on the\r\nother hand, the employer would not be bound to pay the thirty\r\ndollars, and of course he could sue for damages on the contract.\r\n/2/\r\n\r\nBut, for the most part, a breach of promise which discharges the\r\npromisee from further performance on his side will also warrant\r\nrescission, so that no great harm is done by the popular\r\nconfusion of the two questions. Where the promise to perform on\r\none side is limited to the case of performance on the other, the\r\ncontract is generally conditioned on it also. In what follows, I\r\nshall take up the cases which I wish to notice without stopping\r\nto consider whether the contract was in a strict sense\r\nconditioned on performance of the promise on one side, or whether\r\nthe true construction was merely that the promise on the other\r\nside was limited to that event.\r\n\r\nNow, how do we settle whether such a condition exists? It is easy\r\nto err by seeking too eagerly for simplicity, and by striving too\r\nhard to reduce all cases to artificial presumptions, which are\r\nless obvious than the decisions which they are supposed to\r\nexplain. The foundation of the whole matter is, after all, good\r\nsense, as the courts have often said. The law means to carry out\r\nthe intention of the parties, and, so far as they have not\r\nprovided [335] for the event which has happened, it has to say\r\nwhat they naturally would have intended if their minds had been\r\nturned to the point. It will be found that decisions based on the\r\ndirect implications of the language used, and others based upon a\r\nremoter inference of what the parties must have meant, or would\r\nhave said if they had spoken, shade into each other by\r\nimperceptible degrees.\r\n\r\nMr. Langdell has called attention to a very important principle,\r\nand one which, no doubt, throws light on many decisions. /1/ This\r\nis, that, where you have a bilateral contract, while the\r\nconsideration of each promise is the counter promise, yet prima\r\nfacie the payment for performance of one is performance of the\r\nother. The performance of the other party is what each means to\r\nhave in return for his own. If A promises a barrel of flour to B,\r\nand B promises him ten dollars for it, A means to have the ten\r\ndollars for his flour, and B means to have the flour for his ten\r\ndollars. If no time is set for either act, neither can call on\r\nthe other to perform without being ready at the same time\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut this principle of equivalency is not the only principle to be\r\ndrawn even from the form of contracts, without considering their\r\nsubject-matter, and of course it is not offered as such in Mr.\r\nLangdell's work.\r\n\r\nAnother very clear one is found in contracts for the sale or\r\nlease of a thing, and the like. Here the qualities or\r\ncharacteristics which the owner promises that the thing furnished\r\nshall possess, go to describe the thing which the buyer promises\r\nto accept. If any of the promised traits are wanting in the thing\r\ntendered, the buyer may refuse to accept, not merely on the\r\nground that he has not [336] been offered the equivalent for\r\nkeeping his promise, but also on the ground that he never\r\npromised to accept what is offered him. /1/ It has been seen\r\nthat, where the contract contains a statement touching the\r\ncondition of the thing at an earlier time than the moment for its\r\nacceptance, the past condition may not always be held to enter\r\ninto the description of the thing to be accepted. But no such\r\nescape is possible here. Nevertheless there are limits to the\r\nright of refusal even in the present class of cases. If the thing\r\npromised is specific, the preponderance of that part of the\r\ndescription which identifies the object by reference to the\r\nsenses is sometimes strikingly illustrated. One case has gone so\r\nfar as to hold that performance of an executory contract to\r\npurchase a specific thing cannot be refused because it fails to\r\ncome up to the warranted quality. /2/\r\n\r\nAnother principle of dependency to be drawn from the form of the\r\ncontract itself is, that performance of the promise on one side\r\nmay be manifestly intended to furnish the means for performing\r\nthe promise on the other. If a tenant should promise to make\r\nrepairs, and the landlord should promise to furnish him wood for\r\nthe purpose, it is believed that at the present day, whatever may\r\nhave been the old decisions, the tenant's duty to repair would be\r\ndependent upon the landlord's furnishing the material when\r\nrequired. /3/\r\n\r\n[337] Another case of a somewhat exceptional kind is where a\r\nparty to a bilateral contract agrees to do certain things and to\r\ngive security for his performance. Here it is manifest good-sense\r\nto hold giving the security a condition of performance on the\r\nother side, if it be possible. For the requirement of security\r\nshows that the party requiring it was not content to rely on the\r\nsimple promise of the other side, which he would be compelled to\r\ndo if he had to perform before the security was given, and thus\r\nthe very object of requiring it would be defeated. /1/\r\n\r\nThis last case suggests what is very forcibly impressed on any\r\none who studies the cases,--that, after all, the most important\r\nelement of decision is not any technical, or even any general\r\nprinciple of contracts, but a consideration of the nature of the\r\nparticular transaction as a practical matter. A promises B to do\r\na day's work for two dollars, and B promises A to pay two\r\ndollars for a day's work. There the two promises cannot be\r\nperformed at the same time. The work will take all day, the\r\npayment half a minute. How are you to decide which is to be done\r\nfirst, that is to say, which promise is dependent upon\r\nperformance on the other side? It is only by reference to the\r\nhabits of the community and to convenience. It is not enough to\r\nsay that on the principle of equivalency a man is not presumed\r\nto intend to pay for a thing until he has it. The work is\r\npayment for the money, as much as the [338] money for the work,\r\nand one must be paid in advance. The question is, why, if one\r\nman is not presumed to intend to pay money until he has money's\r\nworth, the other is presumed to intend to give money's worth\r\nbefore he has money. An answer cannot be obtained from any\r\ngeneral theory. The fact that employers, as a class, can be\r\ntrusted for wages more safely than the employed for their labor,\r\nthat the employers have had the power and have been the law-makers,\r\nor other considerations, it matters not what, have determined\r\nthat the work is to be done first. But the grounds of\r\ndecision are purely practical, and can never be elicited from\r\ngrammar or from logic.\r\n\r\nA reference to practical considerations will be found to run all\r\nthrough the subject. Take another instance. The plaintiff\r\ndeclared on a mutual agreement between himself and the defendant\r\nthat he would sell, and the defendant would buy, certain Donskoy\r\nwool, to be shipped by the plaintiff at Odessa, and delivered in\r\nEngland. Among the stipulations of the contract was one, that the\r\nnames of the vessels should be declared as soon as the wools were\r\nshipped. The defence was, that the wool was bought, with the\r\nknowledge of both parties, for the purpose of reselling it in the\r\ncourse of the defendant's business; that it was an article of\r\nfluctuating value, and not salable until the names of the vessels\r\nin which it was shipped should have been declared according to\r\nthe contract, but that the plaintiff did not declare the names of\r\nthe vessels as agreed. The decision of the court was given by one\r\nof the greatest technical lawyers that ever lived, Baron Parke;\r\nyet he did not dream of giving any technical or merely logical\r\nreason for the decision, but, after stating in the above words\r\nthe facts which were deemed material to the question [339]\r\nwhether declaring the names of the vessels was a condition to the\r\nduty to accept, stated the ground of decision thus: \"Looking at\r\nthe nature of the contract, and the great importance of it to the\r\nobject with which the contract was entered into with the\r\nknowledge of both parties, we think it was a condition\r\nprecedent.\" /1/\r\n\r\n[340]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE X. -- SUCCESSIONS AFTER DEATH.\r\n\r\nIn the Lecture on Possession, I tried to show that the notion of\r\npossessing a right as such was intrinsically absurd. All rights\r\nare consequences attached to filling some situation of fact. A\r\nright which may be acquired by possession differs from others\r\nsimply in being attached to a situation of such a nature that it\r\nmay be filled successively by different persons, or by any one\r\nwithout regard to the lawfulness of his doing so, as is the case\r\nwhere the situation consists in having a tangible object within\r\none's power.\r\n\r\nWhen a right of this sort is recognized by the law, there is no\r\ndifficulty in transferring it; or, more accurately, there is no\r\ndifficulty in different persons successively enjoying similar\r\nrights in respect of the subject-matter. If A, being the\r\npossessor of a horse or a field, gives up the possession to B,\r\nthe rights which B acquires stand on the same ground as A's did\r\nbefore. The facts from which A's rights sprang have ceased to be\r\ntrue of A, and are now true of B. The consequences attached by\r\nthe law to those facts now exist for B, as they did for A before.\r\nThe situation of fact from which the rights spring is continuing\r\none, and any one who occupies it, no matter how, has the rights\r\nattached to it. But there is no possession possible of a\r\ncontract. The [341] fact that a consideration was given yesterday\r\nby A to B, and a promise received in return, cannot be laid hold\r\nof by X, and transferred from A to himself. The only thing can be\r\ntransferred is the benefit or burden of the promise, and how can\r\nthey be separated from the facts which gave rise to them? How, in\r\nshort, can a man sue or be sued on a promise in which he had no\r\npart?\r\n\r\nHitherto it has been assumed, in dealing with any special right\r\nor obligation, that the facts from which it sprung were true of\r\nthe individual entitled or bound. But it often happens,\r\nespecially in modern law, that a person acquires and is allowed\r\nto enforce a special right, although that facts which give rise\r\nto it are not true of him, or are true of him only in part. One\r\nof the chief problems of the law is to explain the machinery by\r\nwhich this result has been brought to pass.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the problem is not coextensive with the\r\nwhole field of rights. Some rights cannot be transferred by any\r\ndevice or contrivance; for instance, a man's right a to bodily\r\nsafety or reputation. Others again are incident to possession,\r\nand within the limits of that conception no other is necessary.\r\nAs Savigny said, \"Succession does not apply to possession by\r\nitself.\" /1/\r\n\r\nBut the notion of possession will carry us but a very little way\r\nin our understanding of the modern theory of transfer. That\r\ntheory depends very largely upon the notion of succession, to use\r\nthe word just quoted from Savigny, and accordingly successions\r\nwill be the subject of this and the following Lecture. I shall\r\nbegin by explaining the theory of succession to persons deceased,\r\nand after that is done shall pass to the theory of transfer\r\nbetween living [342] people, and shall consider whether any\r\nrelation can be established between the two.\r\n\r\nThe former is easily shown to be founded upon a fictitious\r\nidentification between the deceased and his successor. And as a\r\nfirst step to the further discussion, as well as for its own\r\nsake, I shall briefly state the evidence touching the executor,\r\nthe heir, and the devisee. In order to understand the theory of\r\nour law with regard to the first of these, at least, scholars are\r\nagreed that it is necessary to consider the structure and\r\nposition of the Roman family as it was in the infancy of Roman\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nContinental jurists have long been collecting the evidence that,\r\nin the earlier periods of Roman and German law alike, the unit of\r\nsociety was the family. The Twelve Tables of Rome still recognize\r\nthe interest of the inferior members of the family in the family\r\nproperty. Heirs are called sui heredes, that is, heirs of\r\nthemselves or of their own property, as is explained by Gaius.\r\n/1/ Paulus says that they are regarded as owners in a certain\r\nsense, even in the lifetime of their father, and that after his\r\ndeath they do not so much receive an inheritance as obtain the\r\nfull power of dealing with their property. /2/\r\n\r\nStarting from this point it is easy to understand the [343]\r\nsuccession of heirs to a deceased paterfamilias in the Roman\r\nsystem. If the family was the owner of the property administered\r\nby a paterfamilias, its rights remained unaffected by the death\r\nof its temporary head. The family continued, although the head\r\ndied. And when, probably by a gradual change, /1/ the\r\npaterfamilias came to be regarded as owner, instead of a simple\r\nmanager of the family rights, the nature and continuity of those\r\nrights did not change with the title to them. The familia\r\ncontinued to the heirs as it was left by the ancestor. The heir\r\nsucceeded not to the ownership of this or that thing separately,\r\nbut to the total hereditas or headship of the family with certain\r\nrights of property as incident, /2/ and of course he took this\r\nheadship, or right of representing the family interests, subject\r\nto the modifications effected by the last manager.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the ancestor's rights and duties, or, to use the\r\ntechnical phrase, the total persona sustained by him, was easily\r\nseparated from his natural personality. For this persona was but\r\nthe aggregate of what had formerly been family rights and duties,\r\nand was originally sustained by any individual only as the family\r\nhead. Hence it was said to be continued by the inheritance, /3/\r\nand when the heir assumed it he had his action in respect of\r\ninjuries previously committed. /4/\r\n\r\nThus the Roman heir came to be treated as identified with his\r\nancestor for the purposes of the law. And thus it is clear how\r\nthe impossible transfers which I seek to explain were\r\naccomplished in that instance. Rights to which B [344] as B could\r\nshow no title, he could readily maintain under the fiction that\r\nhe was the same person as A, whose title was not denied.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary at this point to study family rights in the\r\nGerman tribes. For it is not disputed that the modern executor\r\nderives his characteristics from the Roman heir. Wills also were\r\nborrowed from Rome, and were unknown to the Germans of Tacitus.\r\n/1/ Administrators were a later imitation of executors,\r\nintroduced by statute for cases where there was no will, or\r\nwhere, for any other reason, executors were wanting.\r\n\r\nThe executor has the legal title to the whole of the testator's\r\npersonal estate, and, generally speaking, the power of\r\nalienation. Formerly he was entitled to the undistributed\r\nresidue, not, it may fairly be conjectured, as legatee of those\r\nspecific chattels, but because he represented the person of the\r\ntestator, and therefore had all the rights which the testator\r\nwould have had after distribution if alive. The residue is\r\nnowadays generally bequeathed by the will, but it is not even now\r\nregarded as a specific gift of the chattels remaining undisposed\r\nof, and I cannot help thinking that this doctrine echoes that\r\nunder which the executor took in former times.\r\n\r\nNo such rule has governed residuary devises of real estate, which\r\nhave always been held to be specific in England down to the\r\npresent day. So that, if a devise of land should fail, that land\r\nwould not be disposed of by the residuary clause, but would\r\ndescend to the heir as if there had been no will.\r\n\r\nAgain, the appointment of an executor relates back to the date of\r\nthe testator's death. The continuity of person [345] is preserved\r\nby this fiction, as in Rome it was by personifying the\r\ninheritance ad interim.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show the likeness between our executor\r\nand the Roman heir. And bearing in mind what was said about the\r\nheres, it will easily be seen how it came to be said, as it often\r\nwas in the old books, that the executor \"represents the person of\r\nhis testator.\" /1/ The meaning of this feigned identity has been\r\nfound in history, but the aid which it furnished in overcoming a\r\ntechnical difficulty must also be appreciated. If the executor\r\nrepresents the person of the testator, there is no longer any\r\ntrouble in allowing him to sue or be sued on his testator's\r\ncontracts. In the time of Edward III., when an action of covenant\r\nwas brought against executors, Persay objected: \"I never heard\r\nthat one should have a writ of covenant against executors, nor\r\nagainst other person but the very one who made the covenant, for\r\na man cannot oblige another person to a covenant by his deed\r\nexcept him who was party to the covenant.\" /2/ But it is useless\r\nto object that the promise sued upon was made by A, the testator,\r\nnot by B, the executor, when the law says that for this purpose B\r\nis A. Here then is one class of cases in which a transfer is\r\naccomplished by the help of a fiction, which shadows, as fictions\r\nso often do, the facts of an early stage of society, and which\r\ncould hardly have been invented had these facts been otherwise.\r\n\r\nExecutors and administrators afford the chief, if not the only,\r\nexample of universal succession in the English [346] law. But\r\nalthough they succeed per universitatem, as has been explained,\r\nthey do not succeed to all kinds of property. The personal estate\r\ngoes to them, but land takes another course. All real estate not\r\ndisposed of by will goes to the heir, and the rules of\r\ninheritance are quite distinct from those which govern the\r\ndistribution of chattels. Accordingly, the question arises\r\nwhether the English heir or successor to real estate presents the\r\nsame analogies to the Roman heres as the executor.\r\n\r\nThe English heir is not a universal successor. Each and every\r\nparcel of land descends as a separate and specific thing.\r\nNevertheless, in his narrower sphere he unquestionably represents\r\nthe person of his ancestor. Different opinions have been held as\r\nto whether the same thing was true in early German law. Dr.\r\nLaband says that it was; /1/ Sohm takes the opposite view. /2/ It\r\nis commonly supposed that family ownership, at least of land,\r\ncame before that of individuals in the German tribes, and it has\r\nbeen shown how naturally representation followed from a similar\r\nstate of things in Rome. But it is needless to consider whether\r\nour law on this subject is of German or Roman origin, as the\r\nprinciple of identification has clearly prevailed from the time\r\nof Glanvill to the present day. If it was not known to the\r\nGermans, it is plainly accounted for by the influence of the\r\nRoman law. If there was anything of the sort in the Salic law, it\r\nwas no doubt due to natural causes similar to those which gave\r\nrise to the principle at Rome. But in either event I cannot doubt\r\nthat the modern doctrine has taken a good deal of its form, and\r\nperhaps some of its substance, from the mature system [347] of\r\nthe civilians, in whose language it was so long expressed. For\r\nthe same reasons that have just been mentioned, it is also\r\nneedless to weigh the evidence of the Anglo-Saxon sources,\r\nalthough it seems tolerably clear from several passages in the\r\nlaws that there was some identification. /1/\r\n\r\nAs late as Bracton, two centuries after the Norman conquest, the\r\nheir was not the successor to lands alone, but represented his\r\nancestor in a much more general sense, as will be seen directly.\r\nThe office of executor, in the sense of heir, was unknown to the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, /2/ and even in Bracton's time does not seem to\r\nhave been what it has since become. There is, therefore, no need\r\nto go back further than to the early Norman period, after the\r\nappointment of executors had become common, and the heir was more\r\nnearly what he is now.\r\n\r\nWhen Glanvill wrote, a little more than a century after the\r\nConquest, the heir was bound to warrant the reasonable gifts of\r\nhis ancestor to the grantees and their heirs; /3/ and if the\r\neffects of the ancestor were insufficient to pay his debts, the\r\nheir was bound to make up the deficiency from his own property.\r\n/4/ Neither Glanvill nor his Scotch imitator, the Regiam\r\nMajestatem, /5/ limits the liability to the amount of property\r\ninherited from the same source. This makes the identification of\r\nheir and ancestor as complete as that of the Roman law before\r\nsuch a limitation was introduced by Justinian. On the other hand,\r\na century [348] later, it distinctly appears from Bracton, /1/\r\nthat the heir was only bound so far as property had descended to\r\nhim, and in the early sources of the Continent, Norman as well as\r\nother, the same limitation appears. /2/ The liabilities of the\r\nheir were probably shrinking. Britton and Fleta, the imitators of\r\nBracton, and perhaps Bracton himself, say that an heir is not\r\nbound to pay his ancestor's debt, unless he be thereto especially\r\nbound by the deed of his ancestor. /3/ The later law required\r\nthat the heir should be mentioned if he was to be held.\r\n\r\nBut at all events the identification of heir and ancestor still\r\napproached the nature of a universal succession in the time of\r\nBracton, as is shown by another statement of his. He asks if the\r\ntestator can bequeath his rights of action, and answers, No, so\r\nfar as concerns debts not proved and recovered in the testator's\r\nlife. But actions of that sort belong to the heirs, and must be\r\nsued in the secular court; for before they are so recovered in\r\nthe proper court, the executor cannot proceed for them in the\r\necclesiastical tribunal. /4/\r\n\r\nThis shows that the identification worked both ways. The heir was\r\nliable for the debts due from his ancestor, and he could recover\r\nthose which were due to him, until [349] the executor took his\r\nplace in the King's Courts, as well as in those of the Church.\r\nWithin the limits just explained the heir was also bound to\r\nwarrant property sold by his ancestor to the purchaser and his\r\nheirs. /1/ It is not necessary, after this evidence that the\r\nmodern heir began by representing his ancestor generally, to seek\r\nfor expressions in later books, since his position has been\r\nlimited. But just as we have seen that the executor is still said\r\nto represent the person of his testator, the heir was said to\r\nrepresent the person of his ancestor in the time of Edward I. /2/\r\nSo, at a much later date, it was said that \"the heir is in\r\nrepresentation in point of taking by inheritance eadam persona\r\ncum antecessore,\" /3/ the same persona as his ancestor.\r\n\r\nA great judge, who died but a few years ago, repeats language\r\nwhich would have been equally familiar to the lawyers of Edward\r\nor of James. Baron Parke, after laying down that in general a\r\nparty is not required to make profert of an instrument to the\r\npossession of which he is not entitled, says that there is an\r\nexception \"in the cases of heir and executor, who may plead a\r\nrelease to the ancestor or testator whom they respectively\r\nrepresent; so also with respect to several tortfeasors, for in\r\nall these cases there is a privity between the parties which\r\nconstitutes an identity of person.\" /4/\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The identity of person was carried [350]\r\nfarther still. If a man died leaving male children, and owning\r\nland in fee, it went to the oldest son alone; but, if he left\r\nonly daughters, it descended to them all equally. In this case\r\nseveral individuals together continued the persona of their\r\nancestor. But it was always laid down that they were but one\r\nheir. /1/ For the purpose of working out this result, not only\r\nwas one person identified with another, but several persons were\r\nreduced to one, that they might sustain a single persona.\r\n\r\nWhat was the persona? It was not the sum of all the rights and\r\nduties of the ancestor. It has been seen that for many centuries\r\nhis general status, the sum of all his rights and duties except\r\nthose connected with real property, has been taken up by the\r\nexecutor or administrator. The persona continued by the heir was\r\nfrom an early day confined to real estate in its technical sense;\r\nthat is, to property subject to feudal principles, as\r\ndistinguished from chattels, which, as Blackstone tells us, /2/\r\ninclude whatever was not a feud.\r\n\r\nBut the heir's persona was not even the sum of all the ancestor's\r\nrights and duties in connection with real estate. It has been\r\nsaid already that every fee descends specifically, and not as\r\nincident to a larger universitas. This appears not so much from\r\nthe fact that the rules of descent governing different parcels\r\nmight be different, /3/ so that the same person would not be heir\r\nto both, as from the very nature of feudal property. Under the\r\nfeudal system in its vigor, the holding of land was only one\r\n[351] incident of a complex personal relation. The land was\r\nforfeited for a failure to render the services for which it was\r\ngranted; the service could be renounced for a breach of\r\ncorrelative duties on the part of the lord. /1/ It rather seems\r\nthat, in the beginning of the feudal period under Charlemagne, a\r\nman could only hold land of one lord. /2/ Even when it had become\r\ncommon to hold of more than one, the strict personal relation was\r\nonly modified so far as to save the tenant from having to perform\r\ninconsistent services. Glanvill and Bracton /3/ a tell us that a\r\ntenant holding of several lords was to do homage for each fee,\r\nbut to reserve his allegiance for the lord of whom he held his\r\nchief estate; but that, if the different lords should make war\r\nupon each other, and the chief lord should command the tenant to\r\nobey him in person, the tenant ought to obey, saving the service\r\ndue to the other lord for the fee held of him.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the tenant had a distinct persona or status in\r\nrespect of each of the fees which he held. The rights and duties\r\nincident to one of them had no relation to the rights and duties\r\nincident to another. A succession to one had no connection with\r\nthe succession to another. Each succession was the assumption of\r\na distinct personal relation, in which the successor was to be\r\ndetermined by the terms of the relation in question.\r\n\r\nThe persona which we are seeking to define is the estate. Every\r\nfee is a distinct persona, a distinct hereditas, or inheritance,\r\nas it has been called since the time of Bracton. We have already\r\nseen that it may be sustained by more [352] than one where there\r\nare several heirs, as well as by one, just as a corporation may\r\nhave more or less members. But not only may it be divided\r\nlengthwise, so to speak, among persons interested in the same way\r\nat the same time: it may also be cut across into successive\r\ninterests, to be enjoyed one after another. In technical\r\nlanguage, it may be divided into a particular estate and\r\nremainders. But they are all parts of the same fee, and the same\r\nfiction still governs them. We read in an old case that \"he in\r\nreversion and particular tenant are but one tenant.\" /1/ This is\r\nonly a statement of counsel, to be sure; but it is made to\r\naccount for a doctrine which seems to need the explanation, to\r\nthe effect that, after the death of the tenant for life, he in\r\nreversion might have error or attaint on an erroneous judgment or\r\nfalse verdict given against the tenant for life. /2/\r\n\r\nTo sum up the results so far, the heir of modern English law gets\r\nhis characteristic features from the law as it stood soon after\r\nthe Conquest. At that time he was a universal successor in a very\r\nbroad sense. Many of his functions as such were soon transferred\r\nto the executor. The heir's rights became confined to real\r\nestate, and his liabilities to those connected with real estate,\r\nand to obligations of his ancestor expressly binding him. The\r\nsuccession to each fee or feudal inheritance is distinct, not\r\npart of the sum of all the ancestor's rights regarded as one\r\nwhole. But to this day the executor in his sphere, and the heir\r\nin his, represent the person of the deceased, and are treated as\r\nif they were one with him, for the purpose of settling their\r\nrights and obligations.\r\n\r\nThe bearing which this has upon the contracts of the [353]\r\ndeceased has been pointed out. But its influence is not confined\r\nto contract; it runs through everything. The most striking\r\ninstance, however, is the acquisition of prescriptive rights.\r\nTake the case of a right of way. A right of way over a neighbor's\r\nland can only be acquired by grant, or by using it adversely for\r\ntwenty years. A man uses a way for ten years, and dies. Then his\r\nheir uses it ten years. Has any right been acquired? If common\r\nsense alone is consulted, the answer must be no. The ancestor did\r\nnot get any right, because he did not use the way long enough.\r\nAnd just as little did the heir. How can it better the heir's\r\ntitle that another man had trespassed before him? Clearly, if\r\nfour strangers to each other used the way for five years each, no\r\nright would be acquired by the last. But here comes in the\r\nfiction which has been so carefully explained. From the point of\r\nview of the law it is not two persons who have used the way for\r\nten years each, but one who has used it for twenty. The heir has\r\nthe advantage of sustaining his ancestor's and the right is\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE X. -- SUCCESSIONS INTER VIVOS\r\n\r\nI now reach the most difficult and obscure part of the subject.\r\nIt remains to be discovered whether the fiction of identity was\r\nextended to others besides the heir and executor. And if we find,\r\nas we do, that it went but little farther in express terms, the\r\nquestion will still arise whether the mode of thought and the\r\nconceptions made possible by the doctrine of inheritance have not\r\nsilently modified the law as to dealings between the living. It\r\nseems to me demonstrable that their influence has been profound,\r\nand that, without understanding the theory of inheritance, it is\r\nimpossible to understand the theory of transfer inter vivos.\r\n\r\n[354] The difficulty in dealing with the subject is to convince\r\nthe sceptic that there is anything to explain. Nowadays, the\r\nnotion that a right is valuable is almost identical with the\r\nnotion that it may be turned into money by selling it. But it was\r\nnot always so. Before you can sell a right, you must be able to\r\nmake a sale thinkable in legal terms. I put the case of the\r\ntransfer of a contract at the beginning of the Lecture. I have\r\njust mentioned the case of gaining a right by prescription, when\r\nneither party has complied with the requirement of twenty years'\r\nadverse use. In the latter instance, there is not even a right at\r\nthe time of the transfer, but a mere fact of ten years' past\r\ntrespassing. A way, until it becomes a right of way, is just as\r\nlittle susceptible of being held by a possessory title as a\r\ncontract. If then a contract can be sold, if a buyer can add the\r\ntime of his seller's adverse user to his own, what is the\r\nmachinery by which the law works out the result?\r\n\r\nThe most superficial acquaintance with any system of law in its\r\nearlier stages will show with what difficulty and by what slow\r\ndegrees such machinery has been provided, and how the want of it\r\nhas restricted the sphere of alienation. It is a great mistake to\r\nassume that it is a mere matter of common sense that the buyer\r\nsteps into the shoes of the seller, according to our significant\r\nmetaphor. Suppose that sales and other civil transfers had kept\r\nthe form of warlike capture which it seems that they had in the\r\ninfancy of Roman law, /1/ and which was at least [355] partially\r\nretained in one instance, the acquisition of wives, after the\r\ntransaction had, in fact, taken the more civilized shape of\r\npurchase. The notion that the buyer came in adversely to the\r\nseller would probably have accompanied the fiction of adverse\r\ntaking, and he would have stood on his own position as founding a\r\nnew title. Without the aid of conceptions derived from some other\r\nsource, it would have been hard to work out a legal transfer of\r\nobjects which did not admit of possession.\r\n\r\nA possible source of such other conceptions was to be found in\r\nfamily law. The principles of inheritance furnished a fiction and\r\na mode of thought which at least might have been extended into\r\nother spheres. In order to prove that they were in fact so\r\nextended, it will be necessary to examine once more the law of\r\nRome, as well as the remains of German and Anglo-Saxon customs.\r\n\r\nI will take up first the German and Anglo-Saxon laws which are\r\nthe ancestors of our own on one side of the house. For although\r\nwhat we get from those sources is not in the direct line of the\r\nargument, it lays a foundation for it by showing the course of\r\ndevelopment in different fields.\r\n\r\nThe obvious analogy between purchaser and heir seems to have been\r\nused in the folk-laws, but mainly for another purpose than those\r\nwhich will have to be considered in the English law. This was to\r\nenlarge the sphere of alienability. It will be remembered that\r\nthere are many traces of family ownership in early German, as\r\nwell as in early Roman law; and it would seem that the transfer\r\n[356] of property which originally could not be given outside the\r\nfamily, was worked out through the form of making the grantee an\r\nheir.\r\n\r\nThe history of language points to this conclusion. Heres, as\r\nBeseler /1/ and others have remarked, from meaning a successor to\r\nthe property of a person deceased, was extended to the donee\r\nmortis causa, and even more broadly to grantees in general.\r\nHereditare was used in like manner for the transfer of land.\r\nHevin is quoted by Laferriere /2/ as calling attention to the\r\nfact that the ancient usage was to say heriter for purchase,\r\nheritier for purchaser, and desheriter for sell.\r\n\r\nThe texts of the Salic law give us incontrovertible evidence. A\r\nman might transfer the whole or any part of his property /3/ by\r\ndelivering possession of it to a trustee who, within twelve\r\nmonths, handed it over to the beneficiaries. /4/ To those, the\r\ntext reads, whom the donor has named heredes (quos heredes\r\nappellavit). Here then was a voluntary transfer of more or less\r\nproperty at pleasure to persons freely chosen, who were not\r\nnecessarily universal successors, if they ever were, and who\r\nnevertheless took under the name heredes. The word, which must\r\nhave meant at first persons taking by descent, was extended to\r\npersons taking by purchase. /5/ If the word became enlarged in\r\nmeaning, it is probably because the thought which it conveyed was\r\nturned to new uses. The transaction seems [357] to have fallen\r\nhalf-way between the institution of an heir and a sale. The later\r\nlaw of the Ripuarian Franks treats it more distinctly from the\r\nformer point of view. It permits a man who has no sons to give\r\nall his property to whomsoever he chooses, whether relatives or\r\nstrangers, as inheritance, either by way of adfathamire, as the\r\nSalic form was called, or by writing or delivery. /1/\r\n\r\nThe Lombards had a similar transfer, in which the donee was not\r\nonly called heres, but was made liable like an heir for the debts\r\nof the donor on receiving the property after the donor's death.\r\n/2/2 By the Salic law a man who could not pay the wergeld was\r\nallowed to transfer formally his house-lot, and with it the\r\nliability. But the transfer was to the next of kin. /3/\r\n\r\nThe house-lot or family curtilage at first devolved strictly\r\nwithin the limits of the family. Here again, at least in England,\r\nfreedom of alienation seems to have grown up by gradually\r\nincreased latitude in the choice of successors. If we may trust\r\nthe order of development to be noticed in the early charters,\r\nwhich it is hard to believe [358] accidental, although the\r\ncharters are few, royal grants at first permitted an election of\r\nheirs among the kindred, and then extended it beyond them. In a\r\ndeed of the year 679, the language is, \"as it is granted so do\r\nyou hold it and your posterity.\" One a century later reads,\r\n\"which let him always possess, and after his death leave to which\r\nof his heirs he will.\" Another, \"and after him with free power\r\n(of choice) leave to the man of his kin to whom he wishes to\"\r\n(leave it). A somewhat earlier charter of 736 goes a step\r\nfurther: \"So that as long as he lives he shall have the power of\r\nholding and possessing (and) of leaving it to whomsoever he\r\nchoose, either in his lifetime, or certainly after his death.\" At\r\nthe beginning of the ninth century the donee has power to leave\r\nthe property to whomsoever he will, or, in still broader terms,\r\nto exchange or grant in his lifetime, and after his death to\r\nleave it to whom he chooses,--or to sell, exchange, and leave to\r\nwhatsoever heir he chooses. /1/ This choice of heirs [359]\r\nrecalls the quos heredes appellavit of the Salic law just\r\nmentioned, and may be compared with the language of a Norman\r\ncharter of about the year 1190: \"To W. and his heirs, to wit\r\nthose whom he may constitute his heirs.\" /1/\r\n\r\nA perfect example of a singular succession worked out by the\r\nfiction of kinship is to be found in the story of Burnt Njal, an\r\nIcelandic saga, which gives us a living picture of a society\r\nhardly more advanced than the Salian Franks, as we see them in\r\nthe Lex Salica. A lawsuit was to be transferred by the proper\r\nplaintiff to another more versed in the laws, and better able to\r\ncarry it on,--in fact, to an attorney. But a lawsuit was at that\r\ntime the alternative of a feud, and both were the peculiar affair\r\nof the family concerned. /2/ Accordingly, when a suit for killing\r\na member of the family was to be handed over to a stranger, the\r\ninnovation had to be reconciled with the theory that such suit\r\nbelonged only to the next of kin. Mord is to take upon himself\r\nThorgeir's suit against Flosi for killing Helgi, and the form of\r\ntransfer is described as follows.\r\n\r\n\"Then Mord took Thorgeir by the hand and named two witnesses to\r\nbear witness, 'that Thorgeir Thofir's son hands me over a suit\r\nfor manslaughter against Flosi Thord's son, to plead it for the\r\nslaying of Helgi Njal's son, with all those proofs which have to\r\nfollow the suit. Thou handest over to me this suit to plead and\r\nto settle, and to enjoy all rights in it, as though I were the\r\nrightful next of kin. Thou handest it over to me by law; and I\r\n[360] take it from thee by law.'\" Afterwards, these witnesses\r\ncome before the court, and bear witness to the transfer in like\r\nwords: \"He handed over to him then this suit, with all the proofs\r\nand proceedings which belonged to the suit, he handed it over to\r\nhim to plead and to settle, and to make use of all rights, as\r\nthough he were the rightful next of kin. Thorgeir handed it over\r\nlawfully, and Mord took it lawfully.\" The suit went on,\r\nnotwithstanding the change of hands, as if the next of kin were\r\nplaintiff. This is shown by a further step in the proceedings.\r\nThe defendant challenges two of the court, on the ground of their\r\nconnection with Mord, the transferee, by blood and by baptism.\r\nBut Mord replies that this is no good challenge; for \"he\r\nchallenged them not for their kinship to the true plaintiff, the\r\nnext of kin, but for their kinship to him who pleaded the suit.\"\r\nAnd the other side had to admit that Mord was right in his law.\r\n\r\nI now turn from the German to the Roman sources. These have the\r\nclosest connection with the argument, because much of the\r\ndoctrine to be found there has been transplanted unchanged into\r\nmodern law.\r\n\r\nThe early Roman law only recognized as relatives those who would\r\nhave been members of the same patriarchal family, and under the\r\nsame patriarchal authority, had the common ancestor survived. As\r\nwives passed into the families of their husbands, and lost all\r\nconnection with that in which they were born, relationship\r\nthrough females was altogether excluded. The heir was one who\r\ntraced his relationship to the deceased through males alone. With\r\nthe advance of civilization this rule was changed. The praetor\r\ngave the benefits of the inheritance to the blood relations,\r\nalthough they were not heirs, and could [361] not be admitted to\r\nthe succession according to the ancient law. /1/ But the change\r\nwas not brought about by repealing the old law, which still\r\nsubsisted under the name of the jus civile. The new principle was\r\naccommodated to the old forms by a fiction. The blood relation\r\ncould sue on the fiction that he was an heir, although he was not\r\none in fact. /2/\r\n\r\nOne the early forms of instituting an heir was a sale of the\r\nfamilia or headship of the family to the intended heir, with all\r\nits rights and duties. /3/ This sale of the universitas was\r\nafterwards extended beyond the case of inheritance to that of\r\nbankruptcy, when it was desired to put the bankrupt's property\r\ninto the hands of a trustee for distribution. This trustee also\r\ncould make use of the fiction, and sue as if he had been the\r\nbankrupt's heir. /4/ We are told by one of the great\r\njurisconsults that in general universal successors stand in the\r\nplace of heirs. /5/\r\n\r\nThe Roman heir, with one or two exceptions, was always a\r\nuniversal successor; and the fiction of heirship, as such, could\r\nhardly be used with propriety except to enlarge the sphere of\r\nuniversal successions. So far as it extended, however, all the\r\nconsequences attached to the original fiction of identity between\r\nheir and ancestor followed as of course.\r\n\r\n[362] To recur to the case of rights acquired by prescription,\r\nevery universal successor could add the time of his predecessor's\r\nadverse use to his own in order to make out the right. There was\r\nno addition, legally speaking, but one continuous possession.\r\n\r\nThe express fiction of inheritance perhaps stopped here. But when\r\na similar joinder of times was allowed between a legatee or\r\ndevisee (legatarius) and his testator, the same explanation was\r\noffered. It was said, that, when a specific thing was left to a\r\nperson by will, so far as concerned having the benefit of the\r\ntime during which the testator had been in possession for the\r\npurpose of acquiring a title, the legatee was in a certain sense\r\nquasi an heir. /1/ Yet a legatarius was not a universal\r\nsuccessor, and for most purposes stood in marked contrast with\r\nsuch successors. /2/\r\n\r\nThus the strict law of inheritance had made the notion familiar\r\nthat one man might have the advantage of a position filled by\r\nanother, although it was not filled, or was only partially\r\nfilled, by himself; and the second fiction, by which the\r\nprivileges of a legal heir in this respect as well as others had\r\nbeen extended to other persons, broke down the walls which might\r\notherwise have confined those privileges to a single case. A new\r\nconception was introduced into the law, and there was nothing to\r\nhinder its further application. As has been shown, it was applied\r\nin terms to a sale of the universitas for business purposes, and\r\nto at least one case where the succession was confined to a\r\nsingle specific thing. Why, then, might not every gift or sale be\r\nregarded as a succession, so far as to insure the same\r\nadvantages?\r\n\r\n[363] The joinder of times to make out a title was soon allowed\r\nbetween buyer and seller, and I have no doubt, from the language\r\nalways used by the Roman lawyers, that it was arrived at in the\r\nway I have suggested. A passage from Scaevola (B. C. 30) will\r\nfurnish sufficient proof. Joinder of possessions, he says, that\r\nis, the right to add the time of one's predecessor's holding to\r\none's own, clearly belongs to those who succeed to the place of\r\nothers, whether by contract or by will: for heirs and those who\r\nare treated as holding the place of successors are allowed to add\r\ntheir testator's possession to their own. Accordingly, if you\r\nsell me a slave I shall have the benefit of your holding. /1/\r\n\r\nThe joinder of times is given to those who succeed to the place\r\nof another. Ulpian cites a like phrase from a jurisconsult of the\r\ntime of the Antonines,--\"to whose place I have succeeded by\r\ninheritance, or purchase, or any other right.\" /2/ Succedere in\r\nlocum aliorum, like sustinere personam, is an expression of the\r\nRoman lawyers for those continuations of one man's legal position\r\nby another of which the type was the succession of heir to\r\nancestor. Suecedere alone is used in the sense of inherit, /3/\r\nand successio in that of \"inheritance.\" /4/ The succession par\r\nexcellence was the inheritance; and it is believed that scarcely\r\nany instance will be found in the Roman sources where\r\n\"succession\" does not convey that analogy, and indicate the\r\npartial [364] assumption, at least, of a persona formerly\r\nsustained by another. It clearly does so in the passage before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nBut the succession which admits a joinder of times is not\r\nhereditary succession alone. In the passage which has been cited\r\nScaevola says that it may be by contract or purchase, as well as\r\nby inheritance or will. It may be singular, as well as universal.\r\nThe jurists often mention antithetically universal successions\r\nand those confined to a single specific thing. Ulpian says that a\r\nman succeeds to another's place, whether his succession be\r\nuniversal or to the single object. /1/\r\n\r\nIf further evidence were wanting for the present argument, it\r\nwould be found in another expression of Ulpian's. He speaks of\r\nthe benefit of joinder as derived from the persona of the\r\ngrantor. \"He to whom a thing is granted shall have the benefit of\r\njoinder from the persona of his grantor.\" /2/ A benefit cannot be\r\nderived from a persona except by sustaining it.\r\n\r\nIt farther appears pretty plainly from Justinian's Institutes and\r\nthe Digest, that the benefit was not extended to purchasers in\r\nall cases until a pretty late period. /3/\r\n\r\nSavigny very nearly expressed the truth when he said, somewhat\r\nbroadly, that \"every accessio, for whatever purpose, presupposes\r\nnothing else than a relation of juridical [365] succession\r\nbetween the previous and present possessor. For succession does\r\nnot apply to possession by itself.\" /1/ And I may add, by way of\r\nfurther explanation, that every relation of juridical succession\r\npresupposes either an inheritance or a relation to which, so far\r\nas it extends, the analogies of the inheritance may be applied.\r\n\r\nThe way of thinking which led to the accessio or joinder of times\r\nis equally visible in other cases. The time during which a former\r\nowner did not use an casement was imputed to the person who had\r\nsucceeded to his place. /2/ The defence that the plaintiff had\r\nsold and delivered the thing in controversy was available not\r\nonly to the purchaser, but to his heirs or to a second purchaser,\r\neven before delivery to him, against the successors of the\r\nseller, whether universal or only to the thing in question. /3/\r\nIf one used a way wrongfully as against the predecessor in title,\r\nit was wrongful as against the successor, whether by inheritance,\r\npurchase, or any other right. /4/ The formal oath of a party to\r\nan action was conclusive in favor of his successors, universal or\r\nsingular. /5/ Successors by purchase or gift had the [366]\r\nbenefit of agreements made with the vendor. /1/ A multitude of\r\ngeneral expressions show that for most purposes, whether of\r\naction or defence, the buyer stood in the shoes of the seller, to\r\nuse the metaphor of our own law. /2/ And what is more important\r\nthan the result, which often might have been reached by other\r\nways, the language and analogies are drawn throughout from the\r\nsuccession to the inheritance.\r\n\r\nThus understood, there could not have been a succession between a\r\nperson dispossessed of a thing against his will and the wrongful\r\npossessor. Without the element of consent there is no room for\r\nthe analogy just explained. Accordingly, it is laid down that\r\nthere is no joinder of times when the possession is wrongful, /3/\r\nand the only enumerated means of succeeding in rem are by will,\r\nsale, gift, or some other right.\r\n\r\nThe argument now returns to the English law, fortified with some\r\ngeneral conclusions. It has been shown that in both the systems\r\nfrom whose union our law arose the rules governing conveyance, or\r\nthe transfer of specific [367] objects between living persons,\r\nwere deeply affected by notions drawn from inheritance. It had\r\nbeen shown previously that in England the principles of\r\ninheritance applied directly to the singular succession of the\r\nheir to a specific fee, as well as to the universal succession of\r\nthe executor. It would be remarkable, considering their history,\r\nif the same principles had not affected other singular\r\nsuccessions also. It will soon appear that they have. And not to\r\nbe too careful about the order of proof, I will first take up the\r\njoinder of times in prescription, as that has just been so fully\r\ndiscussed. The English law of the subject is found on examination\r\nto be the same as the Roman in extent, reason, and expression. It\r\nis indeed largely copied from that source. For servitudes, such\r\nas rights of way, light, and the like, form the chief class of\r\nprescriptive rights, and our law of servitudes is mainly Roman.\r\nPrescriptions, it is said, \"are properly personal, and therefore\r\nare always alleged in the person of him who prescribes, viz. that\r\nhe and all those whose estate he hath, &c.; therefore, a bishop\r\nor a parson may prescribe,... for there is a perpetual estate,\r\nand a perpetual succession and the successor hath the very same\r\nestate which his predecessor had, for that continues, though the\r\nperson alters, like the case of the ancestor and the heir.\" /1/\r\nSo in a modern case, where by statute twenty years' dispossession\r\nextinguished the owner's title, the Court of Queen's Bench said\r\nthat probably the right would be transferred to the possessor \"if\r\nthe same person, or several persons, claiming one from the other\r\nby descent, will [368] or conveyance, had been in possession for\r\nthe twenty years.\" \"But.... such twenty years' possession must\r\nbe either by the same person, or several persons claiming one\r\nfrom the other, which is not the case here.\" /1/\r\n\r\nIn a word, it is equally clear that the continuous possession of\r\nprivies in title, or, in Roman phrase, successors, has all the\r\neffect of the continuous possession of one, and that such an\r\neffect is not attributed to the continuous possession of\r\ndifferent persons who are not in the same chain of title. One who\r\ndispossesses another of land cannot add the time during which his\r\ndisseisee has used a way to the period of his own use, while one\r\nwho purchased can. /2/\r\n\r\nThe authorities which have been quoted make it plain that the\r\nEnglish law proceeds on the same theory as the Roman. One who\r\nbuys land of another gets the very same estate which his seller\r\nhad. He is in of the same fee, or hereditas, which means, as I\r\nhave shown, that he sustains the same persona. On the other hand,\r\none who wrongfully dispossesses another,--a disseisor,--gets a\r\ndifferent estate, is in of a new fee, although the land is the\r\nsame; and much technical reasoning is based upon this doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of prescription, therefore, buyer and seller were\r\nidentified, like heir and ancestor. But the question [369]\r\nremains whether this identification bore fruit in other parts of\r\nthe law also, or whether it was confined to one particular\r\nbranch, where the Roman law was grafted upon the English stock.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt which answer is most probable, but it\r\ncannot be proved without difficulty. As has been said, the heir\r\nceased to be the general representative of his ancestor at an\r\nearly date. And the extent to which even he was identified came\r\nto be a matter of discussion. Common sense kept control over\r\nfiction here as elsewhere in the common law. But there can be no\r\ndoubt that in matters directly concerning the estate the\r\nidentification of heir and ancestor has continued to the present\r\nday; and as an estate in fee simple has been shown to be a\r\ndistinct persona, we should expect to find a similar\r\nidentification of buyer and seller in this part of the law, if\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nWhere the land was devised by will, the analogy applied with\r\npeculiar ease. For although there is no difference in principle\r\nbetween a devise of a piece of land by will and a conveyance of\r\nit by deed, the dramatic resemblance of a devisee to an heir is\r\nstronger than that of a grantee. It will be remembered that one\r\nof the Roman jurists said that a legatarius (legatee or devisee)\r\nwas in a certain sense quasi heres. The English courts have\r\noccasionally used similar expressions. In a case where a testator\r\nowned a rent, and divided it by will among his sons, and then one\r\nof the sons brought debt for his part, two of the judges, while\r\nadmitting that the testator could not have divided the tenant's\r\nliability by a grant or deed in his lifetime, thought that it was\r\notherwise with regard to a division by will. Their reasoning was\r\nthat \"the devise is quasi [370] an act of law, which shall inure\r\nwithout attornment, and shall make a sufficient privity, and so\r\nit may well be apportioned by this means.\" /1/ So it was said by\r\nLord Ellenborough, in a case where a lessor and his heirs were\r\nentitled to terminate a lease on notice, that a devisee of the\r\nland as heres factus would be understood to have the same right.\r\n/2/\r\n\r\nBut wills of land were only exceptionally allowed by custom until\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII., and as the main doctrines of\r\nconveyancing had been settled long before that time, we must look\r\nfurther back and to other sources for their explanation. We shall\r\nfind it in the history of warranty. This, and the modern law of\r\ncovenants running with the land, will be treated in the next\r\nLecture.\r\n\r\n[371]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE XI. -- SUCCESSIONS.--II. INTER VIVOS.\r\n\r\nThe principal contracts known to the common law and suable in the\r\nKing's Courts, a century after the Conquest, were suretyship and\r\ndebt. The heir, as the general representative of his ancestor's\r\nrights and obligations, was liable for his debts, and was the\r\nproper person to sue for those which were due the estate. By the\r\ntime of Edward III. this had changed. Debts had ceased to concern\r\nthe heir except secondarily. The executor took his place both for\r\ncollection and payment. It is said that even when the heir was\r\nbound he could not be sued except in case the executor had no\r\nassets. /1/\r\n\r\nBut there was another ancient obligation which had a different\r\nhistory. I refer to the warranty which arose upon the transfer of\r\nproperty. We should call it a contract, but it probably presented\r\nitself to the mind of Glanvill's predecessors simply as a duty or\r\nobligation attached by law to a transaction which was directed to\r\na different point; just as the liability of a bailee, which is\r\nnow treated as arising from his undertaking, was originally\r\nraised by the law out of the position in which he stood toward\r\nthird persons.\r\n\r\nAfter the Conquest we do not hear much of warranty, except in\r\nconnection with land, and this fact will at once [372] account\r\nfor its having had a different history from debt. The obligation\r\nof warranty was to defend the title, and, if the defence failed,\r\nto give to the evicted owner other land of equal value. If an\r\nancestor had conveyed lands with warranty, this obligation could\r\nnot be fulfilled by his executor, but only by his heir, to whom\r\nhis other lands had descended. Conversely as to the benefit of\r\nwarranties made to a deceased grantee, his heir was the only\r\nperson interested to enforce such warranties, because the land\r\ndescended to him. Thus the heir continued to represent his\r\nancestor in the latter's rights and obligations by way of\r\nwarranty, after the executor had relieved him of the debts, just\r\nas before that time he had represented his ancestor in all\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nIf a man was sued for property which he had bought from another,\r\nthe regular course of litigation was for the defendant to summon\r\nin his seller to take charge of the defence, and for him, in\r\nturn, to summon in his, if he had one, and so on until a party\r\nwas reached in the chain of title who finally took the burden of\r\nthe case upon himself. A contrast which was early stated between\r\nthe Lombard and the Roman law existed equally between the\r\nAnglo-Saxon and the Roman. It was said that the Lombard presents\r\nhis grantor, the Roman stands in his grantor's\r\nshoes,--Langobardus dat auctorem, Romanus stat loco auctoris. /1/\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, that A gave land to B, and B conveyed over to C. If\r\nC was sued by D, claiming a better title, C practically got the\r\nbenefit of A's warranty, /2/ because, when he summoned B, B would\r\nsummon A, and thus A [373] would defend the case in the end. But\r\nit might happen that between the time when B conveyed to C, and\r\nthe time when the action was begun, B had died. If he left an\r\nheir, C might still be protected. But supposing B left no heir, C\r\ngot no help from A, who in the other event would have defended\r\nhis suit. This no doubt was the law in the Anglo-Saxon period,\r\nbut it was manifestly unsatisfactory. We may conjecture, with a\r\ngood deal of confidence, that a remedy would be found as soon as\r\nthere was machinery to make it possible. This was furnished by\r\nthe Roman law. According to that system, the buyer stood in the\r\nplace of his seller, and a fusion of the Roman with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon rule was all that was needed.\r\n\r\nBracton, who modelled his book upon the writings of the mediaeval\r\ncivilians, shows how this thought was used. He first puts the\r\ncase of a conveyance with the usual clause binding the grantor\r\nand his heirs to warrant and defend the grantee and his heirs. He\r\nthen goes on: \"Again one may make his gift greater and make other\r\npersons quasi heirs [of his grantee], although, in fact, they are\r\nnot heirs, as when he says in the gift, to have and to hold to\r\nsuch a one and his heirs, or to whomsoever he shall choose to\r\ngive or assign the said land, and I and my heirs will warrant to\r\nthe said so and so, and his heirs, or to whomsoever he shall\r\nchoose to give or assign the said land, and their heirs, against\r\nall persons. In which case if the grantee shall have given or\r\nassigned the land, and then have died without heirs, the [first]\r\ngrantor and his heirs begin to hold the place of the first\r\ngrantee and his heirs, and are in place of the first grantee's\r\nheir (pro herede) so far as concerns warranting to his assigns\r\nand their heirs [374] according to the clause contained in the\r\nfirst grantor's charter, which would not be but for the mention\r\nof assigns in the first gift. But so long as the first grantee\r\nsurvives, or his heirs, they are held to warranty, and not the\r\nfirst grantor.\" /1/\r\n\r\nHere we see that, in order to entitle the assign to the benefit\r\nof the first grantor's warranty, assigns must be mentioned in the\r\noriginal grant and covenant. The scope of the ancient obligation\r\nwas not extended without the warrantor's assent. But when it was\r\nextended, it was not by a contrivance like a modern letter of\r\ncredit. Such a conception would have been impossible in that\r\nstage of the law. By mentioning assigns the first grantor did not\r\noffer a covenant to any person who would thereafter purchase the\r\nland. If that had been the notion, there would have been a\r\ncontract directly binding the first grantor to the assign, as\r\nsoon as the land was sold, and thus there would have been two\r\nwarranties arising from the same clause,--one to the first\r\ngrantee, a second to the assign. But in fact the assign recovered\r\non the original warranty to the first grantee. /2/ He could only\r\ncome on the first grantor after a failure of his immediate\r\ngrantor's heirs. The first grantor by mentioning assigns simply\r\nenlarged the limits of his grantee's succession. The assign could\r\nvouch the first grantor only on the principles of succession.\r\nThat is to say, he could only do so when, by the failure of the\r\nfirst grantee's blood, the first grantee's feudal relation to the\r\nfirst grantor, his persona, came to be sustained by the assign.\r\n/3/\r\n\r\n[375] This was not only carrying out the fiction with technical\r\nconsistency, but was using it with good sense, as fictions\r\ngenerally have been used in the English law. Practically it made\r\nlittle difference whether the assign got the benefit of the first\r\ngrantor's warranty mediately or immediately, if he got it. The\r\ntrouble arose where he could not summon the mesne grantor, and\r\nthe new right was given him for that case alone. Later, the\r\nassign did not have to wait for the failure of his immediate\r\ngrantor's blood, but could take advantage of the first grantor's\r\nwarranty from the beginning. /1/\r\n\r\nIf it should be suggested that what has been said goes to show\r\nthat the first grantor's duty to warrant arose from the assign's\r\nbecoming his man and owing homage, the answer is that he was not\r\nbound unless he had mentioned assigns in his grant, homage or no\r\nhomage. In this Bracton is confirmed by all the later\r\nauthorities. /2/\r\n\r\nAnother rule on which there are vast stores of forgotten learning\r\nwill show how exactly the fiction fell in with the earlier law.\r\nOnly those who were privy in estate with the person to whom the\r\nwarranty was originally given, could vouch the original\r\nwarrantor. Looking back to the early [376] procedure, it will be\r\nseen that of course only those in the same chain of title could\r\neven mediately get the benefit of a former owner's warranty. The\r\nground on which a man was bound to warrant was that he had\r\nconveyed the property to the person who summoned him. Hence a man\r\ncould summon no one but his grantor, and the successive vouchers\r\ncame to an end when the last vouchee could not call on another\r\nfrom whom he had bought. Now when the process was abridged, no\r\npersons were made liable to summons who would not have been\r\nliable before. The present owner was allowed to vouch directly\r\nthose who otherwise would have been indirectly bound to defend\r\nhis title, but no others. Hence he could only summon those from\r\nwhom his grantor derived his title. But this was equally well\r\nexpressed in terms of the fiction employed. In order to vouch,\r\nthe present owner must have the estate of the person to whom the\r\nwarranty was made. As every lawyer knows, the estate does not\r\nmean the land. It means the status or persona in regard to that\r\nland formerly sustained by another. The same word was used in\r\nalleging a right by prescription, \"that he and those whose estate\r\nhe hath have for time whereof memory runneth not to the\r\ncontrary,\" &c.; and it will be remembered that the word\r\ncorresponds to the same requirement of succession there.\r\n\r\nTo return to Bracton, it must be understood that the description\r\nof assigns as quasi heredes is not accidental. He describes them\r\nin that way whenever he has occasion to speak of them. He even\r\npushes the reasoning drawn from the analogy of inheritance to\r\nextremes, and refers to it in countless passages. For instance:\r\n\"It should be noted that of heirs some are true heirs and some\r\nquasi [377] heirs, in place of heirs, &c.; true heirs by way of\r\nsuccession quasi heirs, &c. by the form of the gift; such as\r\nassigns,\" &c. /1/\r\n\r\nIf it should be suggested that Bracton's language is only a piece\r\nof mediaeval scholasticism, there are several answers. In the\r\nfirst place it is nearly contemporaneous with the first\r\nappearance of the right in question. This is shown by his citing\r\nauthority for it as for something which might be disputed. He\r\nsays, \"And that warranty must be made to assigns according to the\r\nform of the gift is proved [by a case] in the circuit of W. de\r\nRalegh, about the end of the roll,\"&c. /2/ It is not justifiable\r\nto assume that a contemporary explanation of a new rule had\r\nnothing to do with its appearance. Again, the fact is clear that\r\nthe assign got the benefit of the warranty to the first grantee,\r\nnot of a new one to himself, as has been shown, and Bracton's\r\nexplanation of how this was worked out falls in with what has\r\nbeen seen of the course of the German and Anglo-Saxon law, and\r\nwith the pervading thought of the Roman law. Finally, and most\r\nimportant, the requirement that the assign should be in of the\r\nfirst grantee's estate has remained a requirement from that day\r\nto this. The fact that the same thing is required in the same\r\nwords as in prescription goes far to show that the same technical\r\nthought has governed both.\r\n\r\nI have said, Glanvill's predecessors probably regarded warranty\r\nas an obligation incident to a conveyance, rather than as a\r\ncontract. But when it became usual to insert the undertaking to\r\nwarrant in a deed or charter of feoffment, it lost something of\r\nits former isolation as a duty standing by itself, and admitted\r\nof being [378] generalized. It was a promise by deed, and a\r\npromise by deed was a covenant. /1/ This was a covenant having\r\npeculiar consequences attached to it, no doubt. It differed also\r\nin the scope of its obligation from some other covenants, as will\r\nbe shown hereafter. But still it was a covenant, and could\r\nsometimes be sued on as such. It was spoken of in the Year Books\r\nof Edward III. as a covenant which \"falls in the blood,\" /2/ as\r\ndistinguished from those where the acquittance fell on the land,\r\nand not on the person. /3/\r\n\r\nThe importance of this circumstance lies in the working of the\r\nlaw of warranty upon other covenants which took its place. When\r\nthe old actions for land gave way to more modern and speedier\r\nforms, warrantors were no longer vouched in to defend, and if a\r\ngrantee was evicted, damages took the place of a grant of other\r\nland. The ancient warranty disappeared, and was replaced by the\r\ncovenants which we still find in our deeds, including the\r\ncovenants for seisin, for right to convey, against incumbrances,\r\nfor quiet enjoyment, of warranty, and for further assurance. But\r\nthe principles on which an assign could have the benefit of these\r\ncovenants were derived from those which governed warranty, as any\r\none may see by looking at the earlier decisions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the question, what was a sufficient assignment to\r\ngive an assign the benefit of a covenant for quiet enjoyment, was\r\nargued and decided on the authority of the old cases of warranty.\r\n/4/\r\n\r\n[379] The assign, as in warranty, came in under the old covenant\r\nwith the first covenantee, not by any new right of his own. Thus,\r\nin an action by an assign on a covenant for further assurance,\r\nthe defendant set up a release by the original covenantee after\r\nthe commencement of the suit. The court held that the assignee\r\nshould have the benefit of the covenant. \"They held, that\r\nalthough the breach was in the time of the assignee, yet if the\r\nrelease had been by the covenantee (who is a party to the deed,\r\nand from whom the plaintiff derives) before any breach, or before\r\nthe suit commenced, it had been a good bar to the assignee from\r\nbringing this writ of covenant. But the breach of the covenant\r\nbeing in the time of the assignee,... and the action brought by\r\nhim, and so attached in his person, the covenantee cannot release\r\nthis action wherein the assignee is interested.\" /1/ The\r\ncovenantee even after assignment remains the legal party to the\r\ncontract. The assign comes in under him, and does not put an end\r\nto his control over it, until by breach and action a new right\r\nattaches in the assign's person, distinct from the rights derived\r\nfrom the persona of his grantor. Later, the assign got a more\r\nindependent standing, as the original foundation of his rights\r\nsunk gradually out of sight, and a release after assignment\r\nbecame ineffectual, at least in the case of a covenant to pay\r\nrent. /2/\r\n\r\nOnly privies in estate with the original covenantee can have the\r\nbenefit of covenants for title. It has been shown that a similar\r\nlimitation of the benefits of the ancient [380] warranty was\r\nrequired by its earlier history before the assign was allowed to\r\nsue, and that the fiction by which he got that right could not\r\nextend it beyond that limit. This analogy also was followed. For\r\ninstance, a tenant in tail male made a lease for years with\r\ncovenants of right to let and for quiet enjoyment, and then died\r\nwithout issue male. The lessee assigned the lease to the\r\nplaintiff. The latter was soon turned out, and thereupon brought\r\nan action upon the covenant against the executor of the lessor.\r\nIt was held that he could not recover, because he was not privy\r\nin estate with the original covenantee. For the lease, which was\r\nthe original covenantee's estate, was ended by the death of the\r\nlessor and termination of the estate tail out of which the lease\r\nwas granted, before the form of assignment to the plaintiff. /1/\r\n\r\nThe only point remaining to make the analogy between covenants\r\nfor title and warranty complete was to require assigns to be\r\nmentioned in order to enable them to sue. In modern times, of\r\ncourse, such a requirement, if it should exist, would be purely\r\nformal, and would be of no importance except as an ear-mark by\r\nwhich to trace the history of a doctrine. It would aid our\r\nstudies if we could say that wherever assigns are to get the\r\nbenefit of a covenant as privies in estate with the covenantee,\r\nthey must be mentioned in the covenant. Whether such a\r\nrequirement does exist or not would be hard to tell from the\r\ndecisions alone. It is commonly supposed not to. But the popular\r\nopinion on this trifling point springs from a failure to\r\nunderstand one of the great antinomies of the law, which must now\r\nbe explained.\r\n\r\nSo far as we have gone, we have found that, wherever [381] one\r\nparty steps into the rights or obligations of another, without in\r\nturn filling the situation of fact of which those rights or\r\nobligations are the legal consequences, the substitution is\r\nexplained by a fictitious identification of the two individuals,\r\nwhich is derived from the analogy of the inheritance. This\r\nidentification has been seen as it has been consciously worked\r\nout in the creation of the executor, whose entire status is\r\ngoverned by it. It has been seen still consciously applied in the\r\nnarrower sphere of the heir. It has been found hidden at the root\r\nof the relation between buyer and seller in two cases at least,\r\nprescription and warranty, when the history of that relation is\r\nopened to a sufficient depth.\r\n\r\nBut although it would be more symmetrical if this analysis\r\nexhausted the subject, there is another class of cases in which\r\nthe transfer of rights takes place upon a wholly different plan.\r\nIn explaining the succession which is worked out between buyer\r\nand seller for the purpose of creating a prescriptive right, such\r\nas a right of way over neighboring land to the land bought and\r\nsold, it was shown that one who, instead of purchasing the land,\r\nhad wrongfully possessed himself of it by force, would not be\r\ntreated as a successor, and would get no benefit from the\r\nprevious use of the way by his disseisee. But when the former\r\npossessor has already gained a right of way before he is turned\r\nout, a new principle comes into operation. If the owner of the\r\nland over which the way ran stopped it up, and was sued by the\r\nwrongful possessor, a defence on the ground that the disseisor\r\nhad not succeeded to the former owner's rights would not prevail.\r\nThe disseisor would be protected in his possession of the land\r\nagainst all but the rightful owner, and he would equally be\r\nprotected [382] in his use of the way. This rule of law does not\r\nstand on a succession between the wrongful possessor and the\r\nowner, which is out of the question. Neither can it be defended\r\non the same ground as the protection to the occupation of the\r\nland itself. That ground is that the law defends possession\r\nagainst everything except a better title. But, as has been said\r\nbefore, the common law does not recognize possession of a way. A\r\nman who has used a way ten years without title cannot sue even a\r\nstranger for stopping it. He was a trespasser at the beginning,\r\nhe is nothing but a trespasser still. There must exist a right\r\nagainst the servient owner before there is a right against\r\nanybody else. At the same time it is clear that a way is no more\r\ncapable of possession because somebody else has a right to it,\r\nthan if no one had.\r\n\r\nHow comes it, then, that one who has neither title nor possession\r\nis so far favored? The answer is to be found, not in reasoning,\r\nbut in a failure to reason. In the first Lecture of this course\r\nthe thought with which we have to deal was shown in its\r\ntheological stage, to borrow Comte's well-known phraseology, as\r\nwhere an axe was made the object of criminal process; and also in\r\nthe metaphysical stage, where the language of personification\r\nalone survived, but survived to cause confusion of reasoning. The\r\ncase put seems to be an illustration of the latter. The language\r\nof the law of easements was built up out of similes drawn from\r\npersons at a time when the noxoe deditio was still familiar; and\r\nthen, as often happens, language reacted upon thought, so that\r\nconclusions were drawn as to the rights themselves from the terms\r\nin which they happened to be expressed. When one estate was said\r\nto be enslaved to another, or a right of way was said to be a\r\nquality or [383] incident of a neighboring piece of land, men's\r\nminds were not alert to see that these phrases were only so many\r\npersonifying metaphors, which explained nothing unless the figure\r\nof speech was true.\r\n\r\nRogron deduced the negative nature of servitudes from the rule\r\nthat the land owes the services, not the person,--Proedium non\r\npersona servit. For, said Rogron, the land alone being bound, it\r\ncan only be bound passively. Austin called this an \"absurd\r\nremark.\" /1/ But the jurists from whom we have inherited our law\r\nof easements were contented with no better reasoning. Papinian\r\nhimself wrote that servitudes cannot be partially extinguished,\r\nbecause they are due from lands, not persons. /2/ Celsus thus\r\ndecides the case which I took for my illustration: Even if\r\npossession of a dominant estate is acquired by forcibly ejecting\r\nthe owner, the way will be retained; since the estate is\r\npossessed in such quality and condition as it is when taken. /3/\r\nThe commentator Godefroi tersely adds that there are two such\r\nconditions, slavery and freedom; and his antithesis is as old as\r\nCicero. /4/ So, in another passage, Celsus asks, What else are\r\nthe rights attaching to land but qualities of that land? /5/ So\r\nJustinian's Institutes speak of servitudes which inhere in\r\nbuildings. /6/ So Paulus [384] speaks of such rights as being\r\naccessory to bodies. \"And thus,\" adds Godefroi, \"rights may\r\nbelong to inanimate things.\" /1/ It easily followed from all this\r\nthat a sale of the dominant estate carried existing easements,\r\nnot because the buyer succeeded to the place of the seller, but\r\nbecause land is bound to land. /2/\r\n\r\nAll these figures import that land is capable of having rights,\r\nas Austin recognizes. Indeed, he even says that the land \"is\r\nerected into a legal or fictitious person, and is styled\r\n'praedium dominans.'\" /3/ But if this means anything more than to\r\nexplain what is implied by the Roman metaphors, it goes too far.\r\nThe dominant estate was never \"erected into a legal person,\"\r\neither by conscious fiction or as a result of primitive beliefs.\r\n/4/ It could not sue or be sued, like a ship in the admiralty. It\r\nis not supposed that its possessor could maintain an action for\r\nan interference with an easement before his time, as an heir\r\ncould for an injury to property of the hereditas jacens. If land\r\nhad even been systematically treated as capable of acquiring\r\nrights, the time of a disseisee might have been added to that Of\r\nthe wrongful occupant, on the ground that the land, and not this\r\nor that individual, was gaining the easement, and that long\r\nassociation between the enjoyment of the privilege and the land\r\nwas sufficient, which has never been the law.\r\n\r\nAll that can be said is, that the metaphors and similes employed\r\nnaturally led to the rule which has prevailed, [385] and that, as\r\nthis rule was just as good as any other, or at least was\r\nunobjectionable, it was drawn from the figures of speech without\r\nattracting attention, and before any one had seen that they were\r\nonly figures, which proved nothing and justified no conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs easements were said to belong to the dominant estate, it\r\nfollowed that whoever possessed the land had a right of the same\r\ndegree over what was incidental to it. If the true meaning had\r\nbeen that a way or other easement admits of possession, and is\r\ntaken possession of with the land to which it runs, and that its\r\nenjoyment is protected on the same grounds as possession in other\r\ncases, the thought could have been understood. But that was not\r\nthe meaning of the Roman law, and, as has been shown, it is not\r\nthe doctrine of ours. We must take it that easements have become\r\nan incident of land by an unconscious and unreasoned assumption\r\nthat a piece of land can have rights. It need not be said that\r\nthis is absurd, although the rules of law which are based upon it\r\nare not so.\r\n\r\nAbsurd or not, the similes as well as the principles of the Roman\r\nlaw reappear in Bracton. He says, \"The servitude by which land is\r\nsubjected to [other] land, is made on the likeness of that by\r\nwhich man is made the slave of man.\" /1/ \"For rights belong to a\r\nfree tenement, as well as tangible things.... They may be called\r\nrights or liberties with regard to the tenements to which they\r\nare owed, but servitudes with regard to the tenements by which\r\nthey are owed.... One estate is free, the other subjected to\r\nslavery.\" /2/ \"[A servitude] may be called an arrangement by\r\nwhich house is subjected to house, farm to [386] farm, holding to\r\nholding.\" /1/ No passage has met my eye in which Bracton\r\nexpressly decides that an easement goes with the dominant estate\r\nupon a disseisin, but what he says leaves little doubt that he\r\nfollowed the Roman law in this as in other things.\r\n\r\nThe writ against a disseisor was for \"so much land and its\r\nappurtenances,\" /2/ which must mean that he who had the land even\r\nwrongfully had the appurtenances. So Bracton says an action is in\r\nrem \"whether it is for the principal thing, or for a right which\r\nadheres to the thing,... as when one sues for a right of way,\r\n... since rights of this sort are all incorporeal things, and are\r\nquasi possessed and reside in bodies, and cannot be got or kept\r\nwithout the bodies in which they inhere, nor in any way had\r\nwithout the bodies to which they belong.\" /3/ And again, \"Since\r\nrights do not admit of delivery, but are transferred with the\r\nthing in which they are, that is, the bodily thing, he to whom\r\nthey are transferred forthwith has a quasi possession of those\r\nrights as soon as he has the body in which they are.\" /4/\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt about the later law, as has been said at the\r\noutset.\r\n\r\nWe have thus traced two competing and mutually inconsistent\r\nprinciples into our law. On the one hand is the conception of\r\nsuccession or privity; on the other, that of rights inhering in a\r\nthing. Bracton seems to have vacillated a little from a feeling\r\nof the possibility of conflict between the two. The benefit of a\r\nwarranty was confined to those who, by the act and consent of the\r\n[387] grantee, succeeded to his place. It did not pass to assigns\r\nunless assigns were mentioned. Bracton supposes grants of\r\neasements with or without mention of assigns, which looks as if\r\nhe thought the difference might be material with regard to\r\neasements also. He further says, that if an easement be granted\r\nto A, his heirs and assigns, all such by the form of the grant\r\nare allowed the use in succession, and all others are wholly\r\nexcluded. /1/ But he is not speaking of what the rights of a\r\ndisseisor would be as against one not having a better title, and\r\nhe immediately adds that they are rights over a corporeal object\r\nbelonging to a corporeal object.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be doubted whether the mention of assigns was\r\never necessary to attach an easement to land, and although it is\r\nvery certain that it did not remain so long, the difficulty\r\nreferred to grew greater as time went on. It would have been\r\neasily disposed of if the only rights which could be annexed to\r\nland were easements, such as a right of way. It then might have\r\nbeen said that these were certain limited interests in land, less\r\nthan ownership in extent, but like it in kind, and therefore\r\nproperly transferred by the same means that ownership was. A\r\nright of way, it might have been argued, is not to be approached\r\nfrom the point of view of contract. It does not presuppose any\r\npromise on the part of the servient owner. His obligation,\r\nalthough more troublesome to him than to others, is the same as\r\nthat of every one else. It is the purely negative duty not to\r\nobstruct or interfere with a right of property. /2/\r\n\r\n[388] But although the test of rights going with the land may\r\nhave been something of that nature, this will not help us to\r\nunderstand the cases without a good deal of explanation. For such\r\nrights might exist to active services which had to be performed\r\nby the person who held the servient estate. It strikes our ear\r\nstrangely to hear a right to services from an individual called a\r\nright of property as distinguished from contract. Still this will\r\nbe found to have been the way in which such rights were regarded.\r\nBracton argues that it is no wrong to the lord for the tenant to\r\nalienate land held by free and perfect gift, on the ground that\r\nthe land is bound and charged with the services into whose hands\r\nsoever it may come. The lord is said to have a fee in the homage\r\nand services; and therefore no entry upon the land which does not\r\ndisturb them injures him. /1/ It is the tenement which imposes\r\nthe obligation of homage, /2/ and the same thing is true of\r\nvillein and other feudal services. /3/\r\n\r\nThe law remained unchanged when feudal services took the form of\r\nrent. /4/ Even in our modern terms for years rent is still\r\ntreated as something issuing out of the leased premises, so that\r\nto this day, although, if you hire a whole house and it burns\r\ndown, you have to pay without abatement, because you have the\r\nland out of which the rent issues, yet if you only hire a suite\r\nof rooms and they are burned, you pay rent no longer, because you\r\nno longer have the tenement out of which it comes. /5/\r\n\r\n[389] It is obvious that the foregoing reasoning leads to the\r\nconclusion that a disseisor of the tenant would be bound as much\r\nas the tenant himself, and this conclusion was adopted by the\r\nearly law. The lord could require the services, /1/ or collect\r\nthe rent /2/ of any one who had the land, because, as was said in\r\nlanguage very like Bracton's, \"the charge of the rent goes with\r\nthe land.\" /3/\r\n\r\nThen as to the right to the rent. Rent was treated in early law\r\nas a real right, of which a disseisin was possible, and for which\r\na possessory action could be brought. If, as was very frequently\r\nthe case, the leased land lay within a manor, the rent was parcel\r\nof the manor, /4/ so that there was some ground for saying that\r\none who was seised of the manor, that is, who possessed the lands\r\noccupied by the lord of the manor, and was recognized by the\r\ntenants as lord, had the rents as incident thereto. Thus Brian,\r\nChief Justice of England under Henry VII., says, \"If I am\r\ndisseised of a manor, and the tenants pay their rent to the\r\ndisseisor, and then I re-enter, I shall not have the back rent of\r\nmy tenants which they have paid to my disseisor, but the\r\ndisseisor shall pay for all in trespass or assize.\" /5/ This\r\nopinion was evidently founded on the notion that the rent was\r\nattached to the chief land like an easement. Sic fit ut debeantur\r\nrei a re. /6/\r\n\r\nDifferent principles might have applied when the rent was not\r\nparcel of a manor, and was only part of the reversion; that is,\r\npart of the landlord's fee or estate out of [390] which the lease\r\nwas carved. If the lease and rent were merely internal divisions\r\nof that estate, the rent could not be claimed except by one who\r\nwas privy to that estate. A disseisor would get a new and\r\ndifferent fee, and would not have the estate of which the rent\r\nwas part. And therefore it would seem that in such a case the\r\ntenant could refuse to pay him rent, and that payment to him\r\nwould be no defence against the true owner. /1/ Nevertheless, if\r\nthe tenant recognized him, the disseisor would be protected as\r\nagainst persons who could not show a better title. /2/\r\nFurthermore, the rent was so far annexed to the land that whoever\r\ncame by the reversion lawfully could collect it, including the\r\nsuperior lord in case of escheat. /3/ Yet escheat meant the\r\nextinction of the fee of which the lease and rent were parts, and\r\nalthough Bracton regarded the lord as coming in under the\r\ntenant's title pro herede, in privity, it was soon correctly\r\nsettled that he did not, but came in paramount. This instance,\r\ntherefore, comes very near that of a disseisor.\r\n\r\nServices and rent, then, were, and to some extent are still,\r\ndealt with by the law from the point of view of property. They\r\nwere things which could be owned and transferred like other\r\nproperty. They could be possessed even by wrong, and possessory\r\nremedies were given for them.\r\n\r\nNo such notion was applied to warranties, or to any right which\r\nwas regarded wholly from the point of view of contract. And when\r\nwe turn to the history of those remedies for rent which sounded\r\nin contract, we find that they were so regarded. The actions of\r\ndebt and covenant [391] could not be maintained without privity.\r\nIn the ninth year of Henry VI. /1/ it was doubted whether an heir\r\nhaving the reversion by descent could have debt, and it was held\r\nthat a grantee of the reversion, although he had the rent, could\r\nnot have that remedy for it. A few years later, it was decided\r\nthat the heir could maintain debt, /2/ and in Henry VII.'s reign\r\nthe remedy was extended to the devisee, /3/ who, as has been\r\nremarked above, seemed more akin to the heir than a grantee, and\r\nwas more easily likened to him. It was then logically necessary\r\nto give assigns the same action, and this followed. /4/ The\r\nprivity of contract followed the estate, so that the assignee of\r\nthe reversion could sue the person then holding the term. /5/ On\r\nlike grounds he was afterwards allowed to maintain covenant. /6/\r\nBut these actions have never lain for or against persons not\r\nprivy in estate with the lessor and lessee respectively, because\r\nprivity to the contract could never be worked out without\r\nsuccession to the title. /7/\r\n\r\nHowever, all these niceties had no application to the old\r\nfreehold rents of the feudal period, because the contractual\r\nremedies did not apply to them until the time of Queen Anne. /8/\r\nThe freehold rent was just as much real estate as an acre of\r\nland, and it was sued for by the similar remedy of an assize,\r\nasking to be put back into possession.\r\n\r\n[392] The allowance of contractual remedies shows that rent and\r\nfeudal services of that nature, although dealt with as things\r\ncapable of possession, and looked at generally from the point of\r\nview of property rather than of contract, yet approach much\r\nnearer to the nature of the latter than a mere duty not to\r\ninterfere with a way. Other cases come nearer still. The sphere\r\nof prescription and custom in imposing active duties is large in\r\nearly law. Sometimes the duty is incident to the ownership of\r\ncertain land; sometimes the right is, and sometimes both are, as\r\nin the case of an easement. When the service was for the benefit\r\nof other land, the fact that the burden, in popular language,\r\nfell upon one parcel, was of itself a reason for the benefit\r\nattaching to the other.\r\n\r\nInstances of different kinds are these. A parson might be bound\r\nby custom to keep a bull and a boar for the use of his parish.\r\n/1/ A right could be attached to a manor by prescription to have\r\na convent sing in the manor chapel. /2/ A right might be gained\r\nby like means to have certain land fenced by the owner of the\r\nneighboring lot. /3/ Now, it may readily be conceded that even\r\nrights like the last two, when attached to land, were looked at\r\nas property, and were spoken of as the subject of grant. /4/ It\r\nmay be conceded that, in many cases where the statement sounds\r\nstrange to modern ears, the obligation was regarded as failing on\r\nthe land alone, and not on the person of the [393] tenant. And it\r\nmay be conjectured that this view arose naturally and reasonably\r\nfrom there having been originally no remedy to compel performance\r\nof such services, except a distress executed on the servient\r\nland. /1/ But any conjectured distinction between obligations for\r\nwhich the primitive remedy was distress alone, and others, if it\r\never existed, must soon have faded from view; and the line\r\nbetween those rights which can be deemed rights of property, and\r\nthose which are mere contracts, is hard to see, after the last\r\nexamples. A covenant to repair is commonly supposed to be a pure\r\nmatter of contract. What is the difference between a duty to\r\nrepair, and a duty to fence? The difficulty remains almost as\r\ngreat as ever of finding the dividing line between the competing\r\nprinciples of transfer,--succession on the one side, and\r\npossession of dominant land on the other. If a right in the\r\nnature of an easement could be attached to land by prescription,\r\nit could equally be attached by grant. If it went with the land\r\nin one case, even into the hands of a disseisor, it must have\r\ngone with it in the other. No satisfactory distinction could be\r\nbased on the mode of acquisition, /2/ nor was any attempted. As\r\nthe right was not confined to assigns, there was no need of\r\nmentioning assigns. /3/ In modern times, at least, if not in\r\nearly law, such rights can be created by covenant as well [394]\r\nas by grant. /1/ And, on the other hand, it is ancient law that\r\nan action of covenant may be maintained upon an instrument of\r\ngrant. /2/ The result of all this was that not only a right\r\ncreated by covenant, but the action of covenant itself, might in\r\nsuch cases go to assigns, although not mentioned, at a time when\r\nsuch mention was essential to give them the benefit of a\r\nwarranty. Logically, these premises led one step farther, and not\r\nonly assigns not named, but disseisors, should have been allowed\r\nto maintain their action on the contract, as they had the right\r\narising out of it. Indeed, if the plaintiff had a right which\r\nwhen obtained by grant would have entitled him to covenant, it\r\nwas open to argument that he should be allowed the same action\r\nwhen he had the right by prescription, although, as has been seen\r\nin the case of rent, it did not follow in practice from a man's\r\nhaving a right that he had the contractual remedies for it. /3/\r\nCovenant required a specialty, but prescription was said to be a\r\nsufficiently good specialty. /4/ Where, then, was the line to be\r\ndrawn between covenants that devolved only to successors, and\r\nthose that went with the land?\r\n\r\nThe difficulty becomes more striking upon further examination of\r\nthe early law. For side by side with the personal warranty which\r\nhas been discussed hitherto, there was another warranty which has\r\nnot yet been mentioned [395] by which particular land alone was\r\nbound. /1/ The personal warranty bound only the warrantor and his\r\nheirs. As was said in a case of the time of Edward I., \"no one\r\ncan bind assigns to warranty, since warranty always extends to\r\nheirs who claim by succession and not by assignment.\" /2/ But\r\nwhen particular land was bound, the warranty went with it, even\r\ninto the hands of the King, because, as Bracton says, the thing\r\ngoes with its burden to every one. /3/ Fleta writes that every\r\npossessor will be held. /4/ There cannot be a doubt that a\r\ndisseisor would have been bound equally with one whose possession\r\nwas lawful.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready for a case /5/ decided under Edward III., which\r\nhas been discussed from the time of Fitzherbert and Coke down to\r\nLord St. Leonards and Mr. Rawle, which is still law, and is said\r\nto remain still unexplained. /6/ It shows the judges hesitating\r\nbetween the two conceptions to which this Lecture has been\r\ndevoted. If they are understood, I think the explanation will be\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nPakenham brought covenant as heir of the covenantee against a\r\nprior, for breach of a covenant made by the defendant's\r\npredecessor with the plaintiff's great-grandfather, that the\r\nprior and convent should sing every week in a chapel in his\r\nmanor, for him and his servants. The defendant first pleaded that\r\nthe plaintiff and his servants were not dwelling within the\r\nmanor; but, not daring to [396] rest his case on that, he pleaded\r\nthat the plaintiff was not heir, but that his elder brother was.\r\nThe plaintiff replied that he was tenant of the manor, and that\r\nhis great-grandfather enfeoffed a stranger, who enfeoffed the\r\nplaintiff and his wife; and that thus the plaintiff was tenant of\r\nthe manor by purchase, and privy to the ancestor; and also that\r\nthe services had been rendered for a time whereof the memory was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these pleadings that assigns were not\r\nmentioned in the covenant, and so it has always been taken. /1/\r\nIt also appears that the plaintiff was trying to stand on two\r\ngrounds; first, privity, as descendant and assign of the\r\ncovenantee; second, that the service was attached to the manor by\r\ncovenant or by prescription, and that he could maintain covenant\r\nas tenant of the manor, from whichever source the duty arose.\r\n\r\nFinchden, J. puts the case of parceners making partition, and one\r\ncovenanting with the other to acquit of suit. A purchaser has the\r\nadvantage of the covenant. Belknap, for the defendants, agrees,\r\nbut distinguishes. In that case the acquittance falls on the\r\nland, and not on the person. /2/ (That is to say, such\r\nobligations follow the analogy of easements, and, as the burden\r\nfalls on the quasi servient estate, the benefit goes with the\r\ndominant land to assigns, whether mentioned or not, and they are\r\nnot considered from the point of view of contract at all.\r\nWarranty, on the other hand, is a contract pure and simple, and\r\nlies in the blood,--falls on the person, not on the land. /3/)\r\n\r\nFinchden: a fortiori in this case; for there the action [397] was\r\nmaintained because the plaintiff was tenant of the land from\r\nwhich the suit was due, and here he is tenant of the manor where\r\nthe chapel is.\r\n\r\nWichingham, J.: If the king grants warren to another who is\r\ntenant of the manor, he shall have warren, &c.; but the warren\r\nwill not pass by the grant [of the manor], because the warren is\r\nnot appendant to the manor. No more does it seem the services are\r\nhere appendant to the manor.\r\n\r\nThorpe, C. J., to Belknap: \"There are some covenants on which no\r\none shall have an action, but the party to the covenant, or his\r\nheir, and some covenants have inheritance in the land, so that\r\nwhoever has the land by alienation, or in other manner, shall\r\nhave action of covenant; [or, as it is stated in Fitzherbert's\r\nAbridgment, /1/ the inhabitants of the land as well as every one\r\nwho has the land, shall have the covenant;] and when you say he\r\nis not heir, he is privy of blood, and may be heir: /2/ and also\r\nhe is tenant of the land, and it is a thing which is annexed to\r\nthe chapel, which is in the manor, and so annexed to the manor,\r\nand so he has said that the services have been rendered for all\r\ntime whereof there is memory, whence it is right this action\r\nshould be maintained.\" Belknap denied that the plaintiff counted\r\non such a prescription; but Thorpe said he did, and we bear\r\nrecord of it, and the case was adjourned. /3/\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the discussion followed the lines marked out\r\nby the pleading. One judge thought that [398] the plaintiff was\r\nentitled to recover as tenant of the manor. The other puisne\r\ndoubted, but agreed that the case must be discussed on the\r\nanalogy of easements. The Chief Justice, after suggesting the\r\npossibility of sufficient privity on the ground that the\r\nplaintiff was privy in blood and might be heir, turns to the\r\nother argument as more promising, and evidently founds his\r\nopinion upon it. /1/ It would almost seem that he considered a\r\nprescriptive right enough to support the action, and it is pretty\r\nclear that he thought that a disseisor would have had the same\r\nrights as the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry IV., another case /2/ arose upon a covenant\r\nvery like the last. But this time the facts were reversed. The\r\nplaintiff counted as heir, but did not allege that he was tenant\r\nof the manor. The defendant, not denying the plaintiff's descent,\r\npleaded in substance that he was not tenant of the manor in his\r\nown right. The question raised by the pleadings, therefore, was\r\nwhether the heir of the covenantee could sue without being tenant\r\nof the manor. If the covenant was to be approached from the side\r\nof contract, the heir was party to it as representing the\r\ncovenantee. If, on the other hand, it was treated as amounting to\r\nthe grant of a service like an easement, it would naturally go\r\nwith the manor if made to the lord of the manor. It seems to have\r\nbeen thought that such a covenant might go either way, according\r\nas it was made to the tenant of the manor or to a stranger.\r\nMarkham, one of the judges, says: \"In a writ of covenant one must\r\nbe privy to the covenant if he would have a writ of covenant or\r\naid by the covenant. But, peradventure, if the covenant [399] had\r\nbeen made with the lord of the manor, who had inheritance in the\r\nmanor, ou issint come determination poit estre fait, it would be\r\notherwise,\" which was admitted. /1/ It was assumed that the\r\ncovenant was not so made as to attach to the manor, and the\r\ncourt, observing that the service was rather spiritual than\r\ntemporal, were inclined to think that the heir could sue. /2/ The\r\ndefendant accordingly over and set up a release. It will be seen\r\nhow fully this agrees with the former case.\r\n\r\nThe distinction taken by Markham is stated very clearly in a\r\nreported by Lord Coke. In the argument of Chudleigh's Case the\r\nline is drawn thus: \"Always, the warranty as to voucher requires\r\nprivity of estate to which it was annexed,\" (i.e. succession to\r\nthe original covenantee,) \"and the same law of a use.... But of\r\nthings annexed to land, it is otherwise, as of commons,\r\nadvowsons, and the like appendants or appurtenances.... So a\r\ndisseisor, abator, intruder, or the lord by escheat, &c., shall\r\nhave them as things annexed to the land. So note a diversity\r\nbetween a use or warranty, and the like things annexed to the\r\nestate of the land in privity, and commons, advowsons, and other\r\nhereditaments annexed to the possession of the land.\" /3/ And\r\nthis, it seems to me, is the nearest approach which has ever been\r\nmade to the truth.\r\n\r\nCoke, in his Commentary on Littleton (385 a), takes a distinction\r\nbetween a warranty, which binds the party to yield lands in\r\nrecompense, and a covenant annexed to the land, which is to yield\r\nbut damages. If Lord Coke had [400] meant to distinguish between\r\nwarranties and all covenants which in our loose modern sense are\r\nsaid to run with the land, this statement would be less\r\nsatisfactory than the preceding.\r\n\r\nA warranty was a covenant which sometimes yielded but damages,\r\nand a covenant in the old law sometimes yielded land. In looking\r\nat the early cases we are reminded of the still earlier German\r\nprocedure, in which it did not matter whether the plaintiff's\r\nclaim was founded on a right of property in a thing, or simply on\r\na contract for it. /1/ Covenant was brought for a freehold under\r\nEdward I., /2/ and under Edward III. it seems that a mill could\r\nbe abated by the same action, when maintained contrary to an\r\neasement created by covenant. /3/ But Lord Coke did not mean to\r\nlay down any sweeping doctrine, for his conclusion is, that \"a\r\ncovenant is in many cases extended further than the warrantie.\"\r\nFurthermore, this statement, as Lord Coke meant it, is perfectly\r\nconsistent with the other and more important distinction between\r\nwarranties and rights in the nature of easements or covenants\r\ncreating such rights. For Lord Coke's examples are confined to\r\ncovenants of the latter sort, being in fact only the cases just\r\nstated from the Year Books.\r\n\r\nLater writers, however, have wholly forgotten the distinction in\r\nquestion, and accordingly it has failed to settle the disputed\r\nline between conflicting principles. Covenants which started from\r\nthe analogy of warranties, and others to which was applied the\r\nlanguage and reasoning of easements, have been confounded\r\ntogether under the title of [401] covenants running with the\r\nland. The phrase \"running with the land\" is only appropriate to\r\ncovenants which pass like easements. But we can easily see how it\r\ncame to be used more loosely.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that covenants for title, like\r\nwarranties, went only to successors of the original covenantee.\r\nThe technical expression for the rule was that they were annexed\r\nto the estate in privity. Nothing was easier than to overlook the\r\ntechnical use of the word \"estate,\" and to say that such\r\ncovenants went with the land. This was done, and forthwith all\r\ndistinctions became doubtful. It probably had been necessary to\r\nmention assigns in covenants for title, as it certainly had been\r\nto give them the benefit of the ancient warranty; /1/ for this\r\nseems to have been the formal mark of those covenants which\r\npassed only to privies. But it was not necessary to mention\r\nassigns in order to attach easements and the like to land. Why\r\nshould it be necessary for one covenant running with the land\r\nmore than another? and if necessary for one, why not for all? /2/\r\nThe necessity of such mention in modern times has been supposed\r\nto be governed by a fanciful rule of Lord Coke's. /3/ On the\r\nother hand, the question is raised whether covenants which should\r\npass irrespective of privity are not governed by the same rule\r\nwhich governs warranties.\r\n\r\nThese questions have not lost their importance. Covenants for\r\ntitle are in every deed, and other covenants are [402] only less\r\ncommon, which, it remains to show, belong to the other class.\r\n\r\nChief among these is the covenant to repair. It has already been\r\nobserved that an easement of fencing may be annexed to land, and\r\nit was then asked what was the difference in kind between a right\r\nto have another person build such structures, and a right to have\r\nhim repair structures already built. Evidence is not wanting to\r\nshow that the likeness was perceived. Only, as such covenants are\r\nrarely, if ever, made, except in leases, there is always privity\r\nto the original parties. For the lease could not, and the\r\nreversion would not be likely to, go by disseisin.\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Windsor's Case decides that such a covenant binds an\r\nassignee of the term, although not named. It is reported in two\r\nbooks of the highest authority, one of the reporters being Lord\r\nCoke, the other Croke, who was also a judge. Croke gives the\r\nreason thus: \"For a covenant which runs and rests with the land\r\nlies for or against the assignee at the common law, quia transit\r\nterra cum onere, although the assignees be not named in the\r\ncovenant.\" /1/ This is the reason which governed easements, and\r\nthe very phrase which was used to account for all possessors\r\nbeing bound by a covenant binding a parcel of land to warranty.\r\nCoke says, \"For such covenant which extends to the support of the\r\nthing demised is quodammodo appurtenant to it, and goes with it.\"\r\nAgain the language of easements. And to make this plainer, if\r\nneed be, it is added, \"If a man grants to one estovers to repair\r\nhis house, it is appurtenant to his house.\" Estovers for [403]\r\nrepair went with the land, like other rights of common, /1/\r\nwhich, as Lord Coke has told us, passed even to disseisors.\r\n\r\nIn the next reign the converse proposition was decided, that an\r\nassignee of the reversion was entitled in like manner to the\r\nbenefit of the covenant, because \"it is a covenant which runs\r\nwith the land.\" /2/ The same law was applied, with still clearer\r\nreason, to a covenant to leave fifteen acres unploughed for\r\npasture, which was held to bind an assignee not named, /3/ and,\r\nit would seem, to a covenant to keep land properly manured. /4/\r\n\r\nIf the analogy which led to this class of decisions were followed\r\nout, a disseisor could sue or be sued upon such covenants, if the\r\nother facts were of such a kind as to raise the question. There\r\nis nothing but the novelty of the proposition which need prevent\r\nits being accepted. It has been mentioned above, that words of\r\ncovenant may annex an easement to land, and that words of grant\r\nmay import a covenant. It would be rather narrow to give a\r\ndisseisor one remedy, and deny him another, where the right was\r\none, and the same words made both the grant and the covenant. /5/\r\n\r\nThe language commonly used, however, throws doubt and darkness\r\nover this and every other question connected with the subject. It\r\nis a consequence, already referred to, of confounding covenants\r\nfor title, and the class last discussed, [404] under the name of\r\ncovenants running with the land. According to the general opinion\r\nthere must be a privity of estate between the covenantor and\r\ncovenantee in the latter class of cases in order to bind the\r\nassigns of the covenantor. Some have supposed this privity to be\r\ntenure; some, an interest of the covenantee in the land of the\r\ncovenantor; and so on. /1/ The first notion is false, the second\r\nmisleading, and the proposition to which they are applied is\r\nunfounded. Privity of estate, as used in connection with\r\ncovenants at common law, does not mean tenure or easement; it\r\nmeans succession to a title. /2/ It is never necessary between\r\ncovenantor and covenantee, or any other persons, except between\r\nthe present owner and the original covenantee. And on principle\r\nit is only necessary between them in those cases--such as\r\nwarranties, and probably covenants for title--where, the\r\ncovenants being regarded wholly from the side of contract, the\r\nbenefit goes by way of succession, and not with the land.\r\n\r\nIf now it should be again asked, at the end of this long\r\ndiscussion, where the line is to be drawn between these two\r\nclasses of covenants, the answer is necessarily vague in view of\r\nthe authorities. The following propositions may be of some\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n*A. With regard to covenants which go with the land:--\r\n\r\n*(1.) Where either by tradition or good sense the burden of the\r\nobligation would be said, elliptically, to fall on the land of\r\nthe covenantor, the creation of such a burden is in theory a\r\ngrant or transfer of a partial interest in [405] that land to the\r\ncovenantee. As the right of property so created can be asserted\r\nagainst every possessor of the land, it would not be extravagant\r\nor absurd to allow it to be asserted by the action of covenant.\r\n\r\n*(2.) Where such a right is granted to the owner of a neighboring\r\npiece of land for the benefit of that land, the right will be\r\nattached to the land, and go with it into all hands. The action\r\nof covenant would be allowed to assigns not named, and it would\r\nnot be absurd to give it to disseisors.\r\n\r\n*(3.) There is one case of a service, the burden of which does\r\nnot fall upon land even in theory, but the benefit of which might\r\ngo at common law with land which it benefited. This is the case\r\nof singing and the like by a convent. It will be observed that\r\nthe service, although not falling on land, is to be performed by\r\na corporation permanently seated in the neighborhood. Similar\r\ncases are not likely to arise now.\r\n\r\n*B. With regard to covenants which go only with the estate in the\r\nland:--\r\n\r\nIn general the benefit of covenants which cannot be likened to\r\ngrants, and the burden of which does not fall on land, is\r\nconfined to the covenantee and those who sustain his persona,\r\nnamely, his executor or heir. In certain cases, of which the\r\noriginal and type was the ancient warranty, and of which the\r\nmodern covenants for title are present examples, the sphere of\r\nsuccession was enlarged by the mention of assigns, and assigns\r\nare still allowed to represent the original covenantee for the\r\npurposes of that contract. But it is only by way of succession\r\nthat any other person than the party to the contract can sue upon\r\nit. Hence the plaintiff must always be privy in estate with the\r\ncovenantee.\r\n\r\n[406] C. It is impossible, however, to tell by general reasoning\r\nwhat rights will be held in English law to belong to the former\r\nclass, or where the line will be drawn between the two. The\r\nauthorities must be consulted as an arbitrary fact. Although it\r\nmight sometimes seem that the test of the first was whether the\r\nservice was of a nature capable of grant, so that if it rested\r\npurely in covenant it would not follow the land, /1/ yet if this\r\ntest were accepted, it has already been shown that, apart from\r\ntradition, some services which do follow the land could only be\r\nmatter of covenant. The grant of light and air, a well-\r\nestablished easement, is called a covenant not to build on the\r\nservient land to the injury of the light, by Baron Parke. /2/ And\r\nalthough this might be doubted, /3/ it has been seen that at\r\nleast one well-established easement, that of fencing, cannot be\r\nconsidered as a right granted out of the servient land with any\r\nmore propriety than a hundred other services which would be only\r\nmatter of contract if the law allowed them to be annexed to land\r\nin like manner. The duty to repair exists only by way of\r\ncovenant, yet the reasoning of the leading cases is drawn from\r\nthe law of easement. On the other hand, a covenant by a lessee to\r\nbuild a wall upon the leased premises was held, in Spencer's\r\nCase, not to bind assigns unless mentioned; /4/ but Lord Coke\r\nsays that it would have bound them if it had purported to. The\r\nanalogy of warranty makes its appearance, and throws a doubt on\r\nthe fundamental principle of the case. We can only say that the\r\napplication [407] of the law is limited by custom, and by the\r\nrule that new and unusual burdens cannot be imposed on land.\r\n\r\nThe general object of this Lecture is to discover the theory on\r\nwhich a man is allowed to enjoy a special right when the facts\r\nout of which the right arises are not true of him. The transfer\r\nof easements presented itself as one case to be explained, and\r\nthat has now been analyzed, and its influence on the law has been\r\ntraced. But the principle of such transfers is clearly anomalous,\r\nand does not affect the general doctrine of the law. The general\r\ndoctrine is that which has been seen exemplified in prescription,\r\nwarranty, and such covenants as followed the analogy mentioned\r\nAnother illustration which has not yet been is to be found in the\r\nlaw of uses.\r\n\r\nIn old times a use was a chose in action,--that is, was\r\nconsidered very nearly from the point of view of contract, and it\r\nhad a similar history to that which has been traced in other\r\ncases. At first it was doubted whether proof of such a secret\r\ntrust ought to be allowed, even as against the heir. /1/ It was\r\nallowed, however, in the end, /2/ and then the principle of\r\nsuccession was extended to the assign. But it never went further.\r\nOnly those who were privies in estate with the original feoffee\r\nto uses, were bound by the use. A disseisor was no more bound by\r\nthe confidence reposed in his disseisee, than he was entitled to\r\nvouch his disseisee's warrantor. In the time of Henry VIII. it\r\nwas said that \"where a use shall be, it is requisite that there\r\nbe two things, sc. confidence, and privity:... as I say, if\r\nthere be not privity or confidence, [408] then there can be no\r\nuse: and hence if the feoffees make a feoffment to one who has\r\nnotice of the use, now the law will adjudge him seised to the\r\nfirst use, since there is sufficient privity between the first\r\nfeoffor and him, for if he [i.e. the first feoflor] had warranted\r\nhe [the last feoffee] should vouch as assign, which proves\r\nprivity; and he is in in the per by the feoffees; but where one\r\ncomes into the land in the post, as the lord by escheat or the\r\ndisseisor, then the use is altered and changed, because privity\r\nis wanting.\" /1/\r\n\r\nTo this day it is said that a trust is annexed in privity to the\r\nperson and to the estate /2/ (which means to the persona). It is\r\nnot regarded as issuing out of the land like a rent, so that\r\nwhile a rent binds every one who has the land, no matter how, a\r\ndisseisor is not bound by the trust. /3/ The case of the lord\r\ntaking by escheat has been doubted, /4/ and it will be remembered\r\nthat there is a difference between Bracton and later authors as\r\nto whether he comes in as quasi heres or as a stranger.\r\n\r\nThen as to the benefit of the use. We are told that the right to\r\nsue the subpoena descended indeed to the heir, on the ground of\r\nheres eadem persona cum antecessore, but that it was not assets.\r\n/5/ The cestui que use was given power to sell by an early\r\nstatute. /6/ But with regard to trusts, Lord Coke tells us that\r\nin the reign of Queen Elizabeth [409] all the judges in England\r\nheld that a trust could not be assigned, \"because it was a matter\r\nin privity between them, and was in the nature of a chose in\r\naction.\" /1/ Uses and trusts were both devisable, however, from\r\nan early day, /2/ and now trusts are as alienable as any form of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe history of early law everywhere shows that the difficulty of\r\ntransferring a mere right was greatly felt when the situation of\r\nfact from which it sprung could not also be transferred. Analysis\r\nshows that the difficulty is real. The fiction which made such a\r\ntransfer conceivable has now been explained, and its history has\r\nbeen followed until it has been seen to become a general mode of\r\nthought. It is now a matter of course that the buyer stands in\r\nthe shoes of the seller, or, in the language of an old law-book,\r\n/3/ that \"the assign is in a manner quasi successor to his\r\nassignor.\" Whatever peculiarities of our law rest on that\r\nassumption may now be understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n3/1 E.g.

It has already been observed that the cases mentioned by\r\nLivy seem to suggest that the object of the surrender was\r\nexpiation, as much as they do that it was satisfaction of a\r\ncontract.

The edict of Liutprand, dealing\r\nwith housebreaking followed by theft of property left in charge\r\nof the householder, lays down that the owner shall look to the\r\nbailee alone, and the bailee shall hold the thief both for the\r\nhousebreaking and for the stolen goods. Because, as it says, we\r\ncannot raise two claims out of one causa; somewhat as our law was\r\nunable to divide the severing a thing from the realty, and the\r\nconversion of it, into two different wrongs.

These rules seem to be somewhat modern even as to\r\nservants. The liability of a master for debts contracted by his\r\nservant is very narrowly limited in the earlier Year Books.\r\n\r\n230/1 I am inclined to think that this extension has been largely\r\ndue to the influence of the Roman law. See Lecture I. p. 20, n.\r\n1, and observe the part which the precedents as to fire (e. g.,\r\nY.B. 2 Hen. IV. 18, pl. 6) have played in shaping the modern\r\ndoctrine of master and servant.

A learned writer\r\nof more ancient date asks why a doctor has not a possessory action\r\nif you cease to employ him, and answers: \"Sentio actionem non\r\ntenere, sed sentio tantum, nec si vel morte mineris, possum\r\ndicere quare.

If the law should protect a possessor of\r\nland in the enjoyment of water coming to it, it would do so\r\nbecause the use of the water was regarded as a part of the\r\nenjoyment of that land, and would by no means imply that it would\r\ndo the same in the case just put of a way over land of another.\r\n\r\n242/1 Jefferies v.

X. c. 17,\r\nthat the usual mode of proof was by a writing or by duel, and\r\nthat the King's Court did not generally give protection to private\r\nagreements made anywhere except in the Court of the King (Lib. X.\r\nc. 8). But it can hardly be that debts were never established by\r\nwitness in his time, in view of the continuous evidence from\r\nBracton onwards.\r\n\r\n257/2 But cf. Brunner, Schwurgerichte, 399. I do not go so far as\r\nto say that they were still a living institution.

It is possible that this means no more than\r\nGlanvill's often repeated statement, that the King's Court did\r\nnot, generally speaking, take cognizance of private agreements.\r\nThe substantive law was, perhaps, still limited by traditions\r\nfrom the infancy of contract. See pp. 248, 251, 259, 260. The\r\nproposition in its broadest form may have been based on the\r\ninability to try such agreements in any way but those which have\r\nbeen specified.

Mr. Langdell, Contracts, Sections 92, 94,\r\nsuggests the ingenious explanation for this doctrine, that it was\r\nthen held that no promise could be implied in fact from the\r\nrequest. There may be evidence which I do not know, but the case\r\ncited (Bosden v. Thinne, Yelv. 40) for this statement was not\r\ndecided until A.D. 1603, while the implication of Hunt v.

This is put as a case of equivalence by\r\nMr. Langdell (Contr., Section 116); but the above explanation is\r\nbelieved to be the true one. It will be noticed that this is hardly\r\na true case of condition, but merely a limitation of the scope of\r\nthe tenant's promise. So a covenant to serve as apprentice in a\r\ntrade, which the other party covenants to teach, can only be\r\nperformed if the other will teach, and must therefore be limited\r\nto that event. Cf.

Mr. Langdell says that a bought note, though part of\r\na bilateral contract, is to be treated as unilateral, and that it\r\nmay be presumed that the language of the contract relied on was\r\nthat of a bought note, and thus a condition in favor of the\r\ndefendant, who made it. I do not quite understand how this can be\r\nassumed when the declaration states a bilateral contract, and the\r\nquestion arose on demurrer to a plea, which also states that the\r\nplaintiff \"was by the agreement bound to declare\" the names. How\r\nremote the explanation is from the actual ground of decision will\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n341/1 Recht des Besitzes, Section 11, p. 184, n. 1 (7th ed.),\r\nEng. tr. 124, n. t.\r\n\r\n342/1 Inst. II.
