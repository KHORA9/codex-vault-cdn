THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH,\r\n\r\nK.G., ETC.,\r\n\r\nWHOSE DEEP INTEREST IN ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH\r\nTHE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE BRITISH NAVY\r\nIS WELL KNOWN TO ALL WHO HAVE HAD\r\nTHE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING WITH HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nSTRANGE it must appear that the account of perhaps the most celebrated\r\nand, certainly to the English nation, the most momentous voyage of\r\ndiscovery that has ever taken place--for it practically gave birth to the\r\ngreat Australasian Colonies--has never before been given to the world in\r\nthe very words of its great leader. It has fallen out in this wise.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the Endeavour it was decided that a full and\r\ncomprehensive account of the voyage should be compiled. COOK'S JOURNAL\r\ndealt with matters from the point of view of the seaman, the explorer,\r\nand the head of the expedition, responsible for life, and for its general\r\nsuccess. The Journals of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander looked from the\r\nscientific side on all that presented itself to their enthusiastic\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nWhat could be better than to combine these accounts, and make up a\r\ncomplete narrative from them all?\r\n\r\nThe result, however, according to our nineteenth-century ideas, was not\r\naltogether happy. Dr. Hawkesworth, into whose hands the Journals were\r\nput, not only interspersed reflections of his own, but managed to impose\r\nhis own ponderous style upon many of the extracts from the united\r\nJournals; and, moreover, as they are all jumbled together, the whole\r\nbeing put into Cook's mouth, it is impossible to know whether we are\r\nreading Cook, Banks, Solander, or Hawkesworth himself.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the day were not, however, critical. Hawkesworth's book,*\r\n(* \"Hawkesworth's Voyages\" 3 volumes quarto 1773.) which undoubtedly\r\ncontains all the most generally interesting passages of the three\r\nwriters, gave a clear description of the events of the voyage in a\r\nconnected manner, and was accepted as sufficient; and in the excitement\r\nof devouring the pages which introduced so many new lands and peoples,\r\nprobably few wished for more, and the Journals were put away as dealt\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nSince that time it has been on several occasions in contemplation to\r\npublish Mr. (after Sir Joseph) Banks' Journal; but this has never been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nCook's Journal was in triplicate. The Admiralty Orders of the day\r\nenjoined that the captain should keep a journal of proceedings, a copy of\r\nwhich was to be forwarded to the Admiralty every six months, or as soon\r\nafter as possible. In the case of this voyage the ship was two and a half\r\nyears from England before any opportunity of sending this copy occurred.\r\nThe ship was the whole of this time in new and savage lands. When Batavia\r\nwas reached the duplicate of Cook's Journal was sent home, and six months\r\nlater, when the ship arrived in England, the full Journal of the voyage\r\nwas deposited at the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Admiralty, Sir Philip Stephens, a personal friend\r\nand appreciator of Cook, appears to have appropriated the Batavia\r\nduplicate, as we find it in the hands of his descendants, and passing\r\nthence by sale, first to Mr. Cosens in 1868, and then in 1890 to Mr. John\r\nCorner.\r\n\r\nThe other and complete copy is still in possession of the Admiralty,\r\nthough in some unexplained manner it was absent for some years, and was\r\nonly recovered by the exertions of Mr. W. Blakeney, R.N.\r\n\r\nA third copy of the Journal also terminates a few days before reaching\r\nBatavia. It is in the possession of Her Majesty the Queen, and from its\r\nappearance was kept for, and probably presented to, George III, who took\r\ngreat interest in the voyage.\r\n\r\nNeither private possessors nor the Admiralty have felt moved to publish\r\nthis interesting document until Mr. Corner acquired his copy, when, being\r\nan enthusiastic admirer of Captain Cook, he determined to do so, and was\r\nmaking preliminary arrangements, when he suddenly died, after a few\r\nhours' illness. His son, anxious to carry out his father's wishes, which\r\nincluded the devotion of any proceeds to the restoration of Hinderwell\r\nChurch--the parish church of Staithes, whence Cook ran away to sea--has\r\ncompleted these arrangements, and the present volume is the result.\r\n\r\nThe text is taken from Mr. Corner's copy so far as it goes, paragraphs\r\nfrom the Admiralty copy, which do not appear in the former, being added,\r\nwith a notation of their source.\r\n\r\nThe last portion, from October 23rd, 1770, which is only given in the\r\nAdmiralty copy, is necessarily taken from it.\r\n\r\nThe three copies are, practically, identical, except for the period\r\nAugust 13th to 19th, 1770, during which the wording is often different,\r\nthough the events are the same.\r\n\r\nIt is not very difficult to account for this.\r\n\r\nThe two first-mentioned Journals are in the handwriting of an amanuensis,\r\nMr. Orton, the clerk. No autograph journal is, so far as is known, in\r\nexistence, but some rough original must have been kept, as both copies\r\nbear internal evidence of having been written up after the lapse of an\r\ninterval after the events described.\r\n\r\nThis is markedly the case in the Australian part of the Journal.\r\n\r\nIt is known that Botany Bay was at first called by Cook, Stingray Bay, on\r\naccount of the number of rays caught there; but after Banks had examined\r\nhis collection, and found all his plants new to science, Cook determined\r\nto call it Botany Bay. It is, however, called Botany Bay from the first\r\nin the Journals.\r\n\r\nThe name, \"New South Wales,\" was not bestowed without much consideration,\r\nand apparently at one stage New Wales was the appellation fixed upon, for\r\nin Mr. Corner's copy it is so called throughout, whereas the Admiralty\r\ncopy has \"New South Wales.\"\r\n\r\nIt would therefore seem that about the period of the discrepant accounts\r\nMr. Corner's copy was first made, and that Cook, in the Admiralty copy,\r\nwhich for this part is fuller, revised the wording of his description of\r\nthis very critical portion of the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's Copy has been written with especial care, and by several\r\ndifferent hands. It was evidently the last in point of time.\r\n\r\nIn reading COOK'S JOURNAL of his First Voyage it must be remembered that\r\nit was not prepared for publication. Though no doubt the fair copies we\r\npossess were revised with the care that characterises the man, and which\r\nis evidenced by the interlineations and corrections in his own hand with\r\nwhich the pages are dotted, it may be supposed, from the example we have\r\nin the published account of his Second Voyage, which was edited by\r\nhimself, that further alterations and additions would have been made, to\r\nmake the story more complete, had he contemplated its being printed.\r\n\r\nThis does not, however, in any way detract from the interest of a\r\ntranscript of his record on the spot; and though many circumstances\r\nrecorded in Hawkesworth, from Banks or others, will not be found, it is\r\nprobable that an exact copy of the great navigator's own impressions, and\r\nthe disentanglement of them from the other interpolated matter, will be\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nIn printing this Journal the only alterations that have been made are the\r\nbreaking-up into chapters, with modern headings; the addition of\r\npunctuation; and in the form of the insertion of the daily record of\r\nwind, weather, and position of the ship. These in the original are on the\r\nleft hand page in log form. To save space they have been placed at the\r\nend of every day's transactions.\r\n\r\nThe eccentricities in the spelling have been preserved. A good many of\r\nthese would seem to be due to Mr. Orton, the transcriber, as Cook's own\r\nletters are generally correct in their orthography. The use of the\r\ncapital letter was usual at the time.\r\n\r\nReferences will be found to sketches and plans which have not been\r\nreproduced.\r\n\r\nCook's knack of finding names for localities was peculiarly happy. Those\r\nwho have had to do this, know the difficulty. Wherever he was able to\r\nascertain the native name, he adopts it; but in the many cases where this\r\nwas impossible, he manages to find a descriptive and distinctive\r\nappellation for each point, bay, or island.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have kept these names very much to himself, as it is seldom\r\nthe officers' logs know anything of them; and original plans, still in\r\nexistence, in many cases bear different names to those finally pitched\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nCook's names have rarely been altered, and New Zealand and Australian\r\nplaces will probably for all time bear those which he bestowed.\r\n\r\nIn the orthography of his native names he was not so successful. The\r\nconstant addition of a redundant \"o\" has altered many native sounds, such\r\nas Otaheite for Tahiti, Ohwhyhee for Hawaii; while his spelling generally\r\nhas been superseded by more simple forms. This is a matter, however, in\r\nwhich great difficulties are found to the present day by Englishmen,\r\nwhose language presents no certain laws for rendering any given sound\r\ninto a fixed combination of letters.\r\n\r\nCook's language is unvarnished and plain, as a sailor's should be. His\r\nincidents, though often related with circumstance, are without\r\nexaggeration; indeed if any fault is to be found, it is that he takes\r\noccurrences involving much labour and hardship as such matters of course,\r\nthat it is not easy for the reader, especially if he be a landsman, to\r\nrealise what they really entail.\r\n\r\nCook was assiduous in obtaining observations to ascertain the Variation\r\nof the compass--i.e., the difference between the direction shown by the\r\nmagnetic needle and the true north. He is constantly puzzled by the\r\ndiscrepancies in these observations made at short intervals. These arose\r\nfrom the different positions of the ship's head, whereby the iron within\r\na certain distance of the compass is placed in different positions as\r\nregards the needle working the compass card, the result being that the\r\nneedle is attracted from its correct direction in varying degree. This is\r\nknown as the Deviation of the compass. The cause of this, and of the laws\r\nwhich govern it, were only discovered by Captain Flinders in 1805.\r\nHappily for the navigators of those days, little iron entered into the\r\nconstruction of ships, and the amount of the Deviation was not large,\r\nthough enough to cause continual disquiet and wonderment.\r\n\r\nCook's longitudes in this voyage are all given as west of Greenwich, not\r\ndivided into east and west, as is usual at this day. The latter system\r\nagain has only been adopted universally since his time.\r\n\r\nThough Cook himself gives, at the beginning of the Journal, a note of the\r\nmethod of reckoning days adopted, it may not be amiss to give further\r\nexplanation here.\r\n\r\nIt was the usual custom on board ships to keep what was known as Ship\r\ntime--i.e., the day began at noon BEFORE the civil reckoning, in which\r\nthe day commences at midnight. Thus, while January 1st, as ordinarily\r\nreckoned, is from midnight to midnight, in ship time it began at noon on\r\nDecember 31st and ended at noon January 1st, this period being called\r\nJanuary 1st. Hence the peculiarity all through the Journal of the p.m.\r\ncoming before the a.m. It results that any events recorded as occurring\r\nin the p.m. of January 1st in the log, would, if translated into the\r\nordinary system, be given as happening in the p.m. of December 31st;\r\nwhile occurrences in the a.m. of January 1st would be equally in the a.m.\r\nof January 1st in both systems.\r\n\r\nThis puzzling mode of keeping the day at sea continued to a late period,\r\nand was common to seamen of all nations.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical day, again, begins at noon AFTER the midnight at which\r\nthe civil day begins, and hence is a whole day later than the ship's day.\r\nThis does not enter into Cook's Journal, but one of the logs of the\r\nEndeavour, extant, that of Mr. Green the astronomer, was kept in this\r\ntime, and the events of say Thursday, June 24th, of Cook's Journal, are\r\ntherein given as happening on Wednesday, June 23rd. These differences of\r\nreckoning have been a fertile source of confusion in dates in many\r\nvoyages.\r\n\r\nBesides Cook's Journals there are other Journals and Logs of the voyage\r\nextant. Perhaps it may be necessary to state that a Log is the official\r\ndocument in which the progress of the ship from hour to hour is recorded,\r\nwith such official notes as the alteration in sail carried, expenditure\r\nof provisions and stores, etc. A Journal contains this information in a\r\ncondensed form, with such observations as the officer keeping it may feel\r\ninclined to insert.\r\n\r\nThe ship's Log Book of the Endeavour is in the British Museum. Mr. R.M.\r\nHudson of Sunderland possesses Cook's own log, not autograph however,\r\npresented by Cook to Sir Hugh Palliser, the ancestor of his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Journals of all the officers of the Endeavour are preserved at the\r\nPublic Record Office. There is, however, nothing to be got out of them,\r\nas they are mainly copies one of the other, founded on the ship's log.\r\n\r\nThe portion of Mr. Molineux's, the Master's, Log that exists (at the\r\nAdmiralty) is a most beautifully kept and written document, enriched with\r\ncharts and sketches that attest the accuracy of Cook's remark, that he\r\nwas a \"young man of good parts.\"\r\n\r\nThe log kept by Mr. Green, however, does contain a few original remarks,\r\nsome of which have been made use of. This book contains a mass of\r\nastronomical observations, and witnesses to the zeal of this gentleman in\r\nhis especial duty.\r\n\r\nHe records in one place, when far away from land, his disgust that the\r\nofficers were unwilling to aid him in lunar observations. No doubt they\r\nsaw no particular use in them when there was no coast to fix; but there\r\nis ample proof that he received every aid when Cook thought it necessary.\r\n\r\nSufficient charts have been placed in this book to enable the reader to\r\nfollow the more interesting parts of the voyage; some being reproductions\r\nof Cook's own charts, others modern publications. In the case of the\r\ncoast of East Australia, the coast-line as laid down by Cook, and as now\r\nknown, are given side by side for comparison.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood, that although this book is styled CAPTAIN COOK'S\r\nJOURNAL, he was on this voyage only a Lieutenant in Command, and\r\ntherefore only Captain by courtesy.\r\n\r\nW.J.L.

Kippis, D.D., F.R.S. London: Bickers & Son 1889.)\r\n\r\nThe latest and best life is by Walter Besant,* (* \"Captain Cook\" by\r\nWalter Besant: \"English Men of Action\" London, Macmillan & Co. 1890.)\r\nwhose graceful pen has given us a fascinating, interesting, and, as far\r\nas is possible, complete picture of this great Englishman. Many details\r\nof Cook's private life are lost, but enough has been collected by Mr.\r\nBesant to place our hero vividly before us, and a perusal of his work is\r\nstrongly recommended.\r\n\r\nMany things in the following sketch are taken from Mr. Besant, to whom I\r\nwish to tender my acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nJames Cook rose from nearly the lowest ranks. The second son of James\r\nCook, a Yorkshire labourer, and Grace his wife, he was born on the edge\r\nof the Cleveland Hills on February 27th, 1728, in the little village of\r\nMarton, which lies about four miles south-south-east of Middlesborough,\r\nand five miles west of the well-known hill and landmark, Roseberry\r\nTopping. Eight years later his father removed to Great Ayton, which lies\r\nclose under Roseberry Topping.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirteen Cook, who, it is recorded, had had some elementary\r\nschooling both at Marton and Great Ayton, was apprenticed to one\r\nSanderson, a draper and grocer of Staithes, a fishing village on the\r\ncoast, about fourteen miles from Ayton and nine north-west of Whitby.\r\n\r\nA year later Cook went, or ran away, to sea, shipping at Whitby on board\r\nthe Freelove, a collier belonging to the brothers Walker.\r\n\r\nIn this hard school Cook learnt his sailor duties. No better training\r\ncould have been found for his future responsibilities. Here he learnt to\r\nendure the utmost rigours of the sea. Constant fighting with North Sea\r\ngales, bad food, and cramped accommodation, taught him to regard with the\r\nindifference that afterwards distinguished him, all the hardships that he\r\nhad to encounter, and led him to endure and persevere where others, less\r\ndetermined or more easily daunted by difficulties, would have hurried on,\r\nand left their work incomplete.\r\n\r\nAll details of Cook's life during his thirteen years in the merchant\r\nservice are lost: what voyages he made, how he fared, whether he advanced\r\nin general knowledge, all is gone. The only fact known is that in May\r\n1755, when Cook was twenty-seven years of age, and mate of a vessel of\r\nMessrs. Walker, then in the Thames, he, to avoid the press, then active\r\non account of the outbreak of the war with France, volunteered on board\r\nH.M.S. Eagle, of 60 guns, as an able seaman.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hugh Palliser, who succeeded to the command of this ship in\r\nOctober, was certainly Cook's warmest patron, and it would appear that\r\nCook did work superior to that of an able seaman in the Eagle. Be that as\r\nit may, all that is absolutely known is that that ship took her share of\r\nthe fighting at the taking of Louisbourg and elsewhere on the North\r\nAmerican and West Indian Station, and returned to England in 1759.\r\n\r\nBy Palliser's interest Cook was now appointed master of the Mercury. It\r\nis therefore evident that his qualifications as a navigator recommended\r\nthemselves to Palliser.\r\n\r\nThe Mercury went to North America, and here Cook did his first good\r\nservice recorded, namely, taking soundings in the St. Lawrence, to enable\r\nthe fleet then attacking Quebec to take up safe positions in covering the\r\narmy under Wolfe. This he accomplished with great skill, under many\r\ndifficulties, in the face of the enemy, much of it being done at night.\r\nHe was immediately employed in making a survey of the intricate channels\r\nof the river below Quebec, and for many years his chart was the guide for\r\nnavigation. Cook was indeed a born surveyor. Before his day charts were\r\nof the crudest description, and he must have somehow acquired a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of trigonometry, and possessed an intuitive\r\nfaculty for practically applying it, to enable him to originate, as it\r\nmay truly be said he did, the art of modern marine surveying.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to Quebec concluded, Cook was appointed master of the\r\nNorthumberland, bearing Admiral Lord Colville's flag, and during that\r\nship's winter at Halifax he applied himself to further study of\r\nmathematics and astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn 1762, the Northumberland being at Newfoundland during the capture of\r\nthat island from the French, Cook again was employed in surveys. This\r\nattracted the attention of Captain Graves, the Governor, who conceived a\r\nhigh opinion of his abilities in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1762 Cook returned to England and married Elizabeth\r\nBatts, daughter of a man in business at Wapping; but a few months\r\nafterwards he was called upon by Captain Graves to go again to\r\nNewfoundland to make marine surveys.\r\n\r\nIn this important work he was engaged until 1767, Captain Palliser, who\r\nsucceeded Captain Graves as Governor, being only too glad to avail\r\nhimself of Cook's services.\r\n\r\nThe charts he made during these years in the schooner Grenville were\r\nadmirable. The best proof of their excellence is that they are not yet\r\nwholly superseded by the more detailed surveys of modern times. Like all\r\nfirst surveys of a practically unknown shore, and especially when that\r\nshore abounds in rocks and shoals, and is much indented with bays and\r\ncreeks, they are imperfect, in the sense of having many omissions; but\r\nwhen the amount of the ground covered, and the impediments of fogs and\r\nbad weather on that coast is considered, and that Cook had at the most\r\nonly one assistant, their accuracy is truly astonishing. The originals of\r\nthese surveys form part of the most precious possessions of the\r\nHydrographic Office of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nWe now approach the crowning achievements of Cook's life.\r\n\r\nAfter many years' neglect the exploration of the Pacific was awaking\r\ninterest. This great ocean, which very few, even to this day, realise\r\noccupies nearly one half of the surface of the globe, had been, since the\r\nfirst voyage of Magellan, crossed by many a vessel.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, very little was known of the islands occupying its\r\ncentral portion.\r\n\r\nFor this there were two reasons. First, the comparatively small area\r\ncovered by islands; secondly, the fact that nearly all who traversed it\r\nhad followed Magellan's track, or, if they started, as many did, from\r\nCentral America, they made straight for Magellan's discovery, the Ladrone\r\nIslands. For this, again, there was a reason.\r\n\r\nFew sailed for the purpose of exploration pure and simple; and even those\r\nwho started with that view found, when embarked on that vast expanse,\r\nthat prudence dictated that they should have a moderate certainty of, by\r\na certain time, falling in with a place of sure refreshment. The\r\nprovisions they carried were bad at starting, and by the time they had\r\nfought their way through the Straits of Magellan were already worse;\r\nwater was limited, and would not hold out more than a given number of\r\ndays. Every voyage that is pursued tells the same story--short of water,\r\nand eagerly looking out for an opportunity of replenishing it. The winds\r\nwere found to blow in fixed directions, and each voyager was fearful of\r\ndeviating from the track on which it was known they would be fair, for\r\nfear of delays. And ever present in each captain's mind was the dread of\r\nthe terrible scourge, scurvy. Every expedition suffered from it. Each\r\nhoped they would be exempt, and each in turn was reduced to impotence\r\nfrom its effects.\r\n\r\nIt was the great consideration for every leader of a protracted\r\nexpedition, How can I obviate this paralyzing influence? And one after\r\nanother had to confess his failure.\r\n\r\nIt is yearly becoming more difficult for us to realise these obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing winds and currents in each part of the ocean are well\r\nknown to us: the exact distance and bearing from one point to another are\r\nlaid down in the chart; steam bridges over calm areas, and in many cases\r\nconducts us on our entire journey at a speed but little inferior to that\r\nof land travelling by railroad; modern science preserves fresh and\r\npalatable food for an indefinite period; and, in a word, all the\r\ndifficulties and most of the dangers of long voyages have disappeared.\r\n\r\nTake one element alone in long voyages--the time required. The average\r\nprogress of a ship in the eighteenth century was not more than fifty\r\nmiles a day. Nowadays we may expect as much as four hundred miles in a\r\nfull powered steamer, and not less than one hundred and fifty in a\r\nwell-fitted sailing ship.\r\n\r\nBut navigation, and more especially the navigation of the unknown\r\nPacific, was very different in Cook's days, when all the obstacles above\r\nmentioned impeded the explorers, and impelled them to follow a common\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nThere were a few who had deviated from the common track.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, Mendana, Quiros, Torres, in the latter part of the\r\nsixteenth century, starting first from their colonies in Peru, had\r\nventured along the central line of the Pacific, discovering the\r\nMarquesas, certain small coral islands, the Northern New Hebrides, and\r\nthe Solomon Islands; but their voyages, mainly for fear of Drake and his\r\nsuccessors, were kept so secret that no one quite knew where these\r\nislands lay.\r\n\r\nAbel Tasman, in 1642, coming across the Indian Ocean from the westward,\r\nhad touched at Tasmania, or, as he called it, Van Diemen's Land, had\r\nskirted the western coast of the north island of New Zealand without\r\nlanding, and had stretched away to the north-east, and found the Tonga\r\nGroup.\r\n\r\nThe English Buccaneers were not among these discoverers; Dampier, Woods\r\nRogers, and others, all went from Acapulco to the Ladrones, looking out\r\nfor the valuable Spanish galleons from\r\nManila, and they added little or nothing to the knowledge of the Pacific\r\nand what it contained.\r\n\r\nIt was not therefore strange that the imagination of geographers ran riot\r\namongst the great unknown areas. They were impressed, as they looked at\r\nthe globes of the day, with the fact that, while the northern hemisphere\r\ncontained much land, the southern showed either water or blank spaces;\r\nand starting with the ill-founded idea that the solid land in either\r\nhemisphere should balance, they conceived that there must be a great\r\nunknown continent in the southern part of the Pacific to make up the\r\ndeficiency. This was generally designated Terra Australis Incognita, and\r\nmany is the ancient chart that shows it, sketched with a free and\r\nuncontrolled hand, around the South Pole. It was held by many that Tasman\r\nhad touched it in New Zealand; that Quiros had seen it near his island of\r\nEncarnacion, and again at Espiritu Santo (New Hebrides), but no one had\r\nbeen to see.\r\n\r\nIn George III's reign the desire to know more of this unknown ocean arose\r\nin England. The king himself took great interest in it, and for the first\r\ntime since Queen Elizabeth's age, when Davis, Frobisher, Drake,\r\nNarborough, and others, had gone on voyages of discovery, the pursuit was\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nIn 1764 the Dolphin and Tamor, under the command of Commodore Byron and\r\nCaptain Mouat, sailed on a voyage round the world. They spent some time,\r\nas ordered, in exploring the Falkland Islands, and, after a two months'\r\npassage through Magellan Strait, they stood across the Pacific. They,\r\nhowever, also followed near the well-beaten track, and passing north of\r\nthe Paumotus, of which they sighted a few small islands, they too made\r\nfor the Ladrones. As usual, they suffered much from scurvy, and the one\r\nidea was to get to a known place to recover. Byron returned in May 1766,\r\nhaving added but little to the knowledge of the Pacific, and the Dolphin\r\nwas again sent in the August of the same year, with the Swallow, under\r\nthe command of Captains Wallis and Carteret, on a similar voyage.\r\n\r\nThey did somewhat better. After the usual struggle through the long and\r\nnarrow Strait of Magellan, against the strong and contrary winds that\r\ncontinually blow, and which occupied four months, they got into the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nAs they passed out they separated, the Dolphin outsailing the Swallow,\r\nand a dispassionate reader cannot well escape the conclusion that the\r\nsenior officers unnecessarily parted company.\r\n\r\nThe Dolphin kept a little south of the usual route, fell in with some of\r\nthe Paumotu Group, and finally discovered Tahiti, where she anchored at\r\nRoyal Bay, after grounding on a reef at its entrance, with her people, as\r\nusual, decimated by scurvy. They were almost immediately attacked by the\r\nnatives, who, however, received such a reception that they speedily made\r\nfriends, and fast friends too. The remainder of the month of the Dolphin\r\nstay was marked with the most friendly intercourse, and she sailed with a\r\nhigh opinion of Tahiti and the Tahitians; the Queen, Cook's Obereia,\r\nbeing especially well disposed to them. Their communication with the\r\nnatives must, however, have been limited, as they remained too short a\r\ntime to learn the language, and we gather little of the manners and\r\ncustoms from the account of the voyage.\r\n\r\nAfter sailing from Tahiti we hear the same tale--sickness, want of water,\r\ndoubt of what was before them. After sailing by several small islands,\r\nand an attempt to water at one, course was steered as before for the\r\nLadrones. Let Wallis tell his own story. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"I considered that watering here would be tedious and attended with great\r\nfatigue; that it was now the depth of winter in the southern hemisphere;\r\nthat the ship was leaky, that the rudder shook in the stern very much,\r\nand that what other damage she might have received in her bottom could\r\nnot be known. That for these reasons she was very unfit for the bad\r\nweather which she would certainly meet with, either in going round Cape\r\nHorn or through the Streight of Magellan; that if she should get safely\r\nthrough the streight or round the Cape, it would be absolutely necessary\r\nto refresh in some port; but in that case no port would be in her reach.\r\nI therefore determined to make the best of my way to Tinian, Batavia, and\r\nso to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\"By this rout, as far as we could judge, we should sooner be at home; and\r\nif the ship should prove not to be in a condition to make the whole\r\nvoyage, we should still save our lives, as from this place to Batavia we\r\nshould probably have a calm sea, and be not far from a port.\"\r\n\r\nThese are scarcely the sentiments of a bold explorer, and we shall look\r\nin vain for any similar ideas on the part of Cook. Here was a ship just a\r\nyear from England, just come from a convenient and friendly island, where\r\nevery refreshment and opportunity for refit were to be found, and the\r\nonly thought is how to get home again!\r\n\r\nIt was the vastly different conduct of Cook's voyages; the determination\r\nthat nothing should stop the main object of the expedition; his resource\r\nin every difficulty and danger; that caused, and rightly caused, him to\r\nbe hailed as a born leader of such expeditions.\r\n\r\nWallis followed nearly on Byron's track: went from the Ladrones, through\r\nthe China Sea, to Batavia, and so home, arriving in May 1768.\r\n\r\nThe Swallow, under Captain Carteret, was navigated in a different spirit.\r\nShe was badly fitted out for such a voyage, had not even a forge, and all\r\nthe articles for trade were on board the Dolphin. But Carteret was not\r\neasily daunted. He might, under the circumstances, when he found himself\r\nalone, have abandoned the voyage; but he boldly went forward. Passing\r\nfrom the Strait of Magellan, he touched at Juan Fernandez, and steering\r\nsomewhat south of Wallis's line, he passed south of Tahiti, discovering\r\nPitcairn's Island on his way, and some of the islands south of the\r\nPaumotus.\r\n\r\nBy this time his people were severely afflicted with scurvy, and his ship\r\nin a bad state; but Carteret only thought of getting to some place of\r\nrefreshment, from which he might afterwards pass on his voyage towards\r\nthe south, in the hope of falling in with the great southern Continent.\r\n\r\nIn this he was not fortunate. Missing all other islands, he fell across\r\nthe Santa Cruz Group, and hoping that he had found what he wanted, he\r\nanchored and tried to water. The party were, however, attacked by the\r\nnatives, and several, including the master, were wounded and died by\r\npoisoned arrows. All hope of a quiet refit was over, and his ship's\r\ncompany being in a wretched condition, no forge or tools on board to\r\nenable him to effect his many repairs, Carteret, who was himself very\r\nill, was obliged to give up all intention of exploration to the\r\nsouthward. He got enough water to last him, and sailed on toward the\r\nSolomon Islands. These he also just missed, but fell in with New Britain,\r\nand passing between it and New Ireland, demonstrated for the first time\r\nthat these two large islands were not one, as had been supposed. He here\r\nmanaged to do something to repair his leaky vessel, heeling and caulking\r\nher, but got little but fruit for his scurvy-stricken crew. He was\r\nattacked by the fierce islanders, and was altogether unable to do as much\r\nas he evidently earnestly desired towards examining the islands.\r\n\r\nThence they struggled on by Mindanao to Makassar in Celebes, delayed by\r\ncontrary winds, disappointed of refreshments at every place they tried,\r\nand losing men from scurvy. At Makassar they met with but an inhospitable\r\nreception from the Dutch, who refused to permit them to receive\r\nrefreshments there, and after waiting at Bonthain, a place in Celebes,\r\nseveral months, for the monsoon to change, they at last arrived at\r\nBatavia, the only port in the Dutch Indies really open to ships, in June\r\n1768. Thence, after heaving down and a thorough repair, they reached\r\nhome, via the Cape, on March 20th, 1769.\r\n\r\nOf all the voyages before Cook's, Carteret's showed most determination\r\nand true spirit of enterprise; and had his ship been better supplied, and\r\nmore suited to the exigencies of such a long cruise, he would, but for\r\none thing, have accomplished far more. This was the fatal disease, which\r\nno captain had as yet succeeded in warding off, and which hampered and\r\ndefeated the efforts of the most enthusiastic. No man could go beyond a\r\ncertain point in disregarding the health of his crew.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the kind of voyages, with their scanty fruits, to which\r\nthe English people were getting accustomed, and they were not such as to\r\nencourage repetition.\r\n\r\nIn all the years that had elapsed since the Spaniards first sailed on the\r\nPacific, but little real knowledge of the lands in it had been gained.\r\n\r\nLet us attempt to give a picture of what was known.\r\n\r\nThe Marquesas and Santa Cruz Group were known to exist; but of the\r\nSolomons grave doubts were felt, as no man had seen them but Mendana, and\r\nthey were, if placed on a map at all, shown in very different longitudes.\r\n\r\nSeveral voyagers had sighted different members of the extensive Paumotu\r\nGroup, but the varying positions caused great confusion.\r\n\r\nTahiti had been found by Wallis.\r\n\r\nTasman had laid down the south point of Tasmania, the western coast of\r\nthe North Island of New Zealand, and the Tonga Islands. Dampier and\r\nCarteret had shown that New Britain and New Ireland were separate\r\nislands, lying north-east of New Guinea. Quiros had found the northern\r\nisland of the New Hebrides.\r\n\r\nBut of none of these lands was anything really known. Those who had\r\nvisited them had merely touched. In no case had they gone round them, or\r\nascertained their limits, and their descriptions, founded on brief\r\nexperience, were bald and much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to what was unknown.\r\n\r\nThis comprises the whole of the east coast of Australia, or New Holland,\r\nand whether it was joined to Tasmania on the south, and New Guinea to the\r\nnorth; the dimensions of New Zealand; New Caledonia and the New Hebrides,\r\nwith the exception of the fact that the northern island of the latter\r\nexisted; the Fiji Islands; Sandwich Islands; the Phoenix, Union, Ellice,\r\nGilbert, and Marshall Groups, with innumerable small islands scattered\r\nhere and there; the Cook Islands, and all the Society Islands except\r\nTahiti. The majority of the Paumotu Group. The coast of North America\r\nnorth of 45 degrees north was unknown, and there was the great,\r\nundefined, and imaginary southern Continent to disprove.\r\n\r\nWhether other voyages of exploration would have been undertaken one\r\ncannot say; but in 1768 the Royal Society put in a word.\r\n\r\nA transit of Venus over the sun's disc was to occur in 1769, and\r\nastronomers were anxious to take advantage of it, the object of the\r\nobservation being to ascertain the distance of the earth from the sun,\r\nthe fundamental base line in all astronomical measurements, and which was\r\nvery imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nThe Central Pacific afforded a favourable position, and the Royal Society\r\nmemorialised the king to send a ship for the purpose. The request was\r\ngranted, and at first Alexander Dalrymple, who had conducted marine\r\nsurveys in the East Indies, and was known as a scientific geographer, was\r\nselected as observer. As, however, it was found that he also expected to\r\ncommand the ship, the Admiralty positively refused to have anything to do\r\nwith him, and after some discussion James Cook was selected.\r\n\r\nThis says volumes for Cook's reputation at the time. To have risen\r\nabsolutely from the ranks was a great deal, but to be chosen as a master,\r\nto command a ship, and undertake a scientific observation of this\r\nimportance, was a most exceptional occurrence, and speaks well for the\r\njudgment of those who had the selection.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Mr. Stephens, the Secretary to the Admiralty, had much to\r\ndo with it. How Stephens had become acquainted with Cook history does not\r\nrelate, but doubtless his personal visits to the Admiralty in connection\r\nwith the completion of his charts of Newfoundland, from which he returned\r\nevery winter, had brought him into contact with the Secretary, who had\r\nclearly formed a high opinion of him.\r\n\r\nCook, we may be sure, jumped at the chance, and his pride must have been\r\ngreat when he found he was to receive a commission as Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThis in itself was a most unusual step. The occasions on which a master\r\nhad been transferred to the executive line of the Royal Navy were very\r\nrare, and many an admiral used his influence in favour of some deserving\r\nofficer in vain.\r\n\r\nThis was not without good reason, as the whole training of the Master of\r\nthose days was unfavourable to success in command of ships or men. The\r\nexception was, however, in this case amply justified.\r\n\r\nCook was allowed to choose his vessel, and bearing in mind the dangers of\r\ngrounding in unknown seas, he pitched upon his old friends, the\r\nstoutly-built, full-bottomed colliers of the North Sea trade.\r\n\r\nHis ship, the Endeavour, was a Whitby built vessel of three hundred and\r\nseventy tons, and was known as H.M. Bark Endeavour, there being another\r\nvessel, a cutter, of the same name in the Royal Navy. She was brought to\r\nthe dockyard at Deptford to fit out. Her appearance was, of course,\r\nwholly different from that of a vessel built as a man-of-war, and we\r\nshall see that this caused trouble at Rio Janeiro, where the combination\r\nof merchant build and officers in uniform in an armed ship, aroused\r\nsuspicions in the mind of the Portuguese Viceroy.\r\n\r\nIt is nowhere directly stated whether the Endeavour was sheathed with\r\ncopper or not; but as Cook in the account of his second voyage expresses\r\nhimself as adverse to this method of protecting ships' bottoms, and the\r\noperation is recorded of heeling and boot topping, which was cleaning and\r\ngreasing the part of the ship just below waterline, it may be concluded\r\nthat her sheathing was wood.\r\n\r\nShe proved a most suitable vessel. The log states she was a little crank,\r\nbut an admirable sea-boat. Her rate of sailing was of course, with her\r\nbuild, slow, but her strength and flat bottom stood her in good stead\r\nwhen she made acquaintance with a coral reef.\r\n\r\nShe mounted ten small carriage guns and twelve swivels.\r\n\r\nMr. Banks, a scientific botanist, afterwards well known as Sir Joseph\r\nBanks, and for a long time President of the Royal Society, a gentleman of\r\nprivate means, volunteered to accompany Cook, and took with him a staff\r\nof his own, of artists and others.\r\n\r\nHe also induced Dr. Solander, a Swedish naturalist, afterwards attached\r\nto the British Museum, to accompany him.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Green, one of the assistants at the Royal Observatory at\r\nGreenwich, was sent as astronomer.\r\n\r\nThis scientific staff added much to the success of the expedition.\r\n\r\nBanks and Solander, both men of observation, were able to collect\r\nspecimens of natural history, and study the manners and customs of the\r\nnatives with whom they came in contact, which neither the time at Cook's\r\ndisposal nor his training enabled him to undertake; and though the\r\nJournal of the former has never yet been published, and cannot at the\r\npresent time be traced, many interesting remarks were extracted by Dr.\r\nHawkesworth from it and went far to make his account of the voyage\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nMr. Green also demands special notice.\r\n\r\nOne great question of the day amongst seamen and geographers was the\r\ndiscovering of some ready and sure method of ascertaining the longitude.\r\nHalf the value of the explorations made up to this time had been lost\r\nfrom this want. The recognised means of finding longitude was by the\r\nobservation of lunars; that is, accurately measuring the angular distance\r\nbetween the centres of the moon and of the sun, or of the moon and some\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the moon is so rapid that this angular distance changes\r\nfrom second to second, and thereby, by previous astronomical calculation,\r\nthe time at Greenwich at which its distance from any body is a certain\r\nnumber of degrees can be ascertained and recorded.\r\n\r\nBy well-known calculations the local time at any spot can be obtained,\r\nand when this is ascertained, at the precise moment that the angular\r\ndistance of sun and moon is observed, the difference gives the longitude.\r\n\r\nThis seems simple enough, but there is a good deal of calculation to go\r\nthrough before the result is reached, and neither the observation nor the\r\ncalculation is easy, especially with the astronomical tables of those\r\ndays, and there were very few sailors who were capable of, or patient\r\nenough to make them, nor was the result, as a rule, very accurate. For\r\none thing, the motions of the moon, which are extremely complicated, were\r\nnot enough known to allow her calculated position in the heavens to be\r\nvery accurate, and a very small error in this position considerably\r\naffects the time, and therefore the longitude.\r\n\r\nLuckily for Cook, the Nautical Almanac had just been started, and\r\ncontained tables of the moon which had not previously been available, and\r\nwhich much lightened the calculations.\r\n\r\nThe great invention of the chronometer, that is, a watch that can be\r\ntrusted to keep a steady rate for long periods, was at this time\r\ncompleted by Harrison; but very few had been manufactured, and\r\nastronomers and sailors were slow to believe in the efficacy of this\r\nmethod of carrying time about with a ship. Thus Cook had no chronometer\r\nsupplied to him.\r\n\r\nGreen had accompanied Mr. Maskelyne, afterwards Astronomer Royal, to\r\nBarbados in 1763 in H.M.S. Princess Louisa, in order to test Harrison's\r\ntimekeeper, and also a complicated chair, from which it was supposed\r\nobservations of Jupiter's satellites could be observed on board ship; and\r\nas this trial afforded the final triumph of the new method, one would\r\nhave thought that on a voyage of circumnavigation he would have made\r\nevery effort to get one of these watches.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the Endeavour had no chronometer, and lunars were the\r\nmainstay of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIn these observations Green was indefatigable. Cook, an excellent\r\nobserver himself frequently took part in them; but it was Green's\r\nespecial business, and no doubt to him is due the major part of the\r\ndeterminations of accurate longitude, which is one of the very remarkable\r\npoints of this voyage.\r\n\r\nGreen's log, which is extant, is filled with lunar observations, and the\r\nextraordinary coincidence between different observations attests the care\r\nwith which they were made. I dwell upon this because, while full of\r\nadmiration for Cook's knowledge, and his untiring zeal in every detail of\r\nhis expedition, it is evident, from a study of the original documents,\r\nthat without Green many opportunities of getting longitude would have\r\nbeen lost, Cook having no time to spare to make use of them. Let us give\r\nhonour to whom honour is due.\r\n\r\nThe final results of the observations are not equally good, but this\r\narises from the errors, before referred to, in the moon's place in the\r\nheavens as given in the almanac, which would vary with her position, and\r\naffect the longitude accordingly. The astonishing thing is, not that some\r\nlongitudes are considerably in error, but that the majority of them are\r\nso near the truth.\r\n\r\nThe Endeavour sailed from the Thames on June 30th, 1768, and was in\r\nPlymouth Sound from July 14th to the 26th, when she finally sailed, Banks\r\nand the scientific staff having joined here.\r\n\r\nShe carried a complement, all told, of ninety-four, and very close\r\nstowage it must have been.\r\n\r\nA list is given in this book, immediately before the \"Journal,\" of every\r\nperson on board when the ship sailed from Plymouth.\r\n\r\nThe draught of the ship was 13 feet 6 inches, and her provisions were\r\ncalculated to last eighteen months. The original intention had been that\r\nthe transit of Venus should be observed at the Marquesas; but the\r\nDolphin's return before Cook sailed, with the news of the discovery of\r\nTahiti and its friendly inhabitants, caused this island to be finally\r\nselected.\r\n\r\nThe exact text of Cook's orders cannot be given. They were secret orders;\r\nbut, curiously enough, while the covering letter, which enjoined him to\r\nshow them to nobody, which is dated July 30th, 1768, is duly entered in\r\nAdmiralty Records, the orders themselves, which should follow in the\r\nletter book, are omitted. They have never been published. Nevertheless,\r\nwe can gather what they were.\r\n\r\nCook, in the published account of his Second Voyage, says he had\r\ninstructions to proceed directly to Tahiti, and afterwards to prosecute\r\nthe design of making discoveries in the Pacific by proceeding southward\r\nto the latitude of 40 degrees, and if he did not find land to continue\r\nhis voyage to the west till he fell in with New Zealand, which he was\r\ndirected to explore, and thence to return to England by such route as he\r\nshould judge most convenient.\r\n\r\nPrecautions against the terrible scourge, scurvy, had not been forgotten.\r\n\r\nBesides the supply of all anti-scorbutics then known, a special letter\r\nwas written to Cook directing him to take a quantity of malt to sea, for\r\nthe purpose of being made into wort, as a cure for scorbutic disorders,\r\nas recommended by Dr. McBride.\r\n\r\nThe directions for its use were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The malt must be ground under the direction of the surgeon, and made\r\ninto wort, fresh every day, in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\"1. Take one quart of ground malt, and pour on it three quarts of boiling\r\nwater. Stir them well, and let the mixture stand close covered up for\r\nthree or four hours, after which strain off the liquor.\r\n\r\n\"2. The wort, so prepared, is then to be boiled into a panada, with sea\r\nbiscuit or dried fruits generally carried to sea.\r\n\r\n\"3. The patient must make at least two meals a day of the said panada,\r\nand should drink a quart or more of the fresh infusion as it may agree\r\nwith him, every twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\"4. The surgeon is to keep an exact account of its effects.\"\r\n\r\nThough it is somewhat anticipating events, it is convenient to record\r\nhere the result of these efforts to defeat the hitherto unconquerable\r\nenemy. Mr. Perry's report at the termination of the voyage is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"Sour krout, mustard, vinegar, wheat, inspissated orange and lemon\r\njuices, saloup, portable soup, sugar, molasses, vegetables (at all times\r\nwhen they could be got) were, some in constant, others in occasional use.\r\nThese were of such infinite service to the people in preserving them from\r\na scorbutic taint, that the use of the malt was (with respect to\r\nnecessity) almost entirely precluded.\r\n\r\n\"Again cold bathing was encouraged and enforced by example; the allowance\r\nof salt beef and pork was abridged from nearly the beginning of the\r\nvoyage, and the sailors' usual custom of mixing the salt beef fat with\r\ntheir flour, etc., was strictly forbad.\r\n\r\n\"Upon our leaving England, also, a stop was put to our issuing butter and\r\ncheese, and throughout the voyage raisins were served with the flour\r\ninstead of pickled suet. At Tierra del Fuego we collected wild celery,\r\nand every morning our breakfast was made with this herb, with ground\r\nwheat and portable soup.\r\n\r\n\"We passed Cape Horn, all our men as free from scurvy as on our sailing\r\nfrom Plymouth.\r\n\r\n\"Three slight cases of scorbutic disorders occurred before arriving at\r\nOtaheite. Wort was given, with apparently good effect, and the symptoms\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\"No other cases occurred during the voyage, but the wort was served out\r\nat sea as a regular article of diet.\"\r\n\r\nTo this it may be added, that no opportunity was, as appears by the\r\nJournal, ever lost of getting wild celery and any other wild herb that\r\npresented itself.\r\n\r\nThe personal washing is mentioned by Mr. Perry, and the tradition in the\r\nNavy is, that the men's deck was more constantly scrubbed than had then\r\nbeen usual; in fact, that unusual attention was paid to cleanliness.\r\nStoves were used to dry the decks below even in hot weather.\r\n\r\nAs this voyage forms the subject of this book, its events may be passed\r\nover briefly.\r\n\r\nCalling at Madeira--where the log records that the Endeavour was fired\r\nupon by the fort on the Loo Rock through some misapprehension while\r\nshifting berth, though Cook passes this by in silence--and Rio Janeiro,\r\nCook proceeded to double Cape Horn. His predecessors had struggled\r\nthrough the Strait of Magellan, losing much time and wearing out their\r\nmen with the continual anchoring and weighing in that long and narrow\r\npassage, rendered necessary by the constant foul and strong winds that\r\nprevail. The idea was to avoid the heavy seas and gales of the open sea;\r\nbut Cook's action was amply justified by a more rapid passage without any\r\ndanger. Discovering several of the low coral atolls of the Paumotu Group,\r\nhe arrived at Tahiti on April 13th, 1769.\r\n\r\nOn July 13th, the transit of Venus having been observed under favourable\r\nconditions on June 1st, he left Tahiti, exploring and mapping the Society\r\nIslands immediately to the westward, never before visited, and then stood\r\nto the southward. It may here be mentioned that it is only during the\r\nlast decade that Cook's charts of the Society Group have been superseded\r\nby more elaborate surveys by the French.\r\n\r\nCook went to 40 degrees south, discovering one of the Austral Group on\r\nhis way, when, finding no sign of the hypothetical southern Continent,\r\nand getting into very dirty weather, he first gained a more northern\r\nlatitude and favourable winds, and then stood for New Zealand.\r\n\r\nOn October 7th he arrived at Poverty Bay, and during the next six months\r\nhe completely circumnavigated and mapped the islands of New Zealand. He\r\nhad received on board at Tahiti a native, one Tupia, formerly the high\r\npriest, and a man of much intelligence. Tupia proved to be of the utmost\r\nservice, as, to their astonishment and delight, they found that the\r\nlanguages were sufficiently identical to enable him to act as a most\r\nefficient interpreter; which made it possible to obtain information, and\r\nestablish relations with the New Zealanders which they could never have\r\nsucceeded in doing without him.\r\n\r\nCook now, after consideration, determined to explore the unknown east\r\ncoast of New Holland. The health of his ship's company, and the good\r\norder on board, permitted him to make this good use of his time, instead\r\nof hurrying on to a civilised port, as all his forerunners had had to do.\r\n\r\nHe struck Australia at its south-east point, and followed the whole coast\r\nto the northward, mapping it as he went.\r\n\r\nWhen nearing the northern end the voyage nearly came to a premature\r\nconclusion by the ship grounding on a coral reef, twenty miles from the\r\nland. Cook's seamanship was, however, equal to the occasion. The ship was\r\ngot off, much damaged and leaking severely, and carried into a little\r\nport they discovered not far off. Here she was cleared out and laid upon\r\nthe ground, the tide sufficing to dry enough of her bottom to let the\r\ncarpenters repair it.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of Cook's choice of a ship of the build of the Endeavour was\r\nhere very apparent. It was not every ship that could be safely beached in\r\nthis way without danger of falling over. After long delay she proceeded\r\non her voyage, and soon had a second narrow escape. The long line of\r\ncoral reefs that front the northern part of Eastern Australia, for a\r\ndistance of 1200 miles, approach the coast about the place where the ship\r\nhad grounded. The passage between the outer reef and the land is strewn\r\nwith shoals, and finding his further progress much impeded by them, and\r\nfearful of a repetition of his disaster, Cook with some difficulty found\r\na channel to seaward, and gained the open ocean. He was, however, yet\r\ndetermined to follow the land he was exploring, and more especially to\r\nsolve the great question as to whether Australia was joined to New Guinea\r\nor no; and three days after his escape from the line of reefs he found\r\nhimself with a light wind, embayed on the outer side of them, with the\r\nreefs close to him, and the ship drifting slowly but surely on them, the\r\nheavy swell of the great ocean breaking mountains high on their outer\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nHere again calmness and promptitude saved him, and the ship was pushed\r\nthrough a narrow channel in these terrible reefs into the smooth, though\r\nreef-dotted, waters within. No event in the voyage is more dramatically\r\nnarrated, though without any exaggeration, than this hair-breadth escape.\r\n\r\nWith the caution born of recent dangers, Cook now slowly found his way\r\nthrough the maze of reefs, by a route that no one has again followed, to\r\nthe northern point of Australia, and was rewarded for his pertinacity by\r\nfinding the channel now known as Torres Strait, which led him between New\r\nGuinea and Australia.\r\n\r\nThus far Cook's enthusiasm in adventure and desire to explore had been\r\nfully shared by his companions; but it is apparent that at this point\r\nthey fell short of his high standard. Cook, having secured his direct\r\npassage to Batavia, and having still a little provision left, was anxious\r\nto do still more in the way of discovery, and stood over to the\r\nlittle-known New Guinea shore. It is evident, however, from Cook's\r\nexpressions, though he does not complain, that his people were pining for\r\nfresh food and civilisation. Australia had produced them little but\r\noccasional fish and a few turtle. The salt provisions of those days were\r\nmost unpalatable, and the effect of their continued hard work and\r\ninadequate food for so long, for they were now over two years from\r\nEngland, with no communication of any kind with the outer world, were\r\ntelling on them, though they were still free from scurvy.\r\n\r\nCook, therefore, after landing once in New Guinea, unwillingly turned his\r\nship's head towards Batavia.\r\n\r\nThe complaints grew louder as he passed by Timor without attempting to\r\ncommunicate, and falling in with the island of Savu, he yielded to\r\nimportunity, and touched there to get refreshments.\r\n\r\nThence he went by the south shore of the chain of islands to Sunda Strait\r\nand Batavia.\r\n\r\nSo far all had gone well. It was undoubtedly far the most successful\r\nvoyage ever made. Much had been done--more than his orders directed--to\r\nexplore unknown lands, and the dire enemy of seamen, scurvy, had been\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nBut his luck was not to last.\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely necessary to remain some time at Batavia, while the\r\nroughly repaired damage to the ship was made good in the Dutch dockyard.\r\n\r\nTwo months and a half in the sickly climate of Batavia, during a bad time\r\nof the year, wrought a sad change in his ship's company. The port they so\r\nmuch desired proved but the door of the grave to many of them, and Cook\r\nsailed for England on December 27th, 1770, with dysentery pervading the\r\nship. The surgeon had already died of it; so had the poor Tahitian,\r\nTupia, with two seamen, and one of Mr. Banks' artists.\r\n\r\nWorse was, however, to follow. Day by day, as the ship slowly found her\r\nway over the Indian Ocean towards the Cape, against the wet and unhealthy\r\nnorth-west monsoon, the sick list grew larger. Man after man succumbed,\r\nand before half the distance to Capetown was traversed twenty-two more\r\nwere carried off. Green, the astronomer, two more of Banks' staff, two\r\nmidshipmen, the boatswain and carpenter were among the number. The crew\r\nwas more than decimated.\r\n\r\nThe ship touched at the Cape, and war with France being expected, the\r\nEndeavour joined the East India convoy, under H.M.S. Portland, at St.\r\nHelena. The heavy-sailing, collier-built craft was not, however, when the\r\nships had crossed the line and got upon a wind, able to keep up with\r\nthem, and she once more found herself alone on her way.\r\n\r\nTwo more officers, the First Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, and the Master, Mr.\r\nMolineux, died after leaving the Cape, but not of dysentery, and the ship\r\nfinally reached England on June 12th, 1771.\r\n\r\nNinety-four persons left England in the Endeavour, of whom fifty-four\r\nreturned. Thirty-eight died on the voyage, out of which number thirty-one\r\ndied after reaching Batavia, most of them from fever and dysentery\r\ncontracted at that place.\r\n\r\nAfter paying off in August 1771, the Endeavour was sold in 1775, and for\r\nmany years sailed as a collier in the North Sea.\r\n\r\nThis voyage gave a new impetus to discovery, and the immediate thought\r\nwas to resume it, under this heaven-born leader.\r\n\r\nCook was given little leisure, as it was nearly at once decided to send\r\nhim out again, and he was appointed to command the Resolution on November\r\n28th, 1771, the interval having been occupied in considering what ships\r\nshould be employed.\r\n\r\nCook's experience of the qualities of the Endeavour caused him to uphold\r\nthe selection of similar vessels, for there were to be two, and the\r\nResolution and Adventure, of 462 and 336 tons respectively, both Whitby\r\nbuilt colliers, were bought for the voyage. Cook was promoted to\r\nCommander, and Tobias Furnaux, in the Adventure, was placed under his\r\ncommand. It was not, however, until April 1772 that they sailed.\r\n\r\nIt was originally intended that Banks should again accompany Cook, and\r\nwith a view to his better accommodation a poop was added to the\r\nResolution. The short trip, however, from Deptford to Sheerness proved to\r\nCook that the ship was dangerously over-weighted, and the poop was\r\nremoved, with the consequence that Banks did not sail. The alteration\r\ndelayed final departure until June 22nd from Sheerness, and July 13th\r\nfrom Plymouth.\r\n\r\nThe naturalists on this voyage were two Forsters, Germans, father and\r\nson; and as astronomers Mr. Wales sailed in the Resolution, and Mr.\r\nBayley in the Adventure. Two of Cook's former companions sailed as\r\nLieutenants: Clerke, who was Lieutenant, and Pickersgill, who was master\r\nof the Endeavour when she reached England. This witnesses to the\r\nconfidence and enthusiasm that Cook inspired amongst those under him.\r\nThere were also other Endeavours amongst the junior officers.\r\n\r\nThe main object of the voyage was the settlement of the great question of\r\nthe southern Continent. Cook was directed to explore the whole region\r\nabout the South Pole, starting from the Cape of Good Hope, and working\r\neastward. The winter of the southern hemisphere was to be employed as\r\nCook thought fit.\r\n\r\nThis voyage brought Cook's qualities as a seaman and commander more\r\nprominently to view even than the former. The conditions were very\r\ndifferent. Instead of mapping coasts and islands, the principal duty was\r\nexploration of tempestuous seas in high latitudes, amongst ice, searching\r\nin vain for the illusive southern land.\r\n\r\nCook carried it out thoroughly. No gales, no temperatures deterred him\r\nfrom searching wherever the ships would safely sail, and it was only ice\r\nin dense masses that turned him back.\r\n\r\nWhat his people thought of it we do not know, but the Forsters have given\r\na piteous account of the privations and hardships of an exploration that\r\ngave them little chance of exercising their special knowledge.\r\n\r\nCook was better provided with instruments for the determination of\r\nlongitude than before, and the ships carried four chronometric\r\ntimekeepers; but the proper method of making use of them was scarcely yet\r\nrealised, and the course of his voyage did not permit them to be of much\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMindful of his former success in combating scurvy, and making use of his\r\nexperience, Cook carried with him all his former anti-scorbutics, and\r\nredoubled his general precautions as to cleanliness, both of person and\r\nship. The result was complete immunity from more than symptoms of scurvy.\r\nHe was able to say, when he returned, that no man had died not only of\r\nthis disease, but of any other, due to the exposures of the voyage. Three\r\nlost by accidents, and one from a complaint contracted before leaving\r\nEngland, were the sole losses on a voyage lasting three years, and during\r\nwhich the exposure to heat, cold, rain, and all the hardships of a sea\r\nlife was probably never surpassed.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Cape on November 22nd, Cook stood at once to the southward,\r\nintending to pass over a spot in latitude 54 degrees South, where in 1739\r\nM. Bouvet sighted land that was generally supposed to be a part of the\r\nSouthern Continent, and which he had been especially directed to examine.\r\nGales, however, drove him from his course, and to this day Bouvet's\r\nIslands (for Cook proved they could be nothing else) are doubtfully shown\r\nupon charts.* (* They were again reported in 1825 by the Sprightly, an\r\nEnglish whaler, but Sir James Ross searched for them in 1840 without\r\nsuccess.) Cook soon got into the ice, and fought with it and gales of\r\nwind, in snow and sleet and fog, working gradually eastwards from the\r\nlongitude of the Cape for four months. The ship penetrated to 67 degrees\r\nSouth at one point, and kept as high a latitude as ice permitted\r\neverywhere, but without discovering any land. Cook found to his great joy\r\nthat the ice yielded good fresh water, and replenished his water casks in\r\nthis manner, without any fear of falling short. With all his power of\r\ncommunicating his enthusiasm to others, it may be doubted if they shared\r\nhis pleasure at finding that the search in these inclement regions need\r\nnot be curtailed from lack of this necessary.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the longitude of Tasmania, Cook hauled to the northward, and\r\nheaded for New Zealand, where, after sailing over eleven thousand miles\r\nsince leaving the Cape without once sighting land, he anchored in Dusky\r\nBay on March 26th, 1774, with the Resolution only, the Adventure having\r\nparted company in thick weather on February 9th. Moving on to Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound, his old anchorage at the north end of Middle Island,\r\nhe found the Adventure there on May 18th. Captain Furneaux had, after\r\nvainly searching for his consort, run for Tasmania, and explored the east\r\ncoast. He did not, however, clear up the point for which he states he\r\nvisited this coast, namely, whether it joined New Holland or not, as\r\nstrong winds from the eastward made him fearful of closing what he\r\nthought was a deep bay, though really the Strait, and he sailed for the\r\nrendezvous in New Zealand under the impression that Tasmania and\r\nAustralia were one.\r\n\r\nThe ships left New Zealand on June 7th, 1773, and, after making a wide\r\ncircuit to the south and east in search of land, arrived at Tahiti on\r\nAugust 16th. A good many of the Adventure's people were ill with scurvy,\r\nand Cook is much puzzled to know the reason why they were attacked while\r\nhis own crew were free. He puts it down to the greater trouble he had\r\ntaken to make all his men use wild celery and other herbs in New Zealand,\r\nand no doubt this had its effect; but one cannot but suspect that the\r\nconstant care on his part to keep the ship clean and sweet below had much\r\nto do with it. The Adventure had the same anti-scorbutics, and Cook\r\nespecially mentions that they were in use; but the personal efforts of\r\nthe captain in the direction of general sanitary precautions were, we\r\nknow, exercised in one case, while we know nothing of the other.\r\n\r\nAfter a month's stay at Tahiti and the Society Islands, where the crews\r\nwere much benefited by fresh provisions, the ships sailed for the\r\nFriendly Islands, never visited since Tasrnan's time, and touched at Eoa\r\nand Tongatabu, or, as Tasman had called them, Middleburg and Amsterdam.\r\nThese were finally left on October 7th for New Zealand, which was made on\r\nthe 21st, and from this day to November 2nd the time was spent in\r\nfruitless endeavours to get into Cook's Strait. Gale succeeded gale--no\r\nuncommon thing here--and in one of them the Adventure parted company\r\nnever again to rejoin. Cook anchored in Queen Charlotte's Sound on\r\nNovember 2nd, and waited until the 25th for his consort in vain. Whilst\r\nhere they gained further and indisputable proof of the cannibalistic\r\ntendencies of the Maoris, some of the natives eating human flesh before\r\nthem. Cook has been much blamed for permitting this scene, which took\r\nplace on board; but there had been so much disputing in England as to the\r\npossibility of the fact, that he could not resist the opportunity of\r\nputting it beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, to be shortly proved in a much more horrible manner, for\r\nthe Adventure, which only arrived at Queen Charlotte's Sound after the\r\nResolution left, had a boat's crew attacked, overpowered, and eaten by\r\nthe natives. The circumstances were never wholly known, as not a man\r\nescaped; but the cooked remains were found, the natives decamping as the\r\nsearch-party approached.\r\n\r\nCook sailed south on November 25th, 1773, and was soon again battling\r\nwith the ice, into which he pushed as far as was safe with as much\r\nhardihood as if he had still had the second ship with him. He gained the\r\nlatitude of 67 degrees south, and worked eastward, searching religiously\r\nfor land--which, needless to say, he never found--his ropes frozen, and\r\nsails like, as he says, plates of metal. Whatever the feelings of others\r\non board were, Cook never flinched from every effort to get south,\r\npenetrating in one place to 71 degrees south, where he was stopped by\r\ndense pack, until he found himself nearly in the longitude of Tierra del\r\nFuego, when, satisfied that no Southern Continent existed in the Pacific,\r\nhe, on February 6th, steered north, to continue exploration in more\r\ngenial weather and more profitable latitudes. All this time there was no\r\nscurvy, and very little sickness of any kind; an indisputable proof of\r\nthe untiring supervision Cook exercised over the health of his men. The\r\nobject of his voyage, so far as the Southern Pacific was concerned, was\r\nnow accomplished, and Cook might have rounded Cape Horn, and made for the\r\nCape of Good Hope, completing his tour of the world in southern\r\nlatitudes; but such was not his idea of his duty. His own nervous words\r\nwill explain his feelings best:--\r\n\r\n\"We undoubtedly might have reached the Cape of Good Hope in April, and so\r\nhave put an end to the expedition so far as related to the finding of a\r\ncontinent, which indeed was the first object of the voyage; but for me at\r\nthis time to have quitted this Southern Pacific Ocean with a good ship\r\nexpressly sent out on discoveries, a healthy crew, and not in want either\r\nof stores or provisions, would have betrayed not only a want of\r\nperseverance, but of judgment, in supposing the South Pacific Ocean to be\r\nso well explored that nothing remained to be done in it. This, however,\r\nwas not my opinion; for, although I had proved there was no continent but\r\nwhat must lie far to the south, there remained, nevertheless, room for\r\nvery large islands in places wholly unexamined, and many of those which\r\nwere formerly discovered are but imperfectly explored, and their\r\nsituation as imperfectly known. I was, besides, of opinion that my\r\nremaining in this sea some time longer would be productive of\r\nimprovements in navigation and geography, as well as other sciences.\"\r\n\r\nCook mentions that, on communicating his intentions to his officers, they\r\nall heartily concurred; and he adds, \"Under such circumstances it is\r\nhardly necessary to say that the seamen were always obedient and alert,\r\nand they were so far from wishing the voyage at an end that they rejoiced\r\nat the prospect of its being prolonged another year.\" This, be it\r\nremembered, without a prospect of news from home or contact with\r\ncivilisation, for Cook's design was to pass again through the breadth of\r\nthe Pacific searching for islands as far as Quiros' discovery of Espiritu\r\nSanto, which lay due north of New Zealand, and then to return through the\r\ntempestuous regions they were now quitting to Cape Horn. Perhaps the\r\ncharms of Tahiti reconciled them.\r\n\r\nThis design Cook triumphantly carried out; though shortly after leaving\r\nsouthern latitudes he was so ill of what he describes as a bilious\r\ncholic, that his life was despaired of. He first searched for, and\r\nvisited, Davis' discovery of Easter Island, where he examined and\r\ndescribed the wonderful colossal, though rude, statues there found. He\r\nthen went to the Marquesas, a group but little known, where, after the\r\nusual attempt of the natives to appropriate sundry articles, and the\r\nconsequent necessity of firing upon them, peaceful relations were\r\nestablished, and a brisk trade in much-wanted refreshments was set up.\r\nThis did not last long, however, as the market was spoiled by some red\r\nfeathers, obtained at the Friendly Islands, being given for a pig; after\r\nwhich nothing would buy provisions but these same red feathers, and these\r\nbeing scarce, trade ceased. Cook therefore sailed once more for Tahiti.\r\n\r\nOn his way he touched at some of the coral atolls of the innumerable\r\nPaumotu Group, and arrived at Matavai on April 22nd, again with not a\r\nsick man on board.\r\n\r\nThree weeks were spent here with much satisfaction to all. Provisions\r\nwere in plenty, the king and people very friendly, and all went well. The\r\nislanders were preparing for an attack on Eimeo, a neighbouring island,\r\nand a gathering of the fleets gave Cook an opportunity of learning much\r\nof their naval power and manner of conducting war. He observed that the\r\ngeneral prosperity of Tahiti seemed to be at a much higher point than on\r\nhis former visit.\r\n\r\nAfter another three weeks' stay at Huaheine, and Ulietea, also amongst\r\nold friends, the Resolution sailed on June 4th to the west.\r\n\r\nDiscovering Palmerston and Savage Islands on the way, she called at\r\nNamuka, one of the Friendly Group, thus extending the knowledge of those\r\nislands gained the year before. Thence Cook sailed west, discovering\r\nTurtle Island, but just passing out of sight to the southward of the\r\nlarge Fiji Group, and thus lost the chance of adding them to his other\r\nfinds.\r\n\r\nHe was now bound for the New Hebrides, of which the northern island had\r\nbeen discovered by Quiros. Bougainville, the French explorer, had, in\r\n1768, passed just south of Quiros' Island, and named one or two others he\r\nsighted, but had made no stay, and knew nothing of the extent of the\r\nGroup.\r\n\r\nThis was not Cook's fashion. He explored and circumnavigated the whole\r\nGroup, which extends in a long line for three hundred and fifty miles. He\r\ntouched first at Mallicolo, where, after a temporary disagreement,\r\nfriendship was formed. Passing Sandwich Island, Erromanga was landed\r\nupon; but the suspicion of the natives here impelled them to attack the\r\nboats, and no intercourse was established.\r\n\r\nThe ship then anchored in the convenient harbour of Resolution Bay in the\r\nisland of Tanna, and remained a fortnight, wooding and watering.\r\nObservations on the hot springs that gush from the side of the volcano\r\nbordering the harbour were made, and the relations with the natives were\r\naltogether friendly. Sighting Anityeum, the southern member of the New\r\nHebrides, and making sure there was nothing beyond it, Cook returned\r\nalong the west side of the islands, passing eastward of them again,\r\nbetween Mallicolo and Espiritu Santo. The latter island was closely\r\nfollowed round its whole extent, and Quiros' Bay of St. Philip and St.\r\nJames identified in the great inlet in the northern side. Having laid\r\ndown the whole of this extensive group of islands, and very accurately\r\nfixed the longitude by many lunar observations, Cook, on August 31st,\r\nsailed to the westward to search for more lands.\r\n\r\nHis chart of the New Hebrides is still, for some of the islands, the only\r\none; and wherever superseded by more recent surveys the general accuracy\r\nof his work, both in outline and position, is very remarkable. On several\r\noccasions up to the present year (1893) Cook's recorded positions have\r\nsaved the adoption of so-called amendments reported by passing ships,\r\nwhich would have been anything but amendments in reality.\r\n\r\nFour days after leaving the New Hebrides Cook discovered New Caledonia.\r\nHe explored the whole of the eastern side of this large island, which is\r\nthree hundred miles in length, anchoring in one harbour inside the reefs\r\nwhich border it, and making friends with the natives. Other attempts to\r\nget inside the reefs were, however, unsuccessful, and after several\r\nnarrow escapes from shipwreck Cook gave up, to his regret, a complete\r\ncircumnavigation of the island. The summer approaching, he wished to\r\nrefit and recruit in New Zealand before once more standing south.\r\n\r\nNorfolk Island was discovered and landed upon on the way, and Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound was once more reached on October 19th.\r\n\r\nThe Adventure's visit was ascertained from the Maoris, but Cook was much\r\npuzzled by incompletely understood accounts of white men having been\r\nkilled. As far as could be gathered a ship had been lost on the coast,\r\nand Cook was led to believe that this disaster had no reference to the\r\nAdventure.\r\n\r\nIt was found that pigs and fowls left here on the former visit were still\r\nin existence, and presumably thriving. It may here be mentioned, that\r\nwherever Cook touched he invariably, so far as his stock allowed, left\r\nanimals to stock the country, and that New Zealand was, when the settlers\r\neventually came, found to be well supplied with pigs.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of three weeks the Resolution sailed, on November 10th, for\r\nCape Horn. She kept farther north than on the last occasion, the object\r\nbeing to pass over new ground, and more completely disprove the existence\r\nof any land.\r\n\r\nThe western part of Tierra del Fuego being reached, Cook followed the\r\nshore to the south-east, mapping the outside of this dangerous and\r\ninhospitable archipelago. On December 20th he put in to what he\r\nafterwards called Christmas Sound, where large numbers of kelp geese were\r\nobtained, giving the crew what Cook describes as a dainty Christmas\r\nfeast, though the flesh of these birds is as tough, fishy, and\r\nunpalatable as can well be imagined; on this occasion, however, the\r\nseamen seemed to have concurred in the verdict of their omnivorous\r\ncommander, to whom nothing ever came amiss. Be it remembered, however,\r\nhow long they had been on salt provisions, and that the South Sea\r\nIslands, though pleasant in many respects, produced but little solid\r\nfood--no beef, mutton, or flesh of any quadruped but pigs, and those in\r\nnot very great plenty--while New Zealand gave them nothing but fish.\r\n\r\nRounding Cape Horn, he passed through the Strait Le Maire, and followed\r\nthe north shore of Staten Island, anchoring at one place to obtain seals\r\nand birds.\r\n\r\nWhilst praising the flavour of a young seal cub, Cook is compelled to\r\nadmit that the flesh of an old sea lion is abominable; a remarkable\r\nstatement as coming from him.\r\n\r\nLeaving Staten Island, Cook steered east and discovered South Georgia,\r\nnamed after the king. He followed the north coast of this desolate and\r\nice-clad island, obtaining more refreshment in the shape of seals,\r\npenguins, and shags--unpalatable, but welcome food to men who had so long\r\nsubsisted on bad salt meat. From South Georgia the ship's head was once\r\nmore turned southwards, and before many days ice was again encountered.\r\nIn stormy and thick weather the Resolution made her way, disproving the\r\nexistence of a great tract of land laid down by speculative geographers,\r\nuntil January 31st, 1775, when Sandwich Land was discovered in about\r\nlatitude 60 degrees south. This ice-covered group of islands was sketched\r\nunder great difficulties from gales, fogs, snow, and numerous icebergs;\r\nand Cook then bore away along their parallel, to seek once more for\r\nBouvet's Islands to the eastward.\r\n\r\nHe found nothing, and on February 26th steered for the Cape of Good Hope,\r\neven he being glad to leave this trying, tempestuous latitude. On March\r\n23rd he anchored in Table Bay, having learnt from some vessels outside of\r\nthe safe arrival of the Adventure in England the year before, and of her\r\nboat's crew having been eaten by the Maoris, which cleared up the mystery\r\nof the wrecked ship.\r\n\r\nThe Resolution finally arrived at Spithead on July 29th, 1775, after an\r\nabsence of three years and eighteen days.\r\n\r\nCaptain Furneaux had, on leaving New Zealand, sailed straight for Cape\r\nHorn, the Cape of Good Hope, and England, arriving just a year before the\r\nResolution.\r\n\r\nCook speaks most warmly of Captain Furneaux; but one cannot help\r\ncontrasting his action with Cook's. Left, by the separation, his own\r\nmaster, he might have continued exploration, as did Cook. His ship was\r\nstaunch, his provisions in much the same condition as the Resolution's;\r\nbut he went straight home. His crew had suffered from scurvy, whereas\r\nCook's had not; but he says not one word of this, nor does he give any\r\nreason why he gave up any further thought of the objects of the voyage,\r\nexcept a search for Bouvet's Islands, which he also looked for on his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt was the indomitable perseverance that led Cook to act so differently\r\nthat raised his reputation so far above all other leaders.\r\n\r\nThus ended this very remarkable voyage. Never was a ship's crew exposed\r\nto more continual hardships, with so little to keep up interest and\r\nexcitement, as the people of the Resolution; and yet Cook is able to\r\nrecord, with allowable pride, that only four lives had been lost, and\r\nonly one by a sickness contracted before leaving England.\r\n\r\nOnce more the scurvy was defeated; and, without a doubt, owing to the\r\nintelligent action and untiring supervision of the captain. He gives a\r\nfull description of the measures adopted, and while giving full\r\nacknowledgment to the anti-scorbutics with which he was supplied, he is\r\nof opinion that the general sanitary precautions formed the best\r\nprevention. Cleanliness of persons, bedding, clothes, and ship, were\r\ncontinually enforced. All these were foreign to the sailors of the time,\r\nand extraordinary it is that it was a man born in the lower rank of life,\r\nand brought up in a collier, who had the sense to perceive that in these\r\nlay the surest preventatives against this paralysing scourge.\r\n\r\nCook was promoted to captain--a proud position for the collier boy--and\r\nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society; perhaps even a greater distinction\r\nfor a man of his bringing up. He contributed papers on his methods of\r\npreventing scurvy, and on the tides of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nHe also employed himself in publishing the account of his recent voyage,\r\nthe only one which he himself edited.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, long at rest. The Admiralty wished to send an\r\nexpedition to explore the north-western coasts of North America, and to\r\nexamine the Polar Sea from the Bering Straits side, with a view of the\r\ndiscovery of a north-west passage. Cook seems to have volunteered for the\r\ncommand without being actually asked, and, needless to say, was at once\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nIn February he once more received his commission to command the\r\nResolution, this time accompanied by the Discovery, a vessel very similar\r\nto the Adventure, his consort during the last voyage. Clerke, a master's\r\nmate in the Endeavour, and second lieutenant in the Resolution, was\r\nappointed as commander to the Discovery. He, like Cook, was fated not to\r\nreturn from this third journey to the great Pacific.\r\n\r\nOthers who had sailed with Cook before were ready to accompany him, once\r\nmore to encounter privations and find new lands.\r\n\r\nCook's orders were long and detailed, but were to the effect that he was\r\nto proceed by way of the Cape of Good Hope to search in the Indian Ocean\r\nfor the land recently seen by M. Kerguelen; thence via Tahiti, on to the\r\ncoast of North America in about latitude 45 degrees, which he was to\r\nfollow to latitude 65 degrees, searching especially for any channel which\r\nmight lead to the north-east, as it was supposed there might be a passage\r\ncommunicating with Hudson's Bay. He was further to look for any passage\r\nnorth of North America to the Atlantic, and to make such other\r\nexplorations as might seem fit to him. A money reward of 20,000 pounds\r\nwas also offered in case of success in finding such a passage.\r\n\r\nChronometers were again carried, and more confidence in them being felt,\r\nmore use was made of them.\r\n\r\nCook took with him Omai, a young Society islander, who had induced\r\nCaptain Furneaux to take him to England, and whom Cook now engaged to\r\nreturn to his native country.\r\n\r\nThe ships sailed on July 11th, 1776, and arrived at Table Bay on October\r\n18th.\r\n\r\nSailing thence on November 30th, he passed and roughly mapped Prince\r\nEdward's, Marion, and Croset's Islands, all of which had been discovered\r\nby Marion de Fresne. He then struck Kerguelen's Land, spent Christmas Day\r\nin one of its harbours, and mapped the eastern side of this large but\r\ndesolate island. He was unaware that Kerguelen had visited this island a\r\nsecond time, and had gained much more information about it than he did in\r\nhis first voyage.\r\n\r\nCook had taken on board at the Cape as many cattle, horses, bulls, cows,\r\ngoats, and sheep as he could stow, with a view of landing them at Tahiti\r\nor elsewhere, and it is without surprise that we learn that after several\r\nweeks in these stormy seas a good many of them had died. When we consider\r\nthe size of the ships the wonder is where they found room for these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nOn January 26th the ships arrived in Tasmania, and anchored in Adventure\r\nBay, principally with a view of getting fodder for the remaining cattle.\r\nPigs were left here, according to Cook's usual custom.\r\n\r\nAfter four days the ships sailed, and arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound,\r\nNew Zealand, on February 12th, 1777. Here Cook learnt the history of the\r\nattack on the Adventure's boat's crew from the chief who led it, but made\r\nno attempt at reprisals, although urged by many other natives to kill\r\nhim. He seems to have been guided by the consideration that, as related\r\nby the natives, it was a dishonest act of barter on the part of one of\r\nthe sailors which commenced the disturbance; and that occurring so long\r\nbefore, no good purpose would be served by punishment. It says much for\r\nhis humane treatment of natives.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this, Cook records that he had at different times left about a\r\ndozen pigs in New Zealand. These increased, and stocked the whole island\r\nby the time the English settlers arrived.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Tahiti Cook fell across several islands belonging to what\r\nwas afterwards called after him, the Cook Group. He visited Mangaia,\r\nAtiu, Takutea,* (* Spelt by Cook Mangeea, Wateeo, and Otakootaia.) and\r\nthe Hervey Islands. Relations were established with the natives, and Cook\r\nwas much interested at finding on Atiu three natives of the Society\r\nIslands, the survivors of twelve, who had been blown away in a canoe, and\r\nlanded on this island, five hundred miles distant. As he remarks, this\r\nthrows great light on the manner in which the different islands of the\r\nPacific have been peopled.\r\n\r\nCook now made up his mind that he was too late to prosecute discovery\r\nthis year on the American Continent, it being well into April, and being\r\nanxious to save the remaining cattle that he wished to land at Tahiti,\r\nand which had been taken on board especially for this purpose, the island\r\nbeing still far to windward, he bore away for the Friendly Islands for\r\nfodder and refreshments. He landed on Palmerston on the way--an island\r\ndiscovered last voyage--and arrived at Namuka* (* Cook's Anamooka.) on\r\nMay 1st, with not a sick man in the ships.\r\n\r\nThe ships remained in the Friendly Group for two months and a half,\r\nvisiting and mapping the different islands, and learning much of the\r\nmanners of this interesting race, seeing their great concerted dances,\r\nand the ceremonies of coming of age of the heir to the throne. Cook here\r\nfirst became acquainted with the mysterious rite of Tabu, which was\r\nclosely connected with his own death. A selection of useful animals,\r\nincluding horses, were left at Tongatabu.\r\n\r\nWhile at the Friendly Islands Cook heard of the Fiji Group, and saw some\r\nof the natives, who had come over in a canoe. The intelligence he was\r\nable to gather concerning them was imperfect, and he saw no reason to\r\njustify a long detour to leeward to search for them, when his object was\r\nto stock the Society Islands with the animals he had. Had he known their\r\nsize and importance, his course might possibly have been different. As it\r\nwas, he sailed for Tahiti, and discovering Tubuai, one of the Austral\r\nGroup, on his passage, arrived there on August 13th, 1777.\r\n\r\nSix weeks were spent here, and the old friendships further cemented.\r\nBulls and cows and other animals were presented to the king. Cook also\r\nattended at several ceremonies consequent on war being declared against\r\nEimeo, which included the offering of the dead body of a man, previously\r\nkilled for the purpose, to the war god. He positively refused to aid in\r\nthis war, which very shortly came to an end.\r\n\r\nEimeo was next visited, and here the theft of a goat, which Cook intended\r\nto land at Huaheine, induced him to take severe measures to get it back.\r\nSeveral war canoes and houses were destroyed before it was returned. At\r\nHuaheine, Omai was established, with many valuable European articles in\r\nhis possession. Here again Cook acted with considerable severity in the\r\ncase of a thief cutting off his ears, and confining him on board. His\r\naction has been questioned, but considering his humane character, and the\r\njudgment that he always displayed in these questions, we are justified in\r\nbelieving that he had good reason for departing from his ordinary custom\r\nof mild treatment of natives. At Ulietea, or Raiatea, next visited, a\r\nmidshipman and a seaman of the Discovery deserted. Cook took his usual\r\nstep of confining some natives of importance, and informing their\r\nrelatives that they would be retained until the deserters were returned.\r\nIn this case he impounded the king's son and daughter, with the desired\r\neffect, as the stragglers were soon brought back from Bolabola, whither\r\nthey had gone; but both Cook and Captain Clerke were nearly captured by\r\nthe natives when on shore in the interval.\r\n\r\nIt is only surprising that more of Cook's people did not attempt to\r\nremain in these pleasant islands. The hardships of the sea press much on\r\ncertain natures, and the allurements of the easy and careless life of a\r\ntropical island offered such a contrast, that it scarcely required the\r\ndesire of the natives to get white men with their superior knowledge, and\r\nabove all superior arms, to remain with them, to induce them to desert.\r\nThis last, however, made desertion more easy, and had not Cook taken\r\nstrong measures, no doubt the epidemic would have spread.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting Bolabola, Cook sailed north, to prosecute the main object\r\nof his voyage, the exploration of the north-west coast of America. On\r\nDecember 24th he fell in with Christmas Island, which he so named from\r\nthe season. After mapping it, and getting many turtle, he continued his\r\ncourse to the north, and discovered Atooi or Kauai, the western island of\r\nthe Sandwich Group.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with this island and another, he finally left on February\r\n3rd, 1778, and on March 7th made the coast of North America, a little\r\nsouth of the Columbia River. Gales ensued, and Cook missed the entrance\r\nof Juan de Fuca Strait, making the land again a little north of it.\r\n\r\nAnchoring first in Nootka Sound in Vancouver Island--though Cook did not\r\nknow it was an island--the ships continued their exploration to the\r\nnorth-west, skirting the coast as near as stormy weather permitted them,\r\nand calling at various places until the north-west extremity of the\r\nAlaska Peninsula was reached. In one place, afterwards called Cook's\r\nRiver, it was hoped that the desired passage eastward was found; but it\r\nwas soon discovered that it was merely an inlet.\r\n\r\nPassing through the Aleutian Chain, east of Unalaska, Cook visited that\r\nisland, and continued his voyage through the Bering Sea, clinging to the\r\nland as much as possible, and finally got into Bering Strait. Here he had\r\nboth continents in sight, and communicated with both sides.\r\n\r\nStanding further north, he, in latitude 70 degrees 30 minutes north, came\r\nacross the icy barrier of the Arctic Sea. After vainly trying for a\r\npassage in fog and strong wind, surrounded by loose ice, and after\r\nmapping a good deal of the shores on both sides, the ships again turned\r\nsouth at the end of August, exploring as they went first on the Asiatic\r\nside, and afterwards on the American, especially examining Norton Sound.\r\nIn the beginning of October they once more arrived at Unalaska, and the\r\nResolution having sprung a dangerous leak, the opportunity was taken to\r\nstop it.\r\n\r\nOn October 26th the ships sailed for the Sandwich Islands, where Cook had\r\ndetermined to winter, for the double purpose of refreshing his crew,\r\ngaining more knowledge of the Group, and being in a convenient position\r\nfor resuming his exploration in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe voyage just accomplished was very remarkable, whether for the amount\r\nof coast mapped, which extended for between three and four thousand\r\nmiles, or for the determination with which it was prosecuted in\r\ntempestuous and thick weather, on a most dangerous and inhospitable\r\ncoast, part of the time in ice. The crews were perfectly healthy, with no\r\nsign of scurvy, and he brought both his ships off without any damage.\r\n\r\nMaui, another of the Sandwich Group, was made on November 26th, and after\r\ncommunicating, the ships stood over to Owhyhee (Hawaii). Wind was against\r\nthem, and it was not until January 17th that the two ships, having passed\r\nalong the north side of the island to the eastward, at last anchored in\r\nKealakekua Bay, on the south-west side.\r\n\r\nThe events which followed the arrival of the ships at Hawaii, which\r\nterminated in Captain Cook's death, were not understood at the time, but\r\nhave been elucidated by the inquiries of the early missionaries, which\r\nthrow much light upon the beliefs of the islanders.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a tradition existed that a chief of earlier times, one\r\nRono, Orono, or Lono (the R and the L in the Pacific languages are almost\r\ninterchangeable), had, after killing his wife, become frantically insane,\r\nand after travelling through the islands boxing and wrestling with all he\r\nmet, had departed in a canoe, prophesying that he would some day return\r\nin an island with trees, hogs, and dogs. He was deified, and temples\r\nerected in his honour.\r\n\r\nWhen Cook's ships arrived it was believed that the prophecy was\r\nfulfilled. Rono had returned as he had said, and the natives flocked to\r\ndo him honour. When Cook landed he was received with adoration, the\r\ncrowds prostrating themselves, and the priests escorting him with much\r\nceremony. Led to a temple, he was clothed with red cloth, had pigs\r\noffered to him, and was generally treated in a manner which, though\r\nsatisfactory as showing the friendly feelings of the natives, was\r\npuzzling to the Europeans. This continued throughout their stay, presents\r\nof all kinds being showered upon them. The officers, however, observed\r\nthat the warrior chiefs were not so enthusiastic as the priests and\r\ncommon people. The death of a seaman, who was buried on shore in the\r\npresence of a large concourse, would seem to have been the first\r\ncircumstance that threw doubts upon the godlike character of the\r\nvisitors; but the ready way in which the fence of a Morai or sacred\r\ninclosure, which included various images, was granted for fuel, shows\r\nthat the priests still held to their idea. The king, Taraiopu (or\r\nTerreooboo, as his name was written by Captain King), arrived shortly\r\nafter the ships anchored, and showed himself to be as much impressed with\r\nthe public belief as any of his subjects.\r\n\r\nThus matters continued during the eighteen days the ships remained; but\r\ntowards the end of this time the natives began to show anxiety that they\r\nshould be gone. The drain of hogs and other provisions, which were poured\r\nupon the visitors, doubtless led to anxious thoughts as to how long this\r\nwas to last; and probably those members of the community who were less\r\namenable to the influence of the priests, and were jealous of their own\r\nauthority, were by no means so certain that the popular opinion of the\r\nsupernatural nature of the white men was correct.\r\n\r\nThe ships sailed on February 4th, but, as ill-luck had it, the Resolution\r\nsprung her foremast in a gale, and Cook resolved to return to Kealakekua\r\nBay for repairs. Here they again anchored on the 11th.\r\n\r\nTheir reception was, however, very different.\r\n\r\nNo crowd of canoes round the ship; no enthusiastic mass of natives on\r\nshore. Everything was silence.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened was that the king had departed, leaving the bay under\r\n\"tabu,\" i.e., a sacred interdict.\r\n\r\nThe priests, however, received them with as much friendliness as before,\r\nand the Morai was given up to them as a place of repairs for the damaged\r\nmast.\r\n\r\nThe king hurried back on hearing of the return of the ships, and removed\r\nthe tabu; but the native disposition was changed. Some of the party on\r\nshore had persuaded women to break the tabu.\r\n\r\nWhether this affected relations is uncertain, but the inhabitants\r\ngenerally exhibited considerable hostility, and headed by some chiefs,\r\nshowed an inclination to attack a watering party. Thefts followed, and\r\nthe capture of a canoe as a reprisal caused a scuffle on the beach, in\r\nwhich the Englishmen were worsted by the crowd, though a friendly chief\r\nsoon restored order.\r\n\r\nInstructions were now given to the party on shore at the Morai to permit\r\nno natives to approach in the night, and a musket was fired at one of\r\nthem who came near.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of February 14th the Discovery's cutter was found to have\r\nbeen stolen.\r\n\r\nCook at once decided to have recourse to his usual practice, and get\r\neither the king or some principal chief on board, as a hostage till it\r\nwas returned. He at the same time gave orders to prevent any canoes from\r\nleaving the bay, in order that he might, if necessary, seize them, and\r\nsent his boats to carry this out. Guns were fired from the ships at two\r\nlarge canoes that attempted to pass. Cook himself landed with a small\r\narmed force, and went in search of the king, who at once consented to\r\ncome on board. The conduct of Taraiopu throughout showed that he had\r\nperfect confidence in Cook, and was entirely friendly, whether he still\r\nbelieved in the Rono theory or not.\r\n\r\nWhile walking down to the boat, the natives, who were momentarily\r\nincreasing in numbers, implored the king not to go. His wife joined her\r\nentreaties. Taraiopu hesitated. At this moment a man ran up and cried,\r\n\"It is war; they have killed a chief!\" One of the guard boats had, in\r\nfact, fired at a canoe attempting to leave the bay, and killed a man. The\r\nnatives at once ran to arms, and Cook, seeing his intentions frustrated,\r\nwalked towards the boat. A native attacked him with a spear, and Cook\r\nshot him with his gun. Still, no further attack was made, but the men in\r\nthe boats hearing Cook's shot, and seeing the excited crowd, commenced to\r\nfire without orders. Cook still moved to the shore, calling to his men to\r\ncease firing; but whilst so doing, and with his back to the exasperated\r\nnatives, he was stabbed in the back with a dagger, and fell with his face\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nThere was then general confusion. The boats were a little way from the\r\nbeach, and several of the marines were also killed, before they could\r\nreach them. Cook's body was at once dragged off by the natives.\r\n\r\nThe boats returned on board amid general consternation, and it is\r\nmentioned that a general silence reigned on board when it was known that\r\ntheir beloved commander had fallen.\r\n\r\nThe party at the Morai were shortly after attacked, but beat off the\r\nassailants, and reinforcements were sent from the ships. Lieutenant King,\r\na favourite officer of Cook's, behaved with great discretion, and\r\nassisted by some of the priests, made a truce, during which the mast and\r\nother articles on shore for repairs were got off.\r\n\r\nThe sailors were mad for reprisals, but Captain Clerke, on whom the\r\ncommand devolved, decided on pacific measures, and every attempt was made\r\nto recover Cook's body. All that was obtained, however, were some of his\r\nbones, which were brought down with much solemnity by a chief, and\r\ndelivered wrapped up in new cloth and red feathers.\r\n\r\nIt was known in after years that Cook's body had been instantly cut up;\r\nthe flesh was burnt, as was the custom with great chiefs and many of the\r\nbones were preserved with great honour in a Morai dedicated to Rono.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that Cook's death was due to a revulsion of feeling on the\r\npart of some of the natives, who no longer believed in his divine\r\ncharacter, but that many regarded the outrage with horror. When the first\r\nEuropeans came to reside on the island, and learnt the story from the\r\nnative side, they found universal regret prevailing at this untoward\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nCook left officers imbued with his own noble sentiments. No general\r\nattack was made in revenge for what they saw was the result of\r\nmisunderstanding, although they were ignorant of the exact circumstances\r\nwhich led, first to the uncommon and extraordinary veneration with which\r\nhe had been treated, and then to the sudden change in the native\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nIt was found necessary to fire on the natives who prevented the watering\r\nparty from working, and some of the sailors on this duty burnt some\r\nhouses; but before the ships left, friendly relations were again\r\nestablished, and many natives visited them.\r\n\r\nAfter Cook's remains had been committed to the sea, the prosecution of\r\nthe voyage was determined upon, although Captain Clerke was in the last\r\nstage of consumption, and as soon as the Resolution's mast could be\r\nrepaired, the two vessels once more departed, on February 22nd, 1779.\r\n\r\nCook's intentions were carried out as if he had still been in command.\r\nThe remainder of the Sandwich Group was mapped, and the ships proceeded\r\nonce more to the north. Calling at Petropavlovsk in Avatcha Bay,\r\nKamtchatka, they again passed through Bering Strait, and sought in vain\r\nfor a passage either to the north-east or north-west, being everywhere\r\nbaffled by dense masses of ice. Captain Clerke at last abandoned the\r\nstruggle, and repassed Bering Strait on his way south on August 1st.\r\n\r\nOn August 22nd Captain Clerke died.\r\n\r\nThis officer had accompanied Captain Cook in all his voyages, and had\r\nalso circumnavigated the globe in the Dolphin with Captain Byron before.\r\nNo man had seen more of the Pacific, and he proved himself, during his\r\nshort period of command, a worthy successor of Cook.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gore, who had been with Cook on his First Voyage, now succeeded,\r\nKing being put as Commander into the Discovery, and the two ships made\r\nthe best of their way home, via Macao and the Straits of Sunda, arriving\r\nat the Nore on October 4th, 1780, after an absence of four years and two\r\nmonths. During the whole of this voyage not the slightest symptom of\r\nscurvy appeared in either ship, so completely were Cook's precautions\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nCook had six children. Three died young. Of the others, all boys, the\r\neldest, James, entered the Navy, and lived to be a Commander, when, in\r\n1794, he was drowned. The second, Nathaniel, also in the Navy, was lost\r\nin a hurricane in 1780. The third died when at Cambridge. They none of\r\nthem lived to be married, and no descendant of the great navigator has\r\nperpetuated his race.\r\n\r\nOf Cook's private life during his brief intervals at home we know\r\nnothing. A man rising from the ranks, and of his reserved character,\r\nwould have but few friends, when he had such short time to make them in\r\nhis new sphere. He lived at Mile End when at home, but after his death\r\nhis widow removed to Clapham, living there for forty years, at first with\r\nher cousin, Isaac Smith, who had served with Cook in the Endeavour and\r\nResolution. She died in 1835, at the great age of ninety-three.\r\n\r\nOf Cook's character, none could be a better judge than Captain King, who\r\nwrites as follows, after describing his death:--\r\n\r\n\"Thus fell our great and excellent commander. After a life of so much\r\ndistinguished and successful enterprise, his death, as far as regards\r\nhimself, cannot be considered premature, since he lived to finish the\r\ngreat work for which he seems to have been designed. How sincerely his\r\nloss was felt and lamented, by those who had so long found their general\r\nsecurity in his skill and conduct, and every consolation in their\r\nhardships in his tenderness and humanity, it is neither necessary nor\r\npossible for me to describe. The constitution of his body was robust,\r\ninured to labour, and capable of undergoing the severest hardships. His\r\nstomach bore without difficulty the coarsest and most ungrateful food.\r\nIndeed, temperance with him was scarcely a virtue, so great was the\r\nindifference with which he submitted to every kind of self-denial. The\r\nqualities of his mind were of the same hardy, vigorous kind with those of\r\nhis body. His understanding was strong and perspicacious. His judgment in\r\nwhatever related to the service he was engaged in quick and sure. His\r\ndesigns were bold and manly, and both in the conception and in the mode\r\nof execution bore evident marks of a great original genius. His courage\r\nwas cool and determined, and accompanied by an admirable presence of mind\r\nin the moment of danger. His manners were plain and unaffected. His\r\ntemper might, perhaps, have been justly blamed as subject to haughtiness\r\nand passion, had not these been disarmed by a disposition the most\r\nbenevolent and humane. Those intervals of recreation, which sometimes\r\nunavoidably occurred, and were looked for by us with a longing that\r\npersons who have experienced the fatigues of service will readily excuse,\r\nwere submitted to by him with a certain impatience whenever they could\r\nnot be employed in making further provision for the more effectual\r\nprosecution of his designs.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty complete picture, and of a great man; a man who had\r\nbefore him continually his duty, and who had in an eminent degree the\r\ncapacity to carry it out.\r\n\r\nThough, under his determination to do this, he drove his people hard;\r\nthough he tried them with his irascibility; their conviction of his\r\ngreatness, their confidence in his leadership and in his justice, led\r\nthem to love him. He had no sympathy with the ordinary foibles and\r\nweaknesses of his men. The charms of Tahiti, the paradise of the sailor,\r\nwere no charms for him; he hardly notices the attractive ladies of that\r\nisland; the attractions of the place to him were the abundance of\r\nprovisions, as a means of fitting his expedition for further exploration\r\nand hardship. The strongest proof of his capacity as a commander is the\r\ndevotion of his officers. Those who know the Navy know how difficult it\r\nis for any man who rises from the ranks to be successful in command. But\r\nCook was a gentleman born; he had the intuition of great minds for\r\nfitting themselves to every position to which they may rise, and there is\r\nnever a whisper of disinclination to submit to the rule of the once\r\ncollier boy, the son of a labourer.\r\n\r\nHis intelligence is remarkably shown in his greatest triumph, the\r\nsuppression of scurvy. That it should be left to a man of little\r\neducation to discern the combination of means by which this enemy of long\r\nvoyages could be conquered, is the most remarkable thing about this\r\nremarkable man. He himself notices the disinclination of the sailor to\r\nany new article of food, especially when not particularly palatable; but\r\nhe soon found the means to induce them to understand that their lives\r\ngreatly depended upon these rather nasty messes. Sour krout; the\r\nunsavoury portable soups of that day; the strange greens that Cook\r\ninsisted on hunting up at every land he visited, and boiling with their\r\nordinary food; the constant washing between decks; the drying below with\r\nstoves, even in the hottest weather; the personal baths; the change of\r\nwet clothing; the airing of bedding, were all foreign and repugnant to\r\nthe notions of the seamen of the day, and it required constant\r\nsupervision and wise management to enforce the adoption of these odd\r\nfoods and customs.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it is to Cook's personal action the success was due.\r\nWallis and Byron had anti-scorbutics, but they suffered from scurvy;\r\nFurneaux, sailing with Cook in the second voyage, under precisely similar\r\ncircumstances, suffered from scurvy. It was only in Cook's ships, and in\r\nthe Discovery, commanded and officered by men who had sailed with Cook,\r\nand seen his methods, that exemption occurred.\r\n\r\nCook did more, incomparably more, than any other navigator to discover\r\nnew lands. This was only accomplished by dint of hard work; and yet his\r\nmen suffered less than in any ships, British or foreign, or similar\r\nexpeditions. Though his tracks were in new and unknown waters, we never\r\nhear of starvation; he always manages to have an abundant supply of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe completeness and accuracy of his accounts and charts are no less\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nM. de La Perouse, one of the foremost of the great French navigators,\r\ntold Captain Phillip, the founder of the Colony of New South Wales, that\r\n\"Cook had left him nothing but to admire.\" This was all but literally\r\ntrue; wherever Cook went he finished his work, according to the\r\nrequirements of navigation of his time. He never sighted a land but he\r\ndetermined its dimensions, its shape, its position, and left true guides\r\nfor his successors. His charts are still for some parts unsuperseded, and\r\nhis recorded observations still save us from hasty and incorrect\r\nalterations desired by modern navigators.\r\n\r\nWell may Englishmen be proud that this greatest of navigators was their\r\ncountryman.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONS WHO LEFT ENGLAND IN H.M.S.

The longitude is counted West\r\nfrom the meridian of Greenwich where no other place is particularly\r\nmentioned. The proportional length of the log-line to the half minute\r\nglass, by which the ships run was measured, is as thirty seconds is to\r\nthirty feet.\r\n\r\nWhile the ship lay in port or was coasting in sight of land, or sailing\r\nin narrow seas, this Journal is not kept in the usual form, but the\r\ndegrees of Latitude and Longitude the ship passes over are put down at\r\nthe top of each page, by which together with the notes in the margin* an\r\neasy reference will be had to the Chart. (* These notes in the margin\r\nhave not been printed. ED.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. ENGLAND TO RIO JANEIRO.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE OCCURRENCES ON BOARD HIS MAJESTY'S BARK ENDEAVOUR.\r\n\r\n1768.\r\n\r\n[May to July 1768.]\r\n\r\nRIVER THAMES, Friday, May 27th, to Friday, July 29th.

The transactions of Each Day, both while we\r\nlay here and at Deptford, are inserted in the Log Book, and as they\r\ncontain nothing but common Occurrences, it was thought not necessary to\r\ninsert them here.\r\n\r\n[July to August 1768.]\r\n\r\nJuly 30th to August 7th.

P.M.\r\ngot up the spare Mainsail to dry, it being Wet by the Water getting into\r\nthe Sail room, occasioned by the Ship being very Leakey in her upper\r\nworks. At 5 a.m. loosed 2 Reefs out of each Topsail, and saw the Land,\r\nwhich we judged to be Cape Finister and Cape Ortugal. At 10 Tackt, being\r\nabout 4 miles off Shore, and stood to the North-West; at Noon, Cape\r\nOrtugal bore East by South, distance about 8 Leagues.

East-South-East 3 leagues.\r\n\r\nMonday, 5th. Light breezes and Calm all these 24 hours. At 2 p.m. had an\r\nObservation of the Sun and Moon, which gave the Longitude 8 degrees 42\r\nminutes West from Greenwich. At 6 Cape Finister bore South by West 1/2\r\nWest, 6 Leagues. Variation of the Compass per Azimuth 18 degrees 42\r\nminutes West. At Noon, Cape Finister South by East, distant 4 leagues;\r\nlatitude observed 43 degrees 4 minutes, therefore Cape Finister must lay\r\nin latitude 42 degrees 53 minutes North.* (* This is correct.) Wind\r\nWesterly, North-West, Calm.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 6th. Moderate breezes and Clear weather these 24 Hours. A.M.\r\nfound the Variation by the Mean of 5 Azimuth to be 21 degrees 40 minutes\r\nWest, 3 Degrees more than what it was found Yesterday, which I cannot\r\naccount for,* (* Cook, as all other navigators of his time, was unaware\r\nof the deviation of the compass caused by the iron of the ship.) as both\r\nObservations appeared to me to be equally well made. At 10.28 had an\r\nObservation of the sun and moon, which gave the Longitude 9 degrees 40\r\nminutes West from Greenwich. By this Observation Cape Finister must lay\r\nin 8 degrees 52 minutes, and by that made yesterday in 8 degrees 40\r\nminutes. The Mean of the two is 8 degrees 46 minutes West of Greenwich\r\nthe Longitude of the Cape,* (* The correct longitude is 9 degrees 15\r\nminutes West.) its latitude being 42 degrees 53 minutes North. Wind\r\nNorth-West; course South 42 degrees West; distance 70 miles; latitude 42\r\ndegrees 1 minute North, longitude 9 degrees 50 minutes West; at noon,\r\nCape Finister North 42 degrees East, 70 miles.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 7th.

The same Winds and weather Continue. Found the Variation to\r\nbe this Evening 18 degrees 54 minutes, and in the Morning 17 degrees 58\r\nminutes West, they both being the mean result of several good\r\nObservations. Wind North-East by East, North by East; course South 32\r\ndegrees West; distance 94 miles; latitude 34 degrees 1 minute North,\r\nlongitude 14 degrees 29 minutes West; at noon, Cape Finister North 26 1/2\r\ndegrees East, 198 leagues.\r\n\r\nMonday, 12th. Moderate breezes and fine Clear weather. At 6 a.m. the\r\nIsland of Porto Santo bore North-West by West, distance 9 or 10 leagues.\r\nHauld the Wind to the westward at noon, the Deserters extending from\r\nWest-South-West to South-West by South, the Body of Madeira West 1/2\r\nSouth, and Porto Santo North-North-West 1/2 West. Wind North-North-West;\r\ncourse South 40 degrees West; distance 102 miles; latitude 32 degrees 43\r\nminutes North, longitude 15 degrees 53 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 13th.

First part fine, Clear\r\nweather, remainder Cloudy, with Squals from the land, attended with\r\nShowers of rain. In the Night the Bend of the Hawsers of the Stream\r\nAnchor Slip'd owing to the Carelessness of the Person who made it fast.\r\nIn the Morning hove up the Anchor in the Boat and carried it out to the\r\nSouthward. In heaving the Anchor out of the Boat Mr. Weir, Master's Mate,\r\nwas carried overboard by the Buoy rope and to the Bottom with the Anchor.\r\nHove up the Anchor by the Ship as soon as possible, and found his Body\r\nintangled in the Buoy rope. Moor'd the Ship with the two Bowers in 22\r\nfathoms Water; the Loo Rock West and the Brazen Head East. Saild His\r\nMajesty's Ship Rose. The Boats employed carrying the Casks a Shore for\r\nWine, and the Caulkers caulking the Ship Sides. Wind Easterly.\r\n\r\nThursday, 15th. Squals of Wind from the Land, with rain the most part of\r\nthese 24 Hours. Received on board fresh Beef and Greens for the Ship's\r\nCompany, and sent on shore all our Casks for Wine and Water, having a\r\nShore Boat employed for that purpose. Wind North-East to South-East.\r\n\r\nFriday, 16th. The most part fine, Clear weather. Punished Henry Stevens,\r\nSeaman, and Thomas Dunster, Marine, with 12 lashes each, for refusing to\r\ntake their allowance of Fresh Beef. Employed taking on board Wine and\r\nWater. Wind Easterly.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 17th. Little wind, and fine Clear weather. Issued to the whole\r\nShip's Company 20 pounds of Onions per Man. Employed as Yesterday. Wind\r\nWesterly.\r\n\r\nSunday, 18th. Ditto Weather. P.M. received on board 270 pounds of fresh\r\nBeef, and a Live Bullock charged 613 pounds. Compleated our Wine and\r\nWater, having received of the former 3032 Gallons, of the Latter 10 Tuns.\r\nA.M. unmoor'd and prepar'd for Sailing. Funchall, in the Island of\r\nMadeira, by Observations made here by Dr. Eberton, F.R.S., lies in the\r\nlatitude of 32 degrees 33 minutes 33 seconds North and longitude West\r\nfrom Greenwich 16 degrees 49 minutes,* (* Modern determination is 32\r\ndegrees 38 minutes North, 16 degrees 54 minutes West.) the Variation of\r\nthe Compass 15 degrees 30 minutes West, decreasing as he says, which I\r\nmuch doubt;* (* Cook was right: the variation was increasing.) neither\r\ndoes this Variation agree with our own Observations. The Tides flow full,\r\nand Change North and South, and rise Perpendicular 7 feet at Spring Tides\r\nand 4 feet at Niep tides. We found the North point of the Diping Needle,\r\nbelonging to the Royal Society, to Dip 77 degrees 18 minutes. The\r\nRefreshments for Shipping to be got at this place are Wine, Water, Fruit\r\nof Several Sorts, and Onions in Plenty, and some Sweatmeats; but Fresh\r\nMeat and Poultry are very Dear, and not to be had at any rate without\r\nLeave from the Governour. Wind southerly, East-South-East, South-West.\r\n\r\n[Sailed from Madeira.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 19th. Light breezes and fine Clear weather. At Midnight Sailed\r\nfrom Funchall. At 8 a.m. the high land over it bore North 1/2 East.\r\nUnbent the Cables, stow'd the Anchors, and issued to the Ship's Company\r\n10 pounds of Onions per Man. Ship's Draught of Water, Fore 14 feet 8\r\ninches; Aft 15 feet 1 inch. Wind East-South-East; latitude 31 degrees 43\r\nminutes North; at noon, High land over Funchall North 7 degrees East, 49\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 20th. Light Airs and Clear weather. P.M. took several Azimuth,\r\nwhich gave the Variation 16 degrees 30 minutes West. Put the Ship's\r\nCompany to three Watches. Wind variable; course South 21 degrees 30\r\nminutes West; distance 28 miles; latitude 31 degrees 17 minutes,\r\nlongitude 17 degrees 19 minutes West; at noon, Funchall, Island of\r\nMadeira, North 13 degrees East, 76 miles.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 21st. First part light Airs, remainder fresh Breezes and Clear\r\nweather. Served Hooks and Lines to the Ship's Company, and employed them\r\nin the day in making Matts, etc., for the Rigging. Wind South-West to\r\nSouth-West by West; course South 60 degrees East; distance 60 miles;\r\nlatitude 30 degrees 46 minutes North, longitude 16 degrees 8 minutes\r\nSouth; at noon, Funchall North 10 degrees West, 113 miles.\r\n\r\nThursday, 22nd. Genteel breezes and Clear weather. At 4 p.m. saw the\r\nSalvages bearing South; at 6, the Body of the Island bore South 1/2 West,\r\ndistant about 5 leagues. Found the Variation of the Compass by an Azimuth\r\nto be 17 degrees 50 minutes West. At 10 the Isles of Salvages bore West\r\nby South 1/2 South, distance 2 leagues. I make those Islands to be in\r\nlatitude 30 degrees 11 minutes South, and South 16 degrees East, 58\r\nleagues from Funchall, Madeira. Wind South-West; course South 35 degrees\r\n30 minutes East; distance 73 miles; latitude 29 degrees 40 minutes North,\r\nlongitude 15 degrees 31 minutes West; at noon, Funchall North 21 degrees\r\nWest, 62 leagues.\r\n\r\nFriday, 23rd. Light breezes and Clear weather. At 6 a.m. saw the Peak of\r\nTeneriff bearing West by South 1/2 South, and the Grand Canaries South\r\n1/2 West. The Variation of the Compass from 17 degrees 22 minutes to 16\r\ndegrees 30 minutes, Wind South-West, North-East; course South 26 degrees\r\nWest; distance 54 miles; latitude 28 degrees 51 minutes North, longitude\r\n15 degrees 50 minutes West; at noon, Funchal North 12 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest, 77 leagues.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 24th. A fresh Breeze and Clear weather the most part of these\r\n24 Hours. I take this to be the North-East Trade we have now got into. At\r\n6 p.m. the North-East end of the Island of Teneriff West by North,\r\ndistance 3 or 4 Leagues. Off this North-East point lies some Rocks high\r\nabove the water. The highest is near the point, and very remarkable. By\r\nour run from Yesterday at Noon this end of the Island must lie in the\r\nlatitude of 28 degrees 27 minutes and South 7 degrees 45 minutes East,\r\ndistance 83 leagues from Funchal, and South 18 degrees West, 98 miles\r\nfrom the Salvages. At 1 a.m. the Peak of Teneriff bore West-North-West.\r\nFound the Variation to be this morning 16 degrees 14 minutes West. The\r\nPeak of Teneriff (from which I now take my departure) is a very high\r\nMountain upon the Island of the same name--one of the Canary Islands. Its\r\nperpendicular higth from Actual Measurement is said to be 15,396 feet.*\r\n(* The received height is 12,180 feet. Latitude 28 degrees 16 minutes\r\nNorth, Longitude 16 degrees 38 minutes West.) It lies in the Latitude of\r\n28 degrees 13 minutes North, and Longitude 16 degrees 32 minutes from\r\nGreenwich. Its situation in this respect is allowed to be pretty well\r\ndetermined. Wind North-East by East; latitude 27 degrees 10 minutes\r\nNorth; at noon Peak of Teneriff North 18 degrees 45 minutes, 74 miles.\r\n\r\nSunday, 25th. A Steady Trade Wind and Clear Weather. The Variation by the\r\nAmplitude this Evening was 14 degrees 58 minutes West. Wind East by\r\nNorth, East-North-East; course South 41 degrees West; distance 126 miles;\r\nlatitude 25 degrees 36 minutes North; at noon Peak of Teneriff North 33\r\ndegrees 15 minutes East, 61 leagues.\r\n\r\nMonday, 26th. Fresh breezes and somewhat Hazey. Variation by this Evening\r\nAmplitude 15 degrees 1 minute West. Wind North-East by East; course South\r\n22 degrees 15 minutes West; distance 122 miles; latitude 23 degrees 43\r\nminutes North; at noon Peak of Teneriff North 29 degrees East, 317 miles.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 27th. Ditto weather. Served Wine to the Ship's Company, the Beer\r\nbeing all Expended but 2 Casks, which I intend to keep some time Longer,\r\nas the whole has proved very good to the last Cask. At Noon found the\r\nShip by Observation 10 miles a Head of the Log, which I suppose may be\r\nowing to a Current setting in the same direction of the Trade Wind. Wind\r\nNorth-East; course South 19 degrees West; distance 145 miles; latitude 21\r\ndegrees 26 minutes North; at noon, Peak of Teneriff, North 26 degrees\r\nEast, 154 leagues.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 28th. A Fresh Trade wind and Hazey weather. The Variation of\r\nthe Compass by the mean of Several Azimuth taken this Evening 12 degrees\r\n46 minutes, and in the Morning by the same Method 12 degrees 43 minutes\r\nWest. This day's Log and Observed Latitude agree, which is not\r\nreconcilable to Yesterday. Exercised the People at Small Arms. Wind\r\nNorth-East, East-North-East; course South 12 degrees 30 minutes West;\r\ndistance 150 miles; latitude 18 degrees 59 minutes North; at noon, Peak\r\nof Teneriff North 23 degrees 15 minutes East, 204 leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 29th. Fresh breezes and Hazey weather. The Variation 12 degrees\r\n33 minutes West; the Observed Latitude ahead of that given by the Log 10\r\nmiles. Wind North-East by North; course South 14 degrees West; distance\r\n90 miles; latitude 17 degrees 32 minutes North; at noon Peak of Teneriff,\r\nNorth 33 degrees East, 236 leagues.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape de Verd Islands.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 30th. A Steady breeze and Pleasant weather. At 6 a.m. saw the\r\nIsland of Bonavista (one of the Cape de Verd islands), Extending from\r\nSouth by East to South-West by South, distance 3 or 4 Leagues. Ranged the\r\nEast side of this Island at the Distance of 3 or 4 miles from the Shore,\r\nuntil we were obliged to Haul Off to avoid a Ledge of Rocks which\r\nstretched out South-West by West from the Body or South-East Point of the\r\nIsland 1 1/2 leagues. Had no ground with 40 fathoms a Mile without this\r\nLedge. The Island of Bonavista is in Extent from North to South about 5\r\nleagues, is of a very uneven and hilly Surface, with low sandy beaches on\r\nthe East side. The South-East part of the Island, from which I take my\r\nDeparture, by an Observation this day at Noon lies in the latitude of 16\r\ndegrees North, and according to our run from Madeira in the longitude of\r\n21 degrees 51 minutes West from Greenwich, and South 21 degrees West; 260\r\nleagues from Tenerriff. Drawings Numbers 1 and 2 represent the appearance\r\nof the East side of this Island, where (2) is the South-East point, with\r\nthe hill over it, which is high, of a round Figure, and the southermost\r\non the Island. Wind North-East; course South 12 degrees 30 minutes West;\r\ndistance 97 miles; latitude 15 degrees 37 minutes North per observation;\r\nTeneriffe, North 20 degrees 43 minutes East, 262 1/3 leagues; at noon the\r\nhill on the South-East Point of the Island Bonavista North 69 degrees\r\nWest, distant from the shore 3 leagues.\r\n\r\n[October 1768.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, October 1st. A steady gale and somewhat Hazey. Variation by\r\nvery good Azimuths this Evening 10 degrees 37 minutes, and by the same in\r\nthe Morning 10 degrees 0 minutes West; at Noon found the ship a Head of\r\nthe Log 5 Miles. Wind North, North-North-East; course South 12 degrees 12\r\nminutes West; distance 114 miles; latitude 14 degrees 6 minutes North,\r\nlongitude 22 degrees 10 minutes West; at noon Island of Bonavista,\r\nSouth-East point, North 9 degrees West, 116 miles.\r\n\r\nSunday, 2nd. First part a Steady breeze and pleasant weather, remainder\r\nlight breezes and Cloudy. At noon found the Ship by Observation ahead of\r\nthe Log 7 miles. Wind North by East, North-North-West; course South 1\r\ndegree West; distance 92 miles; latitude 12 degrees 34 minutes North,\r\nlongitude 22 degrees 10 minutes West; at noon Bonavista, South-East\r\npoint, North 5 degrees 45 minutes East, 69 leagues.\r\n\r\nMonday, 3rd. Cloudy weather, with light winds and Calms. Variation by\r\nthis Evening Amplitude South 8 degrees 49 minutes West. A.M. hoisted out\r\na Boat to try if there was any Current; found one setting to the\r\nSouth-East at the rate of 3/4 of a Mile per hour. Wind North, calm,\r\nSouth-South-West 1/2 West; course South 3 degrees 30 minutes East;\r\ndistance 20 miles; latitude 12 degrees 14 minutes North, longitude 22\r\ndegrees 10 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 5\r\ndegrees East, 76 leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 4th. Calm for the Greatest part of the 24 Hours. By an\r\nObservation we had this Morning of the Sun and Moon found our Selves in\r\nthe Longitude of 22 degrees 32 minutes 30 seconds West from Greenwich;\r\nthat by account is 21 degrees 58 minutes, the Difference being 34 miles\r\nWesterly, which does not agree with the Setting of the Current, for\r\nhaving try'd it twice to-day and found it set to the East-South-East 1\r\nMile per Hour, and at the same time found the Ship to the Southward of\r\nthe Log by the Noon Observation 10 miles. Served Portable soup and Sour\r\nkroutt to the Ship's Company. Wind variable; course South 53 degrees\r\nWest; distance 17 miles; latitude 11 degrees 53 minutes North, longitude\r\n22 degrees 33 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 2\r\ndegrees East, 82 leagues.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 5th. Light breezes of Wind, sometimes Clear and sometimes\r\nCloudy weather. Variation 6 degrees 10 minutes West by an Amplitude and\r\nAzimuth this evening. At noon found the Ship by the Observed Latitude 7\r\nMiles to the Southward of the Log, and by the Observed Longitude 30\r\ndegrees to the Eastward of Yesterday's Observations; and as these\r\nObservations for finding the Longitude (if carefully observed with good\r\nInstrument) will generally come within 10 or 15 Miles of each other, and\r\nvery often much nearer, it therefore can be no longer in Doubt but that\r\nthere is a Current setting to the Eastward;* (* This was the Counter\r\nEquatorial Current.) yet we cannot have had this Current long, because\r\nthe Longitude by account and that by Observation agree to-day, but\r\nYesterday she was 28 miles to the Westward of the Observation. Wind calm,\r\nNorth-East, East; course South 29 degrees East; distance 57 miles;\r\nlatitude 10 degrees 56 minutes North, longitude 22 degrees 3 minutes\r\nWest; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 2 degrees East, 101\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 6th. First part light Breezes and Cloudy; Middle frequent heavy\r\nSqualls, with rain, till towards Noon when we had again little wind.\r\nFound the Variation by the mean of 3 Azimuth, taken this Morning, to be 8\r\ndegrees 52 minutes West, which makes the Variation found Yesterday\r\ndoubtful. Wind North-East, South-East, Southerly; course South 10 degrees\r\n30 minutes West; distance 77 miles; latitude 9 degrees 40 minutes North,\r\nlongitude 22 degrees 28 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East\r\npoint, North 4 degrees East, 128 leagues.\r\n\r\nFriday, 7th. Variable light Airs and Calm all these 24 Hours. At Noon\r\nfound the Current to set South-East 1/4 South one Mile per hour, and yet\r\nby Observation at Noon I find the Ship 12 Miles to the Northward of\r\nAccount, a Circumstance that hath not hapned for many days, and which I\r\nbelieve to be owing to the heavy Squalls we had Yesterday from the\r\nSouth-East, which obliged us to put frequently before the Wind. Wind\r\nSoutherly, calm, Northerly; course South 5 degrees West; distance 10\r\nmiles; latitude 9 degrees 42 minutes North, longitude 22 degrees 19\r\nminutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 4 degrees East,\r\n127 leagues.\r\n\r\n[Between Cape de Verd Islands and Equator.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 8th. First part, light Airs and Clear weather; Middle, Squally,\r\nwith Thunder and Lightning all round; latter part, Moderate breezes and\r\nClear weather. Had several Azimuths both in the Evening and Morning,\r\nwhich gave the Variation South 8 degrees 30 minutes West. At Noon found\r\nby Observation that the Ship had outrun the Log 20 Miles, a Proof that\r\nthere is a Current setting to the Southward. Wind North-East by North to\r\nEast-South-East; course South by East; distance 78 miles; latitude 8\r\ndegrees 25 minutes North, longitude 22 degrees 4 minutes West; at noon,\r\nBonavista, South-East point, North 1 degree 45 minutes East, 152 leagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 9th. Light Airs and fine Clear weather. Found the Variation by a\r\ngreat Number of Azimuth made this Afternoon to be 8 degrees 21 minutes 30\r\nseconds West, and by the Morning Amplitude 7 degrees 48 minutes. At Noon\r\ntry'd the Current, and found it set North-North-West 3/4 West, 1 1/8\r\nmiles per hour. The Shifting of the Current was conformed by the Observed\r\nLatitude Wind East-South-East; course South 16 degrees West; distance 29\r\nmiles; latitude 7 degrees 58 minutes North, longitude 22 degrees 13\r\nminutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 2 degrees 40\r\nminutes, 161 leagues.\r\n\r\nMonday, 10th. First part, light breezes and Clear weather; Middle,\r\nsqually, with heavy Showers of Rain; latter, Variable, light Airs and\r\nCalm and dark gloomy weather. At 3 p.m. found the Current to set\r\nNorth-North-East 1/4 East, 1 1/4 Mile per Hour, and at Noon found it to\r\nset North-East 3/4 North at the same rate, and the Variation to be 8\r\ndegrees 39 minutes West by the Mean of Several Azimuth. Wind South-East\r\nby East, Southerly; course South; distance 10 miles; latitude 7 degrees\r\n48 minutes North; longitude 22 degrees 13 minutes West; at noon,\r\nBonavista, South-East point, North 3 degrees East, 164 leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 11th. Very Variable weather, with frequent Squalls rain, and\r\nLightning. By the Observed Latitude at Noon I find the Ship hath only\r\nmade 22 Miles Southing since the last Observation two days ago, whereas\r\nthe Log gives 55 Miles, a Proof that there is a Current setting to the\r\nNorthward. Wind South-East; course South 52 degrees West; distance 18\r\nmiles; latitude 7 degrees 36 minutes North, longitude 22 degrees 8\r\nminutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 3 degrees East,\r\n168 leagues.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 12th. Much the same weather as Yesterday the first part, the\r\nremainder mostly Calm and cloudy weather. A.M. try'd the Current and\r\nfound it set South by West 1/4 West, 1/2 Mile per Hour, which is not\r\nagreeable to yesterday's remark. Wind variable; course South 33 degrees\r\n30 minutes West; distance 20 miles; latitude 7 degrees 21 minutes North,\r\nlongitude 22 degrees 39 minutes West; at noon Bonavista North 5 degrees\r\nEast, 174 leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 13th. Light Airs of Wind, with some heavy showers of rain.\r\nVariation by Azimuth and Amplitude this Evening 8 degrees 46 minutes\r\nWest. At Noon try'd the Current, and found it set South 3/4 East, 1/3 of\r\na Mile per Hour; but finding the Observation and Log agree, I am\r\ninclinable to think it hath had no effect upon the Ship. Wind South-West,\r\nWest-South-West; course South 16 degrees 45 minutes East; distance 21\r\nmiles; latitude 7 degrees 1 minute North, longitude 22 degrees 32 minutes\r\nWest; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 5 degrees East, 181\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nFriday, 14th. Dark, gloomy weather, with much rain, the Wind Variable\r\nfrom West-South-West to South-South-East, sometimes on one Tack and\r\nsometimes on the other. Wind West-South-West to South-South-East; course\r\nSouth 5 degrees East; distance 24 miles; latitude 6 degrees 38 minutes\r\nNorth, longitude 22 degrees 30 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista,\r\nSouth-East point, North 3 degrees 15 minutes, 188 leagues.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 15th. First part, little wind and Cloudy; Middle, Squally, with\r\nrain; latter part, light Airs and Clear weather. A little before Noon\r\ntook several Observations of the sun and moon, the mean result of which\r\ngave the Longitude to be 23 degrees 46 minutes West from Greenwich, which\r\nis 1 degree 22 minutes more Westerly than that by account carried on from\r\nthe last Observation; and the Observed Latitude is 24 Miles more\r\nNortherly than the Log since the Last Observation 2 days ago, all of\r\nwhich shows that the North-Westerly Current hath prevailed for this some\r\nDays past. Wind South-South-West to South-East; course South 30 degrees\r\nEast per log; distance 12 miles; latitude 6 degrees 50 minutes North;\r\nlongitude 22 degrees 23 minutes West per account, 23 degrees 46 minutes\r\nper sun and moon; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North by East,\r\n187 leagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 16th. First part Calm, the remainder Gentle breezes and fine,\r\nPleasant weather. At 3 hours 30 minutes 39 seconds Apparent time p.m. the\r\nobserved distance of the sun and moon's nearest Limb was 52 degrees 42\r\nminutes 30 seconds; the Altitude of the sun's lower limb 32 degrees 39\r\nminutes; the Altitude of the moon's lower limb 58 degrees 36 minutes; the\r\nlongitude of the Ship from the aforegoing Observations 23 degrees 33\r\nminutes 33 seconds West from Greenwich, differing 13 minutes from those\r\nmade this Morning or Yesterday, the Ship laying all the time becalmed.\r\nVariation of the Compass 8 degrees 45 minutes West. Wind South-East,\r\nvariable, North-East; course South 2 degrees East; distance 72 miles;\r\nlatitude 5 degrees 38 minutes North, longitude 23 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 5 degrees 15 minutes\r\nEast, 208 leagues.\r\n\r\nMonday, 17th. Variable, light Airs and Calm clear weather. 1/2 past 1\r\np.m. took two Distances of the sun and moon, the first of which gave the\r\nLongitude 23 degrees 45 minutes 56 seconds, and the last 23 degrees 44\r\nminutes West, the difference being not quite two miles, which shows how\r\nnear to one another these observations can be made. Wind South,\r\nSouth-East, variable; course South by West 1/2 West; distance 11 miles;\r\nlatitude 5 degrees 17 minutes North, longitude 23 degrees 47 minutes\r\nWest; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 5 degrees 15 minutes\r\nEast, 212 leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 18th. Sometimes little wind, sometimes Squally, with rain and\r\nLightning.

Fresh breezes and Cloudy weather. The Observed Latitude\r\nto the Northward of that given by the Log 9 miles, which I suppose must\r\nbe owing to a Current. Wind South by East to South-East by South; course\r\nSouth 42 degrees West; distance 88 miles; latitude 3 degrees 44 minutes\r\nNorth, longitude 25 degrees 23 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista,\r\nSouth-East point, North 14 degrees East, 253 leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 20th. A Genteel gale and Clear weather. At a little before 5\r\np.m. had an Observation of the sun and moon, which gave the Longitude 25\r\ndegrees 46 minutes West from Greenwich, which is more Westerly than that\r\nby account carried on from the last Observation; and the Observed\r\nlatitude being again to the Northward shows that there must be a current\r\nsetting between the North and West. Wind South by East to South-East by\r\nSouth; course South 52 degrees West; distance 48 miles; latitude 3\r\ndegrees 16 minutes North, longitude 26 degrees 20 minutes West; at noon,\r\nBonavista, North 18 degrees 30 minutes East, 270 leagues.\r\n\r\n[Crossing Equator.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 21st. A moderate breeze, and for the most part clear weather.\r\nLongitude per the Mean of 2 Observations of the sun and moon made at 4\r\nhours 45 minutes and at 4 hours 54 minutes p.m., 26 degrees 33 minutes\r\nWest. Variation of the Compass 4 degrees 7 minutes West, and the Observed\r\nLatitude at Noon to the Northward of the Log 7 Miles.

At Noon by Observation found the Ship 11 Miles\r\nahead of the Log. Wind South by East to South-East by South; course South\r\n49 degrees West; distance 50 miles; latitude 1 degree 7 minutes North;\r\nlongitude 28 degrees 50 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East\r\npoint, North 25 degrees East, 328 leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 25th. A Genteel breeze and Clear weather, with a Moist Air. Soon\r\nafter sunrise found the Variation of the Compass to be 2 degrees 24\r\nminutes West, being the Mean result of several very good Azimuths. This\r\nwas just before we crossed the Line in the Longitude of 29 degrees 29\r\nminutes West from Greenwich. We also try'd the Diping Needle belonging to\r\nthe Royal Society, and found the North point to Dip 26 degrees below the\r\nHorizon; but this Instrument cannot be used at Sea to any great degree of\r\naccuracy on account of the Motion of the Ship, which hinders the Needle\r\nfrom resting. However, as the Ship was pretty steady, and by means of a\r\nSwinging Table I had made for that purpose, we could be Certain of the\r\nDip to two Degrees at most. The Observed Latitude and that by account\r\nnearly Agree. Wind South-East to South-East by East; course South 30\r\ndegrees West; distance 95 miles; latitude 0 degrees 15 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 29 degrees 30 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East\r\npoint, North 26 degrees East, 358 leagues.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 26th. First part light Airs and Cloudy weather, the remainder\r\na Moderate Breeze and Cloudy. After we had got an observation, and it was\r\nno longer Doubted that we were to the Southward of the Line, the Ceremony\r\non this occasion practis'd by all Nations was not Omitted. Every one that\r\ncould not prove upon the Sea Chart that he had before Crossed the Line\r\nwas either to pay a Bottle of Rum or be Duck'd in the Sea, which former\r\ncase was the fate of by far the Greatest part on board; and as several of\r\nthe Men chose to be Duck'd, and the weather was favourable for that\r\npurpose, this Ceremony was performed on about 20 or 30, to the no small\r\nDiversion of the Rest. Wind South-East to South-South-East; course South\r\n31 degrees West; distance 77 miles; latitude 1 degree 21 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 30 degrees 18 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East\r\npoint, North 25 degrees 30 minutes East, 385 leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 27th. Fresh Gales and Close Cloudy weather. Variation 2 degrees\r\n48 minutes West. Wind South-South-East to South-East; course South 38\r\ndegrees 15 minutes West; distance 79 miles; latitude 2 degrees 23 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 31 degrees 7 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista,\r\nSouth-East point, North 26 degrees East, 410 leagues.\r\n\r\nFriday, 28th. Fresh Breeze and fine Clear weather. At a little past 1\r\na.m. Longitude in by the 3 following Observations--viz., by the Moon and\r\nthe star Arietis, 32 degrees 27 minutes; by the Moon and Pollux, 32\r\ndegrees 0 minutes 15 seconds; by ditto, 31 degrees 48 minutes 32 seconds;\r\nthe mean of the whole is 32 degrees 5 minutes 16 seconds West from\r\nGreenwich, which is 31 minutes more Westerly than the longitude by\r\naccount carried on since the last Observation. The two first observations\r\nwere made and computed by Mr. Green, and the last by myself. The star\r\nArietis was on one side of the Moon and Pollux on the other. This day at\r\nNoon, being nearly in the latitude of the Island Ferdinand Noronha, to\r\nthe Westward of it by some Charts and to the Eastward by others, was in\r\nExpectation of seeing it or some of those Shoals that are laid down in\r\nmost Charts between it and the Main; but we saw neither one nor a Nother.\r\nWe certainly passed to the Eastward of the Island, and as to the Shoals,\r\nI don't think they Exhist, grounding this my Opinion on the Journal of\r\nsome East India Ships I have seen who were detain'd by Contrary winds\r\nbetween this Island and the Main, and being 5 or 6 Ships in Company,\r\ndoubtless must have seen some of them did they lay as Marked in the\r\nCharts.* (* There is a very dangerous reef, As Rocas, 80 miles west of\r\nFernando Noronha. The Endeavour passed 60 miles east of latter.) Wind\r\nSouth-East to South-East by East; course South 33 degrees West; distance\r\n93 miles, latitude 3 degrees 41 minutes South, longitude 32 degrees 29\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 29th. Fresh Breezes and pleasant weather. Variation of the\r\nCompass 2 degrees 25 minutes West. Wind East-South-East; course South by\r\nWest; distance 101 miles; latitude 5 degrees 25 minutes South, longitude\r\n32 degrees 48\" West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 30th. A Steady breeze, and for the most part close cloudy\r\nweather. Variation by several Azimuths 1 degree 31 minutes West. At noon\r\nthe observed latitude 7 miles southward of account. Wind East-South-East;\r\ncourse South 3/4 West; distance 107 miles; latitude 7 degrees 8 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 33 degrees 4 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 31st. A Fresh breeze and Clear weather. Variation 0 degrees 15\r\nminutes West. Observed Latitude again to the Southward of the Log. Wind\r\nEast to East-South-East; course, South 1/2 West; distance 114 miles;\r\nlatitude 9 degrees 1 minute South, longitude 33 degrees 16 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[November 1768. Between Equator and Rio.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, November 1st. Moderate breezes, for the most part Cloudy.\r\nVariation by the mean of Several Azimuths 0 degrees 58 minutes West in\r\nthe Evening, and in the Morning found it to be 0 degrees 18 minutes West.\r\nWind East-South-East; course South 3/4 West; distance 98 miles; latitude\r\n10 degrees 38 minutes South.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 2nd. A Steady breeze and fine pleasant weather. This\r\nAfternoon, by the mean of Several Azimuths and the Amplitude, found the\r\nVariation to be 0 degrees 34 minutes East, from which it appears that\r\nabout the aforegoing Noon we have Crossed the Line of no Variation in the\r\nLatitude of 10 degrees 38 minutes South, and, according to the following\r\nObservations, in 32 degrees 0 minutes West longitude from Greenwich. At 5\r\nhours 5 minutes 0 seconds Apparent time a.m. the longitude of the Ship\r\nand the Observation of the moon and the star Aldebaran was found to be 32\r\ndegrees 0 minutes 45 seconds; at 8 hours 17 minutes 0 seconds, per sun\r\nand moon, 32 degrees 25 minutes 0 seconds; and at 9 hours 0 minutes 16\r\nseconds, 32 degrees 19 minutes 0 seconds. The mean of the three is 32\r\ndegrees 14 minutes 55 seconds. And again at 7 hours 12 minutes 52\r\nseconds, per sun and moon, 32 degrees 10 minutes 4 seconds; and at 7\r\nhours 19 minutes 42 seconds, per sun and moon, 32 degrees 15 minutes 20\r\nseconds. The mean of these two is 32 degrees 12 minutes 42 seconds, and\r\nthe mean of the whole is 32 degrees 13 minutes 43 seconds West from\r\nGreenwich, which is less by a whole Degree than that by account, which is\r\na Considerable Error to be made in 5 Days in these low Latitudes. One\r\nwould think from this that we must have had a Current setting to the\r\nEastward, which is not likely that it should set against the settled\r\ntrade wind. The 3 first of these Observations were made by Mr. Green, and\r\nthe 2 last by myself. Wind East-South-East, South; course South by West;\r\ndistance 132 miles; latitude 12 degrees 48 minutes South, longitude 32\r\ndegrees 20 minutes West per Observation.\r\n\r\nThursday, 3rd. A Fresh Trade wind and fair weather. Variation per Azimuth\r\nthis Evening 0 degrees 47 minutes East, and at a little past 9 a.m.\r\nlongitude in per sun and moon 33 degrees 0 minutes West of Greenwich.\r\nWind East by South-East; course South 15 degrees West; distance 128\r\nmiles; latitude 14 degrees 51 minutes South, longitude 33 degrees 7\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 4th. A Steady Gale and fair weather. P.M. Variation per Azimuth 1\r\ndegree 29 minutes West, ditto 1 degree 28 minutes West, and by the\r\nAmplitude 1 degree 12 minutes West; mean 1 degree 23 minutes West, by\r\nwhich it appears that we have again Crossed the Line of no Variation. At\r\n1/2 past 9 a.m. the longitude of the Ship, per Observation of the sun and\r\nmoon, 33 degrees 26 minutes 30 seconds. Wind East by South; course South\r\n19 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 125 miles; latitude 16 degrees 49\r\nminutes South, longitude 33 degrees 37 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 5th. Fine pleasant weather. Variation per Azimuth this morning\r\n3 degrees 21 minutes East, which makes me Doubtful of the Variation found\r\nyesterday, tho' at the time I had not the least room to doubt of the\r\nAccuracy of the Observations. Longitude per Observation 34 degrees 43\r\nminutes 30 seconds West. Wind East to North-East; course South 30 degrees\r\n35 minutes West; distance 109 miles; latitude 18 degrees 22 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 34 degrees 50 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 6th. First and Latter part squally, with heavy Showers of rain;\r\nmiddle moderate and fair. I now determined to put into Rio de Janeiro in\r\npreferance to any other port in Brazil or Falkland Islands, for at this\r\nplace I knew we could recruit our Stock of Provisions, several Articles\r\nof which I found we should in time be in want of, and at the same time\r\nprocure Live Stock and refreshment for the People; and from the reception\r\nformer Ships had met with here I doubted not but we should be well\r\nreceived. Wind North-North-East, variable, South; course South 55 degrees\r\nWest; distance 74 miles; latitude 19 degrees 3 minutes South, longitude\r\n35 degrees 50 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 7th. Moderate breezes and Clear weather. P.M. found the Variation\r\nto be 4 degrees 49 minutes East. At 6 Sounded and had 32 fathoms Water;\r\nthe Bottom Coral Rocks, fine Sand and Shells, which Soundings we carried\r\nupon a South-West 1/2 West Course 9 or 10 leagues, and then had no ground\r\nwith 100 fathom. We were by our account and per run afterwards 54 Leagues\r\nEast from the Coast of Brazil and to the Southward of the Shoals called\r\nAbrollos, as they are laid down in Most Charts. Wind South-East to\r\nNorth-East; course South 58 degrees West; distance 68 miles; latitude 19\r\ndegrees 46 minutes South, longitude 36 degrees 50 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 8th. Fresh breezes and Cloudy weather. P.M. variation by the\r\nMean of 12 Azimuths 5 degrees 26 minutes East, and by an Amplitude in the\r\nMorning 7 degrees 52 minutes. At 6 a.m. saw the Land of Brazil bearing\r\nNorth-West 1/2 North, distance 8 or 10 leagues. At 8 Sounded, had 37\r\nfathoms, Coarse Sand, broken Shells, and Coral Rocks. At 9 brought too\r\nand Spoke with a Fishing Boat, who informed us that the land in sight lay\r\nto the Southward of Santo Espiritu. It appears high and Mountainous; the\r\ndrawing Number (3) exhibits a View of this Land as it appeared from the\r\nShip (A), being near to Santo Espiritu, and a remarkable hill (B) bore\r\nNorth-West 1/2 North, distance 7 or 8 leagues. Made Sail in Shore, the\r\nwind being Southerly. Had from the above Depth to 14 fathoms the same\r\nsort of Bottom. Found the Ship at Noon by Observation 10 Miles to the\r\nSouthward of account, which I suppose to be occasioned by a Current\r\nsetting between the South and West. Wind North-North-East, North by West,\r\nSouth-South-West to South by West; course South 50 degrees West; distance\r\n140 miles; latitude 21 degrees 16 minutes South, longitude 37 degrees 35\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 9th. First and Latter part Hazey, with a Moderate Breeze;\r\nMiddle, fresh Gales, with Thunder, Lightning, and rain. At 3 p.m. tack't\r\nin 16 fathoms, distance from the Shore 5 Leagues, the land Extending from\r\nthe North-West by West to North-East. At 5 took the 2nd Reef in the\r\nTopsails and got down Topgallant Yards, stood to the South-East until\r\nMidnight, then tack'd, Sounding from 16 to 55 fathoms. At 8 a.m. Loosed\r\nthe Reefs out of the Topsails and got Topgallant Yards a Cross; unstowed\r\nthe Anchors and bent the Cables. At Noon Latitude Observed 21 degrees 29\r\nminutes South, the Land Extending from South-West by South to\r\nNorth-North-West, distance 4 leagues, Soundings from 55 to 10 fathoms.\r\nWind South-South-East, South-South-West, South; course South 62 degrees\r\n15 minutes West; distance 28 miles; latitude 21 degrees 29 minutes South.\r\n\r\n[Nearing Rio Janeiro.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 10th. Moderate breezes and Hazey upon the Land. Stood in for\r\nthe Shore South-West 1/2 West. Depth of water from 10 to 9 fathoms and\r\nfrom 9 to 16 fathoms, being then 4 Leagues from the Land. From 16 fathoms\r\nit shoalded gradually to 5 fathoms; then we tacked, being about 1 1/2\r\nLeagues from the Shore. The extreams of the Land to the Southward, which\r\nwe took for Cape St. Thomas, bore South 3/4 West, distance 4 leagues. The\r\nLand from Cape St. Thomas to the Northward lies North by East 1/2 East.\r\nAlong the Shore is low land covered with Wood and Sandy Beaches, but\r\ninland are very high Mountains, the greatest part of them being hid in\r\nthe Clouds. Stood off until 5 in the Morning East and East by South.\r\nDepth of Water 10, 20, 16, 23, and 30 fathoms. At Noon Latitude Observed\r\n21 degrees 30 minutes; Depth of Water 14 fathoms; Grey sand with black\r\nSpecks. Extreams of the Land from South-West by West to North-North-West;\r\ndistance 12 or 14 leagues. Wind South-South-East, South-East by South,\r\nSouth by East; course East 1/4 South; distance 17 miles; latitude 21\r\ndegrees 30 minutes South, longitude 37 degrees 43 minutes West per\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nFriday, 11th. First and Latter parts, moderate breezes and fair, but\r\nCloudy and Hazey over the Land; middle, a fresh breeze and Cloudy. At 8\r\ntack'd and Stood to the North-East. Extream of the Land to the southward,\r\nwhich we took for Cape St. Thomas, South-West 1/2 South; distance 5 or 6\r\nleagues; Depth of Water 13 fathoms, Grey sand. At 11 a.m. tack'd in 14\r\nfathoms and Stood to the South-South-East, and at 3 a.m. Stood over a\r\nShoal or Bank of 6 fathoms, afterwards the Depth increased to 30 fathoms,\r\nat Noon in 36 fathoms. Latitude Observed 22 degrees 37 minutes South,\r\nwhich is 10 miles to the Southward of the Log. No Land in sight. Wind\r\nSouth-East to East; course South 5 degrees West; distance 67 miles;\r\nlatitude 23 degrees 37 minutes South, longitude 37 degrees 49 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 12th. Genteel breezes and fine Clear weather. At 2 p.m.\r\nSounded, but had no ground with 38 fathoms, and soon after sounded and\r\nhad none at 50 fathoms, from which it appears that we are to the\r\nSouthward of the Bank we have been upon this 2 days past. It Extends off\r\nfrom the Land between the Latitude 21 degrees and 22 degrees nor less\r\nthan 18 or 20 Leagues, How much farther I know not. Standing in from Sea,\r\nthe Depth of Water very soon diminisheth from 30 to 20 and 17 fathoms,\r\nafterwards gradually from 9, 8 and even to 6 fathoms; but between this\r\nShoal Water and the Main, which is 6 or 7 leagues, you will have 10, 12\r\nand even 16 fathoms, till you come within 2 or 3 leagues of the Shore.\r\nThe Bottom is of Various kinds, sometimes Coral Rocks, Coral Rocks and\r\nbroken Shells, Coarse sand and broken Shells, Small Stones and at other\r\ntimes fine Sand varying at almost every Cast of the Lead. At 5 p.m. saw\r\nthe Land bearing North-West by West 1/2 West, distance 10 or 12 leagues,\r\nwhich proved to be the Island of Cape Frio; it appeared in two Hillocks,\r\nand from the Deck looked like two Islands. Took several Azimuth of the\r\nSun, which gave the Variation 6 degrees 40 minutes East. At 8 a.m. the\r\nIsle of Cape Frio bore West by North 4 leagues. This Island is situated\r\nin the Latitude of 23 degrees 2 minutes South, and according to our\r\nReckoning in the Longitude of 38 degrees 45 minutes West from Greenwich,\r\nbut from many Circumstances I have good reason to think that our\r\nreckoning is wrong and that it lies in the Longitude 41 degrees 10\r\nminutes West. It is not of a Large Circuit, but Tolerable high, with a\r\nhollow in the Middle, which makes it look like 2 Islands when it first\r\nmakes its appearance out of the Water. It lays not far from the Main,\r\nwhich with the Island forms a right Angle, one side trending North and\r\nthe other West. To the northward of the Island and between it and the\r\nMain there appears to lay several smaller Islands near each other. The\r\nMain land on the Sea Coast appears to be low, but inland are high\r\nMountains. Drawing Number 4 exhibits a View of this Island when it bore\r\nWest-North-West, distance 4 leagues. Wind North-East, East-North-East;\r\ncourse South 60 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 59 miles; latitude 23\r\ndegrees 6 minutes South; Isle of Cape Frio North 60 degrees East, 4\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 13th. First and Latter parts a Genteel Sea breeze and Clear\r\nweather, the Middle Calm. P.M. standing along Shore for Rio De Janeiro\r\nobserved that the land on the Sea Coast is high and Mountainous, and the\r\nshore forms some small Bays or Coves wherein are Sandy Beaches. At 8\r\nShortned Sail; the Sugar Loaf Hill at the West Entrance to Rio De Janeiro\r\nWest-North-West, distant 4 or 5 leagues, at the same time was abreast of\r\n2 Small rocky Islands, that lie about 4 Miles from the Shore. At 9 a.m.\r\nSprung up a light breeze at South-East, at which time we made Sail for\r\nthe Harbour, and sent the Pinnace with a Lieutenant before us up to the\r\ncity of Rio De Janeiro, to acquaint the Vice Roy with the reason that\r\ninduced us to put in here, which was to procure Water and other\r\nrefreshments, and to desire the Assistance of a Pilot to bring us into\r\nproper Anchoring ground; at Noon Standing in for the Harbour.\r\n\r\n[At Rio Janeiro.]\r\n\r\nARRIVAL AT RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday, 14th. Moderate Sea and Low breezes and\r\nfine pleasant weather. At 5 p.m. Anchored in 5 fathoms just above the\r\nIsle of Cobras, which lies before the City of Rio De Janeiro. A little\r\nbefore we Anchor'd the Pinnace return'd and informed me that the Vice Roy\r\nhad thought proper to detain the Officer until I went ashore. Soon after\r\nwe Anchored a Boat came on board bringing several of the Vice Roy's\r\nOfficers, who asked many Questions in respect to the Ship: Cargo, from\r\nwhence she came, Number of Guns, Men, etc., all of which was Answered to\r\ntheir satisfaction. They told me it was the Custom of the Port to Detain\r\nthe first Officer that came from any Ship on her first Arrival until a\r\nBoat from the Vice Roy had Visited her; that my Officer would be sent on\r\nboard as soon as they got on shore, which was accordingly done. About\r\nthis time a Boat filled with Soldiers kept rowing about the Ship, which\r\nhad orders, as I afterwards understood, not to Suffer any one of the\r\nOfficers or Gentlemen, except myself, to go out of the Ship. In the\r\nMorning I waited upon the Vice Roy and obtained leave to purchase\r\nProvisions, Refreshments, etc., for the Ship, but obliged me to employ a\r\nperson to buy them for me under a pretence that it was the Custom of the\r\nPlace, and he likewise insisted (notwithstanding all I could say to the\r\ncontrary), on putting a Soldier into the Boats that brought anything to\r\nor from the Ship, alledging that it was the Orders of his Court, and they\r\nwere such as he could not Dispence with, and this indignity I was obliged\r\nto submit to, otherwise I could not have got the supplys I wanted; being\r\nwilling, as much as in me lay, to avoid all manner of Disputes that might\r\ncause the least delay, and at the same time to Convince him that we did\r\nnot come here to Trade, as I believe he imagined--for he Certainly did\r\nnot believe a word about our being bound to the Southward to observe the\r\nTransit of Venus, but looked upon it only as an invented story to cover\r\nsome other design we must be upon, for he could form no other Idea of\r\nthat Phenomenon (after I had explained it to him), than the North Star\r\nPassing through the South Pole; these were his own words. He would not\r\npermit the Gentlemen to reside ashore during our Stay here, nor permit\r\nMr. Banks to go into the country to gather plants, etc.; but not the\r\nleast hint was given me at this time that no one of the Gentlemen was to\r\ncome out of the Ship but myself, or that I was to be put under a Guard\r\nwhen I did come; but this I was soon Convinced of after I took my leave\r\nof His Excellency and found that an Officer was to attend upon me\r\nwhereever I went, which at first the Vice Roy pretended was only meant as\r\na Complement, and to order me all the Assistance I wanted. This day the\r\nPeople were Employed in unbending the Sails, in fitting and rigging the\r\nSpare Topmasts in the room of the others, and getting on shore Empty\r\nWater Casks.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 15th. Fine pleasant weather. Received on board fresh Beef and\r\nGreens for the Ship's Company, with which they was served every Day\r\nDuring our Stay here. Got all the Empty Casks on shore, and set the\r\nCoopers to Work to repair them; Heeld and Boot Topt the Starboard side.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 16th. Set up the Forge to repair the Iron Work; the People\r\nemployed in Heeling and Boot Topping the Larboard side, Blacking the\r\nYards, etc.\r\n\r\nThursday, 17th. Set some People to repair the Sails and the Caulkers to\r\nCaulk the Ship; the rest of the People employed in the Hold and about the\r\nRigging. For 3 days past I have remonstrated to the Vice Roy and his\r\nOfficers against his putting a Guard into my Boat, thinking I could not\r\nAnswer it to the Admiralty the tamely submitting to such a Custom, which,\r\nwhen practiced in its full force, must bring Disgrace to the British\r\nFlag. On the other hand, I was loath to enter into Disputes, seeing how\r\nmuch I was like to be delay'd and imbarrassed in getting the supplys I\r\nwanted, for it was with much difficulty that I obtained leave for one of\r\nmy People to attend the Market to buy necessaries for my Table and to\r\nassist the Agent to buy the things for the Ship. Having gained this Point\r\nand settled everything with the Agent in regard to what was wanting for\r\nthe Ship, I resolved, rather than be made a Prisoner in my own Boat, not\r\nto go any more ashore unless I could do it without having a Soldier put\r\ninto the Boat, as had hitherto been done; and thinking that the Vice Roy\r\nmight lay under some Mistake, which on proper Application might be\r\nclear'd up, I therefore drew up a Memorial stating the whole case and\r\nsent to the Vice Roy this afternoon; and thus a Paper War commenced\r\nbetween me and His Excellency, wherein I had no other Advantage than the\r\nracking his invention to find reasons for treating us in the manner he\r\ndid, for he never would relax the least from any one point.\r\n\r\nFriday, 18th. This day I received an Answer to my Memorial, wherein he\r\ntells me, amongst other things, that if I think it hard submitting to the\r\nCustoms of this Port I may leave it when I please; but this did not suit\r\nmy purpose at present, but I resolved to make my stay as short as\r\npossible. I must own that the Memorial of the Vice Roy's was well drawn\r\nup and very much to the Purpose, which is more than I can say of any of\r\nthe subsequent ones.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 19th. Close cloudy weather. Employed getting aboard Rum, Water,\r\nand other necessaries. Caulking and refitting the Ship. Punished John\r\nThurman, Seaman, with 12 Lashes for refusing to assist the Sailmaker in\r\nrepairing the Sails.\r\n\r\nSunday, 20th. First part cloudy weather; the Middle very hard Storms of\r\nWind and Rain; the Latter moderate, with rain. This Afternoon sent\r\nLieutenant Hicks in the Pinnace with an Answer to the Vice Roy's\r\nMemorial, with orders not to Suffer a Soldier to be put into the Boat;\r\nupon which the Guard Boat attended him to the Landing Place and reported\r\nit to the Vice Roy, who refused to receive the Memorial, and ordered Mr.\r\nHicks on board Again; but in the Meantime they had put a Guard into the\r\nBoat, which Mr. Hicks insisted should be order'd out, that he might\r\nreturn on board in the same manner as he came, without a Guard; and upon\r\nhis refusing to return other way, all the Crew were by Arm'd force taken\r\nout of the Boat (though they gave no provocation nor made the least\r\nresistance) and hurried to Prison, where they remained until the next\r\nday. Mr. Hicks was then put into one of their Boats, and brought on board\r\nunder the Custody of a Guard. Immediately upon my hearing of this I wrote\r\nto the Vice Roy demanding my Boat and Crew and his Excellency's reason\r\nfor detaining her, and inclosed the Memorial he had before refused to\r\nreceive. This I sent by a petty Officer, as I had never objected against\r\na Guard being put into any of my Boats wherein was no Commissioned\r\nOfficer. He was admitted ashore and delivered the Letter, and was told an\r\nAnswer would be sent the next day. This evening, between 8 and 9 o'Clock,\r\ncame on an Excessive hard storm of Wind and Rain, the Longboat coming on\r\nboard the same time with 4 Pipes of Rum in her. The rope they got hold of\r\nbroke, and she went a Drift. The Yawl was immediately sent after her; but\r\nthe Longboat filling with Water, they brought her to a Grapnel and left\r\nher, and the Yawl with the People got on board about 3 in the morning.\r\nEarly this Morning I sent to the Vice Roy to acquaint him with the loss\r\nof our Boat, to desire leave and the Assistance of a Shore Boat to look\r\nafter her, and at the same time to demand the Pinnace and her Crew. After\r\nsome time the whole was granted, and we was so fortunate as to find the\r\nLongboat the same Day, and likewise the 4 Pipes of Rum; but every other\r\nthing that was in her was lost.\r\n\r\nMonday, 21st. This Morning I received his Excellency's Answer to my last\r\nMemorial and Letter. In his Letter he owns there was some indecency in\r\nDetaining the Boat, but lays the Blame to my Officer, who only Executed\r\nthe orders I gave him with Spirit. In one part of his Memorial he says\r\nthat from the Built of the Ship and other Circumstances he Doubts that\r\nshe is the King's. This I thought proper to Answer in Writing by telling\r\nhis Excellency that I was ready to produce my Commission. Rain the most\r\npart of this Day.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 22nd. Moderate breezes, with frequent Showers of Rain. Employed\r\ngetting on board Water, Provisions, etc. Caulking the Ship and repairing\r\nthe Sails.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 23rd. Fine pleasant weather. Employed as before and setting up\r\nthe Rigging. This day I received from the Vice-Roy an Answer to my last\r\nMemorial, wherein he still keeps up his Doubts that she is not a King's\r\nShip, and accuseth my people of Smuggling, a thing I am very Certain they\r\nwere not guilty of, and for which his Excellency could produce no proof,\r\nnotwithstanding many Artful means were made use of to tempt such of our\r\nPeople as were admitted ashore to Trade by the Very Officers that were\r\nunder His Excellency's own Roof. I thought it incumbent on me to Answer\r\nthis Memorial, in which I desir'd His Excellency to take into Custody any\r\none of my People that should be found trading even if it amounted to no\r\nmore than one of the Sailors selling his Cloaths from off his Back for a\r\nBottle of Rum--for what His Excellency called smuggling I was very\r\ncertain amounted to no more, and even this was only Suspicions of my own.\r\n\r\nThursday, 24th. This day a Spanish Packet (a Small Brig) from Buenos\r\nAyres put in here in her way to Spain. This Vessel belonged to his\r\nCatholic Majesty, and notwithstanding the Vice-Roy had all along\r\npretended that the orders he had respecting Foreign Vessels were General,\r\nyet this Vessel meet with very Different Treatment from us. No Guard was\r\nput over her, and her Officers and Crew went wherever they pleased.* (*\r\nThe build and general appearance of the Endeavour not being that of a\r\nman-of-war, the Portuguese authorities entertained suspicions regarding\r\nher true character, which is not altogether surprising, considering the\r\ntimes; but we can well understand Cook's indignation.)\r\n\r\nFriday, 25th, Saturday, 26th. Employed getting on board Water as fast as\r\nthe Coopers could set up and repair the Casks, setting up the rigging and\r\nCaulking the Ship's sides.\r\n\r\nSunday, 27th. Bent the Sails and Cleaned the Ship Fore and Aft.\r\n\r\nMonday, 28th. Fine pleasant weather. The Caulkers having finished the\r\nsides, paid them with Tar. This day I unexpectedly received an Answer\r\nfrom my last Memorial, wherein were only a few weak Arguments to support\r\nHis Excellency's Suspicions that the Ship did not belong to the King, and\r\nthat my People Smugled. This Memorial I answered.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 29th. Employed Lashing the Casks that were on the upper Deck and\r\nbetween Decks and making ready for Sea.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 30th. Punished Robert Anderson, Seaman, and William Judge,\r\nMarine, with 12 Lashes Each, the former for leaving his Duty ashore and\r\nattempting to desert from the Ship, and the latter for using abusive\r\nlanguage to the Officer of the Watch, and John Reading, Boatswain's Mate,\r\nwith 12 lashes for not doing his Duty in punishing the above two Men.\r\nSent a Shore to the Vice-Roy for a Pilot to Carry us to Sea, who sent one\r\non board together with a Large Boat, which I did not want, but it is the\r\nCustom in this Port for the Pilots to have such a Boat to attend upon the\r\nShip they Pilot out, and for which you must pay 10 shillings per day,\r\nbesides the Pilot's fees, which is Seven pounds four Shillings Sterling.\r\n\r\n[December 1768.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 1st December. Wind at South-East, which hinder'd us from\r\nSailing as we intended. Received on board a large Quantity of fresh Beef,\r\nGreens and Yams for the Ship's Company.\r\n\r\nFriday, 2nd. This morning sent a Packet for the Secretary of the\r\nAdmiralty on board the Spanish Pacquet, containing copies of all the\r\nMemorials and Letters that have passed between the Vice-Roy and me, and\r\nlikewise another Packet containing Duplicates thereof I left with the\r\nVice-Roy to be by him forwarded to Lisbon. At 9 Weighed and came to Sail\r\nand turned down the Bay. Peter Flower, Seaman, fell overboard, and before\r\nany Assistance could be given him was drowned; in his room we got a\r\nPortugue.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 3rd. First part, moderate breezes at South-East; remainder,\r\nfresh Gales at South with Rain. At 1 p.m. Anchored in 18 fathoms Water in\r\nthe Great Road (see Plan).\r\n\r\nSunday, 4th. Fore and Middle parts fresh Gales at South-South-East with\r\nheavy rain; Latter, Variable Light Airs and fair weather. Hoisted in the\r\nLong-boat and secured her.\r\n\r\nMonday, 5th. First part, little wind and Cloudy; Middle, Thunder,\r\nLightning and Rain; latter, little wind at South-West and fair. At 4 a.m.\r\nWeighed and tow'd down the Bay (being Calm) with an intent to go to Sea,\r\nbut having 2 Shott fired at us from Santa Cruze Fort was obliged to come\r\nto an Anchor and to send a Boat to the Fort to know the Reason of their\r\nfiring, who it seems had no orders to let us pass, without which no Ship\r\ncan go to Sea. This surprized me not a little, as I had but this very\r\nmorning received a very Polite Letter from the Vice-Roy (in answer to one\r\nI had wrote some days ago), wherein he wishes me a good voyage. I\r\nimmediately dispatched a petty Officer to the Vice-Roy to know the reason\r\nwhy we was not permitted to pass the Fort; the Boat very soon return'd\r\nwith an order to the Captain of the Fort to let us pass, which Order had\r\nbeen wrote some Days Ago, but either by Design or neglect had not been\r\nsent. At 11 weighed in order to put to Sea, but before we could heave up\r\nthe Anchor, it got hold of a Rock, where it held fast in spite of all our\r\nendeavours to Clear it until the Sea Breeze set in.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 6th. The Sea breeze continued all this day. At 2 p.m. the Ship\r\ntended to the Wind, which cleared the Anchor. Hove it up and run higher\r\nup the Bay and Anchored in 15 fathoms, a little below the Isle or Church\r\nof Bon Voyage; found the cable very much rubbed several fathoms from the\r\nAnchor.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 7th. First and latter part a Genteel breeze at South-East and\r\nEast; the Middle, Calm. At 5 a.m. weighed and tow'd out of the Bay; at 8\r\nDischarged the Pilot and his Boat. A breeze of Wind Springing up Easterly\r\nmade Sail out to Sea, and sent a boat to one of the Islands laying before\r\nthe Bay to cut Brooms, a thing we was not permitted to do while we lay in\r\nthe Harbour; the Guard Boat which had constantly attended all the time we\r\nlay in the Bay and Harbour did not leave us until the Pilot was\r\ndischarged. At noon the Sugar Loaf at the west Entrance of the Bay bore\r\nNorth by West 1/2 West, distance, 8 or 9 miles.\r\n\r\n[Description of Rio Janeiro.]\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE BAY OR RIVER OF RIO DE JANEIRO.\r\n\r\nThe few days' delay we met with in getting out of Rio de Janeiro gave me\r\nan opportunity of Drawing a Plan or Sketch of great part of the Bay, but\r\nthe Strict watch that was kept over us during our whole stay hinder'd me\r\nfrom taking so accurate a Survey as I wisht to have done, and all the\r\nObservations I could make was taken from on board the Ship. This Plan\r\nhath no pretensions to accuracy, yet it will give a very good idea of the\r\nplace, differing not much from the truth in what is Essential.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Rio de Janeiro, by some called a River--which its Name\r\nSignifies--but this I think is improper, it being nothing more than a\r\nDeep inlet of the Sea, into which no considerable fresh water River\r\nEmptys itself that I could hear of. Be this as it will, it is Capacious\r\nand Capable of Containing a vast Number of Shipping where they may ride\r\nin perfect Security. The Entrance is Situated West by North 18 Leagues\r\nfrom Cape Frio, and may be known by a remarkable Hill in the Form of a\r\nSugar Loaf, at the West Entrance of the Bay; but as all the Coast is\r\nexceeding high, terminating at the top in Peaked Hills, it is much better\r\nknown by the Islands laying before it, one of which (called Rodonda) is\r\nhigh and round in form of a Hay Stack, and lies South by West 2 1/2\r\nleagues from the Sugar Loaf or Entrance of the Bay. A little without the\r\nEast Entrance of the Bay, and near the shore, lay 2 Islands near each\r\nother: 3 leagues from the Eastward and 4 miles from the Shore are 2 low\r\nRocky Islands, which are the first you meet with in coming from the\r\nEastward or from Cape Frio.\r\n\r\nTo sail into Rio de Janeiro there is not the least Danger until you are\r\nthe length of the Fort of Santa Cruze, which stands on the point that\r\nforms the East Entrance of the Bay or River; on the West Entrance is Fort\r\nLorio, built upon a Rock which lies close to the Main Land, the distance\r\nfrom one Fort to the other is 3/4 of a mile East and West, but the\r\nChannel for Shipping is not quite so broad by reason of Sunken Rocks\r\nlaying off each of the Forts; these rocks may not be properly placed in\r\nthe plan, being only laid down from the information of the Pilot. The\r\nNarrowness of the Channell here causeth the Tides both Flood and Ebb to\r\nrun pretty strong, insomuch that you cannot Stem it without a fresh\r\nbreeze of Wind, nor is it safe Anchoring because the bottom is foul and\r\nRocky. By keeping in the Middle of the Channell you will not only avoid\r\nbeing forced to come to an Anchor, but all other Dangers. Being got\r\nwithin the entrance your Course up the Bay is North by West 1/2 West and\r\nNorth-North-West something more than one League; this brings you the\r\nlength of the great Road, and North-West and West-North-West one league\r\nmore carrys you the length of the Ilha dos Cobras, which lies before the\r\nCity. Keep the North side of this Island close on board and Anchor above\r\nit in 5 fathoms of water, where you see most Convenient before the\r\nMonastery of Benedictines, which stands upon a hill at the North-West End\r\nof the City. Small Ships and Vessels generally lay between the Town and\r\nthe Ilha dos Cobras, but in order to get there they must come round the\r\nNorth side of the Island.\r\n\r\nI shall now give the best description I can of the Different Forts that\r\nare Erected for the Defence of the Bay. The first you meet with coming in\r\nfrom Sea is a Battery of 22 Guns, seated in the Bottom of a sandy Bay,\r\nwhich is on the South side of the Sugar Loaf, and can be designed for no\r\nother use than to hinder an Enemy from landing in that valley, from\r\nwhence I suppose they may March up to the Town or round by the West side\r\nof the Sugar Loaf to attack the Forts that are on that side of the\r\nEntrance into the Bay, the first of which is Seated under the foot of the\r\nSugar Loaf on a low Isthmus which joyns the Peninsula or point of the Bay\r\nwith the Land of the Sugar Loaf. It appears to be a square of Stone Work\r\nwithout a Ditch, with Bastions and furnished with Cannon. A little within\r\nthis fort are 2 battrys of 5 or 6 Guns each. They are designed to play\r\nupon Shipping, but neither these battrys or the Fort are out of reach of\r\na Ship's Cannon. Hard by these batterys stands Fort Logie. It is an\r\nirregular hexagon, built of Stone upon a Small Rock standing at the west\r\nEntrance of the Bay, and is surrounded on all Sides by the Sea. It is\r\nmounted with 14 or 15 guns, which are placed so as to play upon Shipping\r\ngoing in and out of the Harbour. There is only one way to go into it,\r\nwhich is by Steps Leading up to a Sally Port on the North-West side.\r\nOpposite this is the Fort of Santa Cruze, built upon a low rocky point\r\nthat forms the East Entrance of the Bay. It hath the Appearance of a\r\nRegular Fortification of Stone Work built upon the Slope of the Rock, on\r\nwhich account there are in some places 2 Tier of Guns. It hath no Ditch\r\nbut on the Land side, where it is cut out of the Rock; in every other\r\npart the Sea washes up to its Walls. It seems everywhere to be well\r\nMounted with Cannon Except on the land side, where none are wanting,\r\nbecause they could be of no use, the land being so very high above it.\r\nYet, after all, neither this Fort nor those on the opposite shore do not\r\nappear to be of any great Strength, even against Shipping, for which they\r\nare wholly design'd, being the key of the Bay. They lay low, and Ships\r\nmay come so near as to have them entirely within the reach of their Guns;\r\nbut it would require 5 or 6 Sail of the line to insure Success. Between 2\r\nand 3 Miles within the Entrance of the Bay, on the West Side, is the Isle\r\nBorghleone, upon the east point of which is Erected a Battry of Stone,\r\nand Mounted with 17 pieces of Cannon. Besides this, on the highest part\r\nof the Island, is a Battry of 6 Guns mounted on an Open Platform. These\r\nbattrys are designed to play upon Shipping in the Bay, and seems not ill\r\ndesigned for that purpose; yet they would be Obliged to Submit to the\r\nAttack of Shipping or that of a Land force, there being nothing to hinder\r\nthe latter from Landing on the Island behind the Battrys. Opposite to\r\nthis Island, on the low point on the east side of the Bay, is the Battry\r\nof St. Dominica of 7 Guns. A little without this Battry, on the East side\r\nof the Bay, is a small but high Island, close to the Shore, on the Top of\r\nwhich is the Church of Bonn Voyage, about half-way down the Cliff. Below\r\nthe Church is a Battry of 3 Guns. Neither the one nor the other of these\r\nbattry's are of much Consequence. They serve, indeed, to force Shipping\r\ncoming into the Bay between 2 Fires, and hinder them from Anchoring on\r\nthat side until they are silenced. The next fortification is that on the\r\nIlha dos Cobras, the east point and North side of which consists of a\r\nRampart Bastion and a Parrapet faced with Stones and mounted with Cannon,\r\nbut no Ditch, which is not much wanting, as the works are built on the\r\nEdge of the rising Ground. The other side next the Town hath no other\r\ninclosure but a plain wall without any Guns. It is said that the works on\r\nthis Island are in bad repair, on account of being so Extensive that they\r\nwould take more men to Defend them than they could spare, and, placing no\r\nDependancy on their Strength, let them go to decay. The ground on which\r\nthe Monastry of Benedictines Stands Commands the Works on the Island.\r\nOver the South end of the City stands the Castle of St. Sebastian; it is\r\nSeated upon a Hill, and Commands the whole Town; and this is all I know\r\nof it, only that it is not counted a place of any great Strength. For the\r\nDefence of these Forts and the Town the King of Portugal Maintains 7\r\nRegiments of Regular Troops. Those I saw were well cloathed and in good\r\nCondition; but this, as I was told, was not the Case with the whole.\r\nBesides these Troops are 3 Regiments of Militia, 2 of Horse and one of\r\nfoot. These consist of the principal inhabitants of the place, who serve\r\nwithout pay, Muster and Exercise in turns nine Months in the year, on\r\nwhich account they rank with the Regular Troops.\r\n\r\nThe City of Rio de Janeiro is in the Latitude of 22 degrees 50 minutes\r\nSouth and Longitude 42 degrees 15 minutes West from Greenwich.* (* Modern\r\ndetermination, 22 degrees 54 minutes South, 43 degrees 10 minutes West.)\r\nAccording to Observations made at Sea it is Seated on a plain close to\r\nthe Shore on the West side of the Bay, at the foot of Several high\r\nMountains. It is neither ill designed nor ill built. The Houses are\r\nmostly stone, generally one and two Storys high, with Balconys to most of\r\nthem. The Streets are of a Convenient breadth, and Cross each other at\r\nright Angles, and the whole City may be about 3 miles in Compass. It is\r\nGovern'd by a Governor appointed by the King. The present Governor is Don\r\nAnto Mendoyaz Fastada, who is no Friend to the English. It likewise is\r\nthe Residence of the Vice-Roy and Captain General of the States of\r\nBrazil, who is as absolute as any Monarch on Earth, and the people to all\r\nappearance as much Slaves. This City and Adjacent parts about the Bay are\r\nsaid to contain 100,000 Souls; but not above a twentieth part are Whites.\r\nThe rest are blacks, many of whom are free, and seem to live in tolerable\r\nCircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro is supplied with Water from 2 Different parts\r\nof the Adjacent Mountains. That which comes from the Southward is\r\nConvey'd a Cross a Deep Valley by an Acquiduct, which Consists of a great\r\nNumber of Arches placed in 2 Rows, one upon the other; from thence in\r\npipes to a fountain which stands in the Middle of the Square before the\r\nVice-Roy's Palace. At another part of the City is a Reservoir, to which\r\nthe water is conveyed much in the same manner. From these 2 places, but\r\nmostly from the former, the inhabitants fetch all they want, where there\r\nis always a Centinel to keep order: and it is likewise here that the\r\nShips Water. They land their Casks upon a Smooth sandy beach about 100\r\nyards from the Fountain, and upon application to the Vice-Roy you have a\r\nCentinel to look after them and to clear the way for to come to the\r\nfountain to fill water. Upon the whole, Rio de Janeiro is not a bad place\r\nfor Ships to put in at that want refreshments, not only because the\r\nHarbour is safe and Commodious, but that Provision and all manner of\r\nRefreshments may be had in tolerable plenty. Bread and Flour are,\r\nhowever, Scarce and Dear, being brought hither from Europe, and are never\r\nthe better for that Passage. In lieu of these are to be had Yams and\r\nCasada. All sorts of Grain--though it may be the produce of this\r\nCountry--is Dear. Fresh Beef (tho' bad) is to be had in plenty at about 2\r\n1/4 pence per pound, and Jurked Beef about the same price. This is cured\r\nwith Salt, and dryd in the shade, the bones being taken out, and the Meat\r\ncut into large but very thin slices. It eats very well, and if kept in a\r\ndry place will remain good a long time at Sea. Rum, Sugar, and Molasses\r\nare all good and Cheap. Tobacco is Cheap, but not good. Mutton they have\r\nvery little. Hogs and all sorts of Poultry are to be got, tho' in no\r\ngreat plenty, and of Course rather dear. Garden Stuff and Fruit in\r\nplenty, but none that will keep long at Sea except Pumpkins.\r\n\r\nThey have a Yard for building Shipping and a small Hulk for heaving down\r\nby, there being no other method to come at a Ship's bottom, as the Tides\r\ndoth not rise above 6 or 7 feet. At the New and full Moon it is high\r\nWater at that time about 8 o'clock, when the Land and Sea breezes are\r\nregular, but when they are not the Course of Tides are alter'd. The Sea\r\nbreeze begins to blow about 10 or 12 o'clock, and continues until sunset,\r\nwhen it dies away and is succeeded by the land breeze, which continues\r\nmost part of the night. From a little after sunrise until the Sea breeze\r\nsets in it is generally Calm, and is then the Hotest and most\r\nDisagreeable part of the whole day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.

Wind South-East to South; latitude 40 degrees 49 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 58 degrees 29 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 29th. First part moderate breezes and Cloudy; remainder fresh\r\nbreezes and Clear. P.M. loosed all the Reefs out, and got Topgallant\r\nYards a Cross. Variation per Azimuth 16 degrees 12 minutes, per Amplitude\r\n16 degrees 32 minutes; Mean of the Two 16 degrees 22 minutes East.\r\nBetween 9 and 10 a.m. took 7 sets of Observations between the sun and\r\nmoon to find the Longitude of the Ship. Each set Consists of three\r\nObservations; the Mean of the whole gave 59 degrees 18 minutes 34 seconds\r\nWest of Greenwich. The result of each set was as follows: viz., 1st set,\r\n59 degrees 8 minutes; Second, 59 degrees 21 minutes; Third, 59 degrees 34\r\nminutes; Fourth, 59 degrees 17 minutes; Fifth, 59 degrees 11 minutes 45\r\nseconds; Sixth, 59 degrees 19 minutes 30 seconds; and the Seventh, 59\r\ndegrees 20 minutes 45 seconds. The greatest differance between any\r\ntwo--viz., the first and third--is but 26 minutes, and the mean of these\r\ntwo differ from the mean of the whole only 2 minutes 26 seconds. This\r\nshews to what degree of accuracy these observations can be made even by\r\nDifferent Persons, for four of these were made and computed by Mr. Green\r\nand the rest by myself. The Longitude given by the Ship, reckoning from\r\nthe last Observation 5 Days ago, differs only 8 Miles from the\r\nObservation, which shews that we have not been in any Currents. Soundings\r\nfrom 40 to 47. Wind North-Easterly; course South 46 degrees 30 minutes\r\nWest; distance 81 miles; latitude 41 degrees 45 minutes South, longitude\r\n59 degrees 37 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 30th. Little wind, and sometimes Calm; the first part Clear\r\nweather, remainder Foggy and Hazey. Soundings from 44 to 49 fathoms; Grey\r\nsandy Bottom. Caught both this Morning and last Night a great Number of\r\ninsects. Some were upon the Wing, but the greater part were upon the\r\nwater, and many of these alive and of such sort as cannot fly far; and\r\nyet at this Time we could not be less than 30 Leagues from Land. Wind\r\nvariable; course South 30 degrees West; distance 54 miles; latitude 42\r\ndegrees 32 minutes South, longitude 60 degrees 15 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 31st. Cloudy weather, with some Lightning and a few showers of\r\nrain. Variation 18 degrees 36 minutes East. Soundings from 46 to 50\r\nfathoms; fine dark sand. Wind South-Easterly; course South 18 degrees\r\nWest; distance 43 miles; latitude 43 degrees 14 minutes South, longitude\r\n60 degrees 26 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[January 1769.]\r\n\r\nSunday, January 1st, 1769. First and Latter part, fresh breezes and Clear\r\nweather; in the Middle, light Airs and Calm. At Noon, longitude in per 4\r\nSets of Observations between the sun and moon 61 degrees 8 minutes 28\r\nseconds west. The Difference between the least and Greatest of these sets\r\nwas 8 minutes, and the mean of 2 differs from the Mean of the whole but\r\n32 seconds. The Longitude by account carried on from the last\r\nObservations exactly agree with these Observations. Saw a great number of\r\nsmall Whales about the Ship. Wind South to West-South-West; course South\r\n36 degrees West; distance 39 miles; latitude 43 degrees 35 minutes South;\r\nlongitude 61 degrees 8 minutes 28 seconds West.\r\n\r\nMonday, January 2nd. The first part of this day a Genteel gale and Clear\r\nweather; middle, Squally, with Lightning and rain, and some showers of\r\nLarge Hail Stones; towards Noon a Steady fresh breeze and Clear weather.\r\nAt noon longitude in by 3 sets of Observations between the sun and moon\r\n61 degrees 7 minutes 45 seconds, which is 43 seconds to the Eastward of\r\nyesterday's Observations. The Ship by the Log has made 4 minutes East.\r\nWind Westerly; course South 2 degrees East; distance 92 miles; latitude\r\n45 degrees 17 minutes South, longitude 61 degrees 7 minutes 45 seconds\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 3rd. Fresh gales and clear weather; under Single Reef Topsails.\r\nP.M. Saw some Whales and Porpoises and small red Crawfish, some of which\r\nwe Caught. At Noon saw several Birds of a light Grey Colour, like\r\nPidgeons, but smaller; these are of the Mother Carey's kind. Longitude\r\nper Observation 61 degrees 29 minutes 45 seconds, which is 22 minutes to\r\nthe westward of Yesterday, but the ship hath made 41 minutes,\r\nConsequently there is an Error of 19 minutes, which is not to be supposed\r\nto be in the Log in one Day's run; but, be it which way it will, it is\r\nnot great. Wind West, Southerly; course South 11 degrees; distance 122\r\nmiles; latitude 47 degrees 17 minutes South, longitude 61 degrees 29\r\nminutes 45 seconds West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 4th. First part, genteel breeze and Clear; latter, fresh\r\ngales, with heavy squalls of wind and rain, which brought us under our\r\ncourses and main topsails close reefed. Soon after noon saw the\r\nappearance of Land to the Eastward, and being in the Latitude of Peypes\r\nIsland, as it is lay'd down in some Charts, imagined it might be it.* (*\r\nPepys' Island, placed on charts, from a report by Captain Cowley in 1683,\r\nabout 230 miles north of Falkland Islands, and long imagined to exist. It\r\nwas eventually recognised, after the discovery of Cowley's manuscript\r\nJournal, that Cowley had sighted the Falklands.) Bore down to be Certain,\r\nand at 1/2 past 2 p.m. discovered our Mistake, and hauld the Wind again.\r\nAt 6 sounded, and had 72 fathoms black sand and mud. Variation 19 degrees\r\n45 minutes East. Wind West-North-West to South-West by South; course\r\nSouth 30 degrees East; distance 76 miles; latitude 48 degrees 28 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 60 degrees 51 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[Nearing Terra del Fuego.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 5th. Fore part, fresh Gales and Clear; Middle, light Airs;\r\nremainder, fresh Gales and a little hazey. P.M. found the Variation to be\r\n20 degrees 4 minutes East; Soundings 75 and 73 fathoms. A great Number of\r\nWater Fowl about the Ship. Wind South-West, North-East, North-North-East;\r\ncourse South 28 degrees West; distance 92 miles; latitude 49 degrees 49\r\nminutes South, longitude 61 degrees 67 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 6th. Fresh gales, the Air very Sharp and Cold; frequent showers\r\nof rain and Squalls. Soundings 75 fathoms. Saw some Penguins. Gave to\r\neach of the People a Fearnought Jacket and a pair of Trowsers, after\r\nwhich I never heard one Man Complain of Cold, not but that the weather\r\nwas cold enough. Wind West, Southerly; course South 8 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest; distance 92 miles; latitude 51 degrees 20 minutes South, longitude\r\n62 degrees 19 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 7th. First part, Strong Gales, with excessive hard Squals, with\r\nrain. At 9 p.m. wore and brought too, her head to the Westward under the\r\nMainsail, and Reef'd the Foresail for the first time. The Storm continued\r\nwith a little intermission until a little towards Noon, when it abated,\r\nso we could set the Topsails close Reefed. Saw many Penguins and some\r\nSeals. Wind southerly: course South 62 degrees East; distance 14 miles;\r\nlatitude 51 degrees 26 minutes South, longitude 61 degrees 59 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSunday, 8th. Wind and weather both Variable, but for the most part little\r\nwind. P.M. loosed the Reef out of the Foresail and 2 Reefs out of Each\r\nTopsail. A.M. got Top gallant Yards aCross and loosed all the Reefs out.\r\nSoundings from 80 to 75 fathoms. Wind South, South-West, West,\r\nNorth-West; course North 72 degrees West; distance 33 miles; latitude 51\r\ndegrees 16 minutes South; longitude 62 degrees 50 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 9th. First and Latter parts, a moderate breeze and Clear weather;\r\nMiddle, squally with rain. P.M. found the Variation by several azimuths\r\nto be 22 degrees 24 minutes East. Saw a great Number of Penguins and\r\nSeals.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 10th. Moderate breezes and fine clear weather. At 2 p.m. Sounded\r\n86 fathoms; black sand and Small stones. Variation 21 degrees 57 minutes\r\nEast. At 1/2 past 10 Tackt having Stood south 12 Leagues. After standing\r\nto the Westward 14 Miles, sounded, and had 80 fathoms black grey sand; 3\r\nLeagues farther 76, coarse black sand; Tack'd, and at noon had 70 fathoms\r\nblack gravel and Small Stones of different Colours. Saw several flights\r\nof black Sheerwaters. Wind West-South-West, South-West; course South 18\r\ndegrees West; distance 38 miles; latitude 52 degrees 54 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 63 degrees 10 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 11th. A Steady Genteel breeze and clear weather. P.M. after\r\nstanding 13 Leagues South-South-West Sounded 64 fathoms Gravel and small\r\nStones; Standing South-West by South 11 leagues farther, had 46 fathoms,\r\nthe same sort of bottom. At 8 a.m. saw the land of Terra del Fuego,\r\nextending from the west to the South-East by South, distance off shore\r\nbetween 3 and 4 Leagues; sounded and had 35 fathoms small, soft, Slate\r\nStones. Variation 23 degrees 30 minutes East. In ranging along shore to\r\nthe South-East at the distance of 2 or 3 leagues, had 27 and 26 fathoms\r\nmuddy bottom. Saw some of the natives, who made a Smook in several\r\nplaces, which must have been done as a Signal to us as they did not\r\ncontinue it after we passed. By our Longitude we ought not to have been\r\nso far to the Westward as Statenland, as it is laid down in the Charts;\r\nbut it appeared from Subsequent Observations that the Ship had got near a\r\nDegree of Longitude to the Westward of the Log, which is 35 Miles in\r\nthese Latitudes. Probably this in part may be owing to a Small Current\r\nsetting to the Westward, occasioned by the Westerly Current which comes\r\nround Cape Horn and through Strait La Maire, and the inDraught of the\r\nStreights of Magellan. Wind westerly; course South 30 degrees West;\r\ndistance, 100 miles; latitude 54 degrees 20 minutes South, longitude 64\r\ndegrees 35 minutes West per log.\r\n\r\nThursday, 12th. First part, moderate breezes and Cloudy; remainder\r\nsometimes a fresh breeze, sometimes Calm, Hazey weather with rain. At 5\r\nthe wind coming to the Northward obliged us to Tack and Stood\r\nNorth-Westward, being then about 5 Miles from the Shore, and had 23\r\nfathoms, sandy Bottom. At Midnight Tackt and Stood to the Eastward. At\r\nNoon the Land over the Entrance of Straits La Maire, East-North-East,\r\ndistance, 7 leagues; Soundings from 28 to 38 fathoms. Wind North,\r\nNorth-North-East, variable, West-South-West; latitude 54 degrees 34\r\nminutes South per observation.\r\n\r\nFriday, 13th. The greatest part of this day little wind and Cloudy. At 8\r\np.m., Cape St. Diego, at the west entrance of Straits La Maire, East,\r\ndistance about 5 leagues. Keept under an easey Sail until daylight, at\r\nwhich time we were abreast of Cape St. Diego, and then put into the\r\nStraits, but the Tide soon turned against us and obliged us to haul under\r\nthe Cape again and wait until 9 a.m. when it shifted in our favour. Put\r\ninto the Straits again with a Moderate breeze at South-West, which soon\r\ngrew Boisterous with very heavy Squalls, with rain and hail, and obliged\r\nus to Close reef our Topsails. Wind North-East by East, West-South-West,\r\nSouth-West; latitude 54 degrees 39 minutes South; at noon, Cape St. Diego\r\nNorth 2 leagues.\r\n\r\n[In Strait of Le Maire.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 14th. First part Strong Gales, and very heavy squalls with Hail\r\nand Rain; remainder more moderate but unsettled, sometimes a fresh breeze\r\nand Squally, and sometimes little wind. Kept plying in the Straits until\r\n1/2 past 4 p.m., at which time the Tide had made strong against us, and\r\nthe wind not abating, bore away, intending to have hauled under Cape St.\r\nDiego, but was prevented by the force of the Tide, which carried us past\r\nthat Cape with surprising rapidity, at the same time caused a very great\r\nsea. At 6, the weather being Clear, took 9, or 3 sets of, Observations of\r\nthe sun and moon in order to find the Longitude of the place, and as they\r\nperhaps are the first Observations of this kind that were ever made so\r\nnear to the Extremity of South America, I have inserted them below just\r\nas they were taken, that everybody may judge for themselves.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: NAME OF SET.\r\nCOLUMN 2: TIME BY THE WATCH IN HOURS, MINUTES AND SECONDS.\r\nCOLUMN 3: APPARENT TIME COMPUTED FROM IN HOURS, MINUTES AND SECONDS.\r\nCOLUMN 4: OBSERVED DISTANCE.

The mean of the three sets is 66 degrees 9 minutes 25 seconds, and\r\nthe mean of Mr. Green's Computations from the same Observations was 66\r\ndegrees 14 minutes 0 seconds, and the mean of his computations and mine\r\nwill be 66 degrees 11 minutes 32 seconds, and therefore the Longitude of\r\nCape St. Diego or the North-West entrance of Strait Le Maire will be 66\r\ndegrees 0 minutes 0 seconds West from Greenwich, and its Latitude 54\r\ndegrees 39 minutes South.* (* Modern determination is 54 degrees 40\r\nminutes South, 65 degrees 8 minutes West.)\r\n\r\nNote: The distance of the sun and moon was taken by Mr. Green alone, my\r\nQuadrant being out of Order.\r\n\r\nCape St. Diego bore at this time South by East about 4 Leagues Distant.\r\nAt 1/2 past 7 Tackt and Stood to the South-East, Cape St. Diego bearing\r\nSouth by East, distance 5 Leagues. At 1 a.m., Squally, wore Ship, Staten\r\nLand extending from North to East. At 4, Moderate Weather, loosed a Reef\r\nout of each Topsail, the Cape of Good Success West by South, and Cape St.\r\nDiego North-North-West, being now in the Strait, but the Tide turning\r\nagainst us soon carried us out. The Violence of the Tide of Ebb rose such\r\na Sea off Cape St. Diego, that it looked as if it was breaking Violently\r\non the ledge of Rocks, and would be taken for such by any who know'd not\r\nthe true cause. When the Ship was in this Torrent she frequently Pitched\r\nher Bowsprit in the Water. By Noon we got under the Land between Cape St.\r\nDiego and Cape St. Vincent, where I thought to have Anchored, but found\r\nthe Bottom every where hard and Rocky; the Depth of Water from 30 to 12\r\nfathoms. Sent the Master to Examine a small Cove which appeared to our\r\nView a little to the Eastward of Cape St. Vincent. Wind South-South-West\r\nand South-West by South.\r\n\r\nSunday, 15th. Moderate breezes at South and South-East, and cloudy\r\nweather, the greater part of this day. At 2 p.m. the Master return'd with\r\nan account that there was Anchorage in 4 fathoms Water and a good bottom\r\nclose to the Eastward of the first black bluff point which is on the East\r\nside of Cape St. Vincent, at the very Entrance of the Cove we saw from\r\nthe Ship (which I named Vincent Bay). Before this Anchoring ground lay\r\nseveral Rocky Ledges covered with Sea Weed: on these Ledges I was\r\ninformed was not less than 8 or 9 fathoms, but in standing in with the\r\nShip the first we came upon had only 4 fathoms upon it. I therefore\r\nthought that Anchoring here would be attended with some Risk, and that it\r\nwould be better to Endeavour to find some Port in the Strait, and there\r\nCompleat our Wood and Water. However, I sent an Officer with a Boat on\r\nshore to attend to Mr. Banks and people who was very desirous of being on\r\nshore at any rate, while I keept plying as near the shore as possible\r\nwith the Ship. At 9 they return'd on board bringing with them several\r\nPlants, Flowers, etc., most of them unknown in Europe, and in that Alone\r\nconsisted their whole Value; they saw none of the Natives, but meet with\r\nseveral of their old Hutts. Hoisted the Boat in and made Sail into the\r\nStraits and at 3 a.m. Anchord in 12 1/2 fathoms Water (the bottom Coral\r\nrocks) before a small Cove which we took for Port Maurice, and near 1/2 a\r\nMile from the shore Cape St. Diego South-South-West, and Cape St.\r\nBartholomew (which is the south point of Staten Land) East-South-East.\r\n\r\nPort Maurice appeared to afford so little Shelter for Shipping that I did\r\nnot think it worth while to hoist a Boat out to Examine it; we saw here 2\r\nof the Natives come down to the Shore, who stay'd sometime, then retir'd\r\ninto the Woods againe. At 10 o'Clock got under Sail, Wind at South-East,\r\nand plyed to Windward.\r\n\r\n[In Success Bay.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 16th. A Fresh breeze of Wind at South and South-West, with\r\nfrequent showers of Rain and Snow. At 2 p.m. Anchored in the Bay of\r\nSuccess in 9 fathoms, the bottom Owse and sand.* (* The Endeavour was\r\nthree days and a half in getting through the Strait of Le Maire, as far\r\nas Success Bay. It is a difficult passage for a sailing vessel even in\r\nthe present day, as the tides are strong and winds generally contrary,\r\nbut experience has enabled good directions to be given as to the best way\r\nto pass the Strait. Cook himself gives capital advice farther on.) The\r\nsouth point of the Bay bore South-East and the north point\r\nEast-North-East. This Bay I shall describe when I come to speake of the\r\nrest of the Coast. Hoisted out the Boats and moor'd with the Stream\r\nAnchor. While this was doing I went ashore accompanyed by Mr. Banks and\r\nDr. Solander to look for a Watering place and to speak with the Natives,\r\nwho were assembled on the Beach at the Head of the Bay to the Number of\r\n30 or 40. They were so far from being afraid or surprised at our coming\r\namongst them that three of them came on board without the least\r\nhesitation. They are something above the Middle size, of a Dark Copper\r\nColour with long black hair; they paint their Bodies in Streakes, mostly\r\nRed and Black. Their Cloathing consists wholy in a Guanacoe Skin or that\r\nof a Seal, in the same form as it came from the Animal's back.\r\n\r\nThe Women Wear a Piece of Skin over their Privy Parts, but the Men\r\nobserve no such decency. Their Hutts are made like a behive, and open on\r\none side where they have their fires; they are made of small Sticks and\r\ncovered with branches of trees, long Grass, etc., in such a manner that\r\nthey are neither Proof against Wind, Hail, rain or Snow, a sufficient\r\nproof that these People must be a very hardy race. They live chiefly on\r\nshell fish, such as Muscels, which they gather from off the Rocks along\r\nthe Sea Shore, and this seems to be the Work of the Women. Their Arms are\r\nBows and Arrows neatly made; their Arrows are bearded, some with glass\r\nand others with fine flint; several Pieces of the former we saw amongst\r\nthem with other European things, such as rings, Buttons, Cloth, Canvas,\r\netc., which I think proves that they must sometimes travel to the\r\nNorthward, as we know of no Ship that hath been in these parts for many\r\nYears; besides, they were not at all surprised at our Fire Arms; on the\r\nContrary, they seemed to know the use of them, by making signs to us to\r\nfire at Seals or Birds that might come in the way. They have no Boats\r\nthat we saw or anything to go upon the Water with; their number doth not\r\nExceed 50 or 60 young and old, and there are fewer Women than Men. They\r\nare Extreamly fond of any Red thing, and seemed to set more Value on\r\nBeads than anything we could give them; in this Consists their whole\r\nPride, few, either Men or Women, are without a Necklace or String of\r\nBeads made of Small Shells or bones about their Necks. They would not\r\ntaste any strong Liquor, neither did they seem fond of our Provisions. We\r\ncould not discover that they had any Head or Chief or Form of Government,\r\nneither have they any useful or necessary Utensil except it be a Bag or\r\nBasket to gather their Muscels into. In a word they are perhaps as\r\nMiserable a sett of People as are this day upon Earth.* (* Cook's\r\ndescription of the natives of Tierra del Fuego is good to the present\r\nday, except that those who live farther westward are still more wretched.\r\nThose of the main island, in which the Bay of Good Success lies, are able\r\nto kill guanaco, and enjoy a better climate. They, as Cook observed,\r\nnever go on the water, whereas those westward practically live in\r\ncanoes.) Having found a convenient place on the south side of the Bay to\r\nWood and Water at, we set about that Work in the Morning, and Mr. Banks\r\nwith a Party went into the Country to gather Plants, etc.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 17th. Fresh Gales at South-South-West and West-South-West with\r\nrain and Snow, and, of Course, very cold weather; notwithstanding we kept\r\ngeting on board Wood and Water, and finished the Survey of the Bay. Mr.\r\nBanks and his Party not returning this Evening as I expected, gave me\r\ngreat uneasiness, as they were not prepared for Staying out the Night.\r\nHowever, about Noon they returned in no very Comfortable Condition, and\r\nwhat was still worse 2 blacks, servants to Mr. Banks, had perished in the\r\nNight with Cold. Great part of the day they landed was spent before they\r\ngot through the Woods, after which they advanced so far into the Country\r\nthat they were so far from being able to return that night, and with much\r\ndifficulty they got to a place of Tolerable Shelter where they could make\r\na fire: these 2 men being Intrusted with great part of the Liquor (that\r\nwas for the whole party) had made too free with it, and Stupified\r\nthemselves to that degree that they either could or would not Travel, but\r\nlaid themselves down in a place where there was not the least thing to\r\nShelter them from the inclemency of the night. This was about 1/4 of a\r\nMile from where the rest took up their Quarters, and notwithstanding\r\ntheir repeated Endeavours, they could not get them to move one Step\r\nfarther, and the bad travelling made it impossible for any one to Carry\r\nthem, so that they were Obliged to leave them, and the next morning they\r\nwere both found dead.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 18th. All the Middle and Latter parts of this day it blow'd\r\nvery strong from the South-South-West and South-West, attended with Snow,\r\nHail and Rain, and brought such a Sea into the Bay, which rose the Surf\r\nto such a Height that no Boat could land. The same Stormy weather and\r\nSurf continued all\r\n\r\nThursday, 19th. All this time the Ship road very easy with her Broad side\r\nto the swell. The great Surf that always will be upon the Shore when the\r\nwind blows hard from the Southward makes Wooding and Watering tedious,\r\nnotwithstanding there are great plenty of both close to high water Mark.\r\n\r\nFriday, 20th. Moderate gales and Cloudy with frequent Showers of rain all\r\nthis day. This Evening the Surf abated, and at 2 a.m. sent the People on\r\nshore to Wood and Water and cut Brooms, all of which we Completed this\r\nday. In this Service we lost our small Kedge Anchor, it having been laid\r\noff the Watering Place to ride the Long-boat by, and the Gale had broke\r\naway the Hawser and Buoy rope, and perhaps buried the Anchor in the Sand,\r\nfor notwithstanding our utmost Endeavours we were not able to Hook it.\r\nTook up the Stream Anchor and made ready for Sailing.\r\n\r\n[Sailed from Success Bay.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 21st. Wind from South-South-West to South-West; moderate\r\nbreezes the first part; latter, fresh Gales with Showers of Rain. P.M.\r\nhoisted in the Boats, and made ready for Sailing; at 2 a.m. weighed and\r\nmade Sail out of the Bay. At 1/2 past 4 the Cape of good Success bore\r\nWest, and Cape Bartholomew East. Variation per Azimuth, 24 degrees 9\r\nminutes East; at Noon the Cape of good Success bore North 36 degrees\r\nWest; distance, 11 leagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 22nd. Wind between the South and the West first and Latter part,\r\nfresh Gales and Squally, with rain; the Middle, little wind and rain.\r\nA.M. found the Variation by several Azimuths to be 20 degrees 4 minutes\r\nEast. Unbent the Cables and Stowed the Anchors. At Noon, Latitude\r\nobserved 56 degrees 7 minutes South, longitude, made from the Cape of\r\nGood Success, 42 minutes East.\r\n\r\nMonday, 23rd. Winds variable from South-East round by the South-West to\r\nNorth-West. First part, a fresh breeze and Squally, the remainder\r\nmoderate breezes and sometimes Calm and clear weather, which is more than\r\nwe have had for several days past. At 4 a.m. saw the Land in the\r\nSouth-West Quarter, and a small Island bearing West; from this Time until\r\n9 it was Calm, at which time the Ship drove very fast to the North-East\r\nby North. At 9 Sprung up a light breeze at North, loos'd all the Reefs\r\nout, and set the Steering sails. The Cape of good Success bore North-East\r\nby North; Staten land seen from the Deck bearing North-East; the Sugar\r\nLoaf on Terra Del Fuego North-North-East, and is the same Hill as is seen\r\nfrom the North-East side of the Land; it appears to stand but a little\r\nway in Land from the Shore; and the Mainland and Islands on the Coast\r\nextending from the Cape of good Success to the South by West. The Country\r\nMountainous, of an indifferent height; the Tops were covered with Snow,\r\nwhich had lately fell, as it did not lay long. There appeared to be\r\nseveral Bays and inlets and Islands laying along the Coast; the 3rd view\r\nin the Chart exhibits the appearance of this Coast where g is new Island,\r\nc the Sugar Loaf, and h the Cape of good Success. At noon the West End of\r\nNew Island bore North-West by West, 5 leagues. Latitude observed 55\r\ndegrees 25 minutes South, this Island I named New Island because it is\r\nnot laid down in any Chart.* (* This island is still so called in the\r\ncharts.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 24th. The fore and Middle parts of these 24 Hours Moderate Gales\r\nand Cloudy with some Showers of Rain; the Latter, fresh gales with flying\r\nShowers. At 7 p.m. New Island bore North-West by North, and a small\r\nIsland laying to the Westward of it bore West by North. Variation per\r\nSeveral Azimuths 21 degrees 0 minutes East, which is much less than we\r\nhave yet found it upon this Coast; yet I am satisfied with the Goodness\r\nof the Observations. At 1/2 past 1 a.m. the Wind Shifted from\r\nSouth-South-West to East-South-East. Tackt and stood South-West; at 6 Saw\r\nthe Land to the Westward making like several Islands. At 8 two Small\r\nIslands laying off a low Point of Land bore West by South, distant 3\r\nLeagues, and the small Island we saw last night bore North-North-West.\r\nThis I take to be the Island of Evouts, it is about one League in\r\nCircuit, and of a Moderate height and lies 4 Leagues from the Main. Near\r\nthe South Point of it are some Peaked rocks pretty high above Water; the\r\nwind coming to the Southward we did but just weather this Island; in\r\npassing it, sounded and had 40 fathoms Water, sand, and broken Shells. At\r\nNoon it bore North-East distance one League, and the low point of land\r\nbefore mentioned South 17 degrees West distant 4 or 5 Leagues. Tackt and\r\nStood to the South-East, wind at South-South-West. From this low Point\r\nthe land trends to the North-West, about 4 Leagues, where it ends in a\r\nlow point round which to the Westward appears to be a Deep Bay, unless\r\nthis land should prove to be an Island or Islands, which is most likely.\r\nIt rises into high Craggy hills, and the Shore seems to form several\r\nBays; if so, they must afford good Shelter for Shipping against Southerly\r\nand Westerly winds.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Horn.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 25th. Winds from the South to the West-North-West, the first\r\npart fresh Gales and Squally with some Rain; Middle, little wind with\r\nHail and Rain; latter, fresh Gales and Hazey, with Showers of Rain. At 8\r\np.m. the Island of Evouts North-West, distant 3 or 4 miles. Variation,\r\nper morning Amplitude 21 degrees 16 minutes East. At 8 a.m. the\r\nSouthermost low point of land seen Yesterday Bore South 74 degrees West,\r\nand a remarkable Peaked Hill to the Southward of it South-West; and soon\r\nafter we discovered that the land which we took Yesterday to be a part of\r\nthe Main or an Island, was three Islands, which I take to be Hermites. At\r\nNoon the South Point of the Southermost Island bore North-West by West\r\ndistant 3 leagues, having then 58 fathoms Peble Stones. This Point is\r\npretty high and consists of Peaked Craggy rocks, and not far from it lay\r\nseveral others high above Water. It lies in the Latitude of 55 degrees 53\r\nminutes South and South-West 26 Leagues from Straits La Mair, and by some\r\non board thought to be Cape Horn; but I was of another Opinion, and with\r\ngood reason, because we saw land to the Southward of it about 3 or 4\r\nleagues. It appeared not unlike an Island with a very high round Hummock\r\nupon it; this I believe to be Cape Horn, for after we had stood about 3\r\nLeagues the weather cleared up for about a quarter of an hour, which gave\r\nus a sight of the land bearing West-South-West, but we could see no land\r\nto the southward or Westward of it, and therefore conclude that it must\r\nbe the Cape, but whether it be an Island of itself, a part of the\r\nSouthermost of Hermits Islands, or a part of Terra del Fuego, I am not\r\nable to determine. However, this is of very little Consequence to\r\nNavigation: I only wished to be Certain whether or no it was the\r\nSouthermost Land on or near to Terra del Fuego; but the thick foggy\r\nweather and the westerly winds which Carried us from the land prevented\r\nme from satisfying my Curiosity in this point, but from its Latitude and\r\nthe reasons before given I think it must, and if so it must be Cape Horn,\r\nand lies in the latitude of 55 degrees 53 minutes South and Longitude 68\r\ndegrees 13 minutes West from the Meridian of Greenwich,* (* No doubt this\r\nwas Cape Horn, but it lies in 55 degrees 58 minutes South, 67 degrees 16\r\nminutes West.) being the Mean result of Several Observations of the sun\r\nand moon made the day after we left the land, and which agreed with those\r\nmade at Straits Le Mair, allowing for the distance between one place and\r\nthe other, which I found means very accurately to determine. As we are\r\nnow about taking our departure from the Land, which we are not likely to\r\nfall in with again, I shall give a more full Description of such parts of\r\nthe Coasts of Terra del Fuego as hath fallen under my inspection.\r\n\r\nWe fell in with this Coast 21 Leagues to the Westward of Straits Le Mair,\r\nand ranged the coast from thence to the Strait within 2 or 3 Leagues of\r\nthe Land, and had soundings all the way from 40 to 20 fathoms, a Gravelly\r\nand Sandy Bottom. The land near the Shore is in general low but hilly,\r\nthe face of the Country appears Green and Woody, but in land are Craggy\r\nMountains; they appeared to be of no great height, nor were they Covered\r\nwith Snow. The most remarkable land on Terra Del Fuego is a high Mountain\r\nin form of a Sugar Loaf, situated not far from the sea on the South-West\r\nside of the Land, and 3 hills called the 3 Brothers. They lay near the\r\nShore and nine Miles to the Westward of Cape St. Diego, which is a low\r\npoint that forms the North-West Entrance of Strait Le Mair, and are\r\nContiguous to Each other. The Sugar Loaf lies from these Hills\r\nSouth-South-West, and when it was in this situation the Appearances of\r\nthe Land is represented in the first View in the Chart, but it must be\r\nobserved that from this point of View the Three Brothers appear far more\r\nConspicuous than from any other; these land Marks are by some Voyagers\r\nthought very necessary to know Strait Le Mair by, but whoever coasts\r\nTerra Del Fuego within sight of land cannot possibly miss the Strait, it\r\nbeing of itself so very Conspicuous; and Staten Land, which forms the\r\nEast side, is still more so from its very rugged appearance. One League\r\nand a half to the Westward of Cape St. Diego lies Cape St. Vincent,\r\nbetween these two Capes lies Vincent's Bay,* (* Now called Thetis Bay, it\r\nis a very poor anchorage.) a Small Cove wherein is Wood and Water, and\r\nbefore which a Ship might Anchor with a Southerly or South-West wind, but\r\nthe ground is none of the best, unless you go into the very Mouth of the\r\nCove, which is on the East side of the first Bluff point from Cape St.\r\nVincent, where there is Anchorage in 4 fathoms, a Sandy Bottom. In going\r\nin keep clear of the Sea Weed, and send a Boat Ahead to sound, and at\r\nbest this is but a bad place for Shipping, and only recommended to such\r\nas are in want of Wood and Water, and have no Opportunity to put into the\r\nStrait, which in Prudence ought not to be attempted but with a fair wind\r\nor Moderate weather, and upon the very first of the Tide of Flood, which\r\nhapens here at the full and Change of the Moon about 1 or 2 o'clock, and\r\nthen to keep as near to Terra Del Fuego Shore as the winds will permit.\r\nBy using these Precautions you will be sure of either getting quite\r\nthrough the Straits in one Tide or to the Southward of Success Bay; and\r\nit may be more Prudent to put in there should the wind be Southerly, than\r\nto attempt to weather Staten Land with a Lee Wind and Current, for I\r\nbelieve this to be the Chief reason why Ships have run a Risk of being\r\ndrove on that Island.\r\n\r\nStrait Le Maire is formed on the West by part of Terra Del Fuego, and on\r\nthe East by the West end of Staten Land or Island; its Length and Breadth\r\nis about 5 Leagues each; about the Middle of the Strait is Success Bay,\r\non Terra Del Fuego side, and about a 1/4 of a League more to the\r\nNorthwards is Port Maurice, a little Cove, before which we Anchored in 12\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\n[Description of Strait of Le Maire.]\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Success is discovered immediately upon entring the Strait from\r\nthe Northward; there is likewise a good Land Mark near the South head to\r\nknow it by, which is a Mark on the land like a lane or broad road leading\r\nup from the Sea into the Country; this Bay is 1/2 a League Wide at the\r\nEntrance, and lies in West 2 1/2 Miles, and hath good Anchorage in every\r\npart of it, in 10, 8, and 7 fathoms clear ground, and affords plenty of\r\nexceeding good Wood and Water. The Wood is of the Birch kind, but of a\r\ndiffrent Quality to that in England or North America; here are likewise\r\nof the Winter Bark tree and some few others, Wild Selary, some Berrys\r\nlike Cranberrys, but growing on Bushes, very few Wild Fowls of any Sort,\r\nand no Fish Except Shell Fish, such as Muscels, Limpets, etc.; and what\r\nwe saw of the interior parts of the Country is still more barren of the\r\nnecessaries of Life than the Sea. The few days we stay'd here we had\r\nconstant bad weather, the Winds from the South-West and West-South-West\r\nwith rain, Hail and Snow. Snow generally fell on the Hills everywhere\r\nwith these winds when we had rain in the Bay or upon the Sea Coast. I\r\nobserved the same in respect to Staten Land, but as it never froze it did\r\nnot lay long; yet it must render the Country Cold and barren, and unfit\r\nfor Cultivation. The Tides in Success Bay flows at the full and Change of\r\nthe Moon, about 4 or 5 o'Clock, and riseth between 5 and 6 feet\r\nPerpendicular, but in the Strait the flood runs 2 or 3 Hours longer, and\r\nthere the Ebb or Southerly Current runs near Double the strength of the\r\nFlood or Northerly Current.\r\n\r\nStaten Island lies nearest East and West, and from what I could see and\r\njudge of it may be about 12 Leagues in length and 5 in breadth. On the\r\nNorth side are the appearances of Bays or Harbours, and the land is not\r\ndestitute of Wood and Verdure, nor covered with Snow any more than Terra\r\ndel Fuego.\r\n\r\nOn the South-West side of the Cape of good Success (which forms the\r\nSouth-West entrance of Strait Le Mair, and is known by some rocks off it)\r\nlies Valentine's Bay, the entrance of which we only saw. From this Bay\r\nthe land Trends to the West-South-West; for 20 or 30 Leagues it appears\r\nHigh and Mountainous, and forms several Bays and inlets South-West 1/2\r\nSouth 14 Leagues from the Cape of good Success, and 2 or 3 Leagues from\r\nthe Shore lies New Island; it is 2 leagues in length, North-East and\r\nSouth-West, the North-East end is terminated by a remarkable Hillock.\r\nSouth-West 7 Leagues from New Island lies the Isle Evouts, and South, a\r\nlittle Westerly from this island, lies Barnevelts, two small flatt\r\nIslands close to each other; they are partly Environ'd with rocks of\r\nDifferent height above water, and lay South-West 24 leagues from Strait\r\nle Mair. From Barnevelts Island to the South-East point of Hermites\r\nisland is South-West by South, distance 3 Leagues. These Islands lay\r\nSouth-East and North-West, and are pretty high, and will, from most\r\npoints of view, be taken for one Island or a part of the Main; from the\r\nSouth-East point of Hermites Isles to Cape Horn, the Course is South-West\r\nby South, distance 3 Leagues. The Appearance of this Cape and Hermites\r\nIslands is represented in the last View in the chart which I have drawn\r\nof this Coast from our first making the land unto Cape Horn, in which is\r\nincluded Strait Le Mair and part of Staten Land. In this chart I have\r\nlaid down no land nor figured out any Shore, but what I saw myself and\r\nthus far the Chart may be depended upon. The Bays and inlets are left\r\nvoide, the openings of which we only see from the Ship. It cannot be\r\ndoubted but what there is Anchorage, Wood and Water in those Bays, and it\r\nmust have been in some of them that the Dutch Squadron commanded by\r\nHermites put into in the year 1624. It was the Vice Admiral Chapenham, of\r\nthis Squadron, who first discovered that the land of Cape Horn was\r\nconsisted of a Number of Islands, but the account they have given of\r\nthose parts is very short and imperfect, and that of Schouton and Le\r\nMaire still worse, that it is no wonder that the Charts hitherto\r\npublished should be found incorrect, not only in laying down the Land,\r\nbut in the Latitude and Longitude of the places they contain, but I can\r\nnow venture to Assert that the Longitude of few parts of the World are\r\nbetter Ascertained than that of Strait Le Maire and Cape Horn, being\r\ndetermined by several Observations of the Sun and moon made both by\r\nmyself and Mr. Green, the Astronomer.\r\n\r\nWe found the Variation of the Compass on this Coast to be from 23 to 25\r\ndegrees east, except near Barnevelts Islands and Cape Horn, where we\r\nfound it less and unsettled; it is likely that it is here disturbed by\r\nthe land, as the Dutch Squadron before mentioned found in this very place\r\nall their Compasses to differ from each other. The declination of the\r\nSouth point of the Dipping Needle when set up ashore in Success Bay was\r\n68 degrees 15 minutes below the horizon. Between Strait Le Maire and Cape\r\nHorn we found a Current setting generally pretty strong to the North-East\r\nwhen we were in with the Shore, but when 15 or 20 Leagues off we were not\r\nsencible of any.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE OCCURRENCES IN JANUARY 1769. SOUTH SEAS.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Horn.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 26th. Fresh Gales and thick Hazey weather, with small rain. At\r\n2 p.m., the weather clearing up a little, saw Cape Horn bearing\r\nWest-South-West, distance about 6 leagues, and from which I take my\r\ndeparture. Its Latitude and Longitude have before been taken notice of.\r\nWind South-West by West to West-North-West; course South 15 degrees West;\r\ndistance, 63 miles; latitude 56 degrees 57 minutes South; longitude 68\r\ndegrees 13 minutes West; at noon, Cape Horn North, 58 miles.\r\n\r\nFriday, 27th. First part, moderate breezes and thick Hazey weather; the\r\nMiddle, fair and Cloudy; and the Latter, fresh Gales with some rain. At 8\r\na.m. took two Setts of Observations of the sun and moon; the first gave\r\n68 degrees 15 minutes; the second, 68 degrees 9 minutes; the Mean of the\r\n2 is 68 degrees 12 minutes West. The Longitude of the Ship at Noon by\r\nthese Observations is 68 degrees 42 minutes less 14 minutes, the\r\nLongitude made from Cape Horn, equal to 68 degrees 28 minutes, the\r\nlongitude of Cape Horn according to the Observation. A Great many large\r\nAlbetrosses about the Ship. Wind, South-West, West and North; course,\r\nSouth and West; distance, 32 miles; latitude 57 degrees 2 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 68 degrees 27 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 28th. Fresh Gales the most part of this day; first and Middle\r\nparts cloudy; latter, clear with a Sharp cold air. At 2 p.m. saw the\r\nland, bearing North, distant about 8 Leagues; it made in 2 Hummocks, and\r\nappeared to be an Island, which I take to be the Isle of Diego Ramirez.\r\nIt lays in the Latitude of 56 degrees 38 minutes South and Longitude 68\r\ndegrees 47 minutes West from Greenwich.* (* Diego Ramirez is in 56\r\ndegrees 31 minutes South, 68 degrees 43 minutes West.) Found the\r\nVariation this Evening to be 22 degrees East. A.M. had 3 sets of\r\nObservations of the sun and moon, which gave the Longitude 69 degrees 7\r\nminutes 15 seconds West. The Longitude of the Ship at Noon by the\r\nObservation is 69 degrees 24 minutes, from which take 1 degree 48\r\nminutes, the longitude made from Cape Horn, the remainder is 67 degrees\r\n36 minutes, the Longitude of the Cape, which is 52 minutes less than the\r\nresult of Yesterday's Observations.* (* This was the best observation.)\r\nThis difference may arise partly from the Observations and partly from\r\nthe Ship's runs; the mean of the 2 gives 68 degrees 2 minutes and 68\r\ndegrees 24 minutes, the Longitude of the Cape from the Observations taken\r\nat Strait Maire 136 degrees 26 minutes/2 = 68 degrees 13 minutes West\r\nfrom Greenwich. The Longitude of Cape Horn being deduced from no less\r\nthan 24 Observations taken at no very great distance from the Cape, and\r\non both sides of it, and when the Sun was both to the East and West of\r\nthe Moon; for in this case the Errors arising from the Observations are\r\nmost likely to Correct one another. Wind, North and West by North to\r\nNorth-West by West; course, South 39 degrees West; distance, 80 miles;\r\nlatitude 58 degrees 4 minutes South, longitude 70 degrees 1 minute West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 29th. First and Latter parts, fresh Gales and Squally, with\r\nflying Showers of rain and Hail; the Middle, strong Gales with heavy\r\nSqualls and showers of rain. At 8 p.m. took 2nd Reef Topsails, at 6 a.m.\r\nClose reefd the Foretopsails and took in the Mizen Topsl, and at 10 set\r\nit again and let the reef out of the Fore top-sails. Wind, West\r\nNortherly; course South-West; distance, 79 miles; latitude 59 degrees 0\r\nminutes South, longitude 72 degrees 48 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 30th. Fore part, fresh Gales and Squally with Hail and rain,\r\nremainder moderate and Cloudy. At 6 a.m. loosed the 2nd reef out of the\r\nTopsails and set Top-gallant Sails. At 11 Longitude per 3 sets of\r\nObservations of the sun and moon, 1st set 73 degrees 38 minutes 15\r\nseconds; second set 73 degrees 25 minutes 45 seconds; and 3rd, 73 degrees\r\n19 minutes 30 seconds; the mean of the whole is 73 degrees 27 minutes 50\r\nseconds West, and 35 minutes less than the Longitude by Dead reckoning,\r\nwhich is only 6 Leagues in this Latitude, and therefore not worth taking\r\nnotice of. Latitude per Observation 60 degrees 4 minutes South. Wind West\r\nby North and West-North-West; course, South 33 degrees West; distance, 76\r\nmiles; latitude 60 degrees 4 minutes South, longitude 74 degrees 10\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 31st. First part moderate and Cloudy, with some rain; in the\r\nnight, little wind and Calm; towards Noon, fresh Gales and Cloudy.\r\nBetween 7 and 8 p.m., being then in the Latitude of 60 degrees 10\r\nminutes, which was the farthest south we were, and in the Longitude of 74\r\ndegrees 30 minutes found the Variation of the Compass by the mean of\r\nAzimuth to be 27 degrees 9 minutes East. At 3 a.m. wind at\r\nEast-South-East, and Moderate breeze. Set the Steeringsails, and soon\r\nafter 2 Birds like Penguins were seen by the Mate of the Watch. Wind\r\nWest-North-West, calm, East-South-East, South-South-East; course North 71\r\ndegrees West; distance, 55 miles; latitude 59 degrees 46 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 75 degrees 54 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[February 1769.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, February 1st. First part, fresh Gales; latter, light Airs and\r\nCloudy; P.M. found the Variation by several Azimuth to be 24 degrees 53\r\nminutes East. At Noon sounded, but had no ground with 240 fathoms of\r\nline; hoisted a Boat out to try if there was any Current, but found none.\r\nThe weather was such as to admit Mr. Banks to row round the Ship in a\r\nLighterman's Skiff shooting birds. Wind, South-East by East,\r\nSouth-South-East, East; course, North-West by West; distance, 106 miles;\r\nlatitude 58 degrees 46 minutes South, longitude 78 degrees 42 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThursday, 2nd. First part, light breezes and Cloudy; remainder, sometimes\r\na fresh breeze and at other times little wind and hazey, rainy, Cold\r\nweather. Took in the Steeringsls and a reef in each Topsail. Wind\r\nvariable, North-North-West, South-West and South; course, West by North;\r\ndistance, 82 miles; latitude 58 degrees 30 minutes South, longitude 80\r\ndegrees 58 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 3rd. Calm and Light Airs, and for the most part Cloudy and\r\nsometimes drizling rain. Variation 24 degrees 4 minutes East. Wind, West\r\nby North, North-West by West; course South 82 West; distance 30 miles;\r\nlatitude 58 degrees 33 minutes South, longitude 81 degrees 55 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 4th. Fore and Middle parts, little wind and dark cloudy\r\nweather; latter, fresh Gales and Cloudy with some rain. P.M. had a Boat\r\nout and Shott several sorts of Birds, one of which was an Albetross as\r\nlarge as a Goose, whose wings when Extended measured 10 feet 2 inches;\r\nthis was grey, but there are of them all White except the very tip end of\r\ntheir Wings. Another sort, in size between an Albetross and a large Gull,\r\nof a grey Colour, with a white Spot above their Tail about the Breadth of\r\none's hand, and several other sorts. Wind Westerly; course North 13\r\ndegrees West; distance 48 miles; latitude 57 degrees 45 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 82 degrees 16 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 5th. Fresh gales with heavy squalls the first part; remainder,\r\nlittle wind and Cloudy. Very cold weather. Wind, West-South-West, West by\r\nNorth and South-West by West; course North; distance 49 miles; latitude\r\n56 degrees 46 minutes South, longitude 82 degrees 16 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 6th. A moderate breeze of Wind with some flying showers of hail\r\nand rain; close upon a Wind all this day. Wind South-West by West to West\r\nby North; course North 1/4 East; distance 86 miles; latitude 55 degrees\r\n20 minutes South, longitude 82 degrees 23 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 7th. A fresh breeze and dark cloudy weather, with some showers\r\nof rain; the wind, varying from West to North by West, obliged us to Tack\r\nseveral times. Wind North-West by West, West by South; course North 20\r\ndegrees West; distance 46 miles; latitude 54 degrees 40 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 82 degrees 54 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 8th. First part, cloudy with Squalls of wind and Showers of\r\nrain and hail; Latter part thick hazey weather, with frequent Showers.\r\nWind, Westerly, South by West; course North 14 degrees 43 minutes West;\r\ndistance 58 miles; latitude 53 degrees 36 minutes South, longitude 83\r\ndegrees 19 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 9th. Fresh gales all this day, sometimes squally with rain;\r\nunder Double-reef Topsails in the night, and Single-reeft Topsail in the\r\nday. Wind Southerly; course North 55 degrees West: distance 130 miles;\r\nlatitude 52 degrees 22 minutes South, longitude 86 degrees 17 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nFriday, 10th. The former part of this day had fresh breezes and Dark\r\ncloudy weather; in the night hard Squalls with rain, and afterwards hazy,\r\nrainy weather. Wind Westerly; course North 22 degrees West; distance 67\r\nmiles; latitude 51 degrees 16 minutes South, longitude 86 degrees 37\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 11th. Former part Light Airs with drizling rain; remainder, a\r\nModerate breeze and Cloudy. Wind, variable, southerly; course, North 54\r\ndegrees West; distance 36 miles; latitude 50 degrees 55 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 87 degrees 24 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 12th. First and Middle parts, fresh gales and cloudy; latter,\r\nlittle wind and clear. Having for some time past generally found the Ship\r\nby Observation to the Northward of the Log, which is not owing to a\r\nCurrent as I at first imagined, but to a wrong Division of the Log line,\r\nbeing 2 1/2 feet in each Knot--but this is now rectified. Wind South-West\r\nby South; course North 48 degrees West; distance 113 miles; latitude 49\r\ndegrees 41 minutes South, longitude 89 degrees 36 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 13th. The first part of these 24 Hours, moderate breezes and\r\nCloudy; remainder, fresh Gales and cloudy. P.M saw a great many\r\nAlbetrosses and other Birds about the Ship; some were all white and about\r\nthe size of Teal. Took several Observations of the sun and moon, the\r\nresult of which gave 90 degrees 13 minutes West Longitude from Greenwich.\r\nThe Variation of the Compass by the Mean of several Azimuths 17 degrees\r\nEast. The Longitude by account is less than that by Observation, 37\r\nminutes, which is about 20 Miles in these high Latitudes, and nearly\r\nequal to the Error of the Log line before mentioned. This near Agreement\r\nof the 2 Longitudes proves to a Demonstration that we have had no Western\r\nCurrent since we left the Land. Wind West, Northerly; course North 75\r\ndegrees West; distance 35 miles; latitude 49 degrees 35 minutes,\r\nlongitude 90 degrees 37 minutes.\r\n\r\n[Remarks on Passage round Cape Horn.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Foregoing observations it will appear that we are now advanced\r\nabout 12 degrees to the westward of the Strait of Magellan, and 3 1/2\r\ndegrees to the Northward of it, having been 33* (* N.B. 23 days only from\r\nSuccess Bay.) days in Doubling Cape Horn or the Land of Terra del Fuego,\r\nand Arriving into the Degree of Latitude and Longitude we are now in, and\r\nwithout being brought once under our close Reef'd Topsails since we left\r\nStrait Le Maire, a Circumstance that perhaps never hapned before to any\r\nship in those Seas so much dreaded for Hard gales of Wind; in so much\r\nthat the doubling of Cape Horn is thought by some to be a mighty thing,\r\nand others to this day prefer the Straits of Magellan. As I have never\r\nbeen in those Straits I can only form my Judgement on a Carefull\r\nComparison of the Different Ships' Journals that have passed them, and\r\nthose that have sail'd round Cape Horn, particularly the Dolphin's two\r\nlast Voyages and this of ours, being made at the same season of the Year,\r\nwhen one may reasonable expect the same Winds to prevail. The Dolphin in\r\nher last Voyage was three Months in getting through the Straits, not\r\nreckoning the time she lay in Port Famine; and I am firmly perswaided\r\nfrom the Winds we have had, that had we come by that Passage we should\r\nnot have been in these Seas, besides the fatiguing of our People, the\r\ndamage we must have done to our Anchors, Cables, Sails, and Rigging, none\r\nof which have suffer'd in our passage round Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said it will appear that I am no advocate for the\r\nStraits of Magellan, but it should be expected that I should say\r\nsomething of Strait le Mair, through which we passed, and this is the\r\nmore incumbant on me as it was by choice and contrary to the Advice given\r\nby Mr. Walter, the ingenious Author of Lord Anson's Voyage, who advised\r\nall Ships not to go through this Strait but to go to the Eastward of\r\nStaten Land, and likewise to stand to the Southward as far as 61 or 62\r\ndegrees south before any Endeavour is made to get to the Westward. With\r\nrespect to the Passing of Strait le Mair or going round Staten Land, I\r\nlook upon of little Consequence, and either one or the other to be\r\npursued according to Circumstances; for if you happen to fall in with the\r\nland to the Westward of the Strait, and the winds favourable for going\r\nthrough, it certainly must be a piece of folly to lose time in going\r\nround Staten Land, for by paying a little Attention to the Directions I\r\nhave already given no ill Consequences can attend; but on the Contrary if\r\nyou should fall in with the land to the eastward of the Straits or the\r\nwind should prove Boisterous, or unfavourable, in any of these Cases the\r\ngoing to the eastward of Staten Land is the most Advisable. And next, as\r\nto running into the Latitude of 61 or 62 degrees South before any\r\nEndeavour is made to get to the Westward, is what I think no man will\r\never do that can avoid it, for it cannot be supposed that anyone will\r\nsteer south mearly to get into a high Latitude, when at the same time he\r\ncan steer west, for it is not Southing but Westing that is wanting. But\r\nthis way you cannot Steer because the Wind blows almost Constantly from\r\nthat Quarter, so that you have no other Choice but to stand to the\r\nSouthward, close upon a Wind, and by keeping upon that Tack you not only\r\nmake Southing but Westing also, and sometimes not a little when the wind\r\nVaries to the Northward of West; and the farther you advance to the\r\nSouthward the better Chance you have of having the Winds from that\r\nQuarter or Easterly, and likewise of meeting with finer weather, both of\r\nwhich we ourselves Experienced. Prudence will direct every man when in\r\nthose high Latitudes to make sure of sufficient Westing to double all the\r\nlands before he thinks of standing to the Northward. When the winds was\r\nWesterly the Mountains on Terra Del Fuego were generally covered with\r\ndense Clouds, formed, as one may reasonably suppose, by Westerly\r\nExhalations and by Vapours brought thither by the Westerly winds. From\r\nthat Quarter come frequent Showers of rain, hail, and Snow; and after we\r\nhad left the land and were standing to the Southward, with the winds\r\nwesterly, dark dence clouds were Continually forming in the Horizon, and\r\nrose to about 45 degrees, where they began to dissipate. These were\r\ngenerally attended with Showers of Rain, or hail, and Squals of Wind, but\r\nas we advanced to the Southward, these Clouds became less dence, and in\r\nthe Latitude of 60 degrees 10 minutes, when we got the winds Easterly,\r\nthe weather was more serene and Milder; again as we advanced to the\r\nNorthward we had a constant Clouded sky and dark gloomy weather, the\r\nwhole time exceeding Cold.\r\n\r\n[Cape Horn to Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 14th. The first part, fresh Gales and Hazey with rain; the\r\nremainder moderate and Cloudy, with frequent rain. Wind, Westerly, South;\r\ncourse South-West; distance 32 miles; latitude 49 degrees 6 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 91 degrees 12 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 15th. Little wind and Cloudy the most part of this day.\r\nVariation per Azimuth in the Evening 12 degrees East, and in the morning\r\nboth by an Amplitude and an Azimuth 11 degrees East. A.M. Shifted the\r\nMainsail, Mizen, Fore, and Main topsail. Wind, South-South-West,\r\nSouth-West, West by North; course North 46 degrees West; distance 86\r\nmiles; latitude 48 degrees 27 minutes South, longitude 92 degrees 5\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 16th. The first part of this day had fresh Gales and Cloudy; in\r\nthe night thick hazey weather with heavy squalls of wind and rain, which\r\nobliged us to close-reef our Topsails. In the morning and all the\r\nforenoon had strong gales and cloudy weather, and very heavy Seas from\r\nthe South-South-West, one of which broke upon the Quarter and carried\r\naway the Driver Boom. Wind North-West, West, and South; course North 74\r\ndegrees West; distance 97 miles; latitude 48 degrees 0 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 94 degrees 25 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 17th.

Fresh gales all this day. The weather Variable, sometimes\r\nfair and Cloudy, other times hazey, with drizzling rain. Saw some Birds\r\nnearly as big as Albetrosses; they were all black, with Yellow Beaks.\r\nWind South-West by West; course North 32 degrees 30 minutes West;\r\ndistance 140 miles; latitude 44 degrees 50 minutes South, longitude 99\r\ndegrees 7 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 19th. First part, fresh Gales and Hazey; the Middle part, hazey,\r\nwith drizling rain; the latter, gentle breezes and fine Clear weather,\r\nyet the Air is still Cold. Wind South-West by West to West by South;\r\ncourse North-North-West 3/4 West; distance 103 miles; latitude 43 degrees\r\n21 minutes South, longitude 100 degrees 21 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 20th. Moderate breezes and fine weather the greater part of this\r\nday, and the Sea very smooth. Found by repeated trials that the South\r\npoint of the Dipping Needle Dip'd 65 degrees 52 minutes below the\r\nHorizon. Wind Westerly; course South 65 degrees West; distance 58 miles;\r\nlatitude 43 degrees 46 minutes South, longitude 101 degrees 34 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 21st.

Little wind and Calm, and some Lightning, a thing we have\r\nnot seen for some time past, and therefore suppose not common in these\r\nSeas in high Latitudes. Variation 5 degrees 34 minutes East. Wind\r\nNorth-West, calm; course North 30 degrees East; distance 13 miles;\r\nlatitude 44 degrees 35 minutes South, longitude 105 degrees 52 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nFriday, 24th. First part, Calm; Middle, light breezes; latter, fresh\r\nbreezes and hazey. P.M. had several Azimuths, all of which gave the\r\nVariation less than 4 degrees East, but they were a little doubtful on\r\naccount of the Rowling of the Ship. What winds we have had this day hath\r\nbeen from the Eastward, and are the first we have had from that Quarter\r\nsince we left the Latitude 58 degrees 46 minutes. Wind calm,\r\nEast-North-East and East-South-East; course North 42 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest; distance 79 miles: latitude 43 degrees 37 minutes South, longitude\r\n107 degrees 6 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 25th.

First part, Calm and light Airs; remainder, very strong\r\ngales and Squally, with Showers of rain, which at length brought us under\r\nour two Courses, and close-reefed Maintopsail. Wind calm, North-West and\r\nWest-South-West; course North 26 degrees 15 minutes West; distance 88\r\nmiles; latitude 41 degrees 4 minutes South, longitude 109 degrees 52\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 27th.

Wind westerly; course North 18 degrees West;\r\ndistance 85 miles; latitude 39 degrees 43 minutes South, 110 degrees 26\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 28th. The former part little wind and fine clear weather; the\r\nAir full as warm as in the same Degree of North Latitude at the\r\nCorrespondent Season of the Year. The South-West swells still keep up,\r\nnotwithstanding the Gale hath been over about 30 Hours, a proof that\r\nthere is no land near in that Quarter.* (* These are instances of Cook's\r\nobservation and seamanlike perspicacity. The prevailing belief of the\r\ntime was in a great southern continent.) The remainder part of this day\r\nfresh breezes and clear. At 9 a.m. took 3 Sets of Observations of the sun\r\nand moon in order to find the Longitude of the Ship. Wind West to\r\nNorth-West; course North 13 degrees West; distance 42 miles; latitude 39\r\ndegrees 33 minutes 30 seconds South, longitude 110 degrees 38 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n[March 1769.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, March 1st. First part fresh breezes, the remainder moderate\r\nbreezes and clear weather. The result of the Forementioned Observations\r\ngives 110 degrees 33 minutes West Longitude from Greenwich, and exactly\r\nagrees with the Longitude given by the Log from Cape Horn. This Agreement\r\nof the two Longitudes after a Run of 660 leagues is surprizing, and much\r\nmore than could be expected; but, as it is so, it serves to prove, as\r\nwell as the repeated trials we have made when the weather would permit,\r\nthat we have had no Current that hath Affected the Ship since we came\r\ninto these Seas. This must be a great Sign that we have been near no land\r\nof any extent, because near land are generally found Currents. It is well\r\nknown that on the East side of the Continent in the North Sea we meet\r\nwith Currents above 100 Leagues from the Land, and even in the Middle of\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, between Africa and America, are always found\r\nCurrents; and I can see no reason why Currents should not be found in\r\nthis Sea, supposing a Continent or lands lay not far West from us, as\r\nsome have imaggin'd, and if such land was ever seen we cannot be far from\r\nit, as we are now 560 leagues West of the Coast of Chili.* (* These are\r\ninstances of Cook's observation and seamanlike perspicacity. The\r\nprevailing belief of the time was in a great southern continent.) Wind\r\nWest by South; course North 76 degrees West; distance 52 miles; latitude\r\n38 degrees 44 minutes South, longitude 111 degrees 43 minutes West; at\r\nnoon, Cape Horn South 60 degrees East 660 leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 2nd. Former part, fresh gales and hazey, with much rain; the\r\nremainder, a Strong fresh gale and pretty clear weather.

First part, Calm; remainder, a fine genteel breeze and\r\nclear weather. Variation per Azimuth and Amplitude this Evening 2 degrees\r\n26 minutes East. The South-West swell still keeps up, notwithstanding it\r\nhath been Calm 24 hours. Wind calm, North-East, North; course North 50\r\ndegrees West; distance 58 miles; latitude 36 degrees 12 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 112 degrees 50 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 5th.

Little wind and fine Pleasant weather. At 3 p.m. took\r\nseveral Observations of the sun and moon; the mean result of which gave\r\n126 degrees 20 minutes 45 seconds, the Longitude of the Ship West of\r\nGreenwich, and is 47 degrees Longitude West of account carried on from\r\nCape Horn. Wind South, East-South-East, East-North-East; course North 50\r\ndegrees West; distance 47 miles; latitude 30 degrees 17 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 126 degrees 10 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 15th.

Wind North by East to North-North-West; course\r\nWest; distance 57 miles; latitude 25 degrees 21 minutes South, longitude\r\n129 degrees 52 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 23rd. Fresh gales and Squally, with rain, the first part;\r\nremainder fresh Gales and Cloudy. P.M. saw some Men-of-War Birds, and Egg\r\nBirds, and in the Morning saw more Egg Birds and Tropic Birds. The\r\nMan-of-War and Tropic Birds are pretty well known, but the Egg Bird (as\r\nit is called in the Dolphin's Journal) requires some discription to know\r\nit by that Name. It is a small slender Bird of the Gull kind, and all\r\nwhite, and not much unlike the small white Gulls we have in England, only\r\nnot so big.* (* Terns.) There are also Birds in Newfoundland called\r\nStearings that are of the same shape and Bigness, only they are of a\r\nGreyish Colour. These Birds were called by the Dolphin Egg Birds on\r\naccount of their being like those known by that name by Sailors in the\r\nGulph of Florida; neither they nor the Man-of-War Birds are ever reckoned\r\nto go very far from Land. Wind North by West to West by North: course\r\nNorth 13 degrees West; distance 49 miles; latitude 24 degrees 43 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 130 degrees 8 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[Passing Low Archipelago.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 24th. Fresh Gales and Cloudy, with some rain in the forepart of\r\nthis day. All the forepart of these 24 hours the Sea was smooth, but at\r\n12 at night it was more so, and about 3 in the Morning one of the people\r\nsaw, or thought he saw, a Log of Wood pass the Ship. This made us think\r\nthat we were near some land,* (* The Endeavour was now passing to the\r\nnorthward of the easternmost islands of the Paumotu or Low Archipelago,\r\nthough out of sight of them.) but at daylight we saw not the least\r\nappearance of any, and I did not think myself at liberty to spend time in\r\nsearching for what I was not sure to find, although I thought myself not\r\nfar from those Islands discovered by Quiros in 1606; and very probably we\r\nwere not, from the birds, etc., we have seen for these 2 or 3 days past.\r\nWind West-North-West to North-West; course North-East by North 1/4 East;\r\ndistance 99 miles; latitude 22 degrees 23 minutes South, longitude 129\r\ndegrees 2 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 25th.

Wind North-West by North, to\r\nWest by North; course North-East 1/2 North; distance 95 miles; latitude\r\n22 degrees 11 minutes South, longitude 127 degrees 55 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 26th. Squally weather, with rain. At 5 p.m. saw some sea Weed\r\npass the Ship, and at 7 William Greenslade, Marine, either by Accident or\r\ndesign, went overboard and was Drowned. The following circumstances makes\r\nit appear as tho' it was done design'dly. He had been Centinel at the\r\nSteerage door between 12 and 4 o'clock, where he had taken part of a Seal\r\nSkin put under his charge, and which was found upon him. The other\r\nMarines thought themselves hurt by one of their party commiting a crime\r\nof this nature, and he being a raw young fellow, and, as very probable,\r\nmade him resolve upon commiting this rash Action, for the Serjeant not\r\nbeing willing that it should pass over unknown to me, was about 7 o'clock\r\ngoing to bring him aft and have it inquired into, when he gave him the\r\nSlip between Decks, and was seen to go upon the Forecastle, and from that\r\ntime was seen no more. I was neither made acquainted with the Theft or\r\nthe Circumstances attending it, until the Man was gone. Wind, North-West\r\nto West; longitude 127 degrees 43 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 27th. Variable winds and weather, with frequent showers of rain.\r\nAt Noon saw a Bird like a Gannet. Wind variable; course North 1/4 East;\r\ndistance 30 miles; latitude 21 degrees 2 minutes South, longitude 127\r\ndegrees 38 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 28th. Little wind and Cloudy.

Wind Easterly; course North-North-West; distance 37\r\nmiles; latitude 20 degrees 38 minutes South, longitude 127 degrees 50\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 29th. Little winds and Cloudy weather. Variation per Azimuth 2\r\ndegrees 27 minutes East. Saw a Bird like a Dove and several fish about\r\nthe Ship. Employed worming the Best Br. Cable, repairing and Painting the\r\nBoats. Wind Easterly; course North 75 degrees West; distance 50 miles;\r\nlatitude 20 degrees 14 minutes South, longitude 129 degrees 27 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThursday, 30th. First part, Calm and close Cloudy weather; in the night\r\nhad Variable winds and weather, with rain. A.M. Genteel Breezes and\r\nCloudy weather. Between 10 and 11 a.m. took several Observations of the\r\nsun and moon; the mean result of them gave the Longitude of the Ship at\r\nNoon to be 127 degrees 38 minutes, and is 1 degree 49 minutes East of the\r\nLongitude given by the Log; but on the 4th Instant the ship by\r\nObservation was 47 minutes West of the Log, therefore she must have lost\r\n2 degrees 36 minutes of the Log since the last Observation--an Error too\r\ngreat to be accounted for. Wind calm, variable, South-South-East; course\r\nNorth 40 degrees West; distance 53 miles; latitude 19 degrees 34 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 129 degrees 27 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 31st. A Steady breeze and fine pleasant weather. A.M. took\r\nseveral Observations of the sun and moon, the mean result of them came\r\nwithin 8 Miles of Yesterday's Observations computed both by Mr. Green and\r\nmyself, and yet cannot think so great an error can have been committed in\r\nthe ship's run in so short a time as these observations seem to point\r\nout, and therefore I shall abide by the Longitude given by the Log unless\r\nfrom subsequent Observations this error should be found to be just. Wind\r\nSouth; course North 75 degrees 45 minutes West; distance 111 miles;\r\nlatitude 19 degrees 7 minutes South, longitude 131 degrees 21 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n[April 1769.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, April 1st. A steady fresh Trade and fine Weather. Variation per\r\nseveral Azimuths 2 degrees 32 minutes East. Wind South-East to East 1/2\r\nNorth; course West; distance 122 miles; latitude 19 degrees 7 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 133 degrees 28 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 2nd. A fresh Trade wind and fine pleasant weather. At Noon saw a\r\nLarge flock of Birds; they had brown backs and white Bellies. They fly\r\nand make a noise like Stearings, and are shaped like them, only something\r\nlarger. Saw likewise some black Sheerwaters and Several Man-of-War birds.\r\nWind East; course North 86 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 118 miles;\r\nlatitude 19 degrees 0 minutes South, longitude 135 degrees 33 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nMonday, 3rd. First and Latter parts a steady fresh Breeze and cloudy; the\r\nMiddle, sometimes squally with rain, at other times little wind. P.M. saw\r\n2 Birds like Albetrosses; they were all white except the Tip of their\r\nwings and Tails. Wind East; course North 82 degrees 45 minutes West;\r\ndistance 110 miles; latitude 18 degrees 46 minutes South, longitude 137\r\ndegrees 29 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 4th. A Steady fresh Trade and clear weather. At 1/2 past 10 a.m.\r\nsaw land bearing south, distance 3 or 4 Leagues. Haul'd up for it, and\r\nsoon found it to be an Island of about 2 Leagues in Circuit and of an\r\nOval form, with a Lagoon in the Middle, for which I named it Lagoon\r\nIsland. The Border of land Circumscribing this Lagoon is in many places\r\nvery low and narrow, particularly on the south side, where it is mostly a\r\nBeach or Reef of rocks; it is the same on the North side in 3 places, and\r\nthese disjoins the firm land and make it appear like so many Islands\r\ncovered with wood. On the West end of the Island is a large Tree which\r\nlooks like a large Tower, and about the Middle of the Island are two\r\nCocoa Nutt Trees that appears above all the other wood, which as we\r\napproached the Island looked very much like a flag. We approached the\r\nnorth side of this Island within a Mile, and found no Bottom with 130\r\nfathoms of line, nor did there appear to be Anchorage about it. We saw\r\nseveral of the Inhabitants, the most of them men, and these Marched along\r\nthe shore abreast of the Ships with long Clubs in their hands as tho'\r\nthey meant to oppose our landing. They were all naked except their Privy\r\nparts, and were of a Dark Copper Colour with long black Hair, but upon\r\nour leaving the Island some of them were seen to put on a Covering, and\r\none or two we saw in the Skirts of the Wood was Cloathed in White; these\r\nwe supposed to be Women. This Island lies in the Latitude of 18 degrees\r\n47 minutes and Longitude 139 degrees 28 minutes West from the Meridian of\r\nGreenwich;* (* This island is Vahitahi, one of the Paumotu or Low\r\nArchipelago.) variation 2 degrees 54 minutes East. Wind East, East by\r\nSouth; course North 88 degrees West; distance 114 miles; latitude 18\r\ndegrees 42 minutes South, longitude 139 degrees 29 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 5th. A fresh steady gale and fine weather. At 1 p.m. made Sail\r\nto the Westward, and at 1/2 past 3 saw land to the North-West, which we\r\ngot up with at Sun sett and proved to be a low woody Island of a Circular\r\nform, and not much above a Mile in Compass. This Island I called Thrum\r\nCap* (* Akiaki. It is inhabited.); it lies in the Latitude of 18 degrees\r\n35 minutes South and in the Longitude of 139 degrees 48 minutes West from\r\nGreenwich, and North 62 degrees West, 7 Leagues from Lagoon Island. We\r\nsaw no inhabitants, nor the appearance of any, and yet we were within 1/2\r\na Mile of the Shore. I observed by the Shore that it was near low Water,\r\nand at Lagoon Island I observed that it was either high Water or else\r\nthere was no Ebbing and flowing of the Sea. From these Circumstances I\r\ninfer that a South by East or South Moon makes high Water. Here we caught\r\na King Fish, being the first fish we have got in these Seas. Wind East;\r\ncourse North 77 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 79 miles; latitude 18\r\ndegrees 25 minutes South, longitude 140 degrees 51 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 6th. A fresh Trade and fine Pleasant weather. At 3 p.m. Saw\r\nland to the Westward, which proved to be an Island of about 12 or 15\r\nLeagues in Compass; is very low and entirely drown'd in the Middle,\r\nforming there a large lake, into which there appeared to be no inlet. The\r\nborder of land and Reef surrounding this lake like a wall appeared to be\r\nof a Bow-like figure, for which reason I named it Bow Island. The South\r\nside, along which we sail'd, was one continued low narrow Beach or Reef\r\nlike a Causeway for 4 Leagues and upwards, and lies East by North and\r\nWest by South. The East and West Ends and North side of this Island are\r\nwooded-in Groves, and the firm Land appeared disjoined and like a Number\r\nof Islands, and very probably is so. The North-West parts of the Island\r\nwe only saw aCross the Lake, and not very distinct on account of its\r\ngreat extent, and night coming on before we had run the whole length of\r\nthe Island. This description must be imperfect, and the whole Island may\r\nform a Different figure to what I have here described.* (* Hao. It is a\r\nlarge atoll, thirty miles in length. Cook only saw a portion of it.) The\r\neast end lies in the Latitude of 18 degrees 23 minutes South, and\r\nLongitude 141 degrees 12 minutes West from Greenwich. Variation 5 degrees\r\n38 minutes East. This Island is Inhabited; we not only saw smook in\r\nDifferent Parts, but people also. At Noon saw Land to the Westward. Wind\r\neast; course North 85 degrees West; distance 94 miles; latitude 18\r\ndegrees 19 minutes South, longitude 142 degrees 29 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 7th. Fresh Gales and Cloudy. At 1/2 past 2 p.m. got up with the\r\nEast end of the Land seen yesterday at Noon, and which proved to be an\r\nassemblage of Islands join'd together by Reef, and extending themselves\r\nNorth-West by North and South-East by South in 8 or 9 Leagues and of\r\nvarious breadths; but there appeared to be a total Seperation in the\r\nmiddle by a Channell of half a Mile broad, and on this account they are\r\ncalled the two Groups.* (* Marokau and Ravahare. Two atolls close\r\ntogether.) The South Eastermost of them lies in the Latitude of 18\r\ndegrees 12 minutes and Longitude of 142 degrees 42 minutes West from\r\nGreenwich, and West 1/2 North distant 25 Leagues from the West end of Bow\r\nIsland. We ranged along the South-West side of this Island, and hauled\r\ninto a Bay which lies to the North-West of the Southermost point of them,\r\nand where there appeared to be Anchorage and the Sea was smooth and not\r\nmuch Surf on the Shore; but we found no ground with 100 fathoms 3/4 of a\r\nMile from the Shore, and nearer we did not go. Here several of the\r\nInhabitants assembled together with their Canoes, with a design, as we\r\nthought, to come off to us, as they hauld one of them over the reef\r\nseemingly for that purpose; but after waiting near 1/2 an hour, and they\r\nnot attempting to come, we bore away and made Sail, and presentley the\r\nCanoe put off after us; but, as we did not stop, they soon went back\r\nagain. They were in all respects like those we had seen on Lagoon Island,\r\nand Armed with Clubs and long Pikes like them. At 1/2 past 6 a.m. Saw a\r\nsmall Island to the Northward, hauled our wind for it, and soon got close\r\nin with it. It is about 3 or 4 Miles in Circuit, and very low, with a\r\nPond in the Middle. There is some wood upon it, but no inhabitants but\r\nBirds, and for this reason is called Bird Island.* (* Reitoru.) It lies\r\nin the latitude 17 degrees 48 minutes and longitude 143 degrees 35\r\nminutes West, and West 1/2 North 10 Leagues from the West end of the two\r\nGroups. The birds we saw were Men-of-War Birds and several other sorts.\r\nWind East; course North 66 degrees West; distance 66 miles; latitude 17\r\ndegrees 48 minutes South, longitude 143 degrees 31 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 8th. Fresh Trade and pleasant weather, but about noon had a few\r\nflying showers of rain. Variation 6 degrees 32 minutes East. Wind East by\r\nSouth and East; course North 87 degrees West; distance 100 miles;\r\nlatitude 17 degrees 43 minutes South, longitude 145 degrees 16 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSunday, 9th. A steady fresh gale and pleasant weather. At 2 p.m. saw Land\r\nto the Northward, hauld up for it, and found it to be a double range of\r\nlow woody islands joined together by reefs, by which means they make one\r\nIsland in form of an Ellipsis or Oval, in the Middle of which is a Salt\r\nwater lake. The small Islands and reefs circumscribes or bounds this lake\r\nlike a Chain; it is therefore called Chain Island.* (* Anaa.) It is in\r\nlength, North-West and South-East, about 5 Leagues, and in breadth about\r\n5 Miles. The middle of it lies in the Latitude of 17 degrees 23 minutes\r\nSouth, and Longitude 145 degrees 54 minutes West, and West by North 45\r\nLeagues from Bird Island. Variation per Several Azimuths 4 degrees 54\r\nminutes East. Wind East by North to North by East; course West,\r\nNortherly; distance 81 miles; latitude 17 degrees 42 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 146 degrees 40 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 10th. P.M. moderate breezes and cloudy; in the Night, dark,\r\ncloudy, unsettled weather, with very much Thunder, Lightning, and rain.\r\nA.M. little wind and fair. P.M. variation per Several Azimuths 5 degrees\r\n41 minutes East. At 8 a.m. saw Osnaburg Island* (* Maitea, the\r\neasternmost of the Society Islands, which are all high, and a great\r\ncontrast to the low coral atolls of the Paumotus.) (so called by Captain\r\nWallis, the first discoverer) bearing North-West by West, distance 4 or 5\r\nLeagues. It is a high round Island, and appears to be not above a League\r\nin Circuit, and when it bears as above it looks like a high Crown'd Hatt,\r\nbut when it bears North the Top is more like the roof of a House. It lies\r\nin the Latitude of 17 degrees 48 minutes South and Longitude 148 degrees\r\n10 minutes West, and West by South, 44 Leagues, from Chain Island. Wind\r\nNorth-North-West, variable, North-West by North; course South 13 degrees\r\nWest; distance 67 miles; latitude 18 degrees 00 minutes South, longitude\r\n147 degrees 47 minutes West; at noon, Osnaburg Island North by West 1/2\r\nWest, 5 leagues.\r\n\r\n[Arrive at Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 11th. First part, little wind and cloudy; the remainder, little\r\nwind and very Variable; unsettled weather, with some rain. P.M. took\r\nseveral Observations of the sun and moon, which gave the Longitude of the\r\nship to be 148 degrees 18 minutes West, and differs but little from that\r\ngiven by the Log. At 6 a.m. saw King George's Island* (* So named by\r\nCaptain Wallis. The native name was ascertained by Cook, who spelt it\r\nOtaheite. Now known as Tahiti. It is the chief island of the Society\r\nGroup, and was annexed by the French in 1844.) Extending from West by\r\nSouth 1/2 South to West by North 1/2 North. It appeared very high and\r\nMountainous. Wind variable; course North 66 degrees West; distance 54\r\nmiles; latitude 17 degrees 38 minutes South, longitude 148 degrees 39\r\nminutes West; Osnaburg Island East 1/2 South, 13 leagues.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 12th. Variable, light Airs all these 24 Hours, and Hot sultry\r\nweather. At 5 p.m. King George's Island extending from North-West by West\r\nto South-West, distance 6 or 7 Leagues; and at 6 a.m. it bore from\r\nSouth-South-West to West by North, being little wind with Calms. Several\r\nof the Natives came off to us in their Canoes, but more to look at us\r\nthan anything else. We could not prevail with any of them to come on\r\nboard, and some would not come near the ship. Wind variable; course West;\r\ndistance 18 miles; latitude 17 degrees 38 minutes South, longitude 148\r\ndegrees 58 minutes West; at noon, King George's Island, from South to\r\nWest by North, 5 leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 13th. The first part Cloudy and Squally, with Showers of rain;\r\nremainder, genteel breezes and clear weather. At 4 p.m. the North-East\r\npoint of Royal Bay West 1/2 North; run under an easy sail all night, and\r\nhad soundings from 22 to 12 fathoms 2 or 3 Miles from the Shore. At 5\r\na.m. made sail for the bay, and at 7 anchored in 13 fathoms.* (* Matavai\r\nBay.) At this time we had but very few men upon the sick list, and these\r\nhad but slite complaints. The Ship's company had in general been very\r\nhealthy, owing in a great measure to the Sour kroutt, Portable Soup and\r\nMalt; the two first were served to the People, the one on Beef Days and\r\nthe other on Banyan Days. Wort was made of the Malt, and at the\r\ndiscretion of the Surgeon given to every man that had the least simptoms\r\nof Scurvy upon him. By this means, and the Care and Vigilance of Mr.\r\nMonkhouse, the Surgeon, this disease was prevented from getting a footing\r\nin the Ship. The Sour Kroutt, the Men at first would not eat it, until I\r\nput it in practice--a method I never once Knew to fail with seamen--and\r\nthis was to have some of it dressed every day for the Cabin Table, and\r\npermitted all the Officers, without exception, to make use of it, and\r\nleft it to the Option of the men either to take as much as they pleased\r\nor none at all; but this practice was not continued above a Week before I\r\nfound it necessary to put every one on board to an allowance; for such\r\nare the Tempers and disposition of Seamen in general that whatever you\r\ngive them out of the common way--altho' it be ever so much for their\r\ngood--it will not go down, and you will hear nothing but murmurings\r\nagainst the Man that first invented it; but the moment they see their\r\nsuperiors set a value upon it, it becomes the finest stuff in the world\r\nand the inventor an honest fellow. Wind easterly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. TAHITI.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE OCCURRENCES, ETC., AT GEORGE'S ISLAND.\r\n\r\n[At Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nNOTE. The way of reckoning the day in Sea Journals is from Noon to Noon,\r\nbut as the most material transaction at this Island must hapen in the Day\r\ntime, this method will be attended with ill conveniences in inserting the\r\ntransactions of each day; for this reason I shall during our stay at this\r\nIsland, but no longer, reckon the day according to the Civil account that\r\nis to begin and end at Midnight.\r\n\r\nWe had no sooner come to an Anchor in Royal Bay, as before-mentioned,\r\nthan a great number of the Natives in their Canoes came off to the Ship\r\nand brought with them Cocoa Nuts, etc.; these they seem'd to set a great\r\nvalue upon. Amongst those that came off to the Ship was an elderly man\r\nwhose Name was Owhaa, him the Gentlemen that had been here before in the\r\nDolphin* (* Lieutenant Gore and Mr. Molineux, the Master.) knew and had\r\noften spoke of as one that had been of Service to them. This man\r\n(together with some others) I took on board and made much of, thinking\r\nthat he might on some occasions be of use to us. As our stay at this\r\nplace was not likely to be very short, I thought it very necessary that\r\nsome order should be observed in Traficking with the Natives, that such\r\nMerchandize as we had on board for that purpose might continue to bear a\r\nproper value, and not leave it to everyone's own particular fancy, which\r\ncould not fail to bring on Confusion and Quarrels between us and the\r\nNatives, and would infallibly lessen the value of such Articles as we had\r\nto trafick with. In Order to prevent this, the following rules were\r\nordered to be Observed; viz.:--\r\n\r\nRules to be observed by every person in or belonging to His Majesty's\r\nBark the Endeavour for the better Establishing a regular and uniform\r\nTrade for Provisions, etc., with the Inhabitants of George's Island:--\r\n\r\n1. To endeavour by every fair means to Cultivate a Friendship with the\r\nNatives, and to treat them with all imaginable humanity.\r\n\r\n2. A Proper Person or Persons will be appointed to Trade with the Natives\r\nfor all manner of Provisions, Fruits, and other Productions of the Earth;\r\nand no Officer or Seaman or other person belonging to the Ship, excepting\r\nsuch as are so appointed, shall Trade or offer to Trade for any sort of\r\nProvisions, Fruit or other Productions of the Earth, unless they have my\r\nleave so to do.\r\n\r\n3. Every Person employ'd on shore on any duty whatsoever is strictly to\r\nattend to the same, and if by neglect he looseth any of His Arms or\r\nworking Tools, or suffers them to be stole, the full value thereof will\r\nbe charged against his pay, according to the Custom of the Navy in such\r\nCases, and he shall receive such further punishment as the nature of the\r\nOffence may deserve.\r\n\r\n4. The same Penalty will be inflicted upon every person who is found to\r\nEmbezzle, Trade, or Offer to Trade with any of the Ship's Stores of what\r\nNature so ever.\r\n\r\n5. No sort of Iron or anything that is made of Iron, or any sort of Cloth\r\nor other useful or necessary Articles, are to be given in Exchange for\r\nanything but Provisions.\r\n\r\nJ.C.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Ship was properly secured I went on shore, accompanied by\r\nMr. Banks and the other Gentlemen,* (* Cook generally uses this term for\r\nthe civilians on board.) with a Party of Men under Arms; we took along\r\nwith us Owhaa--who took us to the place where the Dolphin watered, and\r\nmade signs to us as well as we could understand that we might Occupy that\r\nground, but it hapned not to be fit for our purpose. No one of the\r\nNatives made the least opposition at our landing, but came to us with all\r\nimaginable Marks of Friendship and Submission. We Afterwards made a\r\nCircuit through the Woods, and then came on board. We did not find the\r\ninhabitants to be numerous, and we imagin'd that several of them had fled\r\nfrom their habitations upon our Arrival in the Bay.\r\n\r\nFriday, 14th. This morning we had a great many Canoes about the Ship; the\r\nmost of them came from the Westward, and brought nothing with them but a\r\nfew Cocoa Nuts, etc. Two that appeared to be Chiefs we had on board,\r\ntogether with several others, for it was a hard matter to keep them out\r\nof the Ship, as they Climb like Munkeys; but it was still harder to keep\r\nthem from Stealing but everything that came within their reach; in this\r\nthey are Prodigious Expert. I made each of these two Chiefs a present of\r\na Hatchet, things that they seemed mostly to value. As soon as we had\r\npartly got clear of these People I took 2 Boats and went to the Westward,\r\nall the Gentlemen being along with me. My design was to see if there was\r\nnot a more commodious Harbour, and to try the disposition of the Natives,\r\nhaving along with us the 2 Chiefs above mentioned; the first place we\r\nlanded at was in great Canoe Harbour (so called by Captain Wallis); here\r\nthe Natives Flocked about us in great numbers, and in as friendly a\r\nmanner as we could wish, only that they show'd a great inclination to\r\nPick our Pockets. We were conducted to a Chief, who for distinction sake\r\nwe called Hurcules. After staying a short time with him, and distributing\r\na few Presents about us, we proceeded farther, and came to a Chief who I\r\nshall call Lycurgus; this man entertained us with broil'd fish, Cocoa\r\nNutts, etc., with great Hospitality, and all the time took great care to\r\ntell us to take care of our Pockets, as a great number of People had\r\ncrowded about us. Notwithstanding the care we took, Dr. Solander and Dr.\r\nMonkhouse had each of them their Pockets picked: the one of his spy glass\r\nand the other of his snuff Box. As soon as Lycurgus was made acquainted\r\nwith the Theft he dispers'd the people in a moment, and the method he\r\nmade use of was to lay hold on the first thing that came in his way and\r\nthrow it at them, and happy was he or she that could get first out of his\r\nway. He seem'd very much concern'd for what had hapned, and by way of\r\nrecompence offered us but everything that was in his House; but we\r\nrefused to accept of anything, and made signs to him that we only wanted\r\nthe things again. He had already sent people out after them, and it was\r\nnot long before they were return'd. We found the Natives very numerous\r\nwherever we came, and from what we could judge seemed very peacably\r\ninclin'd. About six o'Clock in the evening we return'd on board, very\r\nwell satisfied with our little Excursion.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 15th. Winds at East during the day, in the Night a light breeze\r\noff the land; and as I apprehend it be usual here for the Trade wind to\r\nblow during a great part of the day from the Eastern Board, and to have\r\nit Calm or light breezes from the land that is Southerly during the night\r\nwith fair weather, I shall only mention the wind and weather when they\r\ndeviate from this rule. This morning several of the Chiefs we had seen\r\nYesterday came on board, and brought with them Hogs, Bread fruit, etc.,\r\nand for these we gave them Hatchets, Linnen, and such things as they\r\nvalued. Having not met with yesterday a more Convenient situation for\r\nevery purpose we wanted than the place we now are, I therefore, without\r\ndelay, resolved to pitch upon some spot upon the North-East point of the\r\nBay, properly situated for observing the Transit of Venus, and at the\r\nsame time under the command of the Ship's Guns, and there to throw up a\r\nsmall fort for our defence. Accordingly I went ashore with a party of\r\nmen, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Mr. Green. We took along\r\nwith us one of Mr. Banks's Tents, and after we had fix'd upon a place fit\r\nfor our purpose we set up the Tent and marked out the ground we intended\r\nto Occupy. By this time a number of the Natives had got collected\r\ntogether about us, seemingly only to look on, as not one of them had any\r\nweapon, either Offensive or defensive. I would suffer none to come within\r\nthe lines I had marked out, excepting one who appeared to be a chief and\r\nold Owhaa--to these 2 men we endeavour'd to explain, as well as we could,\r\nthat we wanted that ground to Sleep upon such a number of nights and then\r\nwe should go away. Whether they understood us or no is uncertain, but no\r\none appeared the least displeased at what we was about; indeed the Ground\r\nwe had fixed upon was of no use to them, being part of the sandy Beach\r\nupon the shore of the Bay, and not near to any of their Habitations. It\r\nbeing too late in the day to do anything more, a party with a petty\r\nofficer was left to guard the Tent, while we with another party took a\r\nWalk into the woods, and with us most of the natives. We had but just\r\ncrossed the River when Mr. Banks shott three Ducks at one shott, which\r\nsurprised them so much that most of them fell down as though they had\r\nbeen shott likewise. I was in hopes this would have had some good effect,\r\nbut the event did not prove it, for we had not been long from the Tent\r\nbefore the natives again began to gather about, and one of them more\r\ndaring than the rest pushed one of the Centinels down, snatched the\r\nMusket out of his hand and made a push at him, and then made off, and\r\nwith him all the rest. Immediately upon this the Officer ordered the\r\nparty to fire, and the Man who took the musket was shot Dead before he\r\nhad got far from the Tent, but the musquet was carried quite off when\r\nthis hapned. I and Mr. Banks with the other party was about half a Mile\r\noff, returning out of the woods, upon hearing the firing of Muskets, and\r\nthe Natives leaving us at the same time, we Suspected that something was\r\nthe matter and hastened our march, but before we arrived the whole was\r\nover, and every one of the Natives fled except old Owhaa, who stuck by us\r\nthe whole time, and I believe from the first he either knew or had some\r\nsuspicion that the People would attempt something at the Tent, as he was\r\nvery much against our going into the Woods out of sight of the Tent.\r\nHowever, he might have other reasons, for Mr. Hicks, being ashore the day\r\nbefore, the natives would not permit him to go into the Woods. This made\r\nme resolved to go and see whether they meant to prescribe bounds to us or\r\nno. Old Owhaa, as I have said before, was the only one of the Natives\r\nthat stayed by us, and by his means we prevail'd on about 20 of them to\r\ncome to the Tent and there sit down with us, and Endeavour'd by every\r\nmeans in our power to Convince them that the Man was kill'd for taking\r\naway the Musket, and that we still would be friends with them. At sunset\r\nthey left us seemingly satisfied, and we struck our Tent and went on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nSunday, 16th. This day worked the Ship nearer the Shore and moored her in\r\nsuch a manner as to command all the shore of the North-East part of the\r\nBay, but more particularly the place where we intended to Erect a Fort.\r\nPunished Richard Hutchins, seaman, with 12 lashes for disobeying\r\ncommands. Several of the Natives came down to the shore of the Bay, but\r\nnot one of them came off to the Ship during the whole day. In the evening\r\nI went on shore with only a Boat's crew and some of the Gentlemen. The\r\nNatives gathered about us to the Number of about 30 or 40, and brought us\r\nCocoa Nuts, etc., and seemed as friendly as ever.\r\n\r\nMonday, 17th. At two o'Clock this morning, departed this life, Mr. Alex\r\nBuchan, Landskip Draftsman to Mr. Banks, a Gentleman well skill'd in his\r\nprofession and one that will be greatly missed in the Course of this\r\nVoyage. He had long been subject to a disorder in his Bowels, which had\r\nmore than once brought him to the very point of Death, and was at one\r\ntime subject to fits, of one of which he was taken on Saturday morning;\r\nthis brought on his former disorder, which put a Period to his life. Mr.\r\nBanks thought it not so advisable to Inter the Body ashore in a place\r\nwhere we were utter strangers to the Custom of the Natives on such\r\noccasions; it was therefore sent out to sea and committed to that Element\r\nwith all the decency the Circumstance of the place would admit of. This\r\nmorning several of the Chiefs from the westward made us a Visit: they\r\nbrought with them Emblems of Peace, which are Young Plantain Trees. These\r\nthey put on board the Ship before they would venture themselves. They\r\nbrought us a present of 2 Hogs (an Article we find here very Scarce) and\r\nsome Bread Fruit; for these they had Hatchets and other things. In the\r\nafternoon we set up one of the Ship's Tents ashore, and Mr. Green and\r\nmyself stay'd there the night to observe an eclipse of Jupiter's first\r\nSatilite, which we was hinder'd from seeing by Clouds.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 18th. Cloudy weather with some showers of rain. This morning\r\ntook as many people out of the Ship as could possibly be spared, and set\r\nabout Erecting a Fort. Some were employ'd in throughing up intrenchment,\r\nwhile others was cutting facines, Picquets, etc. The Natives were so far\r\nfrom hindering us that several of them assisted in bringing the Picquets\r\nand facines out of the woods, and seemed quite unconcern'd at what we was\r\nabout. The wood we made use of for this occasion we purchased of them,\r\nand we cut no Tree down before we had first obtained their Consent. By\r\nthis time all the Ship's sails were unbent and the Armourer's Forge set\r\nup to repair the Ironwork, etc. Served fresh Pork to the Ship's Company\r\nto-day for the first time. This is like to be a very scarce Article with\r\nus, but as to Bread fruit, Cocoa Nutts and Plaintains, the Natives supply\r\nus with as much as we can destroy.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 19th. This morning Lycurgus, whose real name is\r\nToobouratomita, came with his family from the Westward in order, from\r\nwhat we could understand, to live near us. He brought with him the cover\r\nof a House, with several other Materials for building one. We intend to\r\nrequite the confidence this man seems to put in us by treating him with\r\nall imaginable kindness. Got on shore some Empty Casks, which we placed\r\nin a double row along the Bank of the River, by way of a breast work on\r\nthat side.\r\n\r\nThursday, 20th. Wind at South-East and Squally, with rain. All hands\r\nemploy'd on shore, and nothing remarkable, excepting a Hog weighing about\r\n90 pound was brought alongside the Ship for Sale, but those who brought\r\nit would not part with it for anything we could offer them but a\r\nCarpenter's broad axe, and this was what we could not part with; they\r\ncarried it away. Thus we see those very People who but 2 years ago\r\nprefer'd a spike Nail to an Axe of any Sort, have so far learnt the use\r\nof them that they will not part with a Pig of 10 or 12 pounds weight for\r\nanything under a Hatchet, and even those of an inferior or small sort are\r\nof no great esteem with them, and small Nails such as 10 penny, 20 penny,\r\nor any under 40 penny, are of no value at all; but beads, particularly\r\nwhite cut glass beads, are much valued by them. Mr. Banks and Dr.\r\nSolander lays ashore to-night for the first time, their Markee's being\r\nset up within the Walls of the Fort and fit for their reception.\r\n\r\nFriday, 21st. Got the Copper Oven ashore and fixed it in the bank of the\r\nbreastwork. Yesterday, as Mr. Green and Dr. Monkhouse were taking a walk,\r\nthey happened to meet with the Body of the Man we had shott, as the\r\nNatives made them fully understand; the manner in which the body was\r\ninterred being a little extraordinary. I went to-day, with some others,\r\nto see it. Close by the House wherein he resided when living was built a\r\nsmall shed, but whether for the purpose or no I cannot say, for it was in\r\nall respects like some of the Sheds or Houses they live in. This shed was\r\nabout 14 or 16 feet long, 10 or 12 broad, and of a proportionable height.\r\nOne end was wholy open, the other end and two sides was partly inclosed\r\nwith a kind of wicker'd work. In this Shed lay the Corps, upon a Bier or\r\nframe of wood, with a matted bottom, like a Cott frame used at Sea, and\r\nSupported by 4 Posts about 5 feet from the Ground. The body was cover'd\r\nwith a Matt, and over that a white Cloth; alongside of the Body lay a\r\nwooden Club, one of their Weapons of War. The Head of the Corps lay next\r\nthe close end of the Shed, and at this end lay 2 Cocoa Nutt Shells, such\r\nas they sometimes use to carry water in; at the other end of the Shed was\r\na Bunch of Green leaves, with some dry'd twigs tied all together and\r\nstuck in the Ground, and a stone lying by them as big as a Cocoa Nutt.\r\nNear to these lay a young Plaintain Tree, such as they use as Emblems of\r\nPeace, and by it lay a stone Axe. At the open end of the Shed was stuck\r\nupwright in the ground the Stem of a Plaintain Tree about 5 feet high, on\r\nthe Top of which stood a Cocoa Nutt shell full of fresh water, and on the\r\nside of the post hung a small Bag, wherein was a few pieces of Bread\r\nFruit roasted ready for eating. Some of the pieces were fresh and others\r\nStale. The Natives did not seem to like that we should go near the body,\r\nand stood at a little distance themselves while we examin'd these\r\nmatters, and appeared to be pleased when we came away. It certainly was\r\nno very agreeable place, for it stunk intollerably, and yet it was not\r\nabove 10 yards from the Huts wherein several of the living resided. The\r\nfirst day we landed we saw the Skeleton of a human being laying in this\r\nmanner under a shade that was just big enough to cover it, and some days\r\nafter that, when some of the Gentlemen went with a design to examine it\r\nmore narrowly, it was gone. It was at this time thought that this manner\r\nof interring their Dead was not common to all ranks of People, as this\r\nwas the first we had seen Except the Skeleton just mentioned; but various\r\nwere the opinions concerning the Provisions, etc., laid about the Dead.\r\nUpon the whole, it should seem that these people not only believe in a\r\nSupreem being, but in a future state also, and this must be meant either\r\nas an Offering to some Deitie or for the use of the Dead in the other\r\nworld; but this latter is not very probable, as there appeared to be no\r\nPriest Craft in the thing, for whatever Provisions were put there it\r\nappeared very plain to us that there it remain'd until it consumed away\r\nof itself. It is most likely that we shall see more of this before we\r\nleave the Island, but if it is a Religious ceremony we may not be able to\r\nunderstand it, for the Misteries of most Religions are very Dark and not\r\neasily understood, even by those who profess them.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 22nd, to Thursday, 27th. Nothing worthy of Note Hapned. The\r\npeople were Continually at work upon the Fort,* (* Near the site of this\r\nFort is still a Tamarind Tree, planted by Captain Cook. All visitors to\r\nTahiti go to see \"Cook's Tamarind.\") and the Natives were so far\r\nreconciled to us that they rather assisted us than not. This day we\r\nmounted 6 Swivels at the Fort, which was now nearly finished. This struck\r\nthe Natives with some fear, and some fishermen who lived upon the point\r\nmoved farther off, and old Owhaa told us by signs that after 4 days we\r\nshould fire Great Guns from the Ship. There were some other Circumstances\r\nco-operated with this man's prophecy, whether an opinion hath prevailed\r\namongst them that after that time we intend to fire upon them, or that\r\nthey intend to Attack us, we know not: the first we do not intend unless\r\nthe latter takes place, which is highly improbable.\r\n\r\nFriday, 28th. This morning a great number of the natives came to us in\r\ntheir Canoes from differant parts of the Island, several of whom we had\r\nnot seen before. One of these was the Woman called by the Dolphins the\r\nQueen of this Island; she first went to Mr. Banks's tent at the fort,\r\nwhere she was not known, till the Master, happening to go ashore, who\r\nknew her, and brought her on board with 2 Men and several Women, who\r\nseem'd to be all of her family. I made them all some presents or other,\r\nbut to Oberiea (for that is this Woman's name) I gave several things, in\r\nreturn for which, as soon as I went on shore with her, she gave me a Hog\r\nand several Bunches of plaintains. These she caused to be carried from\r\nher Canoes up to the Fort in a kind of Procession, she and I bringing up\r\nthe rear. This Woman is about 40 years of Age, and, like most of the\r\nother Women, very Masculine. She is head or chief of her own family or\r\nTribe, but to all appearance hath no Authority over the rest of the\r\nInhabitants, whatever she might have when the Dolphin was here. Hercules,\r\nwhose real Name is Tootaha, is, to all appearance, the Chief Man of the\r\nIsland, and hath generally visited us twice a week since we have been\r\nhere, and came always attended by a number of Canoes and people; and at\r\nthose times we were sure to have a supply, more or less, of everything\r\nthe Island afforded, both from himself and from those that came with him,\r\nand it is a Chance thing that we get a Hog at any other time. He was with\r\nus at this Time, and did not appear very well pleased at the Notice we\r\ntook of Oberiea.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 29th. This day got the 4 guns out of the Hold, and Mounted 2 of\r\nthem on the Quarter Deck and the other 2 in the Fort on the Bank of the\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nSunday, 30th. This being the day that Owhaa told us that we should fire\r\nour Guns, no one of us went from the Fort; however, the day passed over\r\nwithout any Visible alteration in the behaviour of any one of the\r\nNatives.\r\n\r\n[May 1769.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 1st May. This morning Tootaha came on board the Ship, and was\r\nvery Desireous of seeing into every Chest and Drawer that was in the\r\nCabin. I satisfied his curiosity so far as to open most of those that\r\nbelong'd to me. He saw several things that he took a fancy to, and\r\ncollected them together; but at last he Cast his eyes upon the Adze I had\r\nfrom Mr. Stephens* (* The Secretary of the Admiralty.) that was made in\r\nimitation of one of their Stone Adzes or Axes.* (* The stone adzes of\r\nTahiti were of excellent workmanship.) The Moment he lays his hands upon\r\nit he of his own accord put away everything he had got before, and ask'd\r\nme if I would give him that, which I very readily did, and he went away\r\nwithout asking for any one thing more, which I by experience knew was a\r\nsure sign that he was well pleased with what he had got.\r\n\r\nThis day one of the Natives, who appeared to be a Chief, dined with us,\r\nas he had done some days before; but then there were always some Women\r\npresent, and one or another of them put the Victuals into his Mouth, but\r\nthis day there hapned to be none to Perform that Office. When he was\r\nhelp'd to victuals and desir'd to eat, he sat in the Chair like a\r\nStatute, without once attempting to put a Morsel to his mouth, and would\r\ncertainly have gone without his dinner if one of the Servants had not fed\r\nhim. We have often found the women very officious in feeding us, from\r\nwhich it would seem that it is the Custom on some occasions for them to\r\nfeed the Chiefs. However, this is the only instance of that kind we have\r\nseen, or that they could not help themselves as well as any of us.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon we set up the Observatory and took the Astronomical\r\nQuadrant ashore for the first time, together with some other Instruments,\r\nthe fort being now finished and made as Tenantable as the time, Nature,\r\nand situation of the Ground and Materials we had to work upon would admit\r\nof. The North and South parts consisted of a Bank of Earth 4 1/2 feet\r\nhigh on the inside, and a Ditch without, 10 feet broad and 6 feet deep;\r\non the West side facing the Bay a Bank of Earth 4 feet high, and\r\nPalisades upon that, but no Ditch, the works being at high-water mark. On\r\nthe East side upon the Bank of the river was placed a double row of\r\nCasks, and, as this was the weakest side, the 2 four Pounders were\r\nplanted there, and the whole was defended, beside these 2 Guns, with 6\r\nSwivels, and generally about 45 Men with small Arms, including the\r\nOfficers and Gentlemen who resided ashore. I now thought myself perfectly\r\nsecure from anything these people would attempt.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 2nd. This morning, about 9 o'Clock, when Mr. Green and I went to\r\nset up the Quadrant, it was not to be found. It had never been taken out\r\nof the Packing Case (which was about 18 Inches square) since it came from\r\nMr. Bird, the Maker; and the whole was pretty heavy, so that it was a\r\nmatter of Astonishment to us all how it could be taken away, as a\r\nCentinal stood the whole night within 5 Yards of the door of the Tent,\r\nwhere it was put, together with several other Instruments; but none of\r\nthem was missing but this. However, it was not long before we got\r\ninformation that one of the Natives had taken it away and carried it to\r\nthe Eastward. Immediately a resolution was taken to detain all the large\r\nCanoes that were in the Bay, and to seize upon Tootaha and some others of\r\nthe principal people, and keep them in Custody until the Quadrant was\r\nproduced; but this last we did not think proper immediately to put in\r\nExecution, as we had only Oberiea in our power, and the detaining of her\r\nby force would have alarm'd all the rest. In the meantime, Mr. Banks (who\r\nis always very alert upon all occasions wherein the Natives are\r\nconcern'd) and Mr. Green went into the Woods to enquire of Toobouratomita\r\nwhich way and where the Quadrant was gone. I very soon was inform'd that\r\nthese 3 was gone to the Eastward in quest of it, and some time after I\r\nfollowed myself with a small party of Men; but before I went away I gave\r\norders that if Tootaha came either to the Ship or the Fort he was not to\r\nbe detain'd, for I found he had no hand in taking away the Quadrant, and\r\nthat there was almost a Certainty of getting it again. I met Mr. Banks\r\nand Mr. Green about 4 miles from the Fort, returning with the Quadrant.\r\nThis was about Sun set, and we all got back to the Fort about 8 o'Clock,\r\nwhere I found Tootaha in Custody, and a number of the Natives crowding\r\nabout the Gate of the Fort. My going into the Woods with a party of Arm'd\r\nmen so alarmed the Natives that in the evening they began to move off\r\nwith their Effects, and a Double Canoe putting off from the Bottom of the\r\nBay was ohserv'd by the Ship, and a Boat sent after her. In this Canoe\r\nhapned to be Tootaha, and as soon as our Boat came up with her, he and\r\nall the people that were in the Canoe jump'd overboard, and he only was\r\ntaken up and brought on board the Ship, together with the Canoe; the rest\r\nwere permitted to swim to the Shore. From the Ship Tootaha was sent to\r\nthe Fort, where Mr. Hicks thought proper to detain him until I return'd.\r\nThe Scene between Toobouratomita and Tootaha, when the former came into\r\nthe Fort and found the latter in Custody, was really moving. They wept\r\nover each other for some time. As for Tootaha, he was so far prepossessed\r\nwith the thought that he was to be kill'd that he could not be made\r\nsencible to the Contrary till he was carried out of the Fort to the\r\npeople, many of whom Expressed their joy by embracing him; and, after\r\nall, he would not go away until he had given us two Hogs, notwithstanding\r\nwe did all in our power to hinder him, for it is very certain that the\r\nTreatment he had meet with from us did not merit such a reward. However,\r\nwe had it in our power to make him a present of equal value whenever we\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 3rd. Very early this morning Tootaha sent for the Canoe we had\r\ndetained yesterday, and in the Afternoon sent a man for an Axe and a\r\nShirt in return for the Hogs he gave us last night; but as this man told\r\nus that Tootaha would not come near us himself in less than 10 days, we\r\nthought proper not to send them, to try if he would not come himself for\r\nthem sooner.\r\n\r\nThursday, 4th. Some people came to the Fort to-day from York Island; one\r\nof them gave us an account of 22 Islands lying in this Neighbourhood. Set\r\nup the 2 Clocks; one in the Tent wherein Mr. Green and I lay, and the\r\nother in the Observatory. This evening Tootaha sent a man again for the\r\nAxe and Shirt, and we sent him word by the same man that Mr. Banks and I\r\nwould come and see him to-morrow and bring them along with us, for it now\r\nbecame necessary that we should take some steps to reconcile this man to\r\nus in order to procure a sufficient supply of Bread fruit, and Cocoa\r\nNuts, which we have not had for these 2 days past, owing, as we\r\napprehend, to Tootaha not being reconciled to us, or otherwise the people\r\ntake this method to shew their resentment of the Treatment their Chief\r\nmeet with.\r\n\r\nFriday, 5th. Early this morning Tootaha sent some of his people to put us\r\nin mind of our promise, and these seem'd very uneasy until we set out,\r\nwhich Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and myself did about 10 o'clock in the\r\nPinnace, having one of these men with us. As soon as we came to Appara,\r\nthe place where Tootaha resided, we saw a great number of People at the\r\nlanding place near his House; one among them, who had a large Turban\r\nabout his Head, and a long white stick in his Hand, drove the others from\r\nthe landing place by beating them with his Stick, and throwing stones at\r\nthem, and at the same time directed us whereabouts to land. After we had\r\nlanded he conducted us to the Chief, but in this there was no order,\r\neveryone crowded upon us crying out \"Tyo Tootaha,\" this Tootaha was our\r\nFriend. We found the chief setting in the shade under a large Tree, with\r\na Circle of old men round him; he made us set down by him, and\r\nimmediately asked for the Axe. I then gave him one, together with an\r\nupper Garment made of Broad Cloth after their Fashion, and a Shirt. The\r\nGarment he put on, but the Shirt he gave to the man who first received us\r\nat landing, who was now seated by us, and the Chief seemed desirous that\r\nwe should take particular notice of him. By that Time Obaria, and several\r\nother women whom we knew, came and sat down by us. Tootaha did not stay\r\nlong before he went away, as we thought to show himself to the people in\r\nhis new Dress. He was not gone long before he return'd and took his seat\r\nagain for a few minutes, then went away again, as we was told, to order\r\nsomething to be got for us to Eat, and at this time we gladly would have\r\ngone too, being almost Suffocated with the Crowd that was about us.\r\nHowever, here we remained for about 10 Minutes longer, when word was\r\nbrought us that the Chief wanted us. We were then conducted to our own\r\nBoat, where we found him setting alone under the Awning. He made signs to\r\nus to come to him, which we did, and as many with us as the Boat would\r\nhold. Here he ordered some Bread fruit and Cocoa Nut to be brought, of\r\nboth of which we tasted.\r\n\r\nAfter we had set here sometime, a Message was brought to the Chief, who\r\nimmediately went out of the Boat, and we was desired to follow, and was\r\nconducted to a large Aria or Court Yard on one side of his House, where\r\nwe were entertained with Public wrestling. Tootaha seated himself at one\r\nend of the place, and several of his Principal men sat round him in a\r\nSemicircle. We were desir'd to sit down here likewise, but we rather\r\nchose to walk about. Everything being now ready, several men entered the\r\nTheater, 8, 10, or 12, sometimes more. These walked about in a Stooping\r\nPoster, with their left hand upon their right breast, and with their\r\nRight hand Open struck with a smack their left Arm and fore-arm. In this\r\nmanner they walked about until one Challenged another, which was done by\r\nmotion and jesture, without speaking one word. The 2 Antagonists would\r\nthen meet and endeavour to seize each other by the thighs, but if that\r\nfail'd they would seize each other by the Hair of the Head or wherever\r\nthey could, and then Wrestle together until by main Strength the one or\r\nthe other was thrown on his back. This was always (Except once) followed\r\nby three Huzzas from some old men who sat in the House, and at the same\r\ntime another Company of men would dance for about a Minute, the Wrestlers\r\nall the time continuing their game without taking the least notice of\r\nanything else. The only dexterity the Wrestlers seemed to make use of was\r\nin first seizing each other, for after they had closed it was all decided\r\nby Main strength. It would sometimes happen that neither the one nor the\r\nother could throw his Antagonist; in this Case they would either part by\r\nmutual consent or were parted by others. The Conqueror never exulted over\r\nthe Conquer'd, neither did the Conquer'd ever repine at his ill luck, but\r\nthe whole was carried on with great good Humour. There were present,\r\nYoung and old, near 500 People. The women do not seem to partake of this\r\ndiversion, only some few of the Principal ones were present, and that\r\nappeared to be owing to us being there.\r\n\r\nAfter this was over we were given to understand that we were to go to\r\nDinner, and were desired to follow Tootaha, who led us into our own Boat,\r\nand soon after came a small Pig ready roasted, with some Bread Fruit and\r\nCocoa Nuts. Here we thought we were to have dined, but Tootaha, after\r\nwaiting about 10 Minutes, made signs to us to put off the Boat and go a\r\nBoard, which we did, and bring him and Toobouratomida along with us. As\r\nsoon as we got on board we all dined on the Cheer the Chief had provided.\r\nWe soon found the good effects of having made friends with this man, for\r\nit was no sooner known to the Natives that he was on board the Ship than\r\nthey brought Bread Fruit, Cocoa Nuts, etc., to the Fort.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 6th; Sunday, 7th. Nothing remarkable, only that the Natives\r\nsupply us with as much bread fruits and Cocoa Nuts as we can destroy.\r\n\r\nMonday, 8th. Early this morning the Master went to the Eastward in the\r\nPinnace to try if he could procure some Hogs and Fowls from that Quarter;\r\nbut he return'd in the evening without success. He saw but very few, and\r\nthose the inhabitants pretended belonged to Tootaha; so great is this\r\nman's influence or authority over them that they dare part with nothing\r\nwithout his Consent, or otherwise they use his Name to Excuse themselves\r\nfrom parting with the few they have, for it is very certain these things\r\nare in no great plenty with them.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 9th; Wednesday, 10th; Thursday, 11th. Nothing remarkable hapned\r\nfor these three days. Oberiea, the Dolphin's queen, made us a Visit for\r\nthe first time since the Quadrant was Stolen. She introduced herself with\r\na Small Pig, for which she had a Hatchet, and as soon as she got it she\r\nLugg'd out a Broken Axe, and several pieces of Old Iron. These, I\r\nbelieve, she must have had from the Dolphin; the Axe she wanted to be\r\nmended, and Axes made of the old iron. I obliged her in the first, but\r\nexcused myself in the latter: since the Natives had seen the Forge at\r\nwork they have frequently brought pieces of Iron to be made into one sort\r\nof Tool or other, which hath generally been done whenever it did not\r\nhinder our own work--being willing to Oblige them in everything in my\r\npower. These Pieces of old Iron the Natives must have got from the\r\nDolphin, as we know of no other Ship being here;* (* M. de Bougainville,\r\nin the French ships La Boudeuse and L'Etoile, had visited Tahiti the year\r\nbefore, after its discovery by the Dolphin. He was unfortunate in his\r\nchoice of anchorage, and his ships lost anchors and got into various\r\ndifficulties. The crews were also much afflicted with scurvy.) and very\r\nprobable some from us, for there is no species of Theft they will not\r\ncommit to get this Article, and I may say the same of the common Seamen\r\nwhen in these parts.\r\n\r\nFriday, 12th. Cloudy weather with Showers of rain. This morning a Man and\r\n2 Young Women, with some others, came to the Fort, whom we had not seen\r\nbefore, and as their manner of introducing themselves was a little\r\nuncommon, I shall insert it. Mr. Banks was as usual at the gate of the\r\nFort trading with the people, when he was told that some Strangers were\r\ncoming, and therefore stood to receive them. The Company had with them\r\nabout a Dozen young Plantain Trees, and some other small Plants, these\r\nthey laid down about 20 feet from Mr. Banks; the people then made a Lane\r\nbetween him and them. When this was done the Man (who appeared to be only\r\na Servant to the two Women) brought the young Plantains singly, together\r\nwith some of the other plants, and gave them to Mr. Banks, and at the\r\ndelivery of each pronounced a Short sentence which we understood not.\r\nAfter he had thus disposed of all his plantain trees, he took several\r\npieces of Cloth and spread them on the ground. One of the Young women\r\nthen stepp'd upon the Cloth, and with as much innocency as one could\r\npossibly conceive, exposed herself, entirely naked, from the waist\r\ndownwards; in this manner she turn'd herself once or twice round, I am\r\nnot certain which, then stepped off the cloth, and dropp'd down her\r\nCloaths. More Cloth was then spread upon the former, and she again\r\nperformed the same Ceremony. The Cloth was then rowled up and given to\r\nMr. Banks, and the two Young women went and Embraced him, which ended the\r\nCeremony.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 13th. Nothing worthy of Note hapned during the day; in the\r\nNight one of the Natives attempted to get into the Fort by Climbing over\r\nthe Wall, but, being discovered by the Centinel, he made off. The Iron\r\nand Iron Tools daily in use at the Armourer's Forge are Temptations that\r\nthese people cannot possibly withstand.\r\n\r\nSunday, 14th. This day we performed divine Service in one of the Tents in\r\nthe fort, where several of the Natives attended and behaved with great\r\ndecency the whole time. This day closed with an odd sceen at the Gate of\r\nthe Fort, where a young Fellow above 6 feet high made love to a little\r\nGirl about 10 or 12 years of Age publickly before several of our people\r\nand a number of the Natives. What makes me mention this is because it\r\nappear'd to be done according to Custom, for there were several women\r\npresent, particularly Obariea and several others of the better sort, and\r\nthese were so far from showing the least disapprobation that they\r\ninstructed the Girl how she should Act her part, who, young as she was,\r\ndid not seem to want it.\r\n\r\nMonday, 15th. Winds variable and cloudy weather. Last Night one of our\r\nWater Casks was taken away from the outside of the Fort, where they stood\r\nfull of water. In the morning there was not one of the Natives but what\r\nknew it was gone; yet, Contrary to what we had always met with on these\r\nOccasions, not one of them would give us any information about it, and I\r\nthought it of too little Consequence to take any methods to Oblige them.\r\nIn the evening Toobouratomida and his Wife, and a Man belonging to\r\nTootaha, would needs lay all Night by the Casks to prevent any more from\r\nbeing taken away; but, as we had placed a Centinel there, this care of\r\ntheirs became unnecessary, and they were prevailed upon to go home; but\r\nbefore they went away they made signs to the Centinel to keep his Eyes\r\nopen. From this it should seem that they knew that an attempt would be\r\nmade in the night to take away more, which would have been done had not\r\nthe Centinel prevented it.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 16th. Winds Westerly. The morning cloudy, with heavy showers of\r\nrain; the Remainder of the day fair weather. From this day nothing\r\nremarkable hapned until\r\n\r\nMonday, 22nd, which was usher'd in with thick Cloudy weather, and\r\nExcessive hard Showers of rain and very much Thunder and Lightning, which\r\nContinued the Greater part of the day.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 23rd. Wind Southerly and fair weather in the Forenoon, but in\r\nthe Afternoon Showers. We have had a Scarcity of all sorts of Fruit for\r\nthese 2 days past, which we immagine to be owing to the Wet weather.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 24th. Fine clear weather all this day. Having found the Long\r\nboat Leakey for these few days past, we hauld her ashore to-day to stop\r\nthe leakes, when, to our great surprise, we found her bottom so much\r\nEaten by the Worms that it was necessary to give her a new one, and all\r\nthe Carpenters were immediately set to work upon her.\r\n\r\nThursday, 25th. Most part of these 24 hours Cloudy, with frequent Showers\r\nof Rain.\r\n\r\nFriday, 26th. Some flying showers again. This morning we hauled the\r\npinnace a Shore to examine her bottom, and had the Satisfaction to find\r\nthat not one worm had touched it, notwithstanding she hath been in the\r\nwater nearly as long as the Long Boat. This must be owing to the White\r\nLead with which her bottom is painted, the Long boats being paid with\r\nVarnish of Pine, for no other reason can be assign'd why the one should\r\nbe preserved and the other destroy'd, when they are both built on the\r\nSame sort of Wood and have been in equal use. From this Circumstance\r\nalone the Bottom of all Boats sent into Countrys where these worms are\r\nought to be painted with White Lead, and the Ships supply'd with a good\r\nstock in order to give them a New Coat whenever it's necessary. By this\r\nmeans they would be preserved free from these destructive Vermin. The\r\nLong boat's Bottom being so much destroy'd appear'd a little\r\nextraordinary, as the Dolphin's Launch was in the Water at this very\r\nplace full as long, and no such thing happened to her, as the Officers\r\nthat were in the Dolphin say.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 27th. Winds variable and fair weather.\r\n\r\nSunday, 28th. Winds Southerly and clear weather. This morning myself, Mr.\r\nBanks, and Dr. Solander set out in the Pinnace to pay Tootaha a Visit,\r\nwho had moved from Apparra to the South-West part of the island. What\r\ninduced us to make him this visit was a Message we had received from him\r\nsome days ago importing that if we would go to him he would give us\r\nseveral Hogs. We had no great faith in this, yet we were resolved to try,\r\nand set out accordingly. It was Night before we reached the place where\r\nhe was, and, as we had left the Boat about half-way behind us, we were\r\nobliged to take up our Quarters with him for the Night. The Chief\r\nreceived us in a Friendly manner, and a Pig was ordered to be killed and\r\ndressed for Supper; but we saved his Life for the present, thinking it\r\nwould do us more service in another place, and we supped on Fruit and\r\nwhat else we could get. Here was, along with the Chief, Obariea and many\r\nmore that we knowd. They all seem'd to be travellers like ourselves, for\r\nneither the Canoes they had along with them, nor the Houses where they\r\nwere, were sufficient to contain the one half of them. We were in all Six\r\nof us, and after supper began to look out for Lodgings. Mr. Banks went to\r\none place, Dr. Solander to another, while I and the other 3 went to a\r\nthird. We all of us took as much care of the little we had about us as\r\npossible, knowing very well what sort of People we were among; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding all the care we took, before 12 o'clock the most of us\r\nhad lost something or other. For my own part I had my Stockings taken\r\nfrom under my head, and yet I am certain that I was not a Sleep the whole\r\ntime. Obariea took charge of Mr. Banks's things, and yet they were stol'n\r\nfrom her, as she pretended. Tootaha was acquainted with what had hapned,\r\nI believe by Obariea herself, and both him and her made some stir about\r\nit; but this was all meer shew, and ended in nothing. A little time after\r\nthis Tootaha came to the Hutt where I and those that were with me lay,\r\nand entertain'd us with a Consort of Musick consisting of 3 Drums, 4\r\nFlutes, and Singing. This lasted about an Hour, and then they retir'd.\r\nThe Music and Singing was so much of a piece that I was very glad when it\r\nwas over. We stay'd with them till near noon the next day in hopes of\r\ngetting some of our things again, and likewise some Hogs; but we were at\r\nlast obliged to come away with the one we had saved out of the Fire last\r\nNight, and a promise from Tootaha that he would come to the Ship in a Day\r\nor two with more, and bring with him the things that are lost, a promise\r\nwe had no reason to expect he would fulfill. Thus ended our Visit, and we\r\ngot to the Fort late in the evening.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 30th. We are now very buisey in preparing our Instruments, etc.,\r\nfor the Observations, and Instructing such Gentlemen in the use of them,\r\nas I intend to send to other parts to observe, for fear we should fail\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 31st. Late this Evening the Carpenters finished the Long boat.\r\n\r\n[June 1769.]\r\n\r\nThursday, June 1st. This day I sent Lieutenant Gore in the Long boat to\r\nYork Island* (* Eimeo, westward of, and near to Tahiti.) with Dr.\r\nMonkhouse and Mr. Sporing (a Gentleman belonging to Mr. Banks) to Observe\r\nthe Transit of Venus, Mr. Green having furnished them with Instruments\r\nfor that purpose. Mr. Banks and some of the Natives of this Island went\r\nalong with them.\r\n\r\nFriday, 2nd. Very early this morning Lieutenant Hicks, Mr. Clark, Mr.\r\nPickersgill and Mr. Saunders went away in the Pinnace to the Eastward,\r\nwith orders to fix upon some Convenient situation upon this Island, and\r\nthere to Observe the Transit of Venus, they being likewise provided with\r\nInstruments for that purpose.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 3rd. This day proved as favourable to our purpose as we could\r\nwish. Not a Cloud was to be seen the whole day, and the Air was perfectly\r\nClear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in observing the\r\nwhole of the Passage of the planet Venus over the Sun's Disk. We very\r\ndistinctly saw an Atmosphere or Dusky shade round the body of the planet,\r\nwhich very much disturbed the times of the Contact, particularly the two\r\ninternal ones. Dr. Solander observed as well as Mr. Green and myself, and\r\nwe differ'd from one another in Observing the times of the Contact much\r\nmore than could be expected. Mr. Green's Telescope and mine where of the\r\nsame Magnifying power, but that of the Doctor was greater than ours. It\r\nwas nearly calm the whole day, and the Thermometer Exposed to the Sun\r\nabout the Middle of the day rose to a degree of heat we have not before\r\nmet with.\r\n\r\nSunday, 4th. Punished Archd. Wolf with 2 Dozen lashes for Theft, having\r\nbroken into one of the Storerooms and stol'n from thence a large quantity\r\nof Spike Nails; some few of them where found upon him. This evening the\r\nGentlemen that were sent to observe the Transit of Venus, return'd with\r\nsuccess; those that were sent to York Island were well received by the\r\nNatives. That Island appear'd to them not to be very fruitful.\r\n\r\nMonday, 5th. Got some of the Bread ashore out of the Bread Room to dry\r\nand Clean. Yesterday being His Majesty's birthday, we kept it to-day and\r\nhad several of the Chiefs to dine with us.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 6th. This day and for some days past we have been informd by\r\nseveral of the Natives that about 10 or 15 months ago Two Ships touched\r\nat this Island and stayed 10 days in a Harbour to the Eastward, called\r\nOhidea, the Commander's name was Tootteraso,* (* M. de Bougainville, who\r\nlaid at Hitiaa from April 6th to April 16th, 1768.)--so at least the\r\nNatives call him--and that one of the Natives, Brother to the Chief of\r\nOhidea, went away with him. They likewise say these ships brought the\r\nvenerial distemper to this Island, where it is now as Common as in any\r\npart of the world, and which the people bear with as little concern as if\r\nthey have been accustom'd to it for Ages past. We had not been here many\r\ndays before some of our People got this disease, and as no such thing\r\nhapned to any of the Dolphin's people while she was here, that I ever\r\nheard of, I had reason (notwithstanding the improbability of the thing)\r\nto think that we had brought it along with us, which gave me no small\r\nuneasiness, and did all in my power to prevent its progress, but all I\r\ncould do was to little purpose, as I was obliged to have the most part of\r\nthe Ship's Company ashore every day to work upon the Fort, and a Strong\r\nGuard every Night; and the Women were so very liberal with their\r\nfavours--or else Nails, Shirts, etc., were temptations that they could\r\nnot withstand, that this distemper very soon spread itself over the\r\ngreatest part of the Ship's company, but now I have the satisfaction to\r\nfind that the Natives all agree that we did not bring it here.\r\n\r\nWe have several times seen Iron tools and other Articles with these\r\npeople that we suspected came not from the Dolphin, and these they now\r\nsay they had from these two Ships.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 7th; Thursday, 8th; Friday, 9th. These three days we have been\r\nemploy'd in Careening both sides of the Ship, and paying them with Pitch\r\nand Brimstone. We found her Bottom in good order, and that the worm had\r\nnot got into it.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 10th. Wind Variable, with very much rain all day and last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSunday, 11th. Cloudy, with rain last night and this morning; the\r\nremainder of the day fair weather. This day Mr. Banks and I took\r\nToobouratomita on board the Ship and shew'd him the print containing the\r\nColours worne by the ships of Diffrent Nations, and very soon made him\r\nunderstand that we wanted to know which of them was worn by the ships\r\nthat were at Ohidea. He at once pitched upon the Spanish Flag and would\r\nby no means admit of any other; this, together with several Articles we\r\nhave lately seen amongst these people, such as Jackets, Shirts, etc.,\r\nusually worn by Spanish Seamen, proves beyond doubt that they must have\r\nbeen Ships of that Nation, and come from some Port on the Coast of South\r\nAmerica.* (* This was of course a mistake, as the ships were French.)\r\n\r\nMonday, 12th. Yesterday Complaint was made to me by some of the Natives\r\nthat John Thurman and James Nicholson, Seamen, had taken by force from\r\nthem several Bows and Arrows and plaited Hair, and the fact being proved\r\nupon them they were this day punished with 2 dozen lashes each.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 13th. Some Showers of rain last night, but fair weather the most\r\npart of the day. Tootaha, whom we have not seen for some time past, paid\r\nus a Visit to-Day. He brought with him a Hog and some Bread Fruit, for\r\nwhich he was well paid.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 14th. Between 2 and 4 o'clock this morning, one of the Natives\r\nstole out of the Fort an Iron rake, made use of for the Oven. It hapned\r\nto be set up against the Wall, and by that means was Visible from the\r\noutside, and had been seen by them in the evening, as a man had been seen\r\nlurking about the Fort some Hours before the thing was Missed. I was\r\ninformed by some others of the Natives that he watch'd an opportunity\r\nwhen the Centinel's back was turned, he hooked it with a long crooked\r\nstick, and haled it over the Wall. When I came to be informed of this\r\ntheft in the Morning I resolved to recover it by some Means or other, and\r\naccordingly went and took possession of all the Canoes of any value I\r\ncould meet with, and brought them into the River behind the Fort to the\r\nnumber of 22, and told the Natives then present (most of them being the\r\nowners of the Canoes) that unless the principal things they had stol'n\r\nfrom us were restored I would burn them every one: not that I ever\r\nintended to put this in execution, and yet I was very much displeased\r\nwith them, as they were daily committing, or attempting to commit, one\r\ntheft or other, when at the same time--contrary to the opinion of\r\neverybody, I would not suffer them to be fir'd upon, for this would have\r\nbeen putting it in the power of the Centinels to have fir'd upon them\r\nupon the most slitest occasions, as I had before experienced. And I have\r\na great Objection to firing with powder only amongst People who know not\r\nthe difference, for by this they would learn to despise fire Arms and\r\nthink their own Arms superior, and if ever such an Opinion prevailed they\r\nwould certainly attack you, the Event of which might prove as\r\nunfavourable to you as them. About Noon the rake was restored us, when\r\nthey wanted to have their Canoes again; but now, as I had them in my\r\npossession, I was resolved to try if they would not redeem them by\r\nrestoring what they had stol'n from us before. The Principal things which\r\nwe had lost was the Marine Musquet, a pair of Pistols belonging to Mr.\r\nBanks, a Sword belonging to one of the Petty Officers, and a Water Cask,\r\nwith some other Articles not worth mentioning. Some said that these\r\nthings were not in the Island, others that Tootaha had them, and those of\r\nTootaha's friends laid the whole to Obariea, and I believe the whole was\r\nbetween these two persons.\r\n\r\nThursday, 15th. We have been employed for some Days past in overhauling\r\nall the Sea Provisions, and stowing such as we found in a State of decay\r\nto hand, in order to be first expended; but having the people divided\r\nbetween the Ship and the Shore, this work, as well as refitting the Ship,\r\ngoes on but slowly.\r\n\r\nFriday, 16th; Saturday, 17th. Variable winds, with Showers of rain and\r\nCloudy weather.\r\n\r\nSunday, 18th. Variable winds and Clear weather. This Night was observed\r\nthe Moon totally Eclipsed.\r\n\r\nMonday, 19th. Punished James Tunley with 12 lashes for taking Rum out of\r\nthe Cask on the Quarter Deck.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 20th. Got all the Powder aShore to Air, all of which we found in\r\na bad Condition, and the Gunner informs me that it was very little better\r\nwhen it came first on board. Last Night Obariea made us a visit, whom we\r\nhave not seen for some time. We were told of her coming, and that she\r\nwould bring with her some of the Stol'n things, which we gave Credit to\r\nbecause we know'd several of them were in her possession; but we were\r\nsurprised to find this Woman put herself wholy in our power, and not\r\nbring with her one Article of what we had lost. The Excuse she made was\r\nthat her Gallant, a man that used to be along with her, did Steal them,\r\nand she had beat him and turned him away, but she was so Sencible of her\r\nown Guilt that she was ready to drop down through fear, and yet she had\r\nresolution Enough to insist upon Sleeping in Mr. Banks's Tent all Night,\r\nand was with difficulty prevailed upon to go to her canoe, altho no one\r\ntook the least notice of her. In the morning she brought her Canoe, with\r\neverything she had, to the Gate of the Fort, after which we could not\r\nhelp admiring her for her Courage and the Confidence she seem'd to place\r\nin us, and thought that we could do no less than to receive her into\r\nfavour, and except the Present she had brought us, which consisted of a\r\nHog, a Dog, some Bread Fruit and Plantains.\r\n\r\nWe refused to Except of the Dog, as being an Animal we had no use for; at\r\nwhich she seemed a little surprised, and told us it was very good eating,\r\nand we very soon had an opportunity to find that it was so, for Mr.\r\nBanks, having bought a Basket of Fruit in which was the Thigh of a Dog\r\nready dressed, of this several of us tasted, and found that it was Meat\r\nnot to be despised, and therefore took Obariea's Dog and had him\r\nimmediately dressed by some of the Natives in the following manner: They\r\nfirst made a hole in the Ground about a foot Deep, in which they made a\r\nfire and heated some small Stones. While this was doing the Dog was\r\nstrangled and the hair got off by laying him frequently on the fire, and\r\nas clean as if it had been scalded off with hot water. His Intrails was\r\ntaken out, and the whole washed Clean, and as soon as the Stones and Hole\r\nwas sufficiently heated the fire was put out and part of the Stones were\r\nleft in the bottom of the hole. Upon these stones were laid green leafs,\r\nand upon them the Dog, together with the Intrails, these were likewise\r\ncovered with leaves, and over them hot stones; and then the hole was\r\nclose cover'd with mould. After he had laid here about 4 Hours, the Oven\r\n(for so I must call it) was op'ned, and the dog taken out, whole and well\r\ndone, and it was the Opinion of every one who tasted it that they never\r\neat sweater Meat, therefore we resolved for the future never to dispise\r\nDog's flesh. It is in this manner that the Natives dress and Bake all\r\ntheir Victuals that require it--Flesh, fish, and Fruit. I now gave over\r\nall thoughts of recovering any of the things the Natives had stol'n from\r\nus, and therefore intend to give them up their Canoes whenever they apply\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 21st. Employed drying the Powder, or getting on board Wood,\r\nWater, etc. Confined Robert Anderson, Seaman, for refusing to obey the\r\norders of the Mate when at work in the Hold. This morning a Chief, whose\r\nName is Oamo, and one we had not seen before, came to the Fort. There\r\ncame with him a Boy about 7 Years of Age and a Young Woman of about 18 or\r\n20. At the Time of their coming Obariea and several others were in the\r\nfort. They went out to meet them, having first uncovered their Heads and\r\nBodies as low as their Waists; and the same thing was done by all those\r\nthat were on the outside of the Fort. As we looked upon this as a\r\nCeremonial respect, and had not seen it paid to any one before, we\r\nthought that this Oamo must be some extraordinary person, and wondered to\r\nsee so little notice taken of him after the Ceremony was over. The Young\r\nwoman that came along with him could not be prevailed upon to come into\r\nthe Fort, and the Boy was Carried upon a Man's back, altho' he was as\r\nable to walk as the Man who carried him. This Lead us to inquire who they\r\nwere; and we was informed that the Boy was Heir Apparent to the\r\nSovereignty of the Island, and the Young Woman was his Sister, and as\r\nsuch the respect was paid them which was due to no one else except the\r\nArreedehi, which was not Tootaha, from what we could learn, but some\r\nother person who we had not seen, or like to do, for they say that he is\r\nno Friend of ours, and therefore will not come near us. The Young Boy\r\nabove mentioned is son to Oamo by Obariea, but Oamo and Obariea do not at\r\nthis time live together as Man and Wife, he not being able to endure with\r\nher troublesome disposition. I mention this because it shows that\r\nseperation in the Marriage state is not unknown to these people.* (* See\r\nnote Notes on Tahiti below.)\r\n\r\nThursday, 22nd. This morning I released Robert Anderson from Confinement\r\nat the intercession of the Master and a promise of behaving better for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nFriday, 23rd. This morning Emanuel Parreyra, a Portugue, was Missing, and\r\nI had some reason to think that he was gone with an intent to stay here.\r\nIt was not long before I was informed that he was at Apparra with\r\nTootaha. The Man who gave us this information was one of Tootaha's\r\nServants. He was Offer'd a Hatchet if he would go to Apparra and bring\r\nhim to us. This was perhaps the very thing he came for, for he\r\nimmediately set out and return'd with the Man in the Evening. The man\r\nsaid in his defence that as he was going to the Boat to go on board last\r\nnight, he was taken away by force by 3 Men, and upon enquiring farther\r\ninto this matter I found it to be so, and that Tootaha wanted to have\r\nkept him, only that he was perswaided to the contrary, or perhaps he\r\nthought that the Hatchet he would get by returning him would do him more\r\nservice than the Man.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 24th, Sunday, 25th. Nothing remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Tahiti: Expedition round Island.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 26th. Very early this morning I set out in the pinnace,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Banks, with an intent to make the Circuit of the\r\nIsland in order to Examine and draw a Sketch of the Coast and Harbours\r\nthereof. We took our rout to the Eastward, and this night reached the\r\nIsthmus, which is a low neck of Land running across the Island, which\r\ndivides it into two districts or Governments wholly independent of each\r\nother as we was informed. The first thing we saw which struck our\r\nattention in this day's rout was a small Pig that had not been roasted\r\nabove a Day or 2 laid upon one of their Altars near to a place where lay\r\nthe Body or Bones of a Dead Person. This Pig must have been put their as\r\nan offering to their God, but on what account we know not. The Coast from\r\nRoyal Bay trends East by South and East-South-East 10 miles South by East\r\nand South 11 miles to the Isthmus. In the first direction the Shore is\r\nmostly open to the Sea, but in the last it is cover'd by reefs of rocks;\r\nthese forms several good Harbours, wherein are safe Anchorage for\r\nShipping in 16, 18, 20, and 24 fathoms, with other Conveniences. It was\r\nin one of these Harbours the Spanish Ships before mentioned lay; the\r\nNatives shew'd us the place where they Pitched their Tent and the Brook\r\nthey water'd at, otherways there was not the least signs of Shipping\r\nhaving been there.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 27th. Winds Easterly and fine weather. It was late last night\r\nbefore we reached the Isthmus, and all the Observations I could make this\r\nmorning was that it appeared to be a Marshey flatt of about 2 miles in\r\nExtent aCross which the Natives Haul their Canoes partly by land and\r\npartly by water. From the Isthmus the land trends East Southerly near 3\r\nLeagues, to the South-East point of the Great Bay which lies before the\r\nIsthmus. On the west side of this point is a Bay called Ohitepepa, which\r\nis in many respects similar to Royal Bay, and is situated in every bit as\r\nfertile and populous part of the Island. There are other places formed by\r\nthe Reefs that lay along the Shore between this and the Isthmus, where\r\nShipping can lay in perfect security. The Land then trends South-East and\r\nSouth to the South-East part of the Island, which is near 3 Leagues, and\r\ncovered all the way by a Reef of Rocks, but no Harbour. We took up our\r\nQuarters at the East part of the Island, being conducted thither by a\r\nYoung Chief we had Often seen on board the Ship, and the next morning\r\nproceeded round the South-East point of the Island, part of which is not\r\ncover'd by any reef, but lies wholy open to the Sea and here the Hills\r\nrise directly from the Shore. At the Southernmost part of the Island the\r\nShore is again cover'd by a Reef, and there forms a very good Harbour,\r\nand the land about it very fertile. At this place we saw a Goose and a\r\nTurkey left at Royal Bay by the Dolphin; they were in possession of a\r\nChief who came along with us in the Boat, and remain'd with us the\r\nremainder of the day, and conducted us over the Shoals we here meet with;\r\nand for this piece of service we lent him a Cloak to Sleep in in the\r\nnight, but we had not been laid down above 10 minutes before he thought\r\nproper to move off with it, but both Mr. Banks and I pursued him so close\r\nthat he was obliged to relinquish his prize, and we saw no more of him.\r\nWhen we returned to our Lodging we found the House, in which were not\r\nless than 2 or 300 people when we went away, intirely deserted, so that\r\nwe had one of the Largest and best houses on the Island wholy to\r\nourselves; but when they found that we meant them no harm the Chief and\r\nhis Wife with some others came and Slept by us the remainder of the\r\nnight. This place is situated on the South-West side of Tiarreboo,* (*\r\nTaiarapu.) the South-East district of the Island, and about 5 miles\r\nSouth-East from the Isthmus. Here is a large, safe, and Commodious\r\nHarbour, inferior to none on the whole Island, and the land about it Rich\r\nin Produce. We found that the people of this district had had little or\r\nno communication with us, yet we was everywhere well received by them. We\r\nfound all this part of the Island very fertile and the Natives numerous,\r\nand had a great many large Double Canoes built and Ornamented uniformly.\r\nThey were all halled ashore, and appeared to be going to decay for want\r\nof use. Their Mories or Burial places stood generally upon these points\r\nof land that projected into the Sea, and were both better built and\r\nOrnamented than those about Royal Bay--Tootaha's excepted. In general\r\nthis district appear'd to be in a more flourishing state than the other,\r\nalthough it is not above one fourth part as big and cannot contain\r\nnothing near the Number of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThursday, 29th. Squally weather with Showers of rain. This morning we\r\nleft Tiaraboo and entered upon that of Opooreonoo, the North-West\r\ndistrict of the Island. The first thing we met with worthy of note was at\r\none of their Mories, where lay the scull bones of 26 Hogs and 6 Dogs.\r\nThese all lay near to and under one of their Altars. These Animals must\r\nhave been offer'd as a Sacrifice to their Gods either all at once or at\r\ndifferent times, but on what account we could not learn. The next day we\r\nmet with an Effigy or Figure of a Man made of Basket work and covered\r\nwith white and Black feathers placed in such order as to represent the\r\nColour of their Hair and Skins when Tattow'd or painted. It was 7 1/2\r\nfeet high and the whole made in due proportion; on its head were 4 Nobs\r\nnot unlike the stumps of Large Horns--3 stood in front and one behind. We\r\nwere not able to learn what use they made of this Monster; it did not at\r\nall appear to us that they paid it the least Homage as a God: they were\r\nnot the least Scrupulous of letting us examine every part of it. I am\r\ninclinable to think that it is only used by way of diversion at their\r\nHevas or public entertainments, as Punch is in a Puppet show.* (* Note by\r\nCook in Admiralty copy: \"Tupia informs us that this is a representation\r\nof one of the Second rank of Eatuas or Gods, called Mauwi, who inhabited\r\nthe Earth upon the Creation of man. He is represented as an immense Giant\r\nwho had seven heads, and was indued with immense strength and abilities.\r\nMany absurd stories are told of his Feats by Tupia.\") We next passed\r\nthrough a Harbour, which is the only one on the south side of Opooreonoo\r\nfit for Shipping. It is situated about 5 Miles to the Westward of the\r\nIsthmus between 2 Small Islands that lay near the shore and a Mile from\r\neach other. In this Harbour is 11 and 12 fathoms of water and good\r\nAnchorage. About a League and a half to the Westward of this Harbour is\r\nthe Morie of Oamo or Oberia, for some told us it belong'd to the one and\r\nsome to the other; it far Exceeds every thing of this Kind upon the whole\r\nIsland. It is a long square of Stonework built Pyramidically; its base is\r\n267 feet by 87 feet; at the Top it is 250 feet by 8 feet. It is built in\r\nthe same manner as we do steps leading up to a Sun Dial or fountain\r\nerected in the Middle of a Square where there is a flite of steps on each\r\nside. In this building there are 11 of such steps; each step is about 4\r\nfeet in height and the breadth 4 feet 7 inches, but they decreased both\r\nin height and breadth from the bottom to the Top. On the middle of the\r\nTop stood the Image of a Bird carved in Wood, near it lay the broken one\r\nof a Fish carved in stone. There was no hollow or Cavity in the inside,\r\nthe whole being fill'd up with stones. The outside was faced partly with\r\nhewn stones and partly with others, and these were placed in such a\r\nmanner as to look very agreeable to the Eye. Some of the hewn stones were\r\n4 feet 7 inches by 2 feet 4 inches and 15 inches thick, and had been\r\nsquared and Polished with some sort of an Edge Tool. On the East side was\r\nenclosed with a stone wall a piece of ground in form of a square, 360\r\nfeet by 354, in this was growing several Cypress trees and Plantains.\r\nRound about this Morie was several smaller ones all going to decay, and\r\non the Beach between them and the Sea lay scatter'd up and down a great\r\nquantity of human bones. Not far from the Great Morie was 2 or 3 pretty\r\nlarge Altars, where lay the Scull bones of some Hogs and dogs. This\r\nMonument stands on the south side of Opooreonoo, upon a low point of land\r\nabout 100 Yards from the Sea.* (* On map Morai-no te Oamo.) It appeared\r\nto have been built many Years, and was in a State of decay, as most of\r\ntheir Mories are. From this it would seem that this Island hath been in a\r\nmore Flourishing state than it is at present, or that Religious Customs\r\nare (like most other Nations) by these people less observed. We took up\r\nour Quarters near this Morie for the night, and early in the Morning\r\nproceeded on our rout, and without meeting with anything remarkable, got\r\non board the Ship on Saturday, the 1st of July, having made the Circuit\r\nof the whole Island, which I Estimated at something more than 30\r\nLeagues.* (* A remarkably close estimate.) The Plan or Sketch which I\r\nhave drawn, altho' it cannot be very accurate, yet it will be found\r\nsufficient to point out the Situation of the different Bays and Harbours\r\nand the true figure of the Island, and I believe is without any Material\r\nerror. For the first 2 or 3 days we was out upon this excursion we\r\nlabour'd under some difficulty for want of Provisions--particularly\r\nbread--an Article we took but little of with us--not doubting that we\r\nshould get bread fruit, more than sufficient for a Boat's Crew at every\r\nplace we went to, but, on the Contrary, we found the season for that\r\nfruit wholy over, and not one to be seen on the Trees, and all other\r\nfruit and roots were scarce. The Natives live now on Sour paist--which is\r\nmade from bread fruit--and some bread fruit and plantains that they get\r\nfrom the Mountains where the season is Later, and on a Nut not unlike a\r\nchessnut which are now in Perfection; but all these Articles are at\r\npresent very scarce, and therefore it is no wonder that the Natives have\r\nnot supply'd us with these things of Late. [At Tahiti.] Upon my return to\r\nthe Ship I found that the Provisions had been all examined and the Water\r\ngot on board, amounting to 65 Tons. I now determind to get everything off\r\nfrom the Shore and leave the Place as soon as possible. The getting the\r\nseveral Articles on board, and Scraping and paying the Ship's side, took\r\nus up the following Week without anything remarkable happening until\r\n\r\n[July 1769. At Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nSunday, July 9th. When, sometime in the Middle Watch, Clement Webb and\r\nSaml. Gibson, both Marines and young Men, found means to get away from\r\nthe Fort (which was now no hard matter to do) and in the morning were not\r\nto be found. As it was known to everybody that all hands were to go on\r\nboard on the Monday morning, and that the ship would sail in a day or\r\ntwo, there was reason to think that these 2 Men intended to stay behind.\r\nHowever I was willing to stay one day to see if they would return before\r\nI took any step to find them.\r\n\r\nMonday, 10th. The 2 Marines not returning this morning, I began to\r\nenquire after them, and was inform'd by some of the Natives that they\r\nwere gone to the Mountains, and that they had got each of them a Wife and\r\nwould not return; but at the same time no one would give us any certain\r\nintelligence where they were, upon which a resolution was taken to seize\r\nupon as many of the Chiefs as we could. This was thought to be the\r\nreadiest method to induce the other natives to produce the 2 Men. We had\r\nin our custody Obariea, Toobouratomita, and 2 other Chiefs, but that I\r\nknow'd Tootaha would have more weight with the Natives than all these put\r\ntogether, I dispatched Lieutenant Hicks away in the Pinnace to the place\r\nwhere Tootaha was, to endeavour to decoy him into the Boat and bring him\r\non board, which Mr. Hicks performed without the least disturbance. We had\r\nno sooner taken the other Chiefs into Custody in Mr. Banks's Tent than\r\nthey became as desirous of having the Men brought back has they were\r\nbefore of keeping them, and only desir'd that one of our people might be\r\nsent with some of theirs for them. Accordingly I sent a petty officer and\r\nthe Corporal of Marines with 3 or 4 of their People, not doubting but\r\nthey would return with the 2 Men in the evening; but they not coming as\r\nsoon as I expected, I took all the Chiefs on board the ship for greater\r\nsafety. About 9 o'Clock in the evening Webb, the Marine, was brought in\r\nby some of the natives and sent on board. He informed me that the Petty\r\nOfficer and Corporal that had been sent in quest of them were disarm'd\r\nand seiz'd upon by the natives, and that Gibson was with them.\r\nImmediately upon getting this information I dispatch'd Mr. Hicks away in\r\nthe Long boat with a strong party of men to rescue them but before he\r\nwent Tootaha and the other Chiefs was made to understand that they must\r\nsend some of their People with Mr. Hicks to shew him the place where our\r\nmen were, and at the same time to send orders for their immediate\r\nreleasement, for if any harm came to the men they (the Chiefs) would\r\nsuffer for it; and I believe at this time they wished as much to see the\r\nMen return in safety as I did, for the guides conducted Mr. Hicks to the\r\nplace before daylight, and he recovered the men without the least\r\nopposition, and return'd with them about 7 o'Clock in the morning of\r\n\r\nTuesday, 11th. I then told the Chiefs that there remain'd nothing more to\r\nbe done to regain their liberty but to deliver up the Arms the People had\r\ntaken from the Petty Officer and Corporal, and these were brought on\r\nboard in less than half an Hour, and then I sent them all on shore. They\r\nmade but a short stay with our people there before they went away, and\r\nmost of the natives with them: but they first wanted to give us 4 Hogs.\r\nThese we refused to except of them, as they would take nothing in return.\r\nThus we are likely to leave these people in disgust with our behaviour\r\ntowards them, owing wholy to the folly of 2 of our men, for it does not\r\nappear that the natives had any hand in inticing them away, and therefore\r\nwere not the first Agressors. However, it is very certain that had we not\r\ntaken this step we never should have recovered them. The Petty Officer\r\nwhom I sent in quest of the deserters told me that the Natives would give\r\nhim no intelligence where they were, nor those that went along with him,\r\nbut, on the contrary, grew very troublesome, and, as they were returning\r\nin the evening, they were suddenly seized upon by a number of Armed men\r\nthat had hid themselves in the wood for that purpose. This was after\r\nTootaha had been seized upon by us, so that they did this by way of\r\nretaliation in order to recover their Chief; but this method did not meet\r\nwith the approbation of them all. A great many condemn'd these\r\nproceedings, and were for having them set at liberty, while others were\r\nfor keeping them until Tootaha was releas'd. The dispute went so far that\r\nthey came from words to blows, and our people were several times very\r\nnear being set at liberty; but at last the party for keeping them\r\nPrevailed, but, as they had still some friends, no insult was offer'd\r\nthem. A little while after they brought Webb and Gibson, the two\r\ndeserters, to them as Prisoners likewise; but at last they agreed that\r\nWebb should be sent to inform us where the others were. When I came to\r\nExamine these 2 Men touching the reasons that induced them to go away, it\r\nappeared that an acquaintance they had contracted with 2 Girls, and to\r\nwhom they had strongly attached themselves, was the Sole reason of their\r\nattempting to stay behind. Yesterday we weighed the small Bower Anchor,\r\nthe Stock of which was so much eaten by the worms as to break in heaving\r\nup, and to-day we hove up the best Bower, and found the Stock in the very\r\nsame Condition. This day we got everything off from the Shore, and\r\nto-night everybody lays on board.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 12th. The Carpenter employ'd in stocking the Anchors and the\r\nSeamen in getting the Ship ready for Sea. This morning we found the\r\nStaves of the Cask the Natives stole from us some time ago laying at the\r\nWatering place; but they had been Sencible enough to keep the Iron Hoops,\r\nand only return what to them was of no use.\r\n\r\n[Sail from Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 13th. Winds Easterly, a light breeze. This morning we was\r\nvisited by Obariea and several others of our acquaintance, a thing we did\r\nnot expect after what had hapned but 2 days ago; but this was in some\r\nmeasures owing to Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and myself going to Apparra\r\nlast night, where we so far convinc'd them of our Friendly disposition\r\nthat several of them were in tears at our coming away. Between 11 and 12\r\no'Clock we got under Sail, and took our final leave of these People,\r\nafter a stay of just three Months, the most part of which time we have\r\nbeen upon good terms with them. Some few differences have now and then\r\nhapned owing partly to the want of rightly understanding each other, and\r\npartly to their natural thievish disposition, which we could not at all\r\ntimes bear with or guard against; but these have been attended with no\r\nill consequence to either side except the first, in which one of them was\r\nkill'd, and this I was very sorry for, because from what had hapned to\r\nthem by the Dolphin I thought it would have been no hard matter to have\r\ngot and keep a footing with them without bloodshed. For some time before\r\nwe left this Island several of the Natives were daily offering themselves\r\nto go away with us; and as it was thought they must be of use to us in\r\nour future discoveries we resolved to bring away one whose name is Tupia,\r\na Chief and a Priest. This man had been with us most part of the time we\r\nhad been upon the Island, which gave us an opportunity to know something\r\nof him. We found him to be a very intelligent person, and to know more of\r\nthe Geography of the Islands situated in these Seas, their produce, and\r\nthe religion, laws, and Customs of the inhabitants, than any one we had\r\nmet with, and was the likeliest person to answer our Purpose. For these\r\nreasons, and at the request of Mr. Banks, I received him on board,\r\ntogether with a young Boy, his Servant. For the first two Months we were\r\nat this Island the Natives supplied us with as much Bread fruit, Cocoa\r\nNuts, etc., as we could well dispence with, and now and then a few Hogs,\r\nbut of these hardly sufficient to give the Ship's company one and\r\nsometimes two fresh Meals a week. As to Fowls, I did not see above 3\r\ndozen upon the whole Island, and fish they seldom would part with; but\r\nduring the last Month we got little refreshment of any sort. The\r\ndetaining of their Canoes broke off Trade at that time, and it never\r\nafter was begun again with any Spirit. However, it was not wholy owing to\r\nthis, but to a Scarcity. The Season for Bread fruit was wholy over, and\r\nwhat other Fruits they had were hardly sufficient for themselves; at\r\nleast, they did not care to part with them. All sorts of Fruits we\r\npurchased with Beads and Nails, not less than 40-penny, for a nail under\r\nthat size was of no value; but we could not get a Hog above 10 or 12\r\npounds weight for anything less than a Hatchet, not but that they set\r\ngreat value upon Spike Nails; but, as this was an Article many in the\r\nShip are provided with, the Women soon found a much easier way at coming\r\nat them than by bringing Provisions. Our Traffick with this people was\r\ncarried on with as much Order as in the best regulated Market in Europe.\r\nIt was managed ashore chiefly by Mr. Banks, who took uncommon Pains to\r\nprocure from the Natives every kind of refreshment that was to be got.\r\nAxes, Hatchets, Spikes, large Nails, looking Glasses, Knives, and Beads\r\nare all highly valued by this People, and nothing more is wanting to\r\nTraffick with them for everything they have to dispose of. They are\r\nlikewise very fond of fine Linnen Cloth, both White and Printed, but an\r\nAxe worth half a Crown will fetch more than a Piece of Cloth worth Twenty\r\nShillings.\r\n\r\nUpon our arrival at Batavia we had certain information that the two ships\r\nthat were at George's Island some time before our arrival there were both\r\nFrench ships.* (* In Admiralty copy.)\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF KING GEORGE'S ISLAND.\r\n\r\nThis Island is called by the Natives Otaheite, and was first discovered\r\nby Captain Wallis, in His Majesty's ship Dolphin, on June 19th, 1767, and\r\nto the Credit of him and his Officers, the Longitude of Royal Bay was by\r\nthem settled to within half a degree of the Truth, and the whole figure\r\nof the Island not ill described. It is situated between the Latitude of\r\n17 degrees 29 minutes and 17 degrees 53 minutes South, and between the\r\nLongitude of 149 degrees 10 minutes and 149 degrees 39 minutes West from\r\nthe Meridian of Greenwich.* (* These latitudes are exact. The modern\r\nlimits of longitude are 149 degrees 7 minutes to 149 degrees 36 minutes\r\n30 seconds.) Point Venus, so called from the Observation being made\r\nthere, is the Northern extremity of the Island, and lies in the Longitude\r\nof 149 degrees 30 minutes,* (* Now considered to be 149 degrees 29\r\nminutes.) being the mean result of a Great number of Observations made\r\nupon the Spot. The Shores of this Island are mostly guarded from the Sea\r\nby reefs of coral rocks, and these form several excellent Bays and\r\nHarbours, wherein are room and depth of Water sufficient for the largest\r\nShips.\r\n\r\nRoyal Bay, called by the Natives Matavie,* (* Matavai.) in which we lay,\r\nand the Dolphin before us, is not inferior to any on the Island, both in\r\nPoint of conveniency and Situation. It may easily be known by a\r\nProdigious high Mountain in the middle of the Island, which bears due\r\nsouth from Point Venus, which is the Eastern point of the Bay. To sail\r\ninto it either keep the West point of the Reefs which lies before Point\r\nVenus close on board, or give it a berth of near half a Mile in order to\r\navoid a small Shoal of Coral Rocks, whereon is but 2 1/2 fathoms of\r\nwater. The best Anchoring is on the Eastern side of the Bay in 16 or 14\r\nfathoms of water, owsey bottom. The Shore of the bay is all a fine sandy\r\nbeach, behind which runs a river of Fresh Water, so that any Number of\r\nShips might Water here without discommoding one another. The only wood\r\nfor fuel upon the whole Island is fruit Trees, and these must be\r\npurchased of the Natives, if you mean to keep on good Terms with them.\r\nThere are some Harbours to the Westward of this bay that have not been\r\nmentioned, but as they lay Contiguous to it, and are to be found in the\r\nplan, the description of them is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe land of this Island, except what is immediately bordering upon the\r\nSea coast, is of a very uneven Surface, and rises in ridges which run up\r\ninto the middle of the Island, and there form mountains, that are of a\r\nheight Sufficient to be seen at the distance of 20 leagues. Between the\r\nfoot of the ridges and the Sea is a border of low Land surrounding the\r\nwhole Island, except in a few places where the ridge rises directly from\r\nthe Sea. This low land is of Various Breadths, but nowhere exceeds a Mile\r\nand a half. The Soil is rich and fertile, being for the most part well\r\nstock'd with fruit Trees and small Plantations. and well water'd by a\r\nnumber of small Rivulets of Excellent Water which come from the adjacent\r\nhills. It is upon this low Land that the greatest part of the inhabitants\r\nlive, not in Towns or Vilages, but dispersed everywhere round the whole\r\nIsland; the Tops of most of the ridges and mountains are Barren and, as\r\nit were, burnt up with the sun, yet many parts of some of them are not\r\nwithout their produce, and many of the Valleys are fertile and inhabited.\r\n\r\n[Produce of Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nOF THE PRODUCE.\r\n\r\nThe produce of this Island is Bread Fruit, Cocoa Nuts, Bonanoes,\r\nPlantains, a fruit like an Apple, sweet Potatoes, Yams, a Fruit known by\r\nthe name of Eag Melloa, and reck'ned most delicious; Sugar Cane which the\r\ninhabitants eat raw; a root of the Salop kind, called by the inhabitants\r\nPea; the root also of a plant called Ether; and a fruit in a pod like a\r\nKidney bean, which when roasted eats like a Chestnut, and is called Ahee;\r\nthe fruit of a Tree which they call Wharra, something like a Pine Apple;\r\nthe fruit of a Tree called by them Nano; the roots of a Fern and the\r\nroots of a plant called Thive. All these Articles the Earth almost\r\nSpontaniously produces, or, at least, they are raised with very little\r\nLabour. In the Article of food these people may almost be said to be\r\nexempt from the Curse of our Forefathers, scarcely can it be said that\r\nthey Earn their bread with the sweat of their brow; benevolent Nature\r\nhath not only Supply'd them with necessarys, but with abundance of\r\nSuperfluities. The Sea coast supplies them with vast Variety of most\r\nExcellent fish, but these they get not without some Trouble and\r\nPerseverance. Fish seems to be one of their greatest Luxuries, and they\r\nEat it either raw or Dressed and seem to relish it one way as well as the\r\nother. Not only fish but almost everything that comes out of the Sea is\r\nEat and Esteem'd by these People; Shell Fish, Lobsters, Crabs, and even\r\nsea insects, and what is commonly called blubbers of many kinds, conduce\r\nto their support.\r\n\r\nFor tame Animals they have Hogs, Fowls, and Dogs, the latter of which we\r\nlearned to Eat from them, and few were there of us but what allow'd that\r\na South Sea dog was next to an English Lamb. One thing in their favour is\r\nthat they live intirely upon Vegetables; probably our Dogs would not Eat\r\nhalf so well. Little can be said in favour of their Fowles, but their\r\npork is most Excellent, they have no beasts of Prey of any Sort, and Wild\r\nFowls are scarce and confin'd to a few Species. When any of the Chiefs\r\nkill a Hog it seems to be almost equally divided among all his\r\nDependents, and as these are generally very numerous, it is but a little\r\nthat come to each person's share, so that their chief food is Vegetables,\r\nand of these they eat a large quantity.\r\n\r\nCookery seems to have been but little studied here; they have only 2\r\nMethods of applying Fire--broiling and Baking, as we called it; the\r\nmethod this is done I have before described, and I am of Opinion that\r\nVictuals dressed this way are more juicy and more equally done than by\r\nany of our Methods, large Fish in particular, Bread Fruit, Bananoes.\r\nPlantains Cooked this way eat like boil'd Potatoes, and was much used by\r\nus by way of bread whenever we could get them. Of bread Fruit they make 2\r\nor 3 dishes by beating it with a Stone Pestle till it makes a Paste,\r\nmixing Water or Cocoa Nut Liquor, or both, with it, and adding ripe\r\nPlantains, Bananoes, Sour Paste, etc.\r\n\r\nThis last is made from bread Fruit in the following manner. This fruit,\r\nfrom what I can find, remains in Season only 8 or 9 months in the year,\r\nand as it is the Chief support of the inhabitants a reserve of food must\r\nbe made for those months when they are without it. To do this the Fruit\r\nis gathered when upon the point of ripening; after the rinde is scraped\r\noff it is laid in heaps and coverd close with leaves, where it undergoes\r\na fermentation, and becomes soft and disagreeably sweet. The Core is then\r\ntaken out, and the rest of the fruit thrown into a Hole dug for that\r\npurpose, the sides and bottom of which are neatly laid with grass. The\r\nwhole is covered with leaves and heavy stones laid upon them; here it\r\nundergoes a second Fermentation and becomes sourish, in which condition\r\nthey say it will keep good 10 or 12 months. As they want to use it they\r\nmake it into balls, which they wrap up in leaves and bake in the same\r\nmanner as they do the Fruit from the Tree; it is then ready for eating\r\neither hot or cold, and hath a sour and disagreeable taste. In this last\r\nState it will keep good a Month or 6 Weeks; it is called by them Mahai,\r\nand they seldom make a Meal without some of it, one way or another. To\r\nthis plain diet Salt Water is the universal sauce, hardly any one sets\r\ndown to a meal without a Cocoa Nut shell full of it standing by them,\r\ninto which they dip most of what they Eat, especially Fish, drinking at\r\nIntervals large sops of it out of their Hands, so that a man may use half\r\na Pint at a Meal.\r\n\r\nIt is not common for any 2 to eat together, the better sort hardly ever;\r\nand the women never upon any account eat with the Men, but always by\r\nthemselves. What can be the reason of so unusual a custom it is hard to\r\nsay; especially as they are a people, in every other instance, fond of\r\nSociety and much so of their Women. They were often Asked the reason, but\r\nthey never gave no other Answer, but that they did it because it was\r\nright, and Express'd much dislike at the Custom of Men and Women Eating\r\ntogether of the same Victuals. We have often used all the intreatys we\r\nwere Masters of to invite the Women to partake of our Victuals at our\r\nTables, but there never was an instance of one of them doing it publick,\r\nbut they would Often goe 5 or 6 together into the Servants apartments,\r\nand there eat very heartily of whatever they could find, nor were they\r\nthe least disturbed if any of us came in while they were dining; and it\r\nhath sometimes hapned that when a woman was alone in our company she\r\nwould eat with us, but always took care that her own people should not\r\nknow what she had don, so that whatever may be the reasons for this\r\ncustom, it certainly affects their outward manners more than their\r\nPrinciple.\r\n\r\n[Natives of Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nPERSON OF THE NATIVES.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their persons the Men in general are tall, strong-limb'd,\r\nand well shaped. One of the tallest we saw measured 6 feet 3 inches and a\r\nhalf. The superior women are in every respect as large as Europeans, but\r\nthe inferior sort are in General small, owing possibly to their early\r\nAmours, which they are more addicted to than their superiors. They are of\r\nvarious Colours: those of the inferior sort, who are obliged to be much\r\nexposed to the Sun and air, are of a very Dark brown; the superiors\r\nagain, who spend most of their Time in their Houses under Shelter, are\r\nnot browner than people who are born or reside longer in the West Indies;\r\nnay, some of the Women are almost as fair as Europeans. Their hair is\r\nalmost universally black, thick, and Strong; this the Women wear short\r\nCropt Round their Ears. The Men, on the other hand, wear it different\r\nways: the better sort let it grow long, and sometimes tying it up on the\r\nTop of their Heads, or letting it hang loose over their Shoulders; but\r\nmany of the inferiors, and such who, in the exercise of their\r\nprofessions, fishing, etc., are obliged to be much upon or in the Water,\r\nwear it cropt short like the women. They always pluck out a part of their\r\nbeards, and keep what remains neat and Clean. Both Sexes eradicate every\r\nhair from under their Armpits, and look upon it as a mark of\r\nuncleanliness in us that we do not do the Same.\r\n\r\nThey have all fine white Teeth, and for the most part short flat Noses\r\nand thick lips; yet their features are agreeable, and their gaite\r\ngraceful, and their behavior to strangers and to each other is open,\r\naffable, and Courteous, and, from all I could see, free from treachery,\r\nonly that they are thieves to a man, and would steal but everything that\r\ncame in their way, and that with such dexterity as would shame the most\r\nnoted Pickpocket in Europe. They are very cleanly people, both in their\r\npersons and diet, always washing their hands and Mouth immediately before\r\nand after their Meals, and wash or Bathe themselves in fresh Water 3\r\ntimes a day, morning, Noon, and Night.\r\n\r\nThe only disagreeable thing about them is the Oil with which they anoint\r\ntheir heads, Monoe, as they call it; this is made of Cocoanutt Oil, in\r\nwhich some sweet Herbs or Flowers are infused. The Oil is generally very\r\nrancid, which makes the wearer of it smell not very agreeable.* (* Other\r\nvoyagers have, on the contrary, described the odour of this sweetened oil\r\nas agreeable.) Another custom they have that is disagreeable to\r\nEuropeans, which is eating lice, a pretty good stock of which they\r\ngenerally carry about them. However, this custom is not universal; for I\r\nseldom saw it done but among Children and Common People, and I am\r\nperswaided that had they the means they would keep themselves as free\r\nfrom lice as we do; but the want of Combs in a Hot climate makes this\r\nhardly possible. There are some very fine men upon this Island whose\r\nskins are whiter than any European's, but of a Dead Colour, like that of\r\nthe Nose of a White Horse; their Eyes, eyebrows, hair and beards are also\r\nWhite. Their bodys were cover'd, more or less, with a kind of White down.\r\nTheir skins are spotted, some parts being much whiter than others. They\r\nare short-sighted, with their eyes oftimes full of rheum, and always\r\nlook'd unwholesome, and have neither the Spirit nor the activity of the\r\nother Natives. I did not see above 3 or 4 upon the whole Island, and\r\nthese were old men; so that I concluded that this difference of colour,\r\netc., was accidental, and did not run in families, for if it did they\r\nmust have been more Numerous. The inhabitants of this Island are Troubled\r\nwith a sort of Leprosy, or Scab all over their bodys. I have seen Men,\r\nWomen, and Children, but not many, who have had this distemper to that\r\ndegree as not to be able to walk. This distemper, I believe, runs in\r\nfamilys, because I have seen both mother and Child have it.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language.\r\nThis is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a\r\nmanner as to be indelible. Some have ill-design'd figures of men, birds,\r\nor dogs; the women generally have this figure Z simply on every joint of\r\ntheir fingers and Toes; the men have it likewise, and both have other\r\ndifferant figures, such as Circles, Crescents, etc., which they have on\r\ntheir Arms and Legs; in short, they are so various in the application of\r\nthese figures that both the quantity and Situation of them seem to depend\r\nintirely upon the humour of each individual, yet all agree in having\r\ntheir buttocks covered with a Deep black. Over this Most have Arches\r\ndrawn one over another as high as their short ribs, which are near a\r\nQuarter of an inch broad. These Arches seem to be their great pride, as\r\nboth men and Women show them with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nTheir method of Tattowing I shall now describe. The colour they use is\r\nlamp black, prepar'd from the Smoak of a Kind of Oily nut, used by them\r\ninstead of Candles. The instrument for pricking it under the Skin is made\r\nof very thin flatt pieces of bone or Shell, from a quarter of an inch to\r\nan inch and a half broad, according to the purpose it is to be used for,\r\nand about an inch and a half long. One end is cut into sharp teeth, and\r\nthe other fastened to a handle. The teeth are dipped into black Liquor,\r\nand then drove, by quick, sharp blows struck upon the handle with a Stick\r\nfor that purpose, into the skin so deep that every stroke is followed\r\nwith a small quantity of Blood. The part so marked remains sore for some\r\ndays before it heals. As this is a painful operation, especially the\r\nTattowing their Buttocks, it is perform'd but once in their Life times;\r\nit is never done until they are 12 or 14 years of Age.\r\n\r\n[Clothing of Tahitians.]\r\n\r\nTheir Cloathing is either of Cloth or Matting of several different sorts;\r\nthe dress of both Men and Women are much the same, which is a Piece of\r\nCloth or Matting wrapp'd 2 or 3 times round their waist, and hangs down\r\nbelow their Knees, both behind and before, like a Pettycoat; another\r\npiece, or sometimes 2 or 3, about 2 yards or 2 1/2 yards long, with a\r\nhole in the Middle, through which they put their heads. This hangs over\r\ntheir Shoulders down behind and before, and is tied round their waist\r\nwith a long piece of thin Cloth, and being open at the sides gives free\r\nliberty to their arms. This is the common dress of all ranks of people,\r\nand there are few without such a one except the Children, who go quite\r\nnaked, the Boys until they are 6 or 7 years of Age, and the girls until 3\r\nor 4. At these Ages they begin to cover what nature teaches them to hide.\r\nBesides the dress I have mentioned some of the better sort, such as can\r\nafford it, but more especially the Women, will one way or other wrap\r\nround them several pieces of Cloth, each 8 or 10 Yards long and 2 or 3\r\nbroad, so much that I have often wondered how they could bear it in so\r\nhot a climate. Again, on the other hand, many of the inferior sort during\r\nthe heat of the Day, go almost naked, the women wearing nothing but the\r\nPetticoat aforementioned, and sometimes hardly that. The men wear a piece\r\nof Cloth like a Sack, which goes between their thighs, and brought up\r\nbefore and behind, and then wrapped round their waist. This every man\r\nwears always without exception, and it is no uncommon thing to see many\r\nof the better sort have nothing else on, as it is reckoned no shame for\r\nany part of the body to be exposed to View, except those which all\r\nmankind hide.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes sometimes shade their faces from the Sun with little Bonnets\r\nmade of Cocoa-Nut leaves. Some have them of fine Matting, but this is\r\nless common. They sometimes wear Turbands, but their Chief Headdress is\r\nwhat they call Tomou, which is human Hair plaited scarce thicker than\r\ncommon thread. Of this I can safely affirm that I have seen pieces near a\r\nmile in length worked upon one end without a Knott. These are made and\r\nworn only by the women, 5 or 6 such pieces of which they will sometimes\r\nwind round their Heads, the effect of which, if done with taste, is very\r\nbecoming. They have Earings by way of Ornament, but wear them only at one\r\nEar. These are made of Shells, Stones, Berries, red pease, and some small\r\npearls which they wear 3 tied together; but our Beads, Buttons, etc.,\r\nvery soon supply'd their places.\r\n\r\n[Customs of Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\nAfter their meals in the Heat of the day they often Sleep, middle Aged\r\npeople especially, the better sort of whom seem to spend most of their\r\ntime in eating and Sleeping. Diversions they have but few, shooting with\r\nthe Bow and Wrestling are the Chief; the first of which is confin'd\r\nalmost wholy to the Chiefs; they shoot for distance only, kneeling upon\r\none knee and dropping the Bow the instant of the Arrows parting from it.\r\nI have seen one of them shoot an Arrow 274 yards, yet he looked upon it\r\nas no Great Shotte.\r\n\r\nMusick is little known to them, yet they are very fond of it; they have\r\nonly 2 Instruments--the flute and the Drum. The former is made of hollow\r\nBamboo about 15 inches long, in which are 3 Holes; into one of them they\r\nblow with one Nostril, stopping the other with the thumb of the left\r\nhand, the other 2 Holes they stop and unstop with their fingers, and by\r\nthis means produce 4 Notes, of which they have made one Tune, which\r\nserves them upon all Occasions, to which they sing a number of songs\r\ngenerally consisting of 2 lines and generally in rhime. At any time of\r\nthe day when they are Lazy they amuse themselves by singing these\r\nCouplets, but especially after dark when their candles are lighted, which\r\nare made of the Kernels of a Nutt abounding much in oil; these are stuck\r\nupon a Skewer of Wood one upon another, and give a very Tolerable light,\r\nwhich they often keep burning an hour after dark, and if they have\r\nstrangers in the House much longer. Their drums are made of a hollow\r\nblock of wood covered with Shark's Skin, and instead of Drumsticks they\r\nuse their hands. Of these they make out 5 or 6 tunes and accompany the\r\nflutes.\r\n\r\nThe drums are Chiefly used at their Heivas, which are a set of Musicians,\r\n2 or 3 Drums for instance, as many flutes and singers, which go about\r\nfrom House to House and play, and are always received and rewarded by the\r\nMaster of the family, who gives them a Piece of Cloth or whatever he can\r\nspare, for which they will stay 3 or 4 hours, during which time his house\r\nwill be crowded full, for the people are extravagantly fond of this\r\ndiversion. The Young Girls whenever they can collect 8 or 10 Together\r\ndance a very indecent Dance, which they call Timorodee, singing most\r\nindecent songs and using most indecent actions, in the practice of which\r\nthey are brought up from their earliest childhood; in doing this they\r\nkeep time to a great nicety. This exercise is generally left off as soon\r\nas they arrive at Years of Maturity, for as soon as they have form'd a\r\nconnection with man they are expected to leave off dancing Timorodee.\r\n\r\nOne amusement or custom more I must mention, though I confess I do not\r\nexpect to be believed, it is founded upon a Custom so inhuman and\r\ncontrary to the Principles of human nature. It is this: that more than\r\none half of the better sort of the inhabitants have enter'd into a\r\nresolution of injoying free liberty in Love, without being Troubled or\r\ndisturbed by its consequences. These mix and Cohabit together with the\r\nutmost freedom, and the Chilldren who are so unfortunate as to be thus\r\nbegot are smother'd at the Moment of their Birth; many of these People\r\ncontract intimacies and live together as man and wife for years, in the\r\ncourse of which the Children that are born are destroy'd. They are so far\r\nfrom concealing it that they look upon it as a branch of freedom upon\r\nwhich they Value themselves. They are called Arreoys, and have meetings\r\namong themselves, where the men amuse themselves with Wrestling, etc.,\r\nand the Women in dancing the indecent dance before-mentioned, in the\r\ncourse of which they give full Liberty to their desires, but I believe\r\nkeep up to the appearance of decency. I never see one of these meetings;\r\nDr. Monkhouse saw part of one, enough to make him give Credit to what we\r\nhad been told.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes express the most indecent ideas in conversation without the\r\nleast emotion, and they delight in such conversation beyond any other.\r\nChastity, indeed, is but little valued, especially among the middle\r\npeople--if a Wife is found guilty of a breach of it her only punishment\r\nis a beating from her husband. The Men will very readily offer the Young\r\nWomen to Strangers, even their own Daughters, and think it very strange\r\nif you refuse them; but this is done merely for the sake of gain.\r\n\r\nThe Houses or dwellings of these People are admirably calculated for the\r\ncontinual warmth of the Climate; they do not build them in Towns or\r\nVillages, but seperate each from the other, and always in the Woods, and\r\nare without walls, so that the air, cooled by the shade of the Trees, has\r\nfree access in whatever direction it hapens to blow. No country can boast\r\nof more delightful walks than this; the whole Plains where the Natives\r\nreside are covered with groves of Bread Fruit and Cocoa Nut Trees,\r\nwithout underwood, and intersected in all directions by the Paths which\r\ngo from House to House, so that nothing can be more grateful in a Climate\r\nwhere the sun hath so powerful an influence. They are generally built in\r\nform of an Oblong square, the Roofs are supported by 3 Rows of Pillars or\r\nposts, and neatly covered with Thatch made of Palm leaves. A middle-siz'd\r\nhouse is about 24 feet by 12, extream heigth about 8 or 9, and heigth of\r\nthe Eves 3 1/2 or 4. The floors are cover'd some inches deep with Hay,\r\nupon which, here and there, lay matts for the conveniency of sitting\r\ndown; few houses has more than one Stool, which is only used by the\r\nMaster of the family.\r\n\r\nIn their houses are no rooms or Partitions, but they all huddle and Sleep\r\ntogether; yet in this they generally observe some order, the Married\r\npeople laying by themselves, and the unmarried each sex by themselves, at\r\nsome small distance from each other. Many of the Eares or Chiefs are more\r\nprivate, having small movable houses in which they Sleep, man and Wife,\r\nwhich, when they go by Water from place to place, are tied upon their\r\nCanoes; these have walls made of Cocoa-Nut leaves, etc. I have said that\r\nthe houses are without walls, but this is only to be understood in\r\ngeneral, for many of them are walled with wickering, but not so close but\r\nto admit a free circulation of Air. The matts which serve them to sit\r\nupon in the daytime are also their beds in the night, and the Cloathes\r\nthey wear in the day serve for covering, a little wood Stool, block of\r\nwood, or bundle of Cloth for a Pillow. Besides these common houses there\r\nare others much larger, 200 feet long and upwards, 30 broad, and 20 in\r\nheigth. There are generally 2 or 3 of these in every district, and seem'd\r\nnot only built for the accommodation of the principal people, but common\r\nto all the inhabitants of that district, and raised and kept up by their\r\njoint Labour; these are always without walls, and have generally a large\r\nArea on one side neatly inclosed with low pallisades, etc.\r\n\r\n[Tahitian Canoes.]\r\n\r\nTheir Canoes or Proes are built all of them very narrow, and some of the\r\nlargest are 60 or 70 feet long. These consist of several pieces; the\r\nbottom is round and made of large logs hollow'd out to the thickness of\r\nabout 3 Inches, and may consist of 3 or 4 pieces; the sides are of Plank\r\nof nearly the same thickness, and are built nearly perpendicular,\r\nrounding in a little towards the Gunwale. The pieces on which they are\r\nbuilt are well fitted, and fastned or sewed together with strong platting\r\nsomething in the same manner as old China, Wooden Bowls, etc., are\r\nmended. The greatest breadth is at the after part, which is generally\r\nabout 18 or 20 Inches, and the fore part about 1/3 Narrower; the heigth\r\nfrom the bottom to the Gunwale seldom exceeds 2 1/2 or 3 feet. They build\r\nthem with high curv'd Sterns which are generally ornamented with carved\r\nwork; the head or fore part curves little or nothing. The smaller Canoes\r\nare built after the same plan, some out of one, 2, or more trees\r\naccording to their size or the use they are for. In order to prevent them\r\nfrom oversetting when in the Water, all those that go single, both great\r\nand Small, have what is called Outriggers, which are Pieces of Wood\r\nfastened to the Gunwale and project out on one side about 6, 8, or 10\r\nfeet, according to the size of the Boat. At the end is fastened in a\r\nParrallel direction to the Canoe a long log of wood simply; or some have\r\nit Shaped in the form of a small Boat, but this is not common; this lays\r\nin the Water and Balances the Boat. Those that are for sailing have\r\nOutriggers only on the other side abreast of the Mast; these serves to\r\nfasten the Shrouds to, and are of use in Trimming the Boat when it blows\r\nfresh; the sailing proes have some one and some 2 masts; the sails are of\r\nMatting and are made narrow at the head and Square at the foot, something\r\nlike a Shoulder of Mutton Sail, such as are generally used in Man-of-War\r\nBarges, etc.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned above that the single Canoes have Outriggers, for those\r\nthat go double--that is 2 together, which is very common--have no need of\r\nany; and it is done in this manner: 2 Canoes are placed in a parrallel\r\ndirection to each other, about 3 or 4 feet asunder, securing them\r\ntogether by small Logs of Wood laid across and lashed to each of their\r\ngunwales; thus the one boat supports the other, and are not in the least\r\ndanger of upsetting, and I believe it is in this manner that all their\r\nlarge Proes are used, some of which will carry a great number of Men, by\r\nmeans of a Platform made of Bamboo or other light wood and the whole\r\nlength of the Proes and considerably broader, but I never saw but one\r\nfitted in this manner upon the whole Island. Upon the Forepart of all\r\nthese large double Proes was placed an Oblong Platform about ten or\r\ntwelve feet in length, and six or eight in Breadth, and supported about 4\r\nfeet above the Gunwale by stout Carved Pillars. The use of these\r\nPlatforms, as we were told, are for the Club Men to stand and fight upon\r\nin time of Battle, for the large Canoes, from what I could learn, are\r\nbuilt most, if not wholly, for war, and their method of fighting is to\r\nGraple one another and fight it out with Clubs, spears, and stones. I\r\nnever saw but one of these sort of Canoes in the water, the rest was all\r\nhauled ashore and seemed to be going to decay, neither were there very\r\nmany of them upon the Island.* (* The war canoes of Tahiti exist no\r\nlonger. The others are still used, and merit all Cook's encomiums on\r\ntheir sailing qualities.)\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and better sort of People generally go from one part of the\r\nisland to another in small double Canoes which carry a little movable\r\nHouse, this not only Skreens them from the Sun by day, but serves them to\r\nSleep in in the Night, and this way of Travelling is Extremely commodious\r\nabout such Islands as are inclosed by a reef as this is; for as these\r\nCanoes draw but Little water they can always keep in the Reefs, and by\r\nthat means are never in danger.\r\n\r\nThey have some few other Canoes, Pahees as they call them, which differ\r\nfrom those above discribed, but of these I saw but 6 upon the whole\r\nIsland, and was told they were not built here. The 2 largest was each 76\r\nfeet long, and when they had been in use had been fastned together. These\r\nare built Sharp and Narrow at both Ends and broad in the Middle; the\r\nbottom is likewise Sharp, inclining to a Wedge, yet Buldges out very much\r\nand rounds in again very quick just below the Gunwale. They are built of\r\nseveral pieces of thick plank and put together as the others are, only\r\nthese have timbers in the inside, which the others have not. They have\r\nhigh Curved Sterns, the head also Curves a little, and both are\r\nornamented with the image of a man carved in wood, very little inferior\r\nwork of the like kind done by common Ship Carvers in England.\r\n\r\nWhen one Considers the Tools these people have one cannot help but\r\nadmiring their workmanship; these are Adzes and small Hatchets made of a\r\nhard Stone, Chizels and Gouges made of human bones, generally the bones\r\nof the Forearm, but Spike Nails have pretty well supplyd the place of\r\nthese. With these ordinary Tools, that a European would expect to break\r\nthe first stroke, I have seen them work surprisingly fast. To plain or\r\npolish their work they rub upon it, with a small stone, Coral Beat small\r\nand Mixed with Water; this is done sometimes by scraping it with Shells,\r\nwith which alone they perform most of their Small wood work.\r\n\r\nTheir Proes or Canoes, large and Small, are row'd and Steer'd with\r\nPaddles, and, notwithstanding the large ones appear to be very unweildy,\r\nthey manage them very dexterously, and I believe perform long and distant\r\nVoyages in them, otherwise they could not have the knowledge of the\r\nIslands in these Seas they seem to have. They wear for Shew or Ornament\r\nat the Mast Head of most of their Sailing Canoes Pendants made of\r\nFeathers.\r\n\r\nHaving described their fighting Canoes I shall next describe their Arms\r\nwith which they attack their Enemys, both by Sea and Land. These are\r\nClubs, Spears or Lances, Slings and Stones which they throw by hand. The\r\nClubs are made of a hard wood, and are about 8 or 9 feet long; the one\r\nhalf is made flatish with 2 Edges, and the other half is round and not\r\nthicker than to be easily grasped by the hand. The Lances are of various\r\nlengths, some from 12, 20 or 30 feet, and are generally Arm'd at the\r\nSmall end with the Stings of Sting-rays, which makes them very dangerous\r\nweapons. Altho' these people have Bows and Arrows--and those none of the\r\nworst--we are told that they never use them in their wars, which\r\ndoubtless is very extraordinary and not easily accounted for. They have\r\nvery Curious breastplates, made of small wickers, pieces of Matting,\r\netc., and neatly Cover'd with Sharks' teeth, Pearl Oyster shells, birds'\r\nfeathers, and dogs' hair. Thus much for their Arms, etc.\r\n\r\n[Tahitian Cloth.]\r\n\r\nI shall now describe their way of making Cloth, which, in my opinion, is\r\nthe only Curious manufacture they have. All their Cloth is, I believe,\r\nmade from the Bark of Trees; the finest is made from a plant which they\r\nCultivate for no other purpose.* (* Broussonetia papyrifera. The\r\nmanufacture is common to all Polynesia, and the ordinary name for it in\r\nthe Pacific is Tapa. The Tahitians, however, called it Ahu.) Dr. Solander\r\nthinks it is the same plant the bark of which the Chinese make paper of.\r\nThey let this plant grow till it is about 6 or 8 feet high, the Stem is\r\nthen about as thick as one's Thum or thicker; after this they cut it down\r\nand lay it a Certain time in water. This makes the Bark strip off easy,\r\nthe outside of which is scraped off with a rough Shell. After this is\r\ndone it looks like long strips of ragged linnen; these they lay together,\r\nby means of a fine paist made of some sort of a root, to the Breadth of a\r\nyard more or less, and in length 6, 8 or 10 Yards or more according to\r\nthe use it is for. After it is thus put together it is beat out to its\r\nproper breadth and fineness, upon a long square piece of wood, with\r\nwooden beaters, the Cloth being keept wet all the time. The beaters are\r\nmade of hard wood with four square sides, are about 3 or 4 inches broad\r\nand cut into grooves of different fineness; this makes the Cloth look at\r\nfirst sight as if it was wove with thread, but I believe the principal\r\nuse of the Groves is to facilitate the beating it out, in the doing of\r\nwhich they often beat holes in it, or one place thinner than another; but\r\nthis is easily repair'd by pasting on small bits, and this they do in\r\nsuch a manner that the Cloth is not the least injured. The finest sort\r\nwhen bleached is very white and comes nearest to fine Cotton. Thick\r\ncloth, especially fine, is made by pasting two or more thickness's of\r\nthin cloth, made for that Purpose, together. Coarse thick cloth and\r\nordinary thin cloth is made of the Bark of Bread fruit Trees, and I think\r\nI have been told that it is sometimes made from the Bark of other trees.\r\nThe making of Cloth is wholy the work of the women, in which all ranks\r\nare employ'd. Their common colours are red, brown and yellow, with which\r\nthey dye some pieces just as their fancy leads them. Besides Cloth they\r\nmake several different sorts of matting, both better and finer than any\r\nwe have in Europe; the stuff they make it on is the Produce of the Palm\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThis Island produceth 2 or 3 sorts of plants, of which they make the rope\r\nthey use in rigging their Canoes, etc.; the finest sort, such as fishing\r\nlines, saine twine, etc., is made of the Bark of a Tree, and some from\r\nthe Kind of Silk grass. Their fishing lines and saines are in Point of\r\ngoodness preferable to any of ours. Their fishing Hooks are very\r\ncuriously made of Tortoise, Pearl Oyster Shells, etc. They have a sort of\r\nSaine that is made of Coarse broad grass like flags; these are twisted\r\nand tied together in a loose manner until the whole is as thick as a\r\nlarge sack, and 60 or 80 fathoms long. This they haul in Shoal smooth\r\nwater; its own weight keeps it so close to the ground that hardly the\r\nsmallest fish can escape out.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned that the Island is divided into two districts or\r\nkingdoms, which are frequently at war with each other, as hapned about 12\r\nMonths ago, and each of these are again divided into smaller districts,\r\nWhennuas as they call them. Over each of the kingdoms is an Eare dehi, or\r\nhead, whom we call a King, and in the Whennuas are Eares, or Chiefs. The\r\nKing's power seems to be but very little; he may be reverenced as a\r\nfather, but he is neither fear'd nor respected as a monarch, and the same\r\nmay be said of the other Chiefs. However, they have a pre-eminence over\r\nthe rest of the People, who pay them a kind of a Voluntary Obedience.\r\nUpon the whole, these people seem to enjoy liberty in its fullest\r\nextent--every man seems to be the sole judge of his own actions and to\r\nknow no punishment but death, and this perhaps is never inflicted but\r\nupon a public enemy. There are 3 ranks of Men and Women: first, the\r\nEares, or chiefs; second, the Manahoonas, or Middling sort; and lastly,\r\nthe Toutous, which comprehend all the lower-class, and are by far the\r\nmost numerous. These seem to live in some sort dependent on the Eares,\r\nwho, together with the Manahoonas, own most, if not all the land. This is\r\nHereditary in their families, and the moment the Heir is born he succeeds\r\nthe Father, both in title and Estate; at least to the name, for its most\r\nlikely that the latter must have the power during his Son or Daughter's\r\nMinority.\r\n\r\nNote by Cook. Upon our arrival at Batavia, we were informed the two\r\nFrench Ships, commanded by the Monsieurs Beaugainvile, touched at that\r\nplace in their way home from the South Seas two years ago. We were here\r\ntold many circumstances of these two Ships, all tending to prove that\r\nthey were the same ships that were at George's Island, which we judged\r\nwere Spaniards; being led into this mistake by the Spanish Iron, etc., we\r\nsaw among the natives, which is easy accounted for, for we are told that\r\nwhile Beaugainvile in the Frigate was delivering up that part of Falkland\r\nIslands possess'd by the French, to the Spaniards, the Store ship was\r\ntrading with the Spaniards in the River Plate, where it is very probable\r\nshe disposed of all her European goods, and purchased others to trade\r\nwith the Islands in the South Seas. To confirm these last circumstances\r\nwe were told that when they arrived at Batavia, the Frigate had on board\r\na great quantity of Spanish Dollars.\r\n\r\n[Religion of Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nHaving given the best account I can of the manners and Customs of these\r\npeople, it will be expected that I should give some account of their\r\nreligion, which is a thing I have learned so little of that I hardly dare\r\nto touch upon it, and should have passed it over in silence, was it not\r\nmy duty as well as inclination to insert in this Journal every and the\r\nleast knowledge I may obtain of a People, who for many Centuries have\r\nbeen shut up from almost every other part of the world.\r\n\r\nThey believe that there is one Supreem God whom they call Tane; from him\r\nsprung a number of inferior Deities, Eatuas as they call them--these they\r\nthink preside over them and intermeddle in their affairs. To these they\r\noffer Oblations such as Hogs, Dogs, Fish, Fruit, etc., and invoke them on\r\nsome particular occasions, as in time of real or Apparent Danger, the\r\nsetting out of a long Voyage, sickness's, etc.; but the Ceremony made use\r\nof on these occasions I know not. The Mories, which we at first thought\r\nwere burying places, are wholy built for Places of worship, and for the\r\nPerforming of religious ceremonies in.* (* Cook did not apparently learn\r\nanything in this voyage of the human sacrifices offered in the Morais on\r\nmany occasions, such as before war; at the coronation of the king; etc.\r\nThe Tahitians were, however, never guilty of cannibalism.) The Viands are\r\nlaid upon altars erected 8, 12, or 12 Feet high, by stout Posts, and the\r\nTable of the Altar on which the Viands lay, is generally made of Palm\r\nleaves; they are not always in the Mories, but very often at some\r\nDistance from them. Their Mories, as well as the Tombs of the Dead, they\r\nseem to hold sacred, and the women never enter the former, whatever they\r\nmay do the latter. The Viands laid near the Tombs of the Dead are, from\r\nwhat I can learn, not for the deceased, but as an Offering to the Eatua\r\nmade upon that Occasion who, if not, would distroy the body and not\r\nexcept of the soul--for they believe of a future state of rewards and\r\npunishments; but what their Ideas are of it I know not. We have seen in\r\nsome few places small Houses set apart on purpose for the Oblations\r\noffer'd to the Eatua, which consists of small strips of Cloth, Viands,\r\netc. I am of Opinion they offer to the Eatua a Strip or small piece of\r\nevery piece of Cloth they make before they use it themselves, and it is\r\nnot unlikely but what they observe the same thing with respect to their\r\nVictuals, but as there are but few of these houses this cannot be a\r\ncommon Custom; it may only be observ'd by the Priests and such families\r\nas are more religious than others.\r\n\r\nNow I have mentioned Priests, there are men that Exercise that function,\r\nof which Numbers Tupia is one. They seem to be in no great repute,\r\nneither can they live wholy by their Profession, and this leads me to\r\nthink that these People are no bigots to their religion. The Priests on\r\nsome occasions do the Office of Physicians, and their prescriptions\r\nconsists in performing some religious ceremony before the sick person.\r\nThey likewise Crown the Eare dehi, or King, in the performing of which we\r\nare told much form and Ceremony is used, after which every one is at\r\nliberty to treat and play as many Tricks with the new King as he pleaseth\r\nduring the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\nThere is a ceremony which they perform at or after the Funerals of the\r\nDead which I had forgot to mention at the time; we hapned to see it\r\nsometime before we left the Island. An old Woman, a relation of\r\nToobouratomita's, hapned to die and was interr'd in the Usual manner. For\r\nseveral successive evenings after, one of her relations dressed himself\r\nin a very odd dress, which I cannot tell how to describe or to convey a\r\nbetter Idea of it than to suppose a man dress'd with plumes of feathers,\r\nsomething in the same manner as those worn by Coaches, Hearses, Horses,\r\netc., at the Funerals in London. It was very neatly made up of black or\r\nbrown and white cloth, black and white feathers, and pearl Oyster Shells.\r\nIt cover'd the head, face, and body, as low as the Calf of the Legs or\r\nlower, and not only looked grand but awful likewise. The man thus\r\nequip'd, and attended by 2 or 3 more men and Women with their faces and\r\nbodys besmear'd with soot, and a Club in their hands, would about sunset\r\ntake a Compass of near a mile running here and there, and wherever they\r\ncame the People would fly from them as tho' they had been so many\r\nhobgoblins, not one daring to come in their way. I know not the reason\r\nfor their Performing this ceremony, which they call Heiva, a name they\r\ngive to most of their divertisements.\r\n\r\nThey compute time by the Moon, which they call Malama, reckoning 30 days\r\nto each moon, 2 of which they say the moon is Mattee, that is, dead, and\r\nthis is at the time of the new moon, when she cannot be seen. The day\r\nthey divide into smaller Portions not less than 2 Hours. Their\r\ncomputations is by units, tens, and scores, up to ten score, or 200, etc.\r\nIn counting they generally take hold on their fingers one by one,\r\nShifting from one hand to the other, until they come to the number they\r\nwant to express; but if it be a high number, instead of their fingers\r\nthey use pieces of Leaves, etc.\r\n\r\nIn conversation one with another they frequently join signs to their\r\nwords, in which they are so expressive that a stranger will very soon\r\ncomprehend their meaning by their actions.\r\n\r\nHaving now done with the People, I must once more return to the Island\r\nbefore I quit it altogether, which, notwithstanding nature hath been so\r\nvery bountiful to it, yet it does not produce any one thing of intrinsick\r\nvalue or that can be converted into an Article of Trade; so that the\r\nvalue of the discovery consists wholy in the refreshments it will always\r\nafford to shipping in their passage through those seas; and in this it\r\nmay be greatly improved by transporting hither horned cattle, etc.\r\nPumpkins have got quite a footing here, the seeds of which most probably\r\nwere brought here by the Spaniards.* (* Bougainville.) We sowed of the\r\nseeds of Water and Musk Mellons, which grew up and throve very fast. We\r\nalso gave of these seeds and the seeds of Pine Apples to several of the\r\nNatives, and it cannot be doubted but what they will thrive here, and\r\nwill be a great addition to the fruits they already have. Upon our first\r\narrival we sowed of all sorts of English garden seeds and grain, but not\r\na single thing came up except mustard sallad; but this I know was not\r\nowing either to the Soil or Climate, but to the badness of the seeds,\r\nwhich were spoil'd by the length of the Passage.\r\n\r\n[Winds at Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nAltho' this Island lies within the Tropick of Capricorn, yet the Heat is\r\nnot Troublesome, nor do the winds blow constantly from the East, but are\r\nsubject to variations, frequently blowing a fresh gale from the\r\nSouth-West Quarter for two or three days together, but very seldom from\r\nthe North-West. Whenever these variable winds happen they are always\r\naccompanied with a swell from the South-West or West-South-West, and the\r\nsame thing happens whenever it is calm and the Atmosphere at the same\r\ntime loaded with Clouds--sure indication that the winds are Variable or\r\nWesterly out at Sea, for clear weather generally attends the settled\r\nTrade.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of Westerly winds within the general Limits of the Easterly\r\nTrade is a little extraordinary, and has induced former Navigators, when\r\nthey met with them, to think that they were caused by the nearness of\r\nsome large Tracks of Land: but I rather think they were owing to another\r\nCause. It hath been found both by the Dolphin and us that the trade winds\r\nin those parts of this Sea doth not extend further to the Southward than\r\n20 degrees, and without which we generally meet with a wind from the\r\nwestward. Now, is it not reasonable to suppose that when these winds blow\r\nstrong they must encroach upon and drive back the Easterly winds as to\r\ncause the variable winds and South-Westerly swells I have been speaking\r\nof? It is well known that the Trade winds blow but faint for some\r\ndistance within their limits, and are therefore easily stopt by a wind\r\nfrom the Contrary direction. It is likewise known that these limits are\r\nsubject to vary several degrees, not only at different seasons of the\r\nYear, but at one and the same season. Another reason why I think that\r\nthese South-West winds are not caused by the nearness of any large Track\r\nof land, is in their being always accompanied with a large swell from the\r\nsame Quarter, and we find a much greater surf beating upon the Shores of\r\nthe South-West sides of the Islands situated just within the Limits of\r\nthe Trade winds than upon any other part of them.\r\n\r\nThe tides are perhaps as inconsiderable in these Seas as in any part of\r\nthe world. A South or South by West moon makes high water in Royal Bay,\r\nbut the water does not rise upon a perpendicular above 10 or 12 inches,\r\nexcept on some very Extraordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nThe variation of the Compass I found to be 4 degrees 46 minutes Easterly,\r\nthis being the mean result of a great number of Trials made by 4 of Dr.\r\nKnight's needles belonging to the Azimuth Compasses, all of which I\r\njudged to be good ones, and yet when applied to the Meridian line I found\r\nthem not only differ one from another sometimes a degree and a half; but\r\nthe same needle would differ from itself more or less, the difference\r\nsometimes amounting to half a degree, both at the same time and on\r\ndifferant days. This will in a great measure account for the seeming\r\nerrors that may, upon a nice examination, appear to have been made in\r\nobserving the Variation inserted in the Course of this Journal. This\r\nvariableness in Magnetick Needles I have many times and in many places\r\nexperienced both ashore and on board of Ships, and I do not remember of\r\never finding two Needles that would agree exactly together at one and the\r\nsame time and place, but I have often found the same Needle agree with\r\nitself for several Trials made immediately one after another.* (* These\r\ndiscrepancies result from imperfections in the suspension and mounting of\r\nthe needles, and are only absent in instruments too delicate for ordinary\r\nsea service.) However, all this is of no sort of consequence to\r\nNavigation, as the Variation of the Compass can always be found to a\r\ndegree of accuracy more than sufficient for all nautical Purposes.\r\n\r\nI have before hinted that these People have an Extensive knowledge of the\r\nIslands situated in these Seas. Tupia, as well as several others, hath\r\ngiven us an account of upwards of 70; but, as the account they have given\r\nof their situation is so Vague and uncertain, I shall refer giving a list\r\nof them until I have learnt from Tupia the Situation of each island with\r\na little more certainty. Four of these islands--viz., Huaheine, Ulietea,\r\nOtaha, and Bolabola* (* These islands are now known as Huaheine, Raiatea,\r\nTahaa, and Borabora or Bolabola, and are under French sovereignty.)--we\r\nwere informed, lay only one or two days' sail to the Westward of George's\r\nIsland, and that we might there procure Hogs, Fowls, and other\r\nrefreshments, Articles that we have been very sparingly supply'd with at\r\nthis last Island, as the Ship's Company (what from the Constant hard duty\r\nthey have had at this place, and the two free use of Woman) were in a\r\nworse state of health than they were on our first arrival, for by this\r\nTime full half of them had got the Venerial disease, in which Situation I\r\nthought they would be ill able to stand the Cold weather we might expect\r\nto meet with to the Southward at this Season of the Year, and therefore\r\nresolved to give them a little time to recover while we ran down to and\r\nexplored the Islands before-mentioned.\r\n\r\nTupia informs us that in the Months of November, December, and January\r\nthey have constant Westerly winds, with rain; also that the whole island\r\ncan muster 6780 Fighting Men, by which some judgment can be formed of the\r\nnumber of inhabitants. Each district furnishes a certain number, which\r\nthe chief is obliged to bring into the field when summoned by the Eare\r\ndehi, or King of the Island, either to make war or repell an invasion.*\r\n(* This paragraph is added in Admiralty copy.)\r\n\r\n[Historical Notes, Tahiti.]\r\n\r\nNotes on Tahiti. The missionaries who came to Tahiti in 1797, in the\r\nmissionary ship Duff, and settled at Matavai, gathered many details of\r\nthe history and economy of the islands. It appears that the state of\r\nsociety, though in many respects savage, had attained a certain pitch of\r\ncivilisation, especially with regard to government. There was generally a\r\nhead chief or king of the whole island, who governed after the feudal\r\nmanner by the sub-chiefs. The sovereignty was hereditary, with this\r\npeculiarity, that the eldest son of the king became from his birth the\r\nsovereign. The father governed henceforth as regent until the son was of\r\nan age to take the reins in his own hands, when the father retired. This\r\nwas the idea; but, as may be imagined, it led to various complications\r\nand difficulties, and wars between the different parts of the island and\r\nthe different chiefs were frequent.\r\n\r\nWhen Wallis discovered the island, in June 1767, Amo was king, or\r\nArii-rahi (called by Cook Eare-dehi), Bereia (Cook's Obereia) being his\r\nwife. The latter seems to have been a woman of much character, and to\r\nhave practically governed the island. The two were separated, inasmuch\r\nthat they had mutually contracted other alliances, but, according to the\r\ncustom of the country, without affecting their friendship.\r\n\r\nOn Wallis's appearance the warlike Tahitians at once attacked the\r\nDolphin, but were easily defeated, and the guns and small arms with which\r\nthey then for the first time made acquaintance had such an effect upon\r\nthem that they speedily made peace, and recognised the superiority of\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nThe defeat had, however, a great effect on the prestige of Amo, whose\r\nauthority rapidly diminished. Tootaha, Amo's brother, and chief of the\r\ndistrict of Matavai, where the Dolphin anchored, was much enriched by her\r\nvisit, and became a greater man in the eyes of his compatriots.\r\nBougainville also touched at Tootaha's district; and although his two\r\nships only remained ten days, it was long enough to furnish this chief\r\nwith many more valuable and coveted articles.\r\n\r\nIn about December 1768, or six months before Cook's visit, war broke out\r\nin the island, and Amo was totally defeated by the chief who governed the\r\neastern peninsula. Cook saw at Papara, on the south side of the main\r\nisland, the relics of this battle in the shape of many human bones.\r\nTootaha, who had joined in the war against his brother, became regent for\r\nthe son (Pomare) of another brother, Hapai, and was therefore the\r\nprincipal man in the island when Cook appeared. Notwithstanding, when Amo\r\n(whom Cook calls Oamo), came to visit the Europeans on 21st June,\r\nbringing his young son, Temare, with him, the latter was carried on men's\r\nshoulders, which was one of the ceremonial observances due to the Otou,\r\nor young king, and the natives present recognised his royal character by\r\nuncovering their shoulders.\r\n\r\nTupia (or Tupaia), who left the island with Cook, was the chief priest of\r\nthe island, and had been living with Bereia; but having shortly before\r\nconspired to kill Tootaha, it is probable that he felt his life was\r\nunsafe in the island.\r\n\r\nFrequent wars raged in the island for many years after Cook's first\r\nvisit. Tootaha was killed in one of these, and when Cook again arrived,\r\nin 1773, Pomare was king, though Cook only knew him by his title of Otou,\r\nwhich he apparently still retained, though there was no regent.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 Captain Bligh called at Tahiti in the Bounty, to export young\r\nbread-fruit trees to the West Indies. The delights of Tahiti probably had\r\ntheir part in bringing about the well-known mutiny a few days after the\r\nship left; and on the return of the Bounty with her crew of mutineers,\r\nsixteen of them remained on the island. These men took a leading part in\r\nthe continual dissensions in the island, until, in 1791, they were\r\ncarried off by the Pandora, sent with the object of capturing the\r\nmutineers.\r\n\r\nEnglish missionaries came to Tahiti in 1797; but after twelve years'\r\nresidence, during which they made no progress, and were constantly in\r\ndanger from the frequent wars, they retreated to Sydney, in New South\r\nWales, leaving two only of their number in Huahine and Eimeo, two of the\r\nSociety Islands. Two years later, on the invitation of Pomare II, who\r\nwas, however, then expelled from Tahiti and living in Eimeo, some of them\r\nreturned, and Pomare became the first convert. Christianity rapidly\r\nspread, and in 1815, Pomare having returned to Tahiti, he and his\r\nChristian followers were attacked. The battle ended in the complete\r\nvictory of Pomare, and for the first time in the sanguinary history of\r\nthe island no butchery of the vanquished followed, nor any devastation of\r\nthe country. The principal idols were destroyed; and whether in\r\nconsequence of the surprise the natives felt at finding that no\r\nretribution followed this sacrilege, or from gratitude at the clemency of\r\nthe victors, opposition to the new religion ceased, the whole island soon\r\nbecame Christian, and the customs of the inhabitants were much changed.\r\nIn 1827 the British Government declined to accede to a request to throw\r\nits protectorate over Tahiti.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 two French priests came to the island with the avowed intention\r\nof proselytising. They were expelled; and after several visits of French\r\nmen-of-war, who came to obtain redress for this act, and an assurance of\r\nfree entrance for French subjects, the island was taken possession of by\r\na French squadron in 1843, and Queen Pomare, daughter of Pomare II, was\r\nde facto deposed. The island has been ever since under the dominion of\r\nFrance. Tahiti is now in a flourishing condition, and exports a\r\nconsiderable quantity of cotton, cocoanuts, and vanilla.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the natives still profess the Protestant religion.\r\n\r\nPapiete, a little westward of Matavai, is now the principal port and town\r\nof the island, the harbour possessing some advantages over the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Tahitians are marvellously fond of singing and dancing, and still\r\nretain their primitive and exceedingly free manners, and the custom of\r\ndecorating themselves with flowers.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the island, with its neighbouring western group, is\r\nprobably unsurpassed, and, considering all the circumstances, it says\r\nmuch for the discipline of the Endeavour that only two of her crew\r\nattempted to remain in what seemed a Paradise.\r\n\r\nCook's efforts to make his men deal properly with the natives are well\r\nillustrated by the following extract from Mr. Molineux's Log, of the 29th\r\nApril. The incident is not mentioned by Cook.\r\n\r\n\"Punished Hy. Jeffs, Seaman, with a dozen lashes for ill-behaviour on\r\nshore. He had been rude to a man's wife yesterday, of which the Indian\r\ncomplained, and Jeffs was confined immediately the Captain had the fact\r\nplainly proved, and next morning the Captain invited the offended Parties\r\non board, who were ignorant of his intentions. All hands being called,\r\nand the Prisoner brought aft, the Captain explained the nature of his\r\nCrime in the most lively manner, and made a very Pathetick speech to the\r\nShip's Company during his punishment. The woman was in the greatest\r\nagonies, and strongly interceded for him. The man's name was Tuburi and\r\nhis wife's name Tamide. I remember them both last Voyage. I should have\r\nmentioned Tuburi being sorry to see Jeffs punished.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from what Cook himself tells us (above), and from what is\r\nnow well known of the laxity of Tahitian morals, that this punishment\r\nwould seem excessive to the natives, and especially to the women, who\r\nwere accustomed themselves to bear whatever blame was bestowed.\r\n\r\nNote. For full description of original Tahitian manners and customs, see\r\n\"Polynesian Researches,\" by W. Ellis (London, H.G. Bohn, 1853); \"Iles\r\nTaiti,\" par MM. Vincendon-Dumoulin et Chas. Desgraz (Paris, 1844).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. TAHITI TO NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE OCCURRENCES AT SEA.\r\n\r\n[July 1769.]\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, July 14th. Gentle breezes at North-East and Clear weather. I have\r\nbefore made mention of our departure from Royal Bay on the preceeding\r\nforenoon, and likewise that I had determined to run down to Huaheine and\r\nUlietea* (* Raiatea.) before we stood to the Southward; but having\r\ndiscovered, from the Hills of George's Island, an Island laying to the\r\nNorthward, we first stood that way to take a nearer View of it. This\r\nIsland is called Tethuroa.* (* Tetiaroa.) It lies North 1/2 West, distant\r\n8 Leagues from Point Venus, and is a small, low, uninhabited Island,\r\nfrequented by the people of George's Island for fish, with which it is\r\nsaid to abound. At 6 A.M. the Westermost part of York Island bore\r\nSouth-East 1/2 South and the body of George's Island East 1/2 South.\r\nPunished the 2 Marines who attempted to desert from us at George's Island\r\nwith 2 Dozen lashes each, and then released them from Confinement. At\r\nNoon the body of York Island* (* Eimeo, or Murea.) bore East by South 1/2\r\nSouth, Royal Bay South 70 degrees 45 minutes East, distant 61 Miles; and\r\nan Island which we took to be Saunder's Island, discovered by Captain\r\nWallace (called by the Natives Topoamanan),* (* Tubuai Manu.) bore\r\nSouth-South-West Latitude observed, 17 degrees 9 minutes South. Saw land\r\nbearing North-West 1/2 West, which Tupia calls the Island of Huaheine.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 15th. Light airs and Variable between the North and\r\nWest-South-West. Clear weather. At 6 p.m. York Island bore South-East,\r\nand Huaheine West-North-West, and at 7 a.m. it bore West. Latitude\r\nobserved at Noon 16 degrees 50 minutes South. Royal Bay South 37 degrees\r\n30 minutes East, distant 22 Leagues.\r\n\r\n[At Huaheine.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 16th. Winds at South and South-South-East. A Gentle Breeze, with\r\nsome few showers of rain. At 6 p.m. the Island of Huaheine West 1/2\r\nSouth, distant 7 or 8 leagues. At 8 a.m., being close in with the\r\nNorth-West part of the Island, sounded, but had no ground with 80\r\nfathoms. Some of the Natives came off to the Ship, but they were very shy\r\nof coming near until they discover'd Tupia; but after that they came on\r\nboard without hesitation. Among those who came on board was the King of\r\nthe Island, whose name is Oree. He had not been long on board before he\r\nand I exchanged Names, and we afterwards address'd each other\r\naccordingly.* (* The Tahitians called Cook Tootee, which was their idea\r\nof the sound of his name, with a vowel termination, none of their words\r\nending in a consonant.) At noon the North end of the Island bore South by\r\nEast 1/2 East, distant 72 Leagues. Latitude observed, 16 degrees 40\r\nminutes South. Three other Islands in sight, namely, Ulietea, Otaha, and\r\nBolabola,* (* Tahaa and Borabora.) so called by the Natives.\r\n\r\nMonday, 17th. Winds Southerly, fine pleasant weather. At 3 p.m. anchored\r\nin a small Harbour on the West side of the Island called by the Natives\r\nOwarhe, in 18 fathoms water, clear ground, and secure from all winds.\r\nSoon after, I went on shore, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and\r\nDr. Monkhouse, Tupia, the King of the Island, and some others of the\r\nNatives, who had been on board since the morning. The Moment we landed\r\nTupia stripped himself as low as his waist, and desir'd Mr. Monkhouse to\r\ndo the same. He then sat down before a great number of the Natives that\r\nwere collected together in a large Shed or House, the rest of us, by his\r\nown desire, standing behind; he then begun a long speach or prayer, which\r\nlasted near a Quarter of an Hour, and in the Course of this Speech\r\npresented to the People two Handkerchiefs, a black silk Neckcloth, some\r\nbeads, and two very small bunches of Feathers. These things he had before\r\nprovided for that purpose. At the same time two Chiefs spoke on the other\r\nside in answer to Tupia, as I suppose, in behalf of the People, and\r\npresented us with some young Plantains plants, and 2 small bunches of\r\nFeathers. These were by Tupia order'd to be carried on board the Ship.\r\nAfter the Peace was thus concluded and ratified, every one was at liberty\r\nto go where he pleased, and the first thing Tupia did was to go and pay\r\nhis Oblations at one of the Mories. This seem'd to be a common ceremony\r\nwith this people, and I suppose always perform'd upon landing on each\r\nother's Territories in a peaceable manner. It further appear'd that the\r\nthings which Tupia gave away was for the God of this People, as they gave\r\nus a Hog and some Cocoanuts for our God, and thus they have certainly\r\ndrawn us in to commit sacriledge, for the Hog hath already received\r\nsentence of Death, and is to be dissected to-morrow. A.M. I set about\r\nSurveying the Island, and Dr. Monkhouse, with some hands, went ashore to\r\nTrade with the Natives, while the Long boat was employ'd compleating our\r\nWater.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 18th. Gentle breezes at South and South-South-West. Clear\r\nweather. The Trading party had no Success to-day. The Natives pretend\r\nthat they have not had time to collect their provisions from the\r\nDifferant parts of the Island, but that on the Morrow we should have\r\nsome; and as I had not seen so much of the Island as I desir'd, I\r\nresolved to stay one day longer to see if anything was to be got.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 19th. P.M. Variable light Airs and clear weather. The Trading\r\nparty had better success to-day than Yesterday. A.M. a Gentle breeze at\r\nSouth-East. As it was known to the Natives that we intended to sail\r\nto-day, Oree, the Chief, and several more, came on board to take their\r\nleave of us. To the Chief was given a small plate on which was Stamp'd\r\nthe following inscription--viz., \"His Britannick Majesty's Ship,\r\nEndeavour, Lieutenant Cook, Commander, 16th July, 1769, Huaheine.\" This\r\nwas accompanied with some Medals, or Counters, of the English Coins,\r\nstruck 1761, together with some other Presents. All these, but more\r\nparticularly the Plate, the Chief promised never to part with. This we\r\nthought would prove as lasting a Testimony of our having first discover'd\r\nthis Island as any we could leave behind. After this was done they were\r\ndismissed, and we began to prepare to leave the place. But as that falls\r\nout on the following day, I shall conclude this with a Discription of the\r\nIsland, which is situated in the Latitude of 16 degrees 43 minutes South,\r\nand Longitude 150 degrees 52 minutes West from Greenwich and North 58\r\ndegrees West, distance, 31 leagues, from King George's Island, or\r\nOtaheite. It is about 7 Leagues in compass, and of a Hilly and uneven\r\nsurface. It hath a safe and commodious Harbour, which lies on the West\r\nside, under the Northermost high land and within the North end of the\r\nReef which lays along that side of the Island. Into this Harbour are 2\r\ninlets, or openings in the Reef, about 1 1/2 Miles from each other. The\r\nSouthermost is the Broadest, on the South side of which is a very small\r\nsandy Island. This Harbour is called by the Natives Ohwarhe. The produce\r\nof this Island is in all respects the same as King George's Island, and\r\nthe Manner and Customs of the inhabitants much the same, only that they\r\nare not addicted to Stealing; and with respect to colour they are rather\r\nfairer than the natives of George's Island, and the whole more Uniformly\r\nof one Colour.\r\n\r\n[At Raiatea.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 20th. Moderate breezes at East and East-North-East. Fair\r\nweather. At 1/2 past 2 p.m. weighed and made Sail for the Island of\r\nUlietea, which lies South-West by West, Distance 7 or 8 leagues from\r\nHuaheine. At 1/2 past 6 we were within 3 Leagues of it, then shortened\r\nsail and stood off and on all night, and at daylight made Sail in shore,\r\nand soon after discover'd an opening in the Reef that lies along this\r\nside of the Island, within which, Tupia said, was a good Harbour. Upon\r\nthis I hoisted out the Pinnace, and sent the Master in to Examine it, who\r\nsoon made the Signal for the Ship to follow. Accordingly we stood in and\r\nAnchor'd in 22 fathoms, soft ground. Soon after we Anchor'd some of the\r\nNatives came on board the Ship with very little invitation.\r\n\r\nFriday, 21st. Winds variable, and dark, cloudy weather, with frequent\r\nShowers of rain. At 1 p.m. I landed in Company with Mr. Banks and the\r\nother gentlemen. The first thing done was the performing of Tupia's\r\nceremony in all respects as at Huaheine. I then hoisted an English jack,\r\nand took possession of the Island and those adjacent in the name of His\r\nBritannick Majesty, calling them by the same names as the natives do.\r\nA.M. sent the Master in the Long boat to examine the coast of the South\r\npart of the Island, and one of the Mates in the Yawl to sound the Harbour\r\nwhere the Ship lay, while I was employ'd in the Pinnace surveying the\r\nNorthern part of the Island, and Mr. Monkhouse went ashore to trade with\r\nthe Natives for such refreshments as were to be got.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 22nd. P.M. the wind Variable with Showers of rain. A.M. strong\r\nGales at South and hazey with rain, and which continued the most part of\r\n\r\nSunday, 23rd, in so much that I did not think it safe to break the Ship\r\nloose and put to sea as I intended.\r\n\r\nMonday, 24th. Winds variable from South-South-East to North-East. At 8\r\na.m. got under sail and plyed to the Northward within the Reef, in order\r\nto go out at the Northern Channell, it being the broadest; but being\r\nlittle wind and meeting with Shoals we had not before discovered, we\r\nturned down but slowly.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 25th. First part, little wind at North-East; in the night calm,\r\nA.M. a fresh breeze at West-North-West, fair weather. At 3 p.m. Anchor'd\r\nin 22 fathoms Muddy bottom, the North Channell open bearing North-East\r\n1/2 East, at 5 a.m. a breeze sprung up at North-West, weighed and put to\r\nSea, and hauled to the Northward in order to take a View of the Island\r\nand Ataha and Bolabola; but before I proceed farther, I shall describe\r\nthe Harbour we have been in.* (* It has no particular name, but extends\r\nthe whole of the eastern side of Raiatea.) This Harbour, taken in its\r\ngreatest Extent, is capable of holding any number of Shipping in perfect\r\nsecurity, as it extends almost the whole length of this side of the\r\nIsland, and is defended from the Sea by a reef of Coral rocks; the\r\nSouthermost opening* (* Teava Moa Pass.) in this reef or Channell into\r\nthe Harbour, which is not more than a Cable's length wide, is off the\r\nEastermost point of the Island, and may be known by a small woody Island,\r\nwhich lies a little to the South-East of it. Between 3 and 4 miles\r\nNorth-West from this Island lies 2 other small Islands, and in the same\r\ndirection as the reef, of which they are a part. Between these 2 Islands\r\nis another Channell* (* Iriru Pass.) into the Harbour that is a full\r\nQuarter of a Mile broad; still further to the North-West are some other\r\nsmall Islands, where, I am informed, is another small inlet, but this I\r\ndid not see; but, as to the other 2, we enter'd the Harbour by the one\r\nand came out by the other.\r\n\r\nThe principal refreshments we have got here consists in Plantains, Cocoa\r\nnuts, some Yams and a few Hogs and fowls. This side of the Island is\r\nneither Populous nor Rich in Produce, if compared to George's Island, or\r\neven Huaheine; however, here is no want of refreshments for a ship who\r\nmay put in here and stay but a short time; and wood and water may be got\r\neverywhere, tho' the latter is not very convenient to come at.\r\n\r\n[Off Bolabola.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 26th. Winds at West by North and West by South, but very\r\nVariable towards the Latter part. At 4 p.m. the North End of Ulietea\r\nSouth 75 degrees West, distance 2 leagues, and the south end of Otaha\r\nNorth 77 degrees West. About a League to the Northward of the South end\r\nof Otaha, on the East side of the Island, a mile or more from the Shore,\r\nlies 2 Small Islands. Between these Islands Tupia says there is a\r\nChannell into a very good harbour which lies within the Reef and it had\r\nall the appearance of such. Keept plying to Windward all night without\r\ngetting any ground. At Noon the Peak on Bolabola West by South. Latitude\r\nobserved 16 degrees 26 minutes South.\r\n\r\nThursday, 27th. Variable light Airs of wind in the South-West Quarter,\r\nand fair weather. Seeing that there is a broad Channell between Otaha and\r\nBolabola, I intend to go through that way and not run to the Northward of\r\nall; but as the wind is right an end, and very Variable withall, we get\r\nlittle or no ground. Between 5 and 6 o'Clock p.m., as we were standing to\r\nthe Northward, we discover'd a small low Island lying North by West or\r\nNorth-North-West distant 4 or 5 Leagues from Bolabola. This Island is\r\ncalled Tubai. Tupia says it produces nothing but a few Cocoa Nuts, that\r\nthere are only 3 families live upon it, but that the people from these\r\nIslands resort thither to Catch fish. At Noon the peak of Bolabola bore\r\nNorth 25 degrees West, and the north end of Otaha North 80 degrees West,\r\ndistant 3 Leagues. Latitude observed 16 degrees 38 minutes South.\r\n\r\nFriday, 28th. Little wind and Variable between the South-West and\r\nNorth-West. At 6 a.m., being near the Entrance of the Harbour which lies\r\non the East side of Otaha before mentioned,* (* Hamene Bay.) and finding\r\nthat it might be examin'd without loosing time, I sent away the Master in\r\nthe Long boat, with orders to sound the Harbour, and if the wind did not\r\nshift in our favour to land upon the Island and to Traffick with the\r\nNatives for such refreshments as were to be got. Mr. Banks and Dr.\r\nSolander went along with him.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 29th. Little wind and Variable. Kept plying on and off this\r\nday, waiting for the return of the Long boat. At 1/2 past 5 not seeing\r\nanything of her, fir'd a Gun for her to return, and as soon as it was\r\ndark hoisted a light. At 1/2 past 8 heard the report of a musquet, which\r\nwe answered with a Gun; and soon after the Boat came on board with 3\r\nsmall Hogs, a few Fowls, and a large Quantity of Plantains, and some\r\nYams. They found the Natives very Sociable and ready to part with\r\nanything they had, and the Harbour safe and Commodious, with a good\r\nAnchorage in 25, 20, and 16 fathoms clear ground. As soon as the Boat was\r\nhoisted in we made Sail to the Northward, and at 8 o'Clock a.m. were\r\nclose under the Peak of Bolabola, but as we could not weather the Island,\r\nwe Tack'd and stood off until near Noon, then Tack'd again and stood to\r\nthe South-West. At Noon the Peak of Bolabola bore South 75 degrees West;\r\nwe were then distant from the Shore under it 2 or 3 miles, and from the\r\nPeak about 5 miles. Latitude observed 16 degrees 29 minutes South.\r\n\r\nSunday, 30th. Wind in the South-East Quarter. At first a Gentle breeze,\r\nbut afterwards freshned upon us. P.M. made several Trips before we could\r\nweather the South end of Bolabola, which at last we accomplished between\r\n7 and 8 o'Clock, and stood off South-South-West until 12 at night, then\r\nTack'd and stood in until 4 a.m., then stood off again; but meeting with\r\na large swell from the Southward, against which the Ship made little or\r\nno way, at 8 we tack'd and stood in Shore again. At this time we\r\ndiscovered an Island which bore from us North 63 degrees West, distant\r\nabout 8 Leagues: at the same time the Peak of Bolabola bore North 1/2\r\nEast, distance 3 or 4 Leagues. This Island Tupia calls Maurua, and\r\naccording to his account it is but small, and surrounded by a Reef of\r\nRocks, and hath no Harbour fit for Shipping. It is inhabited, and its\r\nproduce is the same as the other Islands we have touched at. It riseth in\r\na high round hill in the middle of the Island, which may be seen 10\r\nLeagues. At noon the South end of Otaha bore North 80 degrees East,\r\ndistance 4 Leagues. Latitude observed 16 degrees 39 minutes South.\r\n\r\nMonday, 31st. Fresh Gales in the South-East Quarter, and close, cloudy\r\nweather. Plying to windward all this day, on the South-West side of\r\nOtaha, without gaining little or anything. In the middle watch was\r\nobliged to double reef our Topsails, but in the morning it fell moderate,\r\nand we crowded all the sail we could. At Noon the South end of Otaha bore\r\nEast, distance 2 Leagues. Latitude observed 16 degrees 40 minutes South.\r\nTupia told us there was a very good Harbour within the Reef which lies on\r\nthis side of Otaha; but this Harbour I shall discribe in another place.\r\n\r\n[August 1769. At Raiatea.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, August 1st. A fresh Gale at South-East the most part of this\r\nday. Keept plying to windward all the afternoon and night, and in the\r\nmorning found ourselves nearly the length of the South end of Ulietea,\r\nand to windward of some Harbours that lay on the West side of this\r\nIsland. Into one of them I intended to go with the Ship, in order to stop\r\na Leak in the Powder room, which could not be easily done at Sea, and to\r\ntake in more Ballast, as I found her too light to carry sail upon a wind.\r\nAt Noon plying off one of the Harbour's mouth, the wind being right out.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 2nd. Moderate breezes at South-East and East, with some\r\nShowers of Rain. At 3 p.m. anchor'd in the Entrance of the Channell\r\nleading into the Harbour* (* Rautoanui.) in 14 fathoms water; found a\r\ntide setting pretty strong out, which was the reason that we could not\r\nwork in; carried out the Kedge Anchor in order to warp into the Harbour,\r\nbut after this was done we could not Trip the Bower Anchor with all the\r\npurchass we could make, and was therefore obliged to lay still all night,\r\nbut in the morning we did it with Ease, and warped the Ship into a proper\r\nbirth, and moor'd in 28 fathoms, a sandy bottom. A great many of the\r\nNatives came off to us both last night and this morning, and brought with\r\nthem Hogs, Fowls, Plaintains, etc., which they parted with at a very easy\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThursday, 3rd. Winds from East-South-East to North-East; very Hot weather\r\nthis afternoon. I went ashore to look for a place to get stones for\r\nBallast, and a watering place, both of which I found very convenient; and\r\nin the morning sent an Officer a Shore to Superintend the getting off the\r\nBallast and Water, and I went in the Pinnace to the Northward to survey\r\nthat part of the Island, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, while\r\nthe Carpenters were employ'd on board stopping the Leaks of the Powder\r\nroom and Foresail room.\r\n\r\nFriday, 4th. First and Latter parts, moderate breezes, at\r\nEast-North-East; in the night, Calm, Hot, and sultry. In our rout to the\r\nNorthward this afternoon we were entertained at one place with Musick and\r\nDancing. The Musick consisted of 3 Drums, and the Dancing was mostly\r\nperform'd by 2 Young Women and one Man, and this seem'd to be their\r\nprofession. The dress of the women was such as we had not seen before; it\r\nwas neat, decent, and well chose, and in many respects not much unlike a\r\nEuropean dress; only their Arms, Necks, and Shoulders were bare, and\r\ntheir headdress was the Tomow stuck with Flowers. They made very little\r\nuse of their feet and Legs in Dancing, but one part or another of their\r\nbodies were in continual motion and in various postures, as standing,\r\nsetting, and upon their Hands and knees, making strange Contorsions.\r\nTheir Arms, hands, and Fingers they moved with great Agility and in a\r\nvery Extraordinary manner, and altho' they were very exact in observing\r\nthe same motion in all their movements, yet neither their Musick or\r\nDancing were at all Calculated to please a European. There were likewise\r\nsome men, who acted a kind of a Farce; but this was so short that we\r\ncould gather nothing from it, only that it shew'd that these People have\r\na Notion of Dramatick performances, and some of our Gentlemen saw them\r\nact a Farce the next day, wherein was 4 Acts, and it seem'd to them to\r\nrepresent a War between the Bolabola men and those of Ulietea, wherein\r\nthe former triumph'd over the latter; but what might help them to draw\r\nthis Conclusion was the knowing that such a thing has not long ago hapned\r\nbetween these 2 People, and that the Bolabola men at present possess most\r\nof the Lands on this Island. This is their grand Dramatick Heiva, and I\r\nbelieve is occasionally performed in all the Islands. Upon my return to\r\nthe Ship in the evening I found that they had got on board 20 Tuns of\r\nBallast, and this I thought would be sufficient. In the morning we sent\r\nall our water Casks on shore, and got them all off full by Noon. This\r\nmorning I received a present from Opoony, the Eare dehi of Bolabola, who\r\nat this time was upon this Island. It consisted of 3 Hogs, some pieces of\r\nCloth, Plantains, Cocoa Nuts, etc. These were sent by his Servants, and I\r\nwas told that he would come the next day himself.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 5th. This evening we bought as much Fish as the whole Ship's\r\nCompany could destroy while good. In the morning I sent the Master to the\r\nNorth End of the Island with the Long boat to Traffick with the Natives\r\nfor Provisions, as they did not bring it to the Ship, as they had\r\nhitherto done; and myself, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander,\r\nwent in the Pinnace to the Southern part of the Island, partly on the\r\nsame account and partly to Examine that part of the Island. In our rout\r\nwe passed thro' 2 Harbours equally as good as the one in which the Ship\r\nlays, but the Country about them is poorer and but thinly inhabited, and\r\nwe got no one thing worth bringing home with us, but the Master succeeded\r\nsomething better.\r\n\r\nSunday, 6th. Variable light Airs and fair weather. A.M. I sent the Master\r\nagain to the Northward to procure refreshments, who return'd not\r\nunsuccessfull. Opoony, the Chief, sent some of his people this morning to\r\nme to get something in return for the present he sent the other day; he\r\nnot choosing, as I suppose, to trust himself on board, or perhaps he\r\nthought the persons he sent (who were 3 very pretty young Girls) would\r\nsucceed better than he should do. Be this as it may, they went away very\r\nwell satisfied with what they got, altho' I believe that they were\r\ndisappointed in some things.\r\n\r\nMonday, 7th. Variable light Airs. P.M. some Showers of rain. Being\r\ndesirous to see King Opoony, we made a party this afternoon and I went\r\nashore for that purpose, carrying along with us a small present. Upon our\r\nlanding he did not receive us setting, as all the other Chiefs had\r\nhitherto done, or in any manner of Form; this we attributed to his\r\nStupidity, for such he appeared to be. However, he gave me a Hog in\r\nreturn for the present I made him, and this was paying us full as great a\r\nComplement. Before we took our leave we let him know that we should go to\r\nOtaha in the morning in our Boats, and would be glad to have him along\r\nwith us, and he accordingly promised to accompany us thither.\r\nAccordingly, very early in the morning, I set out with both Pinnace and\r\nLong boat for Otaha, and some of the Gentlemen along with me; and in our\r\nway called upon Opoony, who was in his Canoe ready to set out. As soon as\r\nwe landed on Otaha I made him a present of a Axe; this I thought would\r\ninduce him to incourage his Subjects to bring us such Provisions as we\r\nwanted, but I believe we had already got all they intended us, for after\r\nstaying with him until Noon we were obliged to go away without geting any\r\none thing.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 8th. After leaving Opoony we proceeded towards the North point\r\nof the Island, and in our way pick'd up half a Dozen Hogs, as many Fowls,\r\nand some Plantains and Yams; and I had an opportunity to view and draw a\r\nSketch of the Harbour which lies on this Side of the Island, and which\r\nwas the only thing that induced me to make this Excursion. After it was\r\ndark we met with the Longboat, which I had in the morning dispatch'd to\r\nanother part of the Island; and we now made the best of our way to the\r\nShip and got on board about 10 at night. The Carpenter having finished\r\nstopping the Leaks about the Powder Room and Sailroom I now intend to\r\nsail as soon as ever the wind will permit us to get out of the Harbour.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 9th. P.M. had a light breeze of wind at North; in the night\r\nhad much rain. A.M. little wind and Variable, with some Showers of rain.\r\nAt 11 a.m. a breeze of wind sprung up at East, which carried us out of\r\nthe Harbour, and as soon as the Boats were hoisted in made Sail to the\r\nSouthward. Since we have been about these Islands we have expended but\r\nlittle of our Sea Provisions, and have at this last place been very\r\nplentifully supply'd with Hogs, Fowls, Plantains, and Yams, which will be\r\nof very great use to us in case we should not discover any lands in our\r\nrout to the Southward, the way I now intend to Steer.\r\n\r\n[Description of Society Islands.]\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ISLANDS, ULIETEA, OTAHA AND BOLABOLA.\r\n\r\nSo called by the Natives, and it was not thought adviseable to give them\r\nany other Names; but these three, with Huaheine, Tuibai, and Maurua, as\r\nthey lay contigious to one another, I have named Society Isles.\r\n\r\nThey are situated between the Latitude of 16 degrees 10 minutes and 16\r\ndegrees 55 minutes South and between the Longitude 151 degrees 00 minutes\r\nand 151 degrees 42 minutes West from the Meridian of Greenwich. Ulietea\r\nand Otaha lay close to each other, and are both inclosed within a Reef of\r\nCoral Rocks; and altho' the distance between the one and the other is\r\nnear 2 Miles, yet there is no Passage for Shipping. By means of this reef\r\nare form'd several excellent Harbours. The entrance into them are but\r\nnarrow, but when a Ship is once in nothing can hurt her. Those on the\r\nEast side have been already described. On the West side of Ulietea, which\r\nis the largest Island of the 2, are 3, the Northermost of which, called\r\nOraotanue,* (* Rautoanui.) we lay in, the Channell leading in is a 1/4 of\r\na Mile wide and lies between 2 low sandy Islands, which are the\r\nNorthermost small Islands on this side. You have good Anchorage between\r\nor just within the 2 Islands in 28 fathoms soft ground. This harbour,\r\ntho' but small, yet it is preferable to any on the Island, on account of\r\nthe easy getting of fresh Water, and being seated in the most fertile\r\npart of the Island. The other 2 harbours lay to the Southward of this,\r\nand not far from the South end of the Island. In both of them are good\r\nAnchorage in 10, 12, and 14 fathoms water: they are readily known by 3\r\nsmall woody Islands that lay at their entrance, the Southermost Harbour\r\nlies within and to the Southward of the Southermost Island, and the other\r\nlies between the Northermost. There are more Harbours at the South End of\r\nthis Island, as I am inform'd, but these were not examind by us.\r\n\r\nOtaha affords 2 very good Harbours, one on the East and the other on the\r\nWest side; that on the East side called Ohamane* (* Hamene.) hath been\r\nalready mentioned, the other is called Oharurua* (* Hurepiti.) and lies\r\nabout the middle of the South-West side of the Island. It is pretty\r\nlarge, and affords good Anchorage in 20 and 25 fathoms, and there is no\r\nwant of fresh Water. The breach in the Reef which forms a Channell into\r\nthis harbour is 1/4 of a mile broad, steep too, on both sides, and the\r\nsame may be said of all the others, and in general there is no danger but\r\nwhat is Visible.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Bolabola lies North-West by West from Otaha, distant 4\r\nLeagues, it is incompassed by a reef of Rocks and several small Islands,\r\nand the Circuit of the whole appear'd to be about 8 Leagues. On the\r\nSouth-West side of the Islands (as I am inform'd) is an opening in the\r\nReef which admits of a Channell into a very good Harbour. This Island is\r\nvery remarkable on account of a high Craggy hill upon it, which\r\nTerminates at Top in 2 Peaks, one higher than the other; this hill is so\r\nperpendicular that it appears to be quite inaccessible. The land on\r\nUlietea and Otaha is of a very hilly, broken, and uneven surface, except\r\nwhat borders upon the Sea Coast, and high withall, yet the Hills look\r\ngreen and pleasant and are in many places cloathed with woods.\r\n\r\nThe Produce of these Islands, and manners and Customs of the Natives are\r\nmuch the same as at King George's Island, only as the Bread fruit Tree is\r\nhere in not such plenty, the natives to supply that deficiency plant and\r\nCultivate a greater Quantity of Plantains and Yams of several sorts, and\r\nthese they have in the greatest Perfection.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are rather of a fairer Colour than the Generality of the\r\nNatives of George's Island, but more especially the Women, who are much\r\nfairer and handsomer, and the Men are not so much Addicted to thieving,\r\nand are more Open and free in their behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe only differance we could see in their Religion was in the Houses of\r\ntheir Gods, which were very different to those we saw on George's Island.\r\nThose here were made about the Size and shape of a Coffin open at one\r\nEnd; they are laid upon a Number of small Wooden Arches, which are fram'd\r\nand fastned together like the Roof of a House, and these are generally\r\nsupported about 3 or 4 feet above the ground by Posts. Over the box is a\r\nsmall roof or shade made of Palm thatch; in this Box are deposited the\r\nOblations of the Gods, such as Pieces of Cloth, Human bone, etc., and\r\nthese places they hold sacred, and some are placed in their Mories, and\r\nsome not. They have a Custom of preserving the Sculls and under Jaw bones\r\nof the Dead, but wether of their Friends or Enemies I cannot pretend to\r\nsay. Several of the Sculls, we observed, were broke, and its very\r\nprobable that the owners of them had been kill'd in battle, as some of\r\ntheir Weapons are well Calculated for breaking of Heads; and from what we\r\ncould learn it is a Custom with them to cut out the Lower jaw of their\r\nEnemies, but I believe not before they are kill'd, and these they keep as\r\nTrophies, and are sometimes hung up in their Houses.\r\n\r\nThe Chief or King of Bolabola hath of late Years Usurped the Sovereignty\r\nof the other two, and the Bolabola men at this time possess great part of\r\nthe Lands on Ulietea and Otaha that they have taken from the Natives. The\r\nLands adjoining to the Harbours of Oraotanue belong'd to Tupia, the\r\nPerson we have on board, who is a Native of Ulietea. These people are\r\nvery ingenious in building their Proes or Canoes, and seem to take as\r\nmuch Care of them, having large Shades or Houses to put them in, built\r\nfor the purpose, and in these houses they likewise build and repair them,\r\nand in this they shew a great deal of ingenuity far more than one could\r\nexpect. They are built full Bellied, and after the very same Model as\r\nthose Six we saw on George's Island, which I have already described, and\r\nsome of them are full as large; it is more than probable that these 6\r\nProes were built at some of these Islands. In these Proes, or Pahies as\r\nthey call them, from all the accounts we can learn, these people sail in\r\nthose Seas from Island to Island for several hundred Leagues, the Sun\r\nserving them for a Compass by day, and the Moon and Stars by night. When\r\nthis comes to be proved, we shall be no longer at a loss to know how the\r\nIslands lying in those Seas came to be peopled; for if the inhabitants of\r\nUlietea have been at Islands laying 2 or 300 Leagues to the Westward of\r\nthem, it cannot be doubted but that the inhabitants of those Western\r\nIslands may have been at others as far to Westward of them, and so we may\r\ntrace them from Island to Island quite to the East Indies.\r\n\r\nTupia tells us that during the months of November, December, and January\r\nWesterly winds, with rain, prevail; and as the inhabitants of the Islands\r\nknow very well how to make the proper use of the winds, there will no\r\ndifficulty arise in Trading or Sailing from Island to Island, even tho'\r\nthey lie in an East and West direction.* (* This paragraph is from the\r\nAdmiralty copy of Cook's Journal. This fact is now well known. The\r\nislands here described, the Society Islands of Cook, and now known as the\r\nLeeward Group of the Society Islands, were generally under the dominion\r\nof Tahiti. At the time of Cook's visit, the chief of Bolabola was supreme\r\nover most of the group, and their tie to Tahiti was but slight. They are\r\nall very beautiful and fertile. Within the last decade they have formally\r\nbeen recognised as belonging to France.)\r\n\r\n[Sail from Society Islands.]\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE OCCURRENCES IN THE SOUTH SEAS.\r\n\r\nThursday, August 10th. P.M., Light Airs and Calm, remainder fresh breezes\r\nand Cloudy. At 6 p.m. the South end of Ulietea South-East 1/2 East,\r\ndistant 4 Leagues; but I take my departure from the\r\nHarbour, saild from in Latitude 16 degrees 46 minutes South, and\r\nLongitude 151 degrees 27 minutes West. At 7 a.m. found the Variation to\r\nbe 5 degrees 50 minutes East. Wind Easterly; course South 16 degrees\r\nWest; distance 50 miles; Latitude observed 17 degrees 34 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 151 degrees 41 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 11th. Fresh breezes and Clear weather. Wind East; course South 4\r\ndegrees West; distance 85 miles; latitude 18 degrees 59 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 151 degrees 45 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 12th. Gentle breezes and fair weather. Wind East, East by\r\nNorth; course South 3/4 East; distance 77 miles; latitude 20 degrees 15\r\nminutes South, longitude 151 degrees 36 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 13th. Moderate breezes and Clear weather. Variation 5 degrees 40\r\nminutes East. Wind East by North; course South 16 degrees East; distance\r\n96 miles; latitude 21 degrees 47 minutes South, longitude 151 degrees 9\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 14th. Fresh breezes and fair weather. At 2 p.m. saw land bearing\r\nSouth-East, which Tupia calls the Island of Ohetiroa.* (* Rurutu, one of\r\nthe Tubuai or Austral Group. They are now under French protectorate.) At\r\n6 was within 2 or 3 Leagues of it, the Extreams bearing from South by\r\nEast to South-East; shortned sail and stood off and on all night; at 6\r\na.m. made Sail and stood in for the Land and run to Leeward of the\r\nIsland, keeping close in shore all the time, saw several of the Natives\r\nas we run along shore, but in no great numbers. At 9 hoisted out the\r\nPinnace and sent Lieutenant Gore, Mr. Banks, and Tupia to Endeavour to\r\nland upon the Island, and to speak with the Natives, and to try if they\r\ncould learn from them what lands lay to the Southward of us, and likewise\r\nto see if there was Anchorage in a Bay which appear'd to our View, not\r\nthat I intended to Anchor or make any stay here. Wind North-North-East;\r\nlatitude 22 degrees 26 minutes South, longitude 150 degrees 55 minutes\r\nWest; at noon, Ohetiroa East 2 leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 15th. Fresh breezes and fair weather. At 2 p.m. the Pinnace\r\nreturn'd on board without landing, not but what it was practicable, but\r\nthey did not think it Altogether safe with only one Boat, as it would\r\nhave been attended with some danger on account of the Surf and Rocks upon\r\nthe Shore. The Natives were Arm'd, and Shewd no Signs either of fear or\r\nFriendship. Some of them came off to the Boat in a Canoe, and had some\r\nNails and Beads given them; but with these they were not Satisfied,\r\nthinking they had a right to everything in the Boat, and at last grew so\r\nTroublesome that in order to get clear of them our People were obliged to\r\nfire some Musquets, but with no intent to hurt any of them; however, it\r\nso hapned that one Man was Slightly wounded in the head. The firing had\r\nthe desired effect, and they thought fit to retire. After this, as the\r\nBoat lay near the Shore, some of them waded off to her, and brought with\r\nthem some Trifles which they parted with for small Nails, etc. They\r\nseem'd desirous that our people should land, but this was looked upon as\r\na Piece of Policy in them to get the whole Boat's Crew in their power;\r\nhowever, this was not attempted, as I had given orders to run no Risk.\r\nThe Bay they went into, which lies on the West side of the Island, had in\r\nit 25 fathoms Water, but the bottom was very foul and Rocky. We had now\r\nmade the Circuit of the Island (which did not appear to the best\r\nadvantage), and found that there was neither a Harbour or safe Anchorage\r\nabout it, and therefore I thought the Landing upon it would be attended\r\nwith no advantage either to ourselves or any future navigators; and from\r\nthe Hostile and thievish disposition of the Natives it appear'd that we\r\ncould have no friendly intercourse with them until they had felt the\r\nSmart of our fire Arms, a thing that would have been very unjustifiable\r\nin me at this Time; we therefore hoisted in the Boat, and made Sail to\r\nthe Southward.\r\n\r\n[Of the Austral Group.]\r\n\r\nThis Island is situated in the Latitude of 22 degrees 27 minutes South,\r\nand in the Longitude of 150 degrees 47 minutes West from the Meridian of\r\nGreenwich.* (* Latitude is correct. Longitude 151 degrees 20 minutes\r\nWest.) It is 13 miles in Circuit, and tolerably high; it appears to be\r\nneither Populous nor fertile; its produce seem'd to be nearly the same as\r\nthe other Islands we have touched at, and likewise the Stature, Colour,\r\nHabit, and Arms of the Natives, only that some of them wore Pieces of\r\nCloth like broad belts, different both in Shape and Colour to anything of\r\nthe kind we had seen before, and their Arms, and in general everything\r\nthey had about them, much neater made, and shew'd great proofs of an\r\ningenious fancy. Tupia says that their are several Islands laying at\r\ndifferent directions from this--that is, from the South to the West and\r\nNorth-West--and that 3 days' sail to the North-East is an Island called\r\nManua, that is Bird Island, and that it lies 4 days' sail from Ulietea,\r\nwhich is one day less than from Ulietea to Ohetiroa.* (* Tupia was right\r\nexcept with respect to Manua, as there is no island answering his\r\ndescription.) From this account I shall be able to find the Situation of\r\nManua pretty well. Since we have left Ulietea Tupia hath been very\r\ndesirous for us to steer to the Westward, and tells us if we will go that\r\nway we shall be with plenty of Islands: the most of them he himself hath\r\nbeen at, and from the discription he gives of two of them they must be\r\nthose discover'd by Capt. Wallace, and by him called Boscawen and\r\nKeppel's Islands, and those do not lay less than 400 Leagues to the\r\nWestward of Ulietea. He says that they are 10 or 12 days in going\r\nthither, and 30 or more in coming Back, and that their Pahies--that is\r\ntheir large Proes--sails much faster than this Ship. All this I believe\r\nto be true, and therefore they may with Ease sail 40 Leagues a day or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe farthest Island to the Southward that Tupia hath been at, or knows\r\nanything of, lies but 2 days' Sail from Ohetiroa, and is called Moutou,*\r\n(* Tubuai.) but he says that his father once told him that there was\r\nIslands to the Southward of it; but we Cannot find that he either knows\r\nor ever heard of a Continent or large Track of Land. I have no reason to\r\ndoubt Tupia's information of these Islands, for when we left Ulietea and\r\nsteer'd to the Southward he told us that if we would keep a little more\r\nto the East (which the wind would not permit us to do) we should see\r\nManua, but as we then steer'd we should see Ohetiroa, which hapned\r\naccordingly. If we meet with the Islands to the Southward he speaks off,\r\nit's well, but if not, I shall spend no more time searching for them,\r\nbeing now fully resolv'd to stand directly to the Southward in search of\r\na Continent. Wind Northerly; course South 1/2 East; distance 94 miles;\r\nlatitude 24 degrees 1 minute South, longitude 150 degrees 37 minutes\r\nWest; at noon, Ohetiroa North 1/2 West, 31 leagues; variation 6 degrees 7\r\nminutes East.\r\n\r\nNOTE. As we advanced to the Southward into Cold weather, and a troubled\r\nSea, the Hogs we got at Ulietea began to die apace. They cannot endure\r\nthe least cold, nor will they hardly eat anything but vegetables, so that\r\nthey are not at all to be depended upon at Sea. The fowls also have a\r\ncomplaint general among them which affects their heads, so that they\r\ncontinue holding it down betwixt their Legs until they die; this at least\r\nwas the fate of most of ours. This is necessary to be known to those who\r\ncome such Voyages as these, least they place too much dependance on the\r\nlive stock they get at the Islands.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 16th. Fresh breezes and Cloudy the first part; in the night,\r\nSqually, with rain; remainder, moderate and fair weather. At 8 am, saw\r\nthe Appearances of high land to the Eastward; bore up towards it, but at\r\n10 we discover'd it to be only Clouds, at which we hauld our wind to the\r\nSouthward. At Noon found the Ship by Observation 21 Miles to the\r\nNorthward of the Log, which may in some measure be owing to a South-West\r\nswell we have had all the last 24 hours. Wind North by West, West, West\r\nby South; course South 15 degrees East; distance 62 miles; latitude 25\r\ndegrees 00 minutes South, longitude 150 degrees 19 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 17th. A Gentle breeze with some flying showers of rain. Had a\r\nlarge Swell from the South-West all this day, much larger than yesterday,\r\nand this must be the reason why the observ'd Latitude differ'd from the\r\nLog again to day 16 miles. Wind West by South to South-West by South;\r\ncourse South-South-East; distance 76 miles; latitude 26 degrees 10\r\nminutes South, longitude 149 degrees 46 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 18th. The first part Calm; remainder light breezes and Clear.\r\nVariation per Amplitude in the evening 8 degrees 8 minutes East; in the\r\nMorning 7 degrees 56 minutes East. Carpenters employed repairing the\r\nBoats. The South-West swell still Continues, but not so much as\r\nYesterday, and the observed Latitude and Log agrees. Wind Calm, North;\r\ncourse South 18 degrees East; distance 38 miles; latitude 26 degrees 48\r\nminutes South, longitude 149 degrees 42 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 19th. Little wind with much rain in the night, the South-West\r\nswell still Continues, from which I conclude that there is no land near\r\nus in that Quarter. Wind North-West; course South-East by South; distance\r\n62 miles; latitude 27 degrees 40 minutes South; longitude 149 degrees 6\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 20th. Little wind all this day. Saw a large Albetross. Wind\r\nNorth-West; course South-East by South; distance 57 miles; latitude 28\r\ndegrees 24 minutes South, longitude 148 degrees 25 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 21st. Fresh Gales and Hazey weather. Saw 2 Pintado Birds, the\r\nfirst I have seen this Voyage; they are larger than a Pidgeon and\r\nchecquer'd black and white over their backs and wings, with white\r\nBellies, Black heads, and the end of their Tails black.* (* Cape pigeons,\r\nDaption Capensis.) Wind North-North-West; course South by East; distance\r\n80 miles; latitude 29 degrees 44 minutes South, longitude 148 degrees 22\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\n[Society Islands to New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 22nd. First part Strong Gales with much rain, Thunder, and\r\nLightning; remainder moderate and fair weather. About Noon saw some rock\r\nweed, an Albetross, and some Smaller Sea Birds. Wind North by West,\r\nSouth-West by West; course South 14 degrees East; distance 81 miles;\r\nlatitude 31 degrees 3 minutes South, longitude 148 degrees 00 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 23rd. Little wind for the most part, and pretty clear weather.\r\nIn the night had some Showers of rain. Saw a Grampus, and several Pintado\r\nBirds. Wind South-West to West-South-West; course South-South-East;\r\ndistance 68 miles; latitude 31 degrees 6 minutes South; longitude 147\r\ndegrees 29 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 24th. The first part light Airs and Calm; Middle, moderate\r\nbreezes and Cloudy; latter part very squally with rain. A.M. Variation\r\nper Azimuth 7 degrees 18 minutes East. At Noon took in the Topsails and\r\ngot down Topgallant yards. Saw a Water Spout in the North-West; it was\r\nabout the breadth of a Rainbow, of a dark Colour, the Upper end of the\r\nCloud from whence it came was about 8 degrees above the Horizon. Wind\r\nVariable; course South-South-East; distance 41 miles; latitude 32 degrees\r\n44 minutes South, longitude 147 degrees 10 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 25th. The first and middle part Strong Gales and Squally with\r\nrain, remainder moderate and Cloudy. P.M. Unbent the Maintopsail being\r\nSplit and bent another; in the night lay too under the Foresail, and in\r\nthe morning made sail under the Courses and Topsails with one reef only.\r\nHad a large Sea from the Southward, saw several Albetrosses, Pintado\r\nBirds, and Sheer Waters; some of the Albetrosses were small, such as we\r\nusually saw off Cape Horn; all these kinds of birds are generally seen at\r\na great distance from land. Wind, Southerly; course North-West; distance\r\n26 miles; latitude 32 degrees 26 minutes South; longitude 147 degrees 32\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 26th. Moderate and cloudy weather, a Swell from the South-West.\r\nBy observation of the Sun and Moon made this morning, the Longitude of\r\nthe Ship at Noon is 147 degrees 18 minutes 40 seconds, which differs but\r\n11 minutes from that given by the Log. Wind South-West; course South 6\r\ndegrees East; South distance 13 miles; latitude 32 degrees 39 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 147 degrees 30 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 27th. First part little wind and Cloudy; latter part, fresh Gales\r\nand Clear weather. Variation per Azimuth 6 degrees 40 minutes East. Saw\r\nseveral Albetrosses, Pintado Birds and Sheer Waters. Wind West,\r\nNorth-North-West; course South 5 degrees East; distance 55 miles;\r\nlatitude 33 degrees 34 minutes, longitude 147 degrees 25 minutes.\r\n\r\nMonday, 28th. Fresh Gales and Cloudy, with rain on the Latter part. At 10\r\ndeparted this Life Jno. Rearden,* (* John Reading.) Boatswain's Mate; his\r\nDeath was occasioned by the Boatswain out of mere good Nature giving him\r\npart of a Bottle of Rum last night, which it is supposed he drank all at\r\nonce. He was found to be very much in Liquor last night, but as this was\r\nno more than what was common with him when he could get any, no farther\r\nnotice was taken of him than to put him to Bed, where this morning about\r\n8 o'clock he was found Speechless and past recovery. Wind Northerly;\r\ncourse South; distance 110 miles; latitude 35 degrees 34 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 147 degrees 25 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 29th. Fore and Middle parts fresh Gales and Dark, Hazey weather\r\nwith some rain. At 5 a.m. saw a Comet in the North. Wind North-West to\r\nSouth-West; course South 1/4 East; distance 96 miles; latitude 37 degrees\r\n0 minutes South, longitude 147 degrees 21 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 30th. Fresh breeze and fair weather. At 1 a.m. saw the Comet a\r\nlittle above the Horizon in the East. It pass'd the Meridian about 1/2\r\npast 4; the Tail of the Comet Subtended an Angle of 42 degrees. At 8 a.m.\r\nVariation per Azimuth 7 degrees 9 minutes East. Bent another suit of\r\nSails. Saw a piece of Rock weed, Some Pintado birds and Sheer Waters and\r\na Green bird something smaller than a Dove, but it was not near enough to\r\ndistinguish whether it was a Sea or Land bird; it was only seen by one\r\nPerson, and he probably was Mistaken in the Colour. A Swell from the\r\nSouth-West, Wind Westerly; course South 3/4 East; distance 81 miles;\r\nlatitude 38 degrees 20 minutes South, longitude 147 degrees 6 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThursday, 31st. The first part a fresh breeze and cloudy. At 6 p.m. hauld\r\nthe wind to the South-West and close reefd the Topsails. At 1 a.m. being\r\nvery squally with rain, took in the Topsails and brought too under the\r\nMainsail. At 6 made Sail under the Courses. Saw some seaweed, sounded,\r\nbut had no ground at 65 fathoms of Line. Some Albetrosses, Sheer Waters,\r\nand a great many Pintado Birds about the Ship with some hundreds of Birds\r\nthat were smaller than Pidgeons, their backs were grey, their Bellies\r\nwhite, and the ends of their Tails black, and have a blackish line along\r\nthe upper parts of the wings from the Tip of one to the other. We saw\r\nbirds very like those near Faulklands Islands on the Coast of Patagonia,\r\nonly they had not the black streak along the wings; they fly low like\r\nsheer waters or mother Carys birds, and are perhaps of the same Tribe,\r\nfor Distinction sake I shall call them Doves.* (* Probably petrels of the\r\ngenus Prion.) Wind Westerly; course South 4 degrees 15 minutes East;\r\ndistance 68 miles; latitude 39 degrees 28 minutes South, longitude 147\r\ndegrees 0 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[September 1769.]\r\n\r\nFriday, September 1st. Very strong Gales and heavy Squalls with rain; at\r\n6 p.m. brought too under the Main Sail. At 6 a.m. set the Foresail, a\r\nGreat Sea from the Westward. The same sort of Birds about the Ship as\r\nYesterday, but not in such great Numbers. Wind, Westerly; Course, South\r\n29 degrees East; distance 50 miles; latitude 40 degrees 12 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 146 degrees 29 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 2nd. Very strong Gales, with heavy squalls of Wind, hail, and\r\nrain. At 4 p.m., being in the Latitude of 40 degrees 22 minutes South,\r\nand having not the least Visible signs of land, we wore, and brought too\r\nunder the Foresail, and reef'd the Mainsail, and handed it. I did intend\r\nto have stood to the Southward if the winds had been Moderate, so long as\r\nthey continued Westerly, notwithstanding we had no prospect of meeting\r\nwith land, Rather than stand back to the Northward, on the same Track as\r\nwe came, but as the weather was so very Tempestious I laid aside this\r\ndesign, and thought it more adviseable to stand to the Northward into\r\nbetter weather, least we should receive such Damage in our Sails and\r\nRigging as might hinder the further Prosecutions of the Voyage.* (* This\r\nlong excursion to the south is a fine instance of Cook's thoroughness and\r\ndetermination in exploration. The belief in a southern continent was\r\nstrong amongst most geographers; but it rested on nothing more than the\r\nfalse idea that dry lands in the two hemispheres should balance one\r\nanother. Cook himself did not share the general belief; and few others in\r\nhis position would have struggled for 1500 miles out of his direct course\r\ninto bad weather, simply to disprove an idea, when so much unexplored\r\nocean lay before him to the westward, with a fair wind and fine weather.)\r\nSome Albetrosses, Pintado birds, and Doves about the Ship, and a Bird\r\nlarger than a Duck, his plumage of a Dark Brown, with a Yellow beak. We\r\nsaw of these Birds in our Passage to the Northward, after doubling Cape\r\nHorn. At Noon the weather was more moderate; set the Reefd Mainsail. A\r\ngreat Sea from the West-South-West. Wind West; Course North 54 degrees 30\r\nminutes East; distance 46 miles; latitude 39 degrees 45 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 145 degrees 39 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 3rd. The fore and Middle parts fresh gales, with hard Squalls;\r\nLatter more moderate. At 5 a.m. loos'd the Reef out of the Mainsail, and\r\nset the Topsail double reef'd, and before noon had all the Reefs out.\r\nWind Westerly; course North; distance 50 miles; latitude 38 degrees 54\r\nminutes South, longitude 145 degrees 39 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 4th. First and latter parts, little wind and Cloudy; in the night\r\nCalm. Very few Birds about the Ship. Wind Westerly; course North by East;\r\ndistance 26 miles; latitude 38 degrees 29 minutes South, longitude 145\r\ndegrees 32 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 5th. Fresh breezes and Cloudy weather. At 2 p.m. saw a piece of\r\nrock Weed. Variation, per Azimuth 7 degrees 0 minutes East. Wind West to\r\nNorth-West; course North 32 West; distance 44 miles; latitude 37 degrees\r\n52 minutes South, longitude 146 degrees 2 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 6th. Fresh Gales and Squally, with rain. At Noon saw a Bird\r\nwhich was all white, except the Tip of each Wing; it was nearly as big as\r\nan Albetross. We saw 2 of these Birds in Latitude 19 degrees before we\r\nArrived at George's Island. Wind Westerly; course South 87 degrees 30\r\nminutes West; distance 70 miles; latitude 37 degrees 49 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 147 degrees 30 West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 7th. Fresh Gales and hard squalls, with rain. At 3 p.m. saw\r\nsomething upon the Water, which must either have been a Billet of Wood or\r\na Seal. At Noon a hard gale and Squally, which obliged us to take in the\r\nTopsails. Wind Westerly; course South 80 degrees West; distance 15 miles;\r\nlatitude 37 degrees 52 minutes South, longitude 147 degrees 49 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nFriday, 8th. P.M. very strong gales and Squally. A.M. more moderate; set\r\nthe Topsails. At Noon the Observed Latitude was 13 Miles to the North of\r\nthe Log. This I take to be owing to the great Sea we have had constantly\r\nof Late from the South-West. Wind Westerly; course North 1/4 East;\r\ndistance 76 miles; latitude 36 degrees 36 minutes South, longitude 147\r\ndegrees 40 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 9th. Moderate breezes and dark, cloudy weather, sometimes\r\nHazey, with Drizling Rain. Wind South-East; course North 77 degrees West;\r\ndistance 76 miles; latitude 36 degrees 19 minutes South, longitude 149\r\ndegrees 12 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 10th. Fresh breezes and cloudy. At 9 a.m. we thought the Colour\r\nof the Sea was paler than Usual, which occasioned us to sound, but had no\r\nground with 100 fathoms. Wind South-West, West-South-West; course North\r\n52 degrees West; distance 97 miles; latitude 35 degrees 19 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 150 degrees 46 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 11th. Fresh breezes, and for the most part thick, hazey weather,\r\nwith rain. Wind South-West; course North 43 degrees West; distance 87\r\nmiles; latitude 34 degrees 15 minutes South, longitude 152 degrees 00\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 12th. Fresh breezes and cloudy; a swell from the\r\nSouth-South-West. Some Albetrosses and Pintado Birds about the Ship. Wind\r\nWesterly; course North 30 degrees West; distance 73 miles; latitude 33\r\ndegrees 12 minutes South, longitude 152 degrees 44 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 13th. Gentle breezes, with some flying Showers. At 6 p.m.\r\nVariation per Azimuth, 8 degrees 8 minutes East. Note, while we was\r\nbetween the Latitude of 37 and 40 degrees we had constantly blowing\r\nTempestious weather, but since we have been to the Northward of 37\r\ndegrees, the weather hath been very moderate. Wind South-West and\r\nWest-South-West; course North-North-West; distance 74 miles; latitude 32\r\ndegrees 3 minutes South, longitude 153 degrees 16 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 14th. Gentle breezes, and sometimes Calm. A Swell from the\r\nSouth-South-West. Wind Variable; course South 86 degrees West; distance\r\n33 miles; latitude 32 degrees 5 minutes South, longitude 153 degrees 54\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 15th. First part, moderate and Cloudy, remainder Strong Gales and\r\nSqually. Several Albetrosses, Pintado Birds, and Sheer Waters about the\r\nShip; some of the Albetrosses were all White. Wind North-East to\r\nSouth-East; course South 77 West; distance 139 miles; latitude 32 degrees\r\n36 minutes South, longitude 156 degrees 34 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 16th. First part very strong Gales and Squally; remainder more\r\nmoderate, with a large Swell from the Southward. Wind South-South-East,\r\nSouth, West-South-West; course North 60 degrees West; distance 100 miles;\r\nlatitude 31 degrees 45 minutes South, longitude 158 degrees 16 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSunday, 17th. Fresh Gales and Cloudy. Wind South-West; course North 25\r\nWest; distance 100 miles; latitude 31 degrees 14 minutes South, longitude\r\n159 degrees 6 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 18th. Moderate Gales and Cloudy, with a Swell from the Southward.\r\nWind Westerly; course North by West 1/2 West; distance 78 miles; latitude\r\n29 degrees 00 minutes South, longitude 159 degrees 32 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 19th. Variable; light Airs and Calm. Variation per Amplitude at\r\nsunset, 8 degrees 36 minutes East; per Azimuth in the morning, 8 degrees\r\n29 minutes East; mean, 8 degrees 32 1/2 minutes East. A large hollow\r\nswell from the Southward. Wind Variable; course East; distance 6 miles;\r\nlatitude 29 degrees 00 minutes South, longitude 159 degrees 25 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 20th. Light Airs and Calm. Wind Variable; course South-West by\r\nSouth; distance 20 miles; latitude 29 degrees 20 minutes South, longitude\r\n159 degrees 47 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 21st. Most part Gentle breezes and clear weather. Wind South\r\nEasterly; course South 50 degrees West; distance 62 miles; latitude 30\r\ndegrees 00 minutes South, longitude 160 degrees 42 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 22nd. Fresh breezes and Cloudy. The Southerly swell still\r\nContinues, from which I conjecture that there is no land near in that\r\nDirection. Wind South-East; course South 34 West; distance 81 miles;\r\nlatitude 31 degrees 7 minutes South, longitude 161 degrees 35 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 23rd. Gentle breezes and Cloudy weather. Wind South-East;\r\ncourse South-West by South; distance 62 miles; latitude 31 degrees 59\r\nminutes South, longitude 162 degrees 44 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 24th. Moderate breezes and Cloudy. At Noon saw some sea-Weed. The\r\nSoutherly swell is now quite gone down. Wind South-East to North-East;\r\ncourse South 35 West; distance 97 miles; latitude 33 degrees 18 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 162 degrees 51 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 25th. Ditto weather. At 1 p.m. passed by a Piece of Wood, about 3\r\nfeet long and 7 or 8 Inches thick. Variation at 6 p.m. per Azimuth, 10\r\ndegrees 48 minutes East. A.M., got up all the Boatswain's Stores, to take\r\nan account of them. Wind North-East; course South 43 1/2 West; distance\r\n103 miles; latitude 34 degrees 30 minutes South, longitude 165 degrees 10\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 26th. Fresh breezes and fair weather. Wind North-North-East;\r\ncourse South-West; distance 136 miles; latitude 36 degrees 9 minutes\r\nSouth, longitude 167 degrees 14 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 27th. Very strong Gales and hazey, with rain the First and\r\nMiddle part; Latter, moderate and clear weather. In the evening took in\r\nthe Topsails and Mainsail, and lay too with her head to the Westward\r\nunder the Foresail. During the night, at 4 a.m., made Sail. Saw several\r\nPieces of Sea Weed at different times this 24 Hours. Wind North by East,\r\nWesterly; course South 28 West; distance 95 miles; latitude 37 degrees 33\r\nminutes South, longitude 168 degrees 10 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 28th. First and Middle parts, fresh gales and Cloudy; Latter\r\npart, very strong Gales and Squally. At 4 p.m. saw a Seal aSleep upon the\r\nWater, and some Weed. A.M. saw several bunches of Sea Weed and a few\r\nAlbetrosses and Sheer Waters. Wind Westerly; course South 21 degrees\r\nWest; distance 92 miles; latitude 38 degrees 59 minutes South, longitude\r\n169 degrees 5 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 29th. The first part strong Gales and Squally; remainder a fresh\r\nbreeze and settled weather. At 1 p.m. was obliged to take in the\r\nTopsails, but set them again at 4. At 11 a.m. saw a Bird something like a\r\nSnipe, only it had a short bill; it had the appearance of a land bird.\r\nSeveral Albetrosses, Pintado birds, and Sheer Waters about the Ship, and\r\na Number of Doves; of these we have seen more or less ever since the 31st\r\nof last Month, the day we first saw them. Wind South-West; course North\r\n59 degrees West; distance 60 miles; latitude 38 degrees 30 minutes South,\r\nlongitude 170 degrees 14 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 30th. Moderate breezes and Settled weather. Saw a dark brown\r\nbird as big as a Raven; it is a Sea Fowl, and are seen in great Numbers\r\nabout the Faulkland Islands, as I am told. We likewise saw several pieces\r\nof Sea Weed. Wind South Easterly; course North 87 1/2 West; distance 90\r\nmiles; latitude 38 degrees 26 minutes South, longitude 172 degrees 20\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\n[October 1769.]\r\n\r\nSunday, October 1st. Little Wind in the day time and Calm in the Night.\r\nAt 8 a.m. sounded: no ground with 120 fathoms of line. Saw an immence\r\nnumber of Birds, the most of them were Doves; saw likewise a Seal aSleep\r\nupon the Water, which we at first took for a Crooked billet. These\r\ncreatures, as they lay upon the Water, hold their fins up in a very odd\r\nmanner, and very different to any I have seen before; we generally reckon\r\nthat seals never go out of Soundings or far from Land, but the few we\r\nhave seen in this Sea is certainly an exception to that rule. However,\r\none would think that we were not far from some land, from the Pieces of\r\nRock weed we see daily floating upon the Water. To-day we took up a small\r\nPiece of Stick, but to all appearance it had been a long time at Sea. The\r\nobserv'd Latitude is considerable to the Northward of that given by the\r\nLog, in so much that I think there must be some Current seting from the\r\nSouthward. Wind South to West by North; course North 16 degrees West;\r\ndistance 43 miles; latitude 37 degrees 45 minutes South, longitude 172\r\ndegrees 36 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 2nd. Little wind. At 3 p.m. hoisted out a Boat to try the\r\nCurrent, but found none. Saw several Grampusses. A.M. had a Boat in the\r\nWater, and Mr. Banks shott an Albetross which measured 10 feet 8 Inches\r\nfrom the tip of Wing to the other. He likewise shott 2 birds that were\r\nvery much like Ducks, excepting their head and Bill; their plumage were\r\ndark brown. We first saw some of these birds in the Latitude of 40\r\ndegrees South, after our first coming into those Seas. Wind\r\nWest-South-West, South-West; course North-North-West; distance 35 miles;\r\nlatitude 37 degrees 10 minutes South, longitude 172 degrees 54 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 3rd. Little wind and sometimes Calm. A.M. Variation per Azimuth\r\n13 degrees 22 minutes East. Saw some fish like a Skip Jack, and a small\r\nsort that appeared very Transparent. Took up a very small piece of wood\r\nwith Barnacles upon it, a proof that it hath been some time at Sea. Some\r\nvery large Albetrosses about the Ship and other birds. The observed\r\nLatitude is 10 Miles to the Northward of that given by the Log, and it\r\nwas the same Yesterday, which I think is a Proof that there must be a\r\nCurrent setting to the Northward, notwithstanding we did not find any\r\nwhen we try'd it. Wind Southerly; course North 60 degrees West; distance\r\n28 miles; latitude 36 degrees 56 minutes South, longitude 173 degrees 27\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 4th. Gentle breezes and Cloudy weather. P.M. Variation per\r\nAzimuth 12 degrees 48 minutes East; sounded twice, but found no ground,\r\nwith 120 fathoms of line. Saw some rock weed, but not in such plenty as\r\nof late. Wind South-East; course South 52 1/2 West; distance 86 miles;\r\nlatitude 37 degrees 43 minutes South, longitude 175 degrees 00 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThursday, 5th. Light, gentle breezes and Clear weather. P.M. saw one of\r\nthe same sort of Birds as we saw last Saturday. These birds are of a dark\r\nbrown or Chocolate Colour, with some white feathers under their wings,\r\nand are as big as Ravens. Mr. Gore says that they are in great plenty at\r\nPort Egmont in Faulklands Islands, and for that reason calls them Port\r\nEgmont Hens. Saw a great many Porpoisses, large and Small; the small ones\r\nhad white bellies and Noses. A.M. saw 2 Port Egmont Hens, a Seal, some\r\nsea Weed, and a Piece of wood with Barnacles upon it. Wind South-East to\r\nEast-North-East; course South 49 1/2 West; distance 63 miles; latitude 38\r\ndegrees 23 minutes South, longitude 176 degrees 3 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 6th. Little wind, and fine pleasant weather. Saw some Seals, sea\r\nweed, and Port Egmont Hens. P.M. Variation per Azimuth 12 degrees 50\r\nminutes East. Per Amplitude 12 degrees 40 minutes. A.M. per Azimuth 14\r\ndegrees 2 minutes East; the difference is 1 degree 3 minutes, and the\r\nShip has only gone 9 Leagues in the Time. The Colour of the water appears\r\nto be paler than common, and hath been so for some days past; this makes\r\nus sound frequently, but can find no ground with 180 fathoms of Line.\r\nWind East-North-East; course South-West; distance 62 miles; latitude 39\r\ndegrees 11 minutes South, longitude 177 degrees 2 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[Make New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 7th. Gentle breezes and settled weather. At 2 p.m. saw land* (*\r\nThe North island of New Zealand.) from the Masthead bearing West by\r\nNorth, which we stood directly for, and could but just see it of the Deck\r\nat sunset. Variation per Azimuth and Amplitude 15 degrees 4 1/2 minutes\r\nEast; by observation of the Sun and Moon made this afternoon the\r\nLongitude of the Ship is 180 degrees 55 minutes West, by the mean of\r\nthese and Subsequent observations the Error of the Ship's account in\r\nLongitude from George's Island is 3 degrees 16 minutes; that is, so much\r\nto the Westward of the Longitude resulting from the Log, which is what is\r\ninserted in the Columns. At Midnight brought too and sounded, but had no\r\nground with 170 fathoms. At daylight made sail in for the Land, at Noon\r\nit bore from South-West to North-West by North, distant 8 Leagues.\r\nLatitude observed 38 degrees 57 minutes South; Wind North-East,\r\nSouth-East, Variable; course South 70 degrees West; distance 41 miles;\r\nlatitude 38 degrees 57 minutes observed South; longitude 177 degrees 54\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 8th. Gentle breezes and clear weather. At 5 p.m., seeing the\r\nopening of a Bay that appear'd to run pretty far inland, hauld our wind\r\nand stood in for it; but as soon as night came on we keept plying on and\r\noff until day light, when we found ourselves to leeward of the Bay, the\r\nwind being at North. By Noon we fetch'd in with the South-West point, but\r\nnot being able to weather it we tacked and stood off. We saw in the Bay\r\nseveral Canoes, People upon the Shore, and some houses in the Country.\r\nThe land on the Sea Coast is high, with Steep Cliffs; and back inland are\r\nvery high Mountains. The face of the Country is of a hilly surface, and\r\nappears to be cloathed with wood and Verdure. Wind between the\r\nEast-North-East and North.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. EXPLORATION OF NORTH ISLAND OF NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\n[October 1769. At Poverty Bay, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nMONDAY, 9th October. Gentle breezes and Clear Weather. P.M. stood into\r\nthe Bay and Anchored on the North-East side before the Entrance of a\r\nsmall River,* (* Tauranga nui. The township of Gisborne is now situated\r\non its eastern bank.) in 10 fathoms, a fine sandy bottom. The North-East\r\npoint of the Bay bore East by South 1/2 South, and the South-West point\r\nSouth, distance from the Shore half a League. After this I went ashore\r\nwith a Party of men in the Pinnace and yawl accompanied by Mr. Banks and\r\nDr. Solander. We landed abreast of the Ship and on the East side of the\r\nRiver just mentioned; but seeing some of the Natives on the other side of\r\nthe River of whom I was desirous of speaking with, and finding that we\r\ncould not ford the River, I order'd the yawl in to carry us over, and the\r\npinnace to lay at the Entrance. In the mean time the Indians made off.\r\nHowever we went as far as their Hutts which lay about 2 or 300 Yards from\r\nthe water side, leaving 4 boys to take care of the Yawl, which we had no\r\nsooner left than 4 Men came out of the woods on the other side the River,\r\nand would certainly have cut her off had not the People in the Pinnace\r\ndiscover'd them and called to her to drop down the Stream, which they\r\ndid, being closely persued by the Indians. The coxswain of the Pinnace,\r\nwho had the charge of the Boats, seeing this, fir'd 2 Musquets over their\r\nHeads; the first made them stop and Look round them, but the 2nd they\r\ntook no notice of; upon which a third was fir'd and kill'd one of them\r\nupon the Spot just as he was going to dart his spear at the Boat. At this\r\nthe other 3 stood motionless for a Minute or two, seemingly quite\r\nsurprised; wondering, no doubt, what it was that had thus kill'd their\r\nComrade; but as soon as they recovered themselves they made off, dragging\r\nthe Dead body a little way and then left it. Upon our hearing the report\r\nof the Musquets we immediately repair'd to the Boats, and after viewing\r\nthe Dead body we return'd on board. In the morning, seeing a number of\r\nthe Natives at the same place where we saw them last night, I went on\r\nshore with the Boats, mann'd and arm'd, and landed on the opposite side\r\nof the river. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and myself only landed at first,\r\nand went to the side of the river, the natives being got together on the\r\nopposite side. We called to them in the George's Island Language, but\r\nthey answer'd us by flourishing their weapons over their heads and\r\ndancing, as we suppos'd, the War Dance; upon this we retir'd until the\r\nMarines were landed, which I order'd to be drawn up about 200 yards\r\nbehind us. We went again to the river side, having Tupia, Mr. Green, and\r\nDr. Monkhouse along with us. Tupia spoke to them in his own Language, and\r\nit was an agreeable surprize to us to find that they perfectly understood\r\nhim. After some little conversation had passed one of them swam over to\r\nus, and after him 20 or 30 more; these last brought their Arms, which the\r\nfirst man did not. We made them every one presents, but this did not\r\nsatisfy them; they wanted everything we had about us, particularly our\r\nArms, and made several attempts to snatch them out of our hands. Tupia\r\ntold us several times, as soon as they came over, to take care of\r\nourselves for they were not our friends; and this we very soon found, for\r\none of them snatched Mr. Green's hanger from him and would not give it\r\nup; this encouraged the rest to be more insolent, and seeing others\r\ncoming over to join them, I order'd the man who had taken the Hanger to\r\nbe fir'd at, which was accordingly done, and wounded in such a manner\r\nthat he died soon after. Upon the first fire, which was only 2 Musquets,\r\nthe others retir'd to a Rock which lay nearly in the middle of the River;\r\nbut on seeing the man fall they return'd, probably to carry him off or\r\nhis Arms, the last of which they accomplished, and this we could not\r\nprevent unless we had run our Bayonets into them, for upon their\r\nreturning from off the Rock, we had discharged off our Peices, which were\r\nloaded with small shott, and wounded 3 more; but these got over the River\r\nand were carried off by the others, who now thought proper to retire.\r\nFinding nothing was to be done with the People on this side, and the\r\nwater in the river being salt, I embarked with an intent to row round the\r\nhead of the Bay in search of fresh water, and if possible to surprise\r\nsome of the Natives and to take them on board, and by good Treatment and\r\nPresents endeavour to gain their friendship with this view.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 10th. P.M., I rowed round the head of the bay, but could find no\r\nplace to land on account of the Great Surf which beat everywhere upon the\r\nShore. Seeing 2 Boats or Canoes coming in from Sea I rowed to one of\r\nthem, in order to Seize upon the People; and came so near before they\r\ntook notice of us that Tupia called to them to come alongside and we\r\nwould not hurt them; but instead of doing this they endeavour'd to get\r\naway, upon which I order'd a Musquet to be fir'd over their Heads,\r\nthinking this would either make them surrender, or jump overboard; but\r\nhere I was mistaken, for they immediately took to their Arms or whatever\r\nthey had in the Boat, and began to attack us. This obliged us to fire\r\nupon them, and unfortunately either 2 or 3 were kill'd and one wounded,\r\nand 3 jumped overboard. These last we took up and brought on board, where\r\nthey was Cloathed and Treated with all imaginable kindness; and to the\r\nSurprise of everybody became at once as cheerful and as merry as if they\r\nhad been with their own Friends. They were all 3 Young, the eldest not\r\nabove 20 years of Age, and the youngest about 10 or 12. I am aware that\r\nmost Humane men who have not experienced things of this nature will\r\nCensure my Conduct in firing upon the People in their Boat, nor do I\r\nmyself think that the reason I had for seizing upon her will at all\r\njustify me; and had I thought that they would have made the Least\r\nResistance I would not have come near them; but as they did, I was not to\r\nstand still and suffer either myself or those that were with me to be\r\nknocked on the head.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, as I intended to put our 3 Prisoners ashore, and stay\r\nhere the day to see what effect it might have upon the other Natives, I\r\nsent an Officer ashore with the Marines and a party of men to cut wood,\r\nand soon after followed myself, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander,\r\nand Tupia, taking the 3 Natives with us, whom we landed on the West side\r\nof the River before mentioned. They were very unwilling to leave us,\r\npretending that they should fall into the hands of their Enemies, who\r\nwould kill and Eat them. However, they at last of their own accord left\r\nus and hid themselves in some bushes. Soon after this we discover'd\r\nseveral bodys of the Natives marching towards us, upon which we retir'd\r\naCross the River, and joind the wooders; and with us came the 3 Natives\r\nwe had just parted with, for we could not prevail upon them to go to\r\ntheir own people. We had no sooner got over the River than the others\r\nassembled on the other side to the Number of 150 or 200, all Arm'd. Tupia\r\nnow began to Parly with them, and the 3 we had with us shew'd everything\r\nwe had given them, part of which they laid and left upon the Body of the\r\nMan that was Kill'd the day before. These things seem'd so far to\r\nConvince them of our friendly intentions that one man came over to us,\r\nwhile all the others sat down upon the Sand. We everyone made this man a\r\npresent, and the 3 Natives that were with us likewise presented him with\r\nsuch things as they had got from us, with which, after a short Stay, he\r\nretir'd aCross the River. I now thought proper to take everybody on\r\nboard, to prevent any more Quarrels, and with us came the 3 Natives, whom\r\nwe could not prevail upon to stay behind; and this appear'd the more\r\nstrange as the man that came over to us was Uncle to one of them. After\r\nwe had return'd on board we saw them Carry off the Dead Man; but the one\r\nthat was Kill'd the first evening we Landed remain'd in the very spot\r\nthey had left him.\r\n\r\n[Leave Poverty Bay.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 11th. In the P.M., as I intended to sail in the Morning, we\r\nput the 3 Youths ashore, seemingly very much against their inclination;\r\nbut whether this was owing to a desire they had to remain with us, or the\r\nfear of falling into the hands of their Enemies, as they pretended, I\r\nknow not. The latter, however, seemed to be ill-founded, for we saw them\r\ncarried aCross the River in a Catamaran, and walk Leasurely off with the\r\nother Natives. At 6 a.m. we weighed and stood out of the Bay, which I\r\nhave named Poverty Bay, because it afforded us no one thing we wanted\r\n(Latitude 38 degrees 42 minutes South, Longitude 181 degrees 36 minutes\r\nWest).* (* Latitude correct. Longitude is 181 degrees 57 minutes West.)\r\nIt is in the form of a Horse Shoe, and is known by an Island lying close\r\nunder the North-East point. The 2 points which forms the Entrance are\r\nhigh, with Steap white Cliffs, and lay a League and a half or 2 Leagues\r\nfrom Each other, North-East by East and South-West by West. The Depth of\r\nWater in this Bay is from 12 to 6 and 5 fathoms, a sandy bottom and good\r\nAnchorage, but you lay open to the winds between the South and East.\r\nBoats can go in and out of the river above mentioned at any time of Tide\r\nin fine weather; but as there is a Bar at the Entrance, on which the Sea\r\nSometimes runs so high that no Boat can either get in or out, which\r\nhapned while we laid here; however, I believe that Boats can generally\r\nland on the North-East side of the river. The shore of this Bay, from a\r\nlittle within each Entrance, is a low, flat sand; but this is only a\r\nNarrow Slip, for the face of the Country appears with a variety of hills\r\nand Vallies, all cloathed with woods and Verdure, and to all appearance\r\nwell inhabited, especially in the Vallies leading up from the Bay, where\r\nwe daily saw Smoke at a great distance inland, and far back in the\r\nCountry are very high Mountains. At Noon the South-West point of Poverty\r\nBay, which I have named Young Nicks head (after the Boy who first saw\r\nthis land),* (* In Mr. Molineux's Log, his name is given as Nicholas\r\nYoung, but no such name appears in the official lists.) bore North by\r\nWest, distance 3 or 4 leagues, being at this time about 3 Miles from the\r\nShore, and had 25 fathoms Water, the Main Land extending from North-East\r\nby North to South. My intention is to follow the direction of the Coast\r\nto the Southward, as far as the Latitude of 40 or 41 degrees, and then to\r\nreturn to the Northward, in case we meet with nothing to incourage us to\r\nproceed farther.\r\n\r\n[Off Portland Island, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 12th. Gentle breezes at North-West and North, with frequent\r\nCalms. In the Afternoon, while we lay becalm'd, several Canoes came off\r\nto the Ship, but keept at a distance until one, who appeared to come from\r\na different part, came off and put alongside at once, and after her all\r\nthe rest. The people in this boat had heard of the Treatment those had\r\nmet with we had had on board before, and therefore came on board without\r\nhesitation; they were all kindly treated, and very soon entered into a\r\nTraffick with our People for George's Island Cloth, etc.; giving in\r\nExchange their Paddles, having little else to dispose of, and hardly left\r\nthemselves a sufficient number to paddle ashore; nay, the people in one\r\nCanoe, after disposing of their Paddles, offer'd to sell the Canoe. After\r\na stay of about 2 hours they went away, but by some means or other 3 were\r\nleft on board, and not one boat would put back to take them in, and, what\r\nwas more surprizing, those aboard did not seem at all uneasy with their\r\nsituation. In the evening a light breeze springing up at North-West, we\r\nsteer'd along Shore, under an easy sail, until midnight, then brought\r\ntoo. Soon after it fell Calm, and continued so until 8 o'Clock a.m., when\r\na breeze sprung up at North, with which we stood along shore\r\nSouth-South-West. At and after sunrise found the variation to be 14\r\ndegrees 46 minutes East. About this time 2 Canoes came off to the Ship,\r\none of which was prevailed upon to come along side to take in the 3\r\npeople we had had on board all night, who now seem'd glad of the\r\nopportunity to get ashore. As the People in the Canoe were a little shy\r\nat first, it was observed that one Argument those on board made use on to\r\nintice the others alongside, was in telling them that we did not Eat men;\r\nfrom which it should seem that these people have such a Custom among\r\nthem. At the time we made sail we were abreast of the Point of Land set\r\nyesterday at Noon, from which the Land trends South-South-West. This\r\npoint I have named Cape Table, on account of its shape and figure. It\r\nlies 7 Leagues to the Southward of Poverty Bay, in the Latitude of 39\r\ndegrees 7 minutes South, longitude 181 degrees 36 minutes West, it is of\r\na moderate height, makes in a sharpe Angle, and appears to be quite flat\r\nat Top. In steering along shore to the Southward of the Cape, at the\r\ndistance of 2 or 3 miles off, our soundings were from 20 to 30 fathoms,\r\nhaving a Chain of Rocks that appears at different heights above water,\r\nlaying between us and the Shore. At Noon, Cape Table bore North 20\r\ndegrees East, distant 4 Leagues, and a small Island (being the\r\nSouthermost land in sight) bore South 70 degrees West, distant 3 miles.\r\nThis Island I have named Isle of Portland, on account of its very great\r\nresemblance to Portland in the English Channel. It lies about a mile from\r\na Point on the Main, but there appears to be a ledge of Rocks extending\r\nnearly, if not quite, aCross from the one to the other. North 57 degrees\r\nEast, 2 Miles from the South point of Portland, lies a sunken rock\r\nwhereon the sea breaks; we passed between this Rock and the land having\r\n17, 18, and 20 fathom Water. We saw a great Number of the Natives\r\nassembled together on the Isle of Portland; we likewise saw some on the\r\nMain land, and several places that were Cultivated and laid out in square\r\nPlantations.\r\n\r\nFriday, 13th. At 1 p.m. we discover'd land behind or to the Westward of\r\nPortland, extending to the Southward as far as we could see. In hauling\r\nround the South end of Portland we fell into Shoal Water and broken\r\nground, which we, however, soon got clear of. At this time 4 Canoes came\r\noff to us full of People, and keept for sometime under our stern\r\nthreatning of us all the while. As I did not know but what I might be\r\nobliged to send our Boats ahead to sound, I thought these Gentry would be\r\nas well out of the way. I order'd a Musquet shott to be fir'd close to\r\none of them, but this they took no notice of. A 4 Pounder was then fir'd\r\na little wide of them; at this they began to shake their Spears and\r\nPaddles at us, but notwithstanding this they thought fit to retire.\r\nHaving got round Portland, we hauled in for the Land North-West, having a\r\nGentle breeze at North-East, which died away at 5 o'Clock and obliged us\r\nto Anchor in 21 fathoms, a fine sandy bottom: the South Point of Portland\r\nbore South-East 1/2 South distant about 2 Leagues, and a low Point on the\r\nMain bore North 1/2 East. In this last direction there runs in a deep bay\r\nbehind the Land on which is Table Cape, which makes this Land a\r\nPeninsula, joined to the Main by a low, narrow neck of land; the Cape is\r\nthe North Point of the Peninsula, and Portland the South. While we lay at\r\nAnchor 2 Boats came off to us, and so near as to take up some things we\r\nthrow'd them out of the Ship, but would not come alongside. At 5 a.m. a\r\nbreeze springing northerly we weigh'd and steer'd in for the Land. The\r\nshore here forms a very large Bay, of which Portland is the North-East\r\nPoint, and the Bay above mentioned is an Arm of it. I would gladly have\r\nexamin'd this Arm, because there appear'd to be safe Anchorage in it, but\r\nas I was not certain of this, and the wind being right an End, I did not\r\ncare to spend time in Turning up to it. At Noon Portland bore South 50\r\ndegrees East, and the Southermost land in sight bore South-South-West,\r\ndistant 10 or 12 Leagues, being about 3 miles from the Shore, and in this\r\nsituation had 12 fathoms water--24 fathoms have been the most Water we\r\nhave had since we have been within Portland, every where clear ground.\r\nThe land near the Shore is of a moderate height, with white Cliffs and\r\nSandy beaches. Inland are several Pretty high Mountains, and the whole\r\nface of the Country appears with a very hilly surface, and for the most\r\npart Covered with wood, and hath all the appearances of a very pleasant\r\nand fertile Country.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 14th. P.M. had Gentle breezes between the North-East and\r\nNorth-West. Kept running down along shore at the distance of 2 or 3 miles\r\noff. Our sounding was from 20 to 13 fathoms, an even sandy bottom. We saw\r\nsome Canoes or Boats in shore, and several houses upon the Land, but no\r\nharbour or Convenient watering place--the Main thing we were looking for.\r\nIn the night had little wind, and Sometimes Calm with Dirty, rainy\r\nweather. A.M. had Variable light Airs next to a Calm and fair weather. In\r\nthe morning, being not above 2 Leagues from the South-West corner of the\r\ngreat Bay we have been in for the 2 days past, the Pinnace and Long boat\r\nwere hoisted out in order to search for Fresh Water; but just as they\r\nwere ready to put off we observed several Boats full of People coming off\r\nfrom the Shore, and for that reason I did not think it prudent to send\r\nour own from the Ship. The first that came were 5 in Number, in them were\r\nbetween 80 and 90 men. Every Method was tried to gain their Friendship,\r\nand several things were thrown overboard to them; but all we could do was\r\nto no purpose, neither would they accept of any one thing from us, but\r\nseem'd fully bent on attacking us. In order to prevent this, and our\r\nbeing obliged to fire upon them, I order'd a 4 Pounder Loaded with grape\r\nto be fir'd a little wide of them, letting them know at the same time by\r\nMeans of Tupia what we were going to do; this had the desir'd effect, and\r\nnot one of these would afterwards trust themselves abreast of the Ship.\r\nSoon after 4 more came off; one of these put what Arms they had into\r\nanother Boat, and then came alongside so near as to take what things we\r\ngave them, and I believe might have been Prevailed upon to come on board\r\nhad not some of the first 5 came up under our Stern and began again to\r\nthreaten us, at which the people in this one Boat seem'd displeased;\r\nimmediately after this they all went ashore. At Noon Latitude in per\r\nObservation 39 degrees 37 minutes South. Portland bore by our run from it\r\nEast by North, distant 14 Leagues; the Southermost land in sight, and\r\nwhich is the South point of the Bay, South-East by South, distant 4 or 5\r\nLeagues; and a Bluff head lying in the South-West corner of the Bay South\r\nby West 2 or 3 Miles. On each side of this bluff head is a low narrow\r\nsand or stone beach; between these beaches and the Main land is a pretty\r\nlarge lake of Salt Water, as I suppose. On the South-East side of this\r\nhead is a very large flatt, which seems to extend a good way inland to\r\nthe Westward; on this flatt are Several groves of Streight, tall Trees,\r\nbut there seems to be a great Probability that the lake above mentiond\r\nextends itself a good way into this flatt Country. Inland are a Chain of\r\nPretty high Mountains extending North and South; on the Summits and Sides\r\nof these Mountains were many Patches of Snow, but between them and the\r\nSea the Land is Cloathed with wood.* (* The Endeavour was now off what is\r\ncalled Ahuriri Bay. The bluff head is known as Ahuriri Bluff, and the\r\ntown of Napier, of 8000 inhabitants, lies at the back of it. The large\r\nsheet of salt water is called Manganui-o-rotu. There was no sheltered\r\nharbour for a vessel in the Endeavour's situation, but at present,\r\nharbour works have improved the entrance to the lagoon into which vessels\r\ndrawing 12 feet can enter. Produce of the value of over a million pounds\r\nper annum is now exported from Napier.)\r\n\r\n[In Hawkes Bay, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 15th. P.M. stood over for the Southermost Land or South point of\r\nthe Bay, having a light breeze at North-East, our soundings from 12 to 8\r\nfathoms. Not reaching this point before dark, we stood Off and on all\r\nnight, having Variable light Airs next to a Calm; depth of water from 8\r\nto 7 fathoms; Variation 14 degrees 10 minutes East. At 8 a.m., being\r\nabreast of the South-West point of the Bay, some fishing Boats came off\r\nto us and sold us some stinking fish; however it was such as they had,\r\nand we were glad to enter into Traffick with them upon any Terms. These\r\nPeople behaved at first very well, until a large Arm'd boat, wherein were\r\n22 Men, came alongside. We soon saw that this Boat had nothing for\r\nTraffick, yet as they came boldly alongside we gave them 2 or 3 pieces of\r\nCloth, Articles they seem'd the most fond off. One Man in this Boat had\r\non him a black skin, something like a Bear Skin, which I was desirous of\r\nhaving that I might be a better judge what sort of an Animal the first\r\nOwner was. I offer'd him for it a piece of Red Cloth, which he seem'd to\r\njump at by immediately putting off the Skin and holding it up to us, but\r\nwould not part with it until he had the Cloth in his possession and after\r\nthat not at all, but put off the Boat and went away, and with them all\r\nthe rest. But in a very short time they return'd again, and one of the\r\nfishing Boats came alongside and offer'd us some more fish. The Indian\r\nBoy Tiata, Tupia's Servant, being over the side, they seiz'd hold of him,\r\npull'd him into the Boat and endeavoured to carry him off; this obliged\r\nus to fire upon them, which gave the Boy an opportunity to jump\r\noverboard. We brought the Ship too, lower'd a Boat into the Water, and\r\ntook him up unhurt. Two or 3 paid for this daring attempt with the loss\r\nof their lives, and many more would have suffer'd had it not been for\r\nfear of killing the Boy. This affair occasioned my giving this point of\r\nland the name of Cape Kidnapper. It is remarkable on account of 2 White\r\nrocks in form of Haystacks standing very near it. On each side of the\r\nCape are Tolerable high white steep Cliffs, Latitude 39 degrees 43\r\nminutes South; Longitude 182 degrees 24 minutes West; it lies South-West\r\nby West, distant 13 Leagues from the Island of Portland. Between them is\r\na large Bay wherein we have been for these 3 days past; this Bay I have\r\nnamed Hawkes Bay in Honour of Sir Edward, first Lord of the Admiralty; we\r\nfound in it from 24 to 8 and 7 fathoms, everywhere good Anchoring. From\r\nCape Kidnapper the Island Trends South-South-West, and in this direction\r\nwe run along shore, keeping about a League off, having a steady breeze\r\nand Clear weather. At Noon the above Cape bore from us North 9 degrees\r\nEast, distant 2 Leagues, and the Southermost land in sight South 25\r\ndegrees West Latitude in Per Observation 39 degrees 50 minutes South.\r\n\r\nMonday, 16th. First and latter part, fresh breezes, Northerly; in the\r\nnight, Variable and sometimes calm. At 2 p.m. passed by a Small but a\r\nPretty high white Island lying close to the Shore. On this Island we saw\r\na good many Houses, Boats, and Some People. We concluded that they must\r\nbe fishers, because the Island was quite barren; we likewise saw several\r\npeople upon the Shore in a small Bay on the Main within the Island. At 7\r\nthe Southermost land in sight bore South-West by South, and Cape\r\nKidnapper North 3/4 East, distant 8 leagues, being then about 2 Leagues\r\nfrom the Shore, and had 55 fathoms. At 11 brought too until daylight,\r\nthen made Sail along shore to the Southward. At 7 passed a pretty high\r\npoint of Land, which lies South-South-West, 12 Leagues from Cape\r\nKidnapper. From this point the Land Trends 3/4 of a point more to the\r\nWestward. At 10 saw more land appear to the Southward, at South-West by\r\nSouth. At Noon the Southermost land in sight bore South 39 degrees West,\r\ndistant 8 or 10 Leagues, and a high Bluff head with Yellowish Cliffs bore\r\nWest, distant 2 miles, Latitude observed 40 degrees 34 minutes South;\r\ndepth of water 32 fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Returning North from Cape Turnagain.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 17th. P.M. winds at West, a fresh breeze; in the night, Variable\r\nlight Airs and Calm; a.m. a Gentle breeze between the North-West and\r\nNorth-East. Seeing no likelyhood of meeting with a Harbour, and the face\r\nof the Country Visibly altering for the worse, I thought that the\r\nstanding farther to the South would not be attended with any Valuable\r\ndiscovery, but would be loosing of Time, which might be better employ'd\r\nand with a greater Probability of success in examining the Coast to the\r\nNorthward. With this View, at 1 p.m. Tack'd and stood to the Northward,\r\nhaving the Wind at West, a fresh breeze.* (* If Cook had known the exact\r\nshape of New Zealand, he could scarcely have taken a better resolve, in\r\nview of saving time, than to turn northward again when he did.) At this\r\ntime we could see the land extending South-West by South, at least 10 or\r\n12 Leagues. The Bluff head or high point of land we were abreast off at\r\nNoon I have called Cape Turnagain because here we returned. It lies in\r\nthe Latitude of 40 degrees 34 minutes South, Longitude 182 degrees 55\r\nWest, and 18 Leagues South-South-West and South-South-West 1/2 West from\r\nCape Kidnapper. The land between them is of a very unequal height; in\r\nsome places it is high, with White Cliffs next the Sea--in others low,\r\nwith sandy beaches. The face of the Country is not nearly so well\r\nCloathed with wood as it is about Hawkes Bay, but for the most part looks\r\nlike our high Downs in England, and to all appearance well inhabited, for\r\nwe saw several Villages as we run along shore, not only in the Vallies,\r\nbut on the Tops and sides of the Hills, and Smokes in other places. The\r\nridge of Mountains before mentioned extends to the Southward farther than\r\nwe could see, and are every where Checquer'd with Snow. This night saw 2\r\nLarge fires up in the inland Country, a sure sign that it must be\r\ninhabited. At Noon Cape Kidnapper bore North 56 degrees West, distant 7\r\nLeagues; latitude observed 39 degrees 52 minutes South.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 18th. Variable light winds and fine weather. At 4 a.m. Cape\r\nKidnapper bore North 32 degrees West, distant 2 Leagues. In this\r\nsituation had 62 fathoms; and when the said Cape bore West by North,\r\ndistant 3 or 4 Leagues, had 45 fathoms; Midway between the Isle of\r\nPortland and Cape Kidnapper had 65 fathoms. At Noon the Isle of Portland\r\nbore North-East 1/2 East, distant 4 Leagues; latitude observ'd 39 degrees\r\n34 minutes South.\r\n\r\nThursday, 19th. The first part had Gentle breezes at East and\r\nEast-North-East; in the night, fresh Gales between the South and\r\nSouth-West; dark, Cloudy weather, with Lightning and rain. At 1/2 past 5\r\nP.M. Tack'd and stood to the South-East: the Isle of Portland bore\r\nSouth-East, distant 3 Leagues. Soon after we Tacked a boat or Canoe came\r\noff from the Shore, wherein were 5 People. They came on board without\r\nshewing the least signs of fear, and insisted upon staying with us the\r\nwhole night; indeed, there was no getting them away without turning them\r\nout of the Ship by force, and that I did not care to do; but to prevent\r\nthem playing us any Trick I hoisted their Canoe up alongside. Two\r\nappear'd to be Chiefs, and the other 3 their Servants. One of the Chiefs\r\nseem'd to be of a free, open, and Gentle disposition; they both took\r\ngreat notice of everything they saw, and was very thankful for what was\r\ngiven them. The 2 Chiefs would neither Eat nor Drink with us, but the\r\nother 3 Eat whatever was offer'd them. Notwithstanding that these people\r\nhad heard of the Treatment the others had meet with who had been on board\r\nbefore, yet it appear'd a little strange that they should place so much\r\nConfidence in us as to put themselves wholy in our power wether we would\r\nor no, especially as the others we had meet with in this bay had upon\r\nevery occasion behaved in quite a different manner. At 11 brought too\r\nuntil daylight (the night being dark and rainy), then made sail. At 7\r\na.m. brought too under Cape Table, and sent away the Indian Canoe. At\r\nthis Time some others were putting off from the Shore, but we did not\r\nwait their coming, but made sail to the Northward. At Noon the\r\nNorthermost land in sight North 20 degrees East, and Young Nicks head, or\r\nthe South point of Poverty Bay, West-Northerly, near 4 Leagues. Latitude\r\nobserved 38 degrees 44 minutes 30 seconds South.\r\n\r\nFriday, 20th. P.M. a fresh breeze at South-South-West; in the night,\r\nvariable light breezes, with rain; A.M. a fresh breeze at South-West. At\r\n3 p.m. passed by a remarkable head, which I called Gable end Foreland on\r\naccount of the very great resemblance the white cliff at the very point\r\nhath to the Gable end of a House. It is made still more remarkable by a\r\nSpir'd Rock standing a little distance from it. This head land lies from\r\nCape Table North 24 degrees East, distant 12 Leagues. Between them the\r\nShore forms a Bay, wherein lies Poverty Bay, 4 Leagues from the former\r\nand 8 Leagues from the Latter. From Gable end Foreland the land trends\r\nNorth by East as far as we could see. The land from Poverty Bay to this\r\nplace is of a moderate but very unequal height, distinguished by Hills\r\nand Vallies that are Cover'd with woods. We saw, as we run along shore,\r\nseveral Villages, cultivated lands, and some of the Natives. In the\r\nevening some Canoes came off to the Ship, and one Man came on board to\r\nwhom we gave a few Trifles and then sent him away. Stood off and on until\r\ndaylight, and then made sail in shore in order to look into 2 Bays that\r\nappear'd to our view about 2 Leagues to the Northward of the Foreland.\r\nThe Southermost we could not fetch, but in the other we Anchor'd about 11\r\no'Clock in 7 fathoms, a black sandy bottom. The North point bore\r\nNorth-East 1/2 North, distant 2 Miles, and the South Point South-East by\r\nEast, distant one Mile, and about 3/4 of a Mile from the Shore. This Bay\r\nis not so much Shelter'd from the Sea as I at first thought it was; but\r\nas the Natives, many of whom came about us in their Canoes, appear'd to\r\nbe of a friendly disposition, I was willing to try if we could not get a\r\nlittle water on board, and to see a little into the Nature of the Country\r\nbefore we proceeded further to the Northward.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 21st. We had no sooner come to an Anchor, as mentioned above,\r\nthan perceiving 2 old Men in the Canoes, who from their Garbe appear'd to\r\nbe Chiefs, these I invited on board, and they came without Hesitation. To\r\neach I gave about 4 Yards of linnen and a Spike Nail; the linnen they\r\nwere very fond of, but the Nails they seem'd to set no Value upon. Tupia\r\nexplain'd to them the reasons of our Coming here, and that we should\r\nneither hurt nor Molest them if they did but behave in the same peaceable\r\nmanner to us; indeed, we were under very little apprehension but what\r\nthey would, as they had heard of what hapned in Poverty Bay. Between 1\r\nand 2 p.m. I put off with the Boats mann'd and Arm'd in order to land to\r\nlook for fresh Water, these 2 Men along with us; but the surf running\r\nvery high, and it begun to blow and rain at the same time, I returned\r\nback to the Ship, having first put the 2 Chiefs into one of their Canoes.\r\nIn the evening it fell moderate, and we landed and found 2 Small Streams\r\nof Fresh Water, and the Natives to all appearance very friendly and\r\npeaceable; on which account I resolved to Stay one day at least, to fill\r\na little water and to give Mr. Banks an opportunity to Collect a little\r\nof the Produce of the Country. In the morning Lieutenant Gore went on\r\nshore to superintend the Watering with a Strong party of Men, but the\r\ngetting the Casks off was so very difficult, on account of the Surf, that\r\nit was noon before one Turn came on board.\r\n\r\n[At Tegadoo Bay, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 22nd. P.M. light breezes and Cloudy. About or a little after Noon\r\nseveral of the Natives came off to the Ship in their Canoes and began to\r\nTraffick with us, our people giving them George's Island Cloth for\r\ntheirs, for they had little else to dispose of. This kind of exchange\r\nthey seem'd at first very fond of, and prefer'd the Cloth we had got at\r\nthe Islands to English Cloth; but it fell in its value above 500 p. ct.\r\nbefore night. I had some of them on board, and Shew'd them the Ship, with\r\nwhich they were well pleased. The same friendly disposition was observed\r\nby those on shore, and upon the whole they behaved as well or better than\r\none could expect; but as the getting the Water from the Shore proved so\r\nvery Tedious on account of the Surf, I resolved upon leaving this place\r\nin the morning, and accordingly, at 5 a.m., we weighed and put to Sea.\r\nThis Bay is called by the Natives Tegadoo;* (* Anaura Bay.) it lies in\r\nthe Latitude of 38 degrees 16 minutes South, but as it hath nothing to\r\nrecommend it I shall give no discription of it. There is plenty of Wild\r\nSellery, and we purchased of the Natives 10 or 15 pounds of sweet\r\nPotatoes. They have pretty large plantations of these, but at present\r\nthey are scarce, it being too Early in the Season. At Noon the Bay of\r\nTegadoo bore West 1/2 South, distant 8 Leagues, and a very high double\r\npeak'd Mountain some distance in land bore North-West by West. Latitude\r\nobserved 38 degrees 13 minutes South; Wind at North, a fresh Gale.\r\n\r\nMonday, 23rd. P.M. fresh Gales at North, and Cloudy weather. At 1 Tack'd\r\nand stood in shore; at 6 Sounded, and had 56 fathoms fine sandy bottom;\r\nthe Bay of Tegadoo bore South-West 1/2 West, distance 4 Leagues. At 8\r\nTack'd in 36 fathoms, being then about 2 Leagues from land; stood off and\r\non all night, having Gentle breezes. At 8 a.m., being right before the\r\nBay of Tegadoo and about a League from it, some of the Natives came off\r\nto us and inform'd us that in a Bay a little to the Southward (being the\r\nsame that we could not fetch the day we put into Tegadoo) was fresh Water\r\nand easey getting at it; and as the wind was now against us, and we\r\ngain'd nothing by beating to windward, I thought the time would be better\r\nspent in this Bay* (* Tolaga.) in getting on board a little water, and\r\nforming some Connections with the Natives, than by keeping the Sea. With\r\nthis view we bore up for it, and sent 2 Boats in, Mann'd and Arm'd, to\r\nExamine the Watering Place, who returned about noon and conform'd the\r\naccount the Natives had given. We then Anchor'd in 11 fathoms, fine sandy\r\nbottom; the North point of the Bay North by East and the South point\r\nSouth-East, and the watering place, which was in a Small Cove a little\r\nwithin the South point of the Bay, distance one Mile.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 24th. Winds Westerly and fine weather. This afternoon, as soon\r\nas the Ship was moor'd, I went ashore to Examine the watering place,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. I found the Water good and the\r\nPlace pretty Convenient, and plenty of Wood close to high Water Mark, and\r\nthe Natives to all appearance not only very friendly but ready to\r\nTraffick with us for what little they had. Early in the morning I sent\r\nLieutenant Gore ashore to Superintend the Cutting wood and filling of\r\nWater, with a Sufficient number of men for both purposes, and all the\r\nMarines as a Guard. After breakfast I went myself, and remain'd there the\r\nwhole day; but before this Mr. Green and I took several observations of\r\nthe Sun and Moon. The mean result of them gave 180 degrees 47 minutes\r\nWest Longitude from the Meridian of Greenwich; but as all the\r\nobservations made before exceeded these, I have laid down this Coast\r\nagreeable to the means of the whole. At noon I took the Sun's Meridian\r\nAltitude with the Astronomical Quadrant, and found the Latitude 38\r\ndegrees 22 minutes 24 seconds South.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 25th. Winds and weather as Yesterday. P.M. set up the\r\nArmourer's Forge to repair the Tiller braces, they being broke. By night\r\nwe had got on board 12 Tons of Water and two or 3 Boats' loads of Wood,\r\nand this I looked upon to be a good day's work. The Natives gave us not\r\nthe least disturbance, but brought us now and then different sorts of\r\nFish out to the Ship and Watering place, which we purchased of them with\r\nCloth, beads, etc.\r\n\r\nThursday, 26th. P.M. had the winds from between the South and South-West,\r\nfair weather; the remainder, rainy, dirty weather. Notwithstanding we\r\ncontinued getting on board Wood and Water.\r\n\r\nFriday, 27th. Winds at South-West; first part rainy weather, the\r\nremainder fair. A.M. sent the Pinnace to drudge, but she met with no\r\nsuccess; after this, I went and sounded the Bay. I made a Shift to land\r\nin 2 Places, the first time in the bottom of the bay, where I went a\r\nlittle way into the Country, but met with nothing extraordinary. The\r\nother place I landed at was at the North point of the Bay, where I got as\r\nmuch Sellery and Scurvy grass as loaded the Boat. This day we compleated\r\nour Water to 70 Tons, but not wood Enough.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 28th. Gentle breezes Southerly and fine weather. Employ'd\r\nwooding, cutting, and making of Brooms, there being a Shrub here very fit\r\nfor that purpose; and as I intended to sail in the morning some hands\r\nwere employ'd picking of Sellery to take to Sea with us. This is found\r\nhere in great plenty, and I have caused it to be boiled with Portable\r\nSoup and Oatmeal every morning for the people's breakfast; and this I\r\ndesign to continue as long as it will last, or any is to be got, and I\r\nlook upon it to be very wholesome and a great Antiscorbutick.\r\n\r\n[At Tolaga Bay, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 29th. P.M. Gentle breezes with Thunder and Lightning up the\r\nCountry; in the night had light Airs off the land and very foggy; in the\r\nforenoon had a gentle breeze at North-North-East and Clear weather. At 4\r\na.m. unmoor'd, and at 6 weigh'd and put to Sea. At Noon the bay sail'd\r\nfrom bore North 63 degrees West, distant 4 Leagues. This bay is called by\r\nthe Natives Tolaga;* (* It still goes by this name.) it is moderately\r\nlarge, and hath in it from 13 to 8 and 7 fathoms, clean sandy bottom and\r\ngood Anchorage, and is shelterd from all winds except those that blow\r\nfrom the North-East Quarter. It lies in the Latitude of 38 degrees 22\r\nminutes South, and 4 1/2 Leagues to the Northward of Gable end Foreland.\r\nOff the South point lies a small but high Island, so near to the Main as\r\nnot to be distinguished from it. Close to the North end of this Island,\r\nat the Entrance into the Bay, are 2 high Rocks; one is high and round\r\nlike a Corn Stack, but the other is long with holes thro' it like the\r\nArches of a Bridge. Within these rocks is the Cove, where we cut wood and\r\nfill'd our Water. Off the North point of the Bay is a pretty high rocky\r\nIsland, and about a Mile without it are some rocks and breakers. The\r\nvariation of the Compass is here 14 degrees 31 minutes East, and the Tide\r\nflows at full and change of the Moon about 6 o'Clock, and rises and falls\r\nupon a Perpendicular 5 or 6 feet, but wether the flood comes from the\r\nSouthward or Northward I have not been able to determine.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay in this bay we had every day more or less Traffick with\r\nthe Natives, they bringing us fish, and now and then a few sweet Potatoes\r\nand several trifles which we deemd Curiosities; for these we gave them\r\nCloth, Beads, Nails, etc. The Cloth we got at King George's Island and\r\nUlietea, they valued more than anything we could give them, and as every\r\none in the Ship were provided with some of this sort of Cloth, I suffer'd\r\nevery body to purchase what ever they pleased without limitation; for by\r\nthis means I knew that the Natives would not only sell but get a good\r\nPrice for every thing they brought. This I thought would induce them to\r\nbring to Market whatever the Country afforded, and I have great reason to\r\nthink that they did, yet it amounted to no more than what is above\r\nmentioned. We saw no 4 footed Animals, either Tame or Wild, or signs of\r\nany, except Dogs and Rats,* (* Cook's powers of observation are here\r\nevident. There were no other quadrupeds in New Zealand.) and these were\r\nvery Scarce, especially the latter. The flesh of the former they eat, and\r\nornament their clothing with their skins as we do ours with furs, etc.\r\nWhile we lay here I went upon some of the Hills in order to View the\r\nCountry, but when I came there I could see but very little of it, the\r\nsight being interrupted by still higher hills. The Tops and ridges of the\r\nHills are for the most part barren, at least little grows on them but\r\nfern; but the Valleys and sides of many of the Hills were luxuriously\r\nclothed with woods and Verdure and little Plantations of the Natives\r\nlying dispers'd up and down the Country. We found in the Woods, Trees of\r\nabove 20 different sorts; Specimens of each I took on board, as all of\r\nthem were unknown to any of us. The Tree which we cut for firing was\r\nsomething like Maple and yeilded a whitish Gum. There was another sort of\r\na deep Yellow which we imagin'd might prove useful in dying. We likewise\r\nfound one Cabage Tree* (* Palm.) which we cut down for the sake of the\r\ncabage. The Country abounds with a great Number of Plants, and the woods\r\nwith as great a variety of beautiful birds, many of them unknown to us.\r\nThe soil of both the hills and Valleys is light and sandy, and very\r\nproper for producing all kinds of Roots, but we saw only sweet potatoes\r\nand Yams among them; these they plant in little round hills, and have\r\nplantations of them containing several Acres neatly laid out and keept in\r\ngood order, and many of them are fenced in with low paling which can only\r\nserve for Ornament.\r\n\r\nMonday, 30th. P.M. little wind and cloudy weather. At 1 Tack'd and stood\r\nin shore; at 7 o'Clock Tolaga Bay bore West-North-West, distant one\r\nLeague. Tack'd and lay her head off; had it calm until 2 a.m., when a\r\nbreeze sprung up at South-West, and we made Sail to the Northward. At 6,\r\nGable end Foreland bore South-South-West, and Tolaga bay South-South-West\r\n1/4 West, distance 3 Leagues. At 8, being about 2 Miles from the shore,\r\nsome Canoes that were fishing came after the Ship; but we having a fresh\r\nof wind they could not come up with us, and I did not chuse to wait for\r\nthem. At Noon, Latitude per observation 37 degrees 49 minutes South, a\r\nsmall Island lying off the Northernmost land in sight, bore North 16\r\ndegrees East, distant 4 Miles; course from Tolaga bay North by East 1/2\r\nEast, distance 13 Leagues. The Land from thence is of a moderate but\r\nunequal height, forming several small bays wherein are sandy beaches.\r\nHazey, cloudy weather prevented us from seeing much of the inland\r\ncountry, but near the Shore we could see several Villages and Plantations\r\nof the Natives. Soundings from 20 to 30 fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Runaway, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 31st. At half-past one p.m. hauled round the Island above\r\nmentioned, which lies East 1 Mile from the North-East point of the land.\r\nThe lands from hence Trends North-West by West, and West-North-West, as\r\nfar as we could see. This point of Land I have called East Cape, because\r\nI have great reason to think that it is the Eastermost land on this whole\r\nCoast; and for the same reason I have called the Island which lays off\r\nit, East Island. It is but of a small circuit, high and round, and\r\nappears white and barren. The Cape is of a moderate height with white\r\ncliffs, and lies in the Latitude of 37 degrees 42 minutes 30 seconds\r\nSouth, and Longitude 181 degrees 00 minutes West from the Meridian of\r\nGreenwich. After we had rounded the East Cape we saw, as we run along\r\nshore, a great number of Villages and a great deal of Cultivated land;\r\nand in general the country appear'd with more fertility than what we had\r\nseen before; it was low near the Sea, but hilly inland. At 8, being 8\r\nleagues to the Westward of Cape East, and 3 or 4 miles from the shore,\r\nshortned sail and brought too for the night, having at this Time a fresh\r\nGale at South-South-East and squally weather; but it soon fell moderate,\r\nand at 2 a.m. made Sail again to the South-West as the land now Trended.\r\nAt 8 saw land which made like an Island bearing West. At the same time\r\nthe South-Westermost part of the Main bore South-West. At 9, five Canoes\r\ncame off to us, in one of which were upwards of 40 Men all Arm'd with\r\nPikes, etc.; from this and other Circumstances it fully appear'd that\r\nthey came with no friendly intentions; and I at this Time being very\r\nbuisey, and had no inclination to stay upon deck to watch their Motions,\r\nI order'd a Grape shot to be fir'd a little wide of them. This made them\r\npull off a little, and then they got together either to consult what to\r\ndo or to look about them. Upon this I order'd a round shott to be fir'd\r\nover their heads, which frightend them to that degree that I believe they\r\ndid not think themselves safe until they got ashore. This occasion'd our\r\ncalling the Point of land off which this hapned, Cape Runaway. Latitude\r\n37 degrees 32 minutes South, longitude 181 degrees 50 minutes West, and\r\n17 or 18 Leagues to the Westward of East Cape. 4 Leagues to the Westward\r\nof East Cape is a bay which I have named Hicks's bay, because Lieutenant\r\nHicks was the first who discover'd it.\r\n\r\n[November 1769.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 1st November. P.M., as we stood along shore (having little\r\nwind, and Variable), we saw a great deal of Cultivated land laid out in\r\nregular inclosures, a sure sign that the Country is both fertile and well\r\ninhabited. Some Canoes came off from the shore, but would not come near\r\nthe Ship. At 8 brought to 3 Miles from the Shore, the land seen yesterday\r\nbearing West, and which we now saw was an Island, bore South-West,* (*\r\nThis should evidently be North-West.) distant 8 leagues. I have named it\r\nWhite Island,* (* White Island is an active volcano. It was evidently\r\nquiescent at the time of the Endeavour passing.) because as such it\r\nalways appear'd to us. At 5 a.m. made Sail along shore to the South-West,\r\nhaving little wind at East-South-East and Cloudy weather. At 8 saw\r\nbetween 40 and 50 Canoes in shore. Several of them came off to the Ship,\r\nand being about us some time they ventur'd alongside and sold us some\r\nLobsters, Muscels, and 2 Conger Eales. After these were gone some others\r\ncame off from another place with Muscels only, and but few of these they\r\nthought proper to part with, thinking they had a right to everything we\r\nhanded them into their Canoes without making any return. At last the\r\nPeople in one Canoe took away some linnen that was towing over the side,\r\nwhich they would not return for all that we could say to them. Upon this\r\nI fir'd a Musket Ball thro' the Canoe, and after that another musquet\r\nload with Small Shott, neither of which they minded, only pulled off a\r\nlittle, and then shook their paddles at us, at which I fir'd a third\r\nMusquet; and the ball, striking the Water pretty near them, they\r\nimmediately apply'd their Paddles to another use; but after they thought\r\nthemselves out of reach they got altogether, and Shook their Paddles\r\nagain at us. I then gave the Ship a Yaw, and fir'd a 4 Pounder. This sent\r\nthem quite off, and we keept on our course along shore, having a light\r\nbreeze at East-South-East. At noon we were in the Latitude of 37 degrees\r\n55 minutes, White Island bearing North 29 degrees West, distant 8\r\nLeagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 2nd. Gentle breezes from North-West round Northerly to\r\nEast-South-East and fair weather. At 2 p.m. saw a pretty high Island\r\nbearing West from us, and at 5 saw more Islands and Rocks to the Westward\r\nof it. Hauld our wind in order to go without them, but, finding that we\r\ncould not weather them before dark, bore up, and run between them and the\r\nMain. At 7 was close under the first Island, from whence a large double\r\nCanoe full of People came off to us. This was the first double Canoe we\r\nhad seen in this Country. They staid about the Ship until it was dark,\r\nthen left us; but not before they had thrown a few stones. They told us\r\nthe name of the Island, which was Mowtohora.* (* Motuhora, called also\r\nWhale Island.) It is but of a small Circuit, but high, and lies 6 Miles\r\nfrom the Main. Under the South side is Anchorage in 14 fathoms.\r\nSouth-West by South from this Island on the Main land, seemingly at no\r\ngreat distance from the Sea, is a high round Mountain, which I have named\r\nMount Edgcombe. It stands in the middle of a large Plain, which make it\r\nthe more Conspicuous. Latitude 37 degrees 59 minutes South, Longitude 183\r\ndegrees 07 minutes West. In standing to the Westward we Shoalded our\r\nWater from 17 to 10 fathoms, and knowing that we were not far from some\r\nSmall Islands and Rocks that we had seen before dark, after Passing of\r\nwhich I intended to have brought too for the night, but I now thought it\r\nmore prudent to tack, and spend the Night under the Island of Mowtohora,\r\nwhere I knew there was no danger. And it was well we did, for in the\r\nmorning, after we had made Sail to the Westward, we discovered Rocks\r\nahead of us Level with and under the Water.* (* Rurima Rocks.) They lay 1\r\n1/2 Leagues from the Island Mowtohora, and about 9 Miles from the Main,\r\nand North-North-East from Mount Edgecumbe. We passed between these Rocks\r\nand the Main, having from 7 to 10 fathoms. The double Canoe which we saw\r\nlast night follow'd us to-day under Sail, and keept abreast of the Ship\r\nnear an hour talking to Tupia, but at last they began to pelt us with\r\nstones. But upon firing one Musquet they dropt aStern and left us. At 1/2\r\npast 10 Passed between a low flat Island and the Main, the distance from\r\none to the other being 4 Miles; depth of Water 10, 12, and 15 fathoms. At\r\nNoon the flat Island* (* Motunau.) bore from North-East to East 1/2\r\nNorth, distance 5 or 6 Miles; Latitude in per Observation 37 degrees 39\r\nminutes South, Longitude 183 degrees 30 minutes West. The Main land\r\nbetween this and the Island of Mowtohara, which is 10 Leagues, is of a\r\nmoderate height, and all a level, flat Country, pretty clear of wood and\r\nfull of Plantations and Villiages. These Villiages are built upon\r\nEminences Near the Sea, and are Fortified on the land side with a Bank\r\nand a Ditch, and Pallisaded all round. Besides this, some of them\r\nappear'd to have out-works. We have before now observed, on several parts\r\nof the Coast, small Villiages inclosed with Pallisades and works of this\r\nkind built on Eminences and Ridges of hills, but Tupia had all along told\r\nus that they were Mories, or places of worship; but I rather think they\r\nare places of retreat or strong hold where they defend themselves against\r\nthe Attack of an Enemy, as some of them seem'd not ill design'd for that\r\nPurpose.* (* In the contests with the Maories in after years, these Pahs,\r\nor forts, proved to be no despicable defences.)\r\n\r\n[In Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 3rd. P.M. Fresh Gales at North-East by East and hazey weather. At\r\n2 pass'd a small high Island lying 4 Miles from a high round head on the\r\nMain* (* The island was Moliti; the high round head was Maunganui, which\r\nmarks the entrance to Tauranga harbour, a good port, where now stands a\r\nsmall town of the same name.) from this head the land Trends North-West\r\nas far as we could see, and appeared to be very rugged and hilly. The\r\nweather being very hazey, and the Wind blowing fresh on shore, we hauled\r\noff close upon a wind for the weathermost Island in sight, which bore\r\nfrom us North-North-East, distant 6 or 7 Leagues. Under this Island we\r\nspent the Night, having a fresh gale at North-East and North-East by\r\nEast, and hazey weather with rain; this Island I have called the Mayor.\r\nAt 7 a.m. it bore South 47 degrees East, distant 6 Leagues, and a Cluster\r\nof small Islands and Rocks bore North 1/2 East, distant one League. At\r\nthe time had a Gentle breeze at East-North-East and clear weather. The\r\nCluster of Islands and Rocks just mentioned we named the Court of\r\nAldermen; they lay in the Compass of about half a League every way, and 5\r\nLeagues from the Main, between which and them lay other Islands. The most\r\nof them are barren rocks, and of these there is a very great Variety,\r\nsome of them are of as small a Compass as the Monument in London, and\r\nSpire up to a much greater height; they lay in the Latitude of 36 degrees\r\n57 minutes, and some of them are inhabited. At Noon they bore South 60\r\ndegrees East, distant 3 or 4 Leagues, and a Rock like a Castle lying not\r\nfar from the Main, bore North 40 degrees West, one League. Latitude\r\nobserved 36 degrees 58 minutes South; Course and distance since Yesterday\r\nnoon is North-North-West 1/2 West, about 20 Leagues. In this Situation\r\nhad 28 fathoms water, and a great many small Islands and Rocks on every\r\nside of us. The Main land appears here with a hilly, rugged, and barren\r\nsurface, no Plantations to be seen, nor no other signs of its being well\r\ninhabited.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 4th. The first and middle parts, little wind at East-North-East\r\nand Clear weather; the Latter had a fresh breeze at North-North-West and\r\nhazey with rain. At 1 p.m. 3 Canoes came off from the Main to the Ship,\r\nand after Parading about a little while they darted 2 Pikes at us. The\r\nfirst was at one of our Men as he was going to give them a rope, thinking\r\nthey were coming on board; but the 2nd they throw'd into the Ship; the\r\nfiring of one musquet sent them away. Each of these Canoes were made out\r\nof one large Tree, and were without any sort of Ornament, and the people\r\nin them were mostly quite naked. At 2 p.m. saw a large op'ning or inlet\r\nin the land, which we bore up for with an intent to come to an Anchor. At\r\nthis time had 41 fathoms, which gradually decreased to 9 fathoms, at\r\nwhich time we were 1 1/2 Mile from a high Tower'd Rock lying near the\r\nSouth point of the inlet; the rock and the Northermost of the Court of\r\nAldermen being in one bearing South 61 degrees East. At 1/2 past 7\r\nAnchor'd in 7 Fathoms a little within the South Entrance of the Bay or\r\ninlet. We were accompanied in here by several Canoes, who stay'd about\r\nthe Ship until dark; and before they went away they were so generous as\r\nto tell us that they would come and attack us in the morning; but some of\r\nthem paid us a Visit in the night, thinking, no doubt, but what they\r\nshould find all hands asleep, but as soon as they found their Mistake\r\nthey went off. My reasons for putting in here were the hopes of\r\ndiscovering a good Harbour, and the desire I had of being in some\r\nconvenient place to observe the Transit of Mercury, which happens on the\r\n9th Instant, and will be wholy Visible here if the day is clear. If we be\r\nso fortunate as to obtain this observation, the Longitude of this place\r\nand Country will thereby be very accurately determined. Between 5 and 6\r\no'Clock in the morning several Canoes came off to us from all parts of\r\nthe Bay; in them were about 130 or 140 People. To all appearances their\r\nfirst design was to attack us, being all Completely Arm'd in their way;\r\nhowever, this they never attempted, but after Parading about the Ship\r\nnear 3 Hours, sometimes trading with us, and at other times Tricking of\r\nus, they dispersed; but not before we had fir'd a few Musquets and one\r\ngreat gun, not with any design to hurt any of them, but to shew them what\r\nsort of Weapons we had, and that we could revenge any insult they offer'd\r\nto us. It was observable that they paid but little regard to the Musquets\r\nthat were fir'd, notwithstanding one ball was fir'd thro' one of their\r\nCanoes, but what Effect the great gun had I know not, for this was not\r\nfir'd until they were going away.\r\n\r\n[At Mercury Bay, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nAt 10, the weather Clearing up a little, I went with 2 Boats to sound the\r\nBay and to look for a more convenient Anchoring place, the Master being\r\nin one Boat, and I in the other. We pull'd first over the North Shore,\r\nwhere some Canoes came out to meet us, but as we came near them they\r\nretir'd to the Shore and invited us to follow them, but seeing they were\r\nall Arm'd I did not think fit to Except of their Invitation; but after\r\nTrading with them out of the Boat for a few Minutes we left them and went\r\ntowards the head of the Bay. I observed on a high Point a fortified\r\nVillage, but I could only see a part of the works, and as I intend to see\r\nthe whole, shall say no more about it at this time. After having fix'd\r\nupon an Anchoring place not far from where the Ship lay I return'd on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nSunday, 5th. Winds at North-North-West, Hazey weather with rain in the\r\nnight. At 4 p.m. weigh'd and run in nearer the South shore and Anchor'd\r\nin 4 1/2 fathoms, a soft sandy bottom, the South point of the Bay bearing\r\nEast, distant 1 Mile, and a River (into which the boats can go at low\r\nWater) South-South-East, distant 1 1/2 Miles.* (* The bight in which the\r\nEndeavour anchored is now known as Cook Bay.) In the morning the Natives\r\ncame off again to the Ship, but their behaviour was very different to\r\nwhat it was Yesterday morning, and the little traffick we had with them\r\nwas carried on very fair and friendly. Two came on board the Ship--to\r\neach I gave a Piece of English Cloth and some Spike Nails. After the\r\nNatives were gone I went with the Pinnace and Long boat into the River to\r\nhaul the Sean, and sent the Master to sound the Bay and drudge for fish\r\nin the Yawl. We hauled the Sean in several places in the River, but\r\ncaught only a few Mullet, with which we returned on board about Noon.\r\n\r\nMonday, 6th. Moderate breezes at North-North-West, and hazey weather with\r\nrain in the night. P.M. I went to another part of the Bay to haul the\r\nSean, but meet with as little Success as before; and the Master did not\r\nget above 1/2 a Bucket full of Shells with the Drudge. The Natives\r\nbrought to the Ship, and sold to our People, small Cockles, Clams, and\r\nMussels, enough for all hands. These are found in great plenty upon the\r\nSand Banks of the River. In the morning I sent the Long boat to Trawl in\r\nthe Bay, and one Officer with the Marines and a party of men to Cut wood\r\nand haul the Sean, but neither the Sean nor the Trawl meet with any\r\nsuccess; but the Natives in some measure made up for this by bringing\r\nseveral Baskets of dry'd or ready dress'd fish; altho' it was none of the\r\nbest I order'd it all to be bought up in order to encourage them to\r\nTrade.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 7th. The first part moderate and fair; the remainder a fresh\r\nbreeze, northerly, with dirty, hazey, raining Weather. P.M. got on board\r\na Long boat Load of Water, and Caught a dish of fish in the Sean. Found\r\nhere a great Quantity of Sellery, which is boild every day for the Ship's\r\nCompany as usual.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 8th. P.M. fresh breeze at North-North-West and hazey, rainy\r\nweather; the remainder a Gentle breeze at West-South-West and Clear\r\nWeather. A.M. heeld and Scrubb'd both sides of the Ship and Sent a Party\r\nof Men ashore to Cutt wood and fill Water. The Natives brought off to the\r\nShip, and Sold us for Small pieces of Cloth, as much fish as served all\r\nhands; they were of the Mackrell kind, and as good as ever was Eat. At\r\nNoon I observ'd the Sun's Meridian Zenith distance, by the Astronomical\r\nQuadrant, which gave the Latitude 36 degrees 47 minutes 43 seconds South;\r\nthis was in the River before mentioned, that lies within the South\r\nEntrance of the Bay.\r\n\r\nThursday, 9th. Variable light breezes and Clear weather. As soon as it\r\nwas daylight the Natives began to bring off Mackrell, and more than we\r\nwell know what to do with; notwithstanding I order'd all they brought to\r\nbe purchased in order to encourage them in this kind of Traffick. At 8,\r\nMr. Green and I went on shore with our Instruments to observe the Transit\r\nof Mercury, which came on at 7 hours 20 minutes 58 seconds Apparent time,\r\nand was observed by Mr. Green only.* (* Mr. Green satirically remarks in\r\nhis Log, \"Unfortunately for the seamen, their look-out was on the wrong\r\nside of the sun.\" This probably refers to Mr. Hicks, who was also\r\nobserving. It rather seems, however, as if Cook, on this occasion, was\r\ncaught napping by an earlier appearance of the planet than was expected.)\r\nI, at this time, was taking the Sun's Altitude in order to Ascertain the\r\ntime. The Egress was observed as follows:--\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Green:\r\nInternal Contact at 12 hours 8 minutes 58 seconds Afternoon.\r\nExternal Contact at 12 hours 9 minutes 55 seconds Afternoon.\r\n\r\nBy myself:\r\nInternal Contact at 12 hours 8 minutes 45 seconds Afternoon.\r\nExternal Contact at 12 hours 9 minutes 43 seconds Afternoon.\r\n\r\nLatitude observed at noon 36 degrees 48 minutes 28 seconds, the mean of\r\nthis and Yesterday's observation gives 36 degrees 48 minutes 5 1/2\r\nseconds South; the Latitude of the Place of Observation, and the\r\nVariation of the Compass was at this time found to be 11 degrees 9\r\nminutes East. While we were making these observations 5 Canoes came\r\nalongside the Ship, 2 Large and 3 Small ones, in one were 47 People, but\r\nin the other not so many. They were wholy strangers to us, and to all\r\nappearance they came with a Hostile intention, being compleatly Arm'd\r\nwith Pikes, Darts, Stones, etc.; however, they made no attempt, and this\r\nwas very probable owing to their being inform'd by some other Canoes (who\r\nat this time were alongside selling fish) what sort of people they had to\r\nDeal with. When they first came alongside they begun to sell our people\r\nsome of their Arms, and one Man offer'd to Sale a Haahow, that is a\r\nSquare Piece of Cloth such as they wear. Lieutenant Gore, who at this\r\ntime was Commanding Officer, sent into the Canoe a piece of Cloth which\r\nthe Man had agreed to Take in Exchange for his, but as soon as he had got\r\nMr. Gore's Cloth in his Possession he would not part with his own, but\r\nput off the Canoe from alongside, and then shook their Paddles at the\r\nPeople in the Ship. Upon this, Mr. Gore fir'd a Musquet at them, and,\r\nfrom what I can learn, kill'd the Man who took the Cloth; after this they\r\nsoon went away. I have here inserted the account of this Affair just as I\r\nhad it from Mr. Gore, but I must own it did not meet with my approbation,\r\nbecause I thought the Punishment a little too severe for the Crime, and\r\nwe had now been long Enough acquainted with these People to know how to\r\nChastise Trifling faults like this without taking away their Lives.\r\n\r\nFriday, 10th. P.M., Gentle breezes and Variable; the remainder, a Strong\r\nbreeze at East-North-East, and hazey weather. A.M., I went with 2 Boats,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen into the River which\r\nEmptys itself into the head of the Bay, in order to Examine it; none of\r\nthe Natives came off to the Ship this morning, which we think is owing to\r\nbad weather.\r\n\r\n[Pahs in Mercury Bay, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 11th. Fresh Gales at East-North-East, and Cloudy, hazey weather\r\nwith rain. Between 7 and 8 o'Clock p.m. I returnd on board from out the\r\nRiver, having been about 4 or 5 Miles up it, and could have gone much\r\nfarther had the weather been favourable. I landed on the East side and\r\nwent upon the Hills, from whence I saw, or at least I thought I saw, the\r\nhead of the River. It here branched into several Channels, and form'd a\r\nNumber of very low flat Islands, all cover'd with a sort of Mangrove\r\nTrees, and several places of the Shores of both sides the River were\r\nCover'd with the same sort of wood. The sand banks were well stored with\r\nCockles and Clams, and in many places were Rock Oysters. Here is likewise\r\npretty plenty of Wild Fowl, such as Shags, Ducks, Curlews, and a Black\r\nbird, about as big as a Crow, with a long, sharp bill of a Colour between\r\nRed and Yellow; we also saw fish in the River, but of what sort I know\r\nnot. The Country especially on the East side is barren, and for the most\r\npart destitute of wood, or any other signs of Fertility; but the face of\r\nthe country on the other side looked much better, and is in many places\r\ncover'd with wood. We meet with some of the Natives and saw several more,\r\nand Smokes a long way inland, but saw not the least signs of Cultivation,\r\neither here or in any other part about the Bay, so that the inhabitants\r\nmust live wholy on shell and other fish, and Fern roots, which they Eat\r\nby the way of Bread. In the Entrance of this river, and for 2 or 3 Miles\r\nup, it is very safe and Commodious Anchoring in 3, 4, and 5 fathoms, and\r\nConvenient places for laying a Ship aShore, where the Tide rises and\r\nfalls about 7 feet at full and Change. I could not see whether or no any\r\nconsiderable fresh Water Stream came out of the Country into this river,\r\nbut there are a number of small Rivulets which come from the Adjacent\r\nhills. [Pahs in Mercury Bay, New Zealand.] A little within the Entrance\r\nof the River on the East side is a high point or peninsula juting out\r\ninto the River on which are the Remains of one of their Fortified towns.\r\nThe Situation is such that the best Engineer in Europe could not have\r\nChose a better for a Small Number of men to defend themselves against a\r\ngreater; it is strong by Nature and made more so by Art. It is only\r\nAccessible on the land Side, and there have been cut a Ditch and a Bank\r\nraised on the inside. From the Top of the Bank to the Bottom of the Ditch\r\nwas about 22 feet, and depth of the Ditch on the land side 14 feet; its\r\nbreadth was in proportion to its depth, and the whole seem'd to have been\r\ndone with great Judgment. There had been a row of Pickets on the Top of\r\nthe Bank, and another on the outside of the Ditch; these last had been\r\nset deep in the ground and Sloping with their upper ends hanging over the\r\nDitch. The whole had been burnt down, so that it is probable that this\r\nplace had been taken and destroy'd by an Enemy. The people on this side\r\nof the Bay seem now to have no houses or fix'd habitations, but Sleep in\r\nthe open Air, under Trees and in small Temporary shades; but to all\r\nappearance they are better off on the other side, but there we have not\r\nset foot. In the morning, being dirty rainy weather, I did not Expect any\r\nof the Natives off with fish, but thinking that they might have some\r\nashore I sent a Boat with some Trade, who return'd about noon loaded with\r\nOysters, which they got in the River which is abreast of the Ship, but\r\nsaw no fish among the Natives.\r\n\r\nSunday, 12th. P.M. had Strong Gales at North-East, and hazey, rainy\r\nweather; A.M. a fresh breeze at North-West, and Clear weather. In the\r\nmorning got on board a Turn of Water, and afterwards sent the Long boat\r\ninto the River for Oysters to take to sea with us; and I went with the\r\nPinnace and Yawl, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, over to the\r\nNorth side of the Bay in order to take a View of the Country and the\r\nFortified Village which stands there. We landed about a mile from it, and\r\nwere meet by the inhabitants in our way thither, who, with a great deal\r\nof good nature and friendship, conducted us into the place and shew'd us\r\neverything that was there.\r\n\r\nThis village is built upon a high Promontory or point on the North side\r\nand near the head of the Bay. It is in some places quite inaccessible to\r\nman, and in others very difficult, except on that side which faced the\r\nnarrow ridge of the hill on which it stands. Here it is defended by a\r\ndouble ditch, a bank and 2 rows of Picketing, the inner row upon the\r\nBank; but not so near the Crown but what there was good room for men to\r\nWalk and handle their Arms between the Picketing and the inner Ditch. The\r\nouter Picketing was between the 2 Ditches, and laid sloping with their\r\nupper ends hanging over the inner Ditch. The Depth of this Ditch from the\r\nbottom to the Crown of the bank was 24 feet. Close within the inner\r\nPlcketing was erected by strong Posts a stage 30 feet high and 40 in\r\nlength and 6 feet broad. The use of this stage was to stand upon to throw\r\nDarts at the Assailants, and a number of Darts lay upon it for that\r\npurpose. At right angles to this Stage and a few paces from it was\r\nanother of the same Construction and bigness; this stood likewise within\r\nthe Picketing, and was intended for the same use as the other--viz., to\r\nstand upon to throw stones and darts upon the Enemy as they advanc'd up\r\nthe side of the Hill where lay the Main way into the place. It likewise\r\nmight be intended to defend some little outworks and hutts that lay at\r\nthe Skirts and on this side of the Hill. These outworks were not intended\r\nas advanced Posts, but for such of the Inhabitants to live in as had not\r\nroom in the Main works, but had taken Shelter under it. Besides the works\r\non the land side, above described, the whole Villiage was Pallisaded\r\nround with a line of pretty strong Picketing run round the Edge of the\r\nhill. The ground within having not been level at first, but laid Sloping,\r\nthey had divided it into little squares and Leveled each of these. These\r\nsquares lay in the form of an Amphitheatre, and were each of them\r\nPallisaded round, and had communication one with another by narrow lanes\r\nand little gateways, which could easily be stoped up, so that if an Enemy\r\nhad forced the outer Picketing he had several others to incounter before\r\nthe place could be easily reduced, supposing them to defend everyone of\r\nthe places one after another. The main way leading into this\r\nfortification was up a very steep part of the Hill and thro' a narrow\r\npassage about 12 feet long and under one of the Stages. I saw no door nor\r\ngate, but it might very soon have been barricaded up. Upon the whole I\r\nlooked upon it to be very strong and well choose Post, and where a small\r\nnumber of resolute men might defend themselves a long time against a vast\r\nsuperior force, Arm'd in the manner as these People are. These seem'd to\r\nbe prepared against a Siege, having laid up in store an immense quantity\r\nof Fern roots and a good many dry'd fish; but we did not see that they\r\nhad any fresh Water nearer than a brook which runs close under the foot\r\nof a hill, from which I suppose they can at times get water, tho'\r\nbesiged, and keep it in gouards until they use it. Under the foot of the\r\npoint on which the Village stands are 2 Rocks, the one just broke off\r\nfrom the Main and other detatched a little from it. They are both very\r\nsmall, and more fit for Birds to inhabit than men; yet there are houses\r\nand places of defence on each of them, and about a Mile to Eastward of\r\nthese is another of these small Fortified rocks, which communicates with\r\nthe Main by a Narrow pathway, where there is a small Villiage of the\r\nNatives. Many works of this kind we have seen upon small Islands and\r\nRocks and Ridges of hills on all parts of the Coast, besides a great\r\nnumber of Fortified towns, to all appearances Vastly superior to this I\r\nhave described. From this it should seem that the People must have long\r\nand frequent Warrs, and must have been long accustomed to it, otherwise\r\nthey never would have invented such strong holds as these, the Erecting\r\nof which must cost them immense labour, considering the Tools they have\r\nto work with, which are only made of Wood and Stone. It is a little\r\nstrange that with such a Warlike People, as these undoubtedly are, no\r\nOmissive weapons are found among them, such as bows and Arrows, Slings,\r\netc., things in themselves so easily invented, and are common in every\r\nother part of the world. The Arms they use are long spears or Lances, a\r\nStaff about 5 feet long. Some of these are pointed at one end like a\r\nSerjeant's Halberd, others are round and Sharp; the other ends are broad,\r\nsomething like the blade of an Oar. They have another sort about 4 1/2\r\nfeet long; these are shaped at one End like an Axe, and the other is made\r\nwith a Sharp point. They have short Truncheons about a foot long, which\r\nthey call Pattoo Pattoas; some made of wood, some of bone, and others of\r\nStone. Those made of wood are Variously shaped, but those made of bone\r\nand Stone are of one shape, which is with a round handle, a broadish\r\nblade, which is thickest in the Middle and taper'd to an Edge all round.\r\nThe use of these are to knock Men's brains out, and to kill them outright\r\nafter they are wounded; and they are certainly well contrived things for\r\nthis purpose. Besides these Weapons they Throw stones and Darts; the\r\nDarts are 10 or 12 feet long, are made of hard wood, and are barbed at\r\none end. They handle all their Arms with great Agility, particularly\r\ntheir long Pikes or Lances, against which we have no weapon that is an\r\nequal match except a Loaded Musquet.\r\n\r\nMonday, 13th. P.M., Gentle Breezes at North-West and Clear weather. After\r\ntaking a Slight View of the Country and Loaded both boats with Sellery,\r\nwhich we found in Great plenty near the Sea beach, we return'd on board\r\nabout 5 o'Clock. The Long boat at the same time return'd out of the River\r\nLoaded as deep as she could swim with Oysters. And now I intended to put\r\nto Sea in the morning if wind and weather will permit. In the night had\r\nthe wind at South-East, with rainy, dirty, hazey weather, which continued\r\nall day, so that I could not think of Sailing, but thought myself very\r\nhappy in being in a good Port. Samuel Jones, Seaman, having been confin'd\r\nsince Saturday last for refusing to come upon deck when all hands were\r\ncalled, and afterwards refused to Comply with the orders of the officers\r\non deck, he was this morning punished with 12 lashes and remited back to\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 14th. Fresh Gales, Easterly, and rainy, Dirty weather.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 15th. In the evening I went in the Pinnace and landed upon one\r\nof the Islands that lies off of the South Head of the Bay, with a view to\r\nsee if I could discover any sunken rocks or other Dangers lying before\r\nthe Entrance of the Bay, as there was a pretty large swell at this Time.\r\nThe Island we landed upon was very small, yet there were upon it a\r\nVillage, the inhabitants of which received us very friendly. This little\r\nVillage was laid out in small Oblong squares, and each pailisaded round.\r\nThe Island afforded no fresh Water, and was only accessible on one side:\r\nfrom this I concluded that it was not choose for any Conveniency it could\r\nafford them, but for its Natural Strength.\r\n\r\n[Sail from Mercury Bay, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nAt 7 A.M. weigh'd, with a light breeze at West, and clear weather, and\r\nmade Sail out of the Bay, steering North-East, for the Northermost of a\r\nNumber of Islands lying off the North point of the Bay. These Islands are\r\nof Various extents, and lye Scattered to the North-West in a parallel\r\ndirection with the Main as far as we could see. I was at first afraid to\r\ngo within them, thinking that there was no safe Passage, but I afterwards\r\nthought that we might; and I would have attempted it, but the wind,\r\ncoming to the North-West, prevented it, so that we were obliged to stand\r\nout to Sea. At Noon was in the Latitude of 36 degrees 4 minutes South.\r\nThe Northermost Island, above mentioned, bore North, distant half a\r\nLeague; the Court of Aldermen, South-East by South, distant 6 Leagues;\r\nand the Bay Sail'd from, which I have named Mercury Bay, on account of\r\nthe observation being made there, South-West by West, distant 6 Miles.\r\n\r\nMercury Bay* (* At the head of Mercury Bay is a small settlement called\r\nWhitianga.) lies in the Latitude of 36 degrees 47 minutes South, and the\r\nLongitude of 184 degrees 4 minutes West, from the Meridian of Greenwich.\r\nIt lies in South-West between 2 and 3 Leagues. There are several Islands\r\nlying both to the Southward and Northward of it, and a Small high Island\r\nor Rock in the Middle of the Entrance. Within this Island the depth of\r\nwater doth no were Exceed 9 or 8 fathoms; the best Anchorage is in a\r\nsandy Bay which lies just within the South head in 5 and 4 fathoms,\r\nbringing a high Tower Rock, which lies without the head, in one with the\r\nhead, or just shut in behind it. Here it is very Convenient Wooding and\r\nWatering, and in the River are an immense quantity of Oysters and other\r\nsmall Shell fish; and this is the only thing it is remarkable for, and\r\nhath occasioned my giving it the Name of Oyster River. But the Snugest\r\nand Safest place for a Ship to lay in that wants to stay there any time\r\nis in the River at the head of the Bay, and where there is every\r\nconveniency the place can afford. To sail up and into it keep the South\r\nshore all the way on board. As we did not learn that the Natives had any\r\nname for this River, I have called it the River of Mangroves,* (* Still\r\nso called.) because of the great quantity of these Trees that are found\r\nin it. The Country on the South-East side of this River and Bay is very\r\nbarren, producing little else but Fern, and such other plants as delight\r\nin a Poor Soil. The land on the North-West side is pretty well cover'd\r\nwith wood, the Soil more fertile, and would no doubt produce the\r\nNecessarys of Life, was it Cultivated. However, this much must be said\r\nagainst it, that it is not near so Rich nor fertile as the lands we have\r\nseen to the Southward; and the same may be said of its inhabitants, who,\r\nalthough pretty numerous, are poor to the highest degree when Compar'd to\r\nothers we have seen. They have no Plantations, but live only on Fern\r\nroots and fish; their Canoes are mean, and without ornament, and so are\r\ntheir Houses, or Hutts, and in general everything they have about them.\r\nThis may be owing to the frequent wars in which they are Certainly\r\ningaged; strong proofs of this we have seen, for the people who resided\r\nnear the place where we wooded, and who Slept every night in the Open\r\nAir, placed themselves in such a manner when they laid down to sleep as\r\nplainly shew'd that it was necessary for them to be always upon their\r\nGuard. They do not own Subjection to Teeratie, the Earadehi,* (* Cook did\r\nnot realize that the New Zealanders were divided into independent\r\ntribes.) but say that he would kill them was he to come Among them; they\r\nconfirm the Custom of Eating their Enemies, so that this is a thing no\r\nlonger to be doubted. I have before observed that many of the People\r\nabout this bay had no fix'd habitations, and we thought so then, but have\r\nsince learnt that they have strong holds--or Hippas, as they call\r\nthem--which they retire to in time of danger.\r\n\r\nWe found, thrown upon the Shore in several places in this Bay, a quantity\r\nof Iron Sand, which is brought down out of the Country by almost every\r\nlittle fresh-water brook. This proves that there must be of that Ore not\r\nfar inland. Neither of the Inhabitants of this Place, nor any other where\r\nwe have been, know the use of Iron or set the least Value upon it,\r\npreferring the most Trifling thing we could give them to a Nail, or any\r\nsort of Iron Tools. Before we left this bay we cut out upon one of the\r\nTrees near the Watering Place the Ship's Name, date, etc., and, after\r\ndisplaying the English Colours, I took formal possession of the place in\r\nthe Name of His Majesty.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Colville, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 16th. Fresh breezes between the North-West and South-West, and\r\nfair weather. At 1 P.M., having got within the Group of Islands which\r\nlies of the North head of Mercury Bay, hauld our wind to the Northward,\r\nand Kept plying to windward all the day between these Islands and some\r\nothers laying to the Northward of them, with a View to get under the Main\r\nland, the Extream North-West point of which we could see, at Noon, bore\r\nWest by North, distant 6 or 8 Leagues; Latitude in Per Observation 36\r\ndegrees 33 minutes South.\r\n\r\nNote, in speaking of Mercury Bay, I had forgot to mention that the\r\nMangrove Trees found there produce a resinous substance very much like\r\nRosin. Something of this kind, I am told, is found in both the East and\r\nWest Indies. We found it, at first, in small Lumps upon the Sea Beach,\r\nbut afterwards found it sticking to the Mangrove Trees, and by that means\r\nfound out from whence it came.\r\n\r\nFriday, 17th. The fore and Middle parts had fresh Gales between the\r\nSouth-West and West by South, and Squally. Kept plying to windward in\r\norder to get under the land. At 6 A.M. fetched close under the lee of the\r\nNorthernmost Island in sight, then Tackd and Stood to the Southward until\r\n11, when we tack'd and Stood to the Northward. At this time the North\r\nhead of Mercury Bay, or Point Mercury, bore South-East by East, distant 3\r\nLeagues, being at this time between 2 and 3 Leagues from the Main land,\r\nand abreast of a place where there appear'd to be a Harbour;* (* Probably\r\nWaikawau Bay) but the heavy squalls which we had from the Land would not\r\npermit us to take a nearer View of it, but soon brought us under our\r\nClose reeft Topsails. At Noon Point Mercury bore South-East, distant 4\r\nLeagues, and the weathermost point of the Main land in sight bore North\r\n60 degrees West, distant 5 Leagues. Over the North-West side of Mercury\r\nBay is a pretty high round hill, rising sloping from the Shore of the\r\nBay. This hill is very conspicuous from where we now are.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 18th. First part strong Gales at South-West and\r\nSouth-South-West, with heavy squalls: in the morning had Gentle breezes\r\nat South and South-East, towards noon had Whifling light Airs all round\r\nthe Compass. Kept plying to windward under close Reeft Topsails until\r\ndaylight, at which time we had got close under the Main, and the wind\r\ncoming at South-East we made sail and steer'd North-West by West, as the\r\nland lays, keeping close in shore. At 6 we passed a small Bay* (* Charles\r\nCove.) wherein there appear'd to be Anchorage, and pretty good Shelter\r\nfrom the Sea Winds, at the Entrance of which lies a Rock pretty high\r\nabove water. 4 Miles farther to the West-North-West is a very Conspicuous\r\npromontory or point of land which we got abreast of about 7 o'Clock; it\r\nlies in the Latitude of 36 degrees 26 minutes South and North 48 degrees\r\nWest, 9 Leagues from Point Mercury. From this point the Land trends West\r\n1/2 South near one League, then South-South-East as far as we could see.\r\nBesides the Islands laying without us we could see land round by the\r\nSouth-West as far as North-West, but whether this was the Main or Islands\r\nwas not possible for us at this Time to determine; the fear of loosing\r\nthe Main land determin'd me to follow its direction. With this View we\r\nhauld round the point* (* Cape Colville.) and Steer'd to the Southward,\r\nbut meeting with Whifling light Airs all round the Compass, we made but\r\nlittle progress untill noon, when we found ourselves by Observation in\r\nthe Latitude of 36 degrees 29 minutes South; a small Island* (* Channel\r\nIsland.) which lays North-West 4 Miles from the Promontory\r\nabove-mentioned bore North by East, distant 6 1/2 Miles, being at this\r\ntime about 2 Miles from the Shore. While we lay under the land 2 large\r\nCanoes came off to us; in one of them were 62 people; they staid about us\r\nsome time, then began to throw stones into the Ship, upon which I fir'd a\r\nMusquet ball thro' one of the Canoes. After this they retir'd ashore.\r\n\r\nSunday, 19th. At 1 p.m. a breeze sprung up at East, which afterwards came\r\nto North-East, and with it we steer'd along shore South by East and\r\nSouth-South-East, having from 25 to 18 fathoms Water. At 1/2 past 7,\r\nhaving run 7 or 8 Leagues since Noon, we Anchor'd in 23 fathoms, not\r\nchoosing to run any farther in the Dark, having the land on both sides of\r\nus forming the Entrance of a Streight, Bay or River, lying in South by\r\nEast, for on that point of the Compass we could see no land. At daylight\r\nA.M., the wind being still favourable, we weighed and run under an Easy\r\nsail up the inlet, keeping nearest the East side. Soon after we had got\r\nunder Sail 3 large Canoes came off to the Ship, and several of the people\r\ncame on board upon the very first invitation; this was owing to their\r\nhaving heard of our being upon the Coast and the manner we had treated\r\nthe Natives. I made each of those that came on board a small present, and\r\nafter about an Hour's stay they went away well Satisfied. After having\r\nrun 5 Leagues from the place where we Anchor'd last night our Depth of\r\nWater gradually decreased to 6 fathoms, and into less I did not choose to\r\ngo, and as the wind blew right up the inlet and tide of flood, we came to\r\nan Anchor nearly in the middle of the Channell, which is here about 11\r\nMiles over, and after this sent 2 Boats to sound, the one on one side and\r\nthe other on the other side.\r\n\r\n[At Frith of Thames, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 20th. Moderate breezes at South-South-East and fair weather. At 2\r\np.m. the boats return'd from sounding, not having found above 3 feet more\r\nwater than were we now lay; upon this I resolved to go no farther with\r\nthe Ship but to examine the head of the Bay in the Boat, for as it\r\nappeard to run a good way inland, I thought this a good opportunity to\r\nsee a little of the interior part of the Country and its produce.\r\nAccordingly at daylight in the morning I set out with the Pinnace and\r\nLong boat accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia. We found the\r\ninlet end in a River, about 9 miles above the Ship, into which we Enter'd\r\nwith the first of the flood, and before we had gone 3 Miles up it found\r\nthe Water quite fresh. We saw a number of Natives and landed at one of\r\ntheir Villages, the inhabitants of which received us with open Arms. We\r\nmade but a Short stay with them but proceeded up the river until near\r\nNoon, when finding the face of the country to continue pretty much the\r\nsame, and no alteration in the Course or stream of the River or the least\r\nprobability of seeing the end of it, we landed on the West side in order\r\nto take a View of the lofty Trees which Adorn its banks, being at this\r\ntime 12 or 14 Miles within the Entrance, and here the Tide of Flood runs\r\nas strong as it does in the River Thames below bridge.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 21st. After Landing as above-mention'd, we had not gone a\r\nhundred yards into the woods before we found a Tree that girted 19 feet 8\r\ninches, 6 feet above the ground, and having a Quadrant with me, I found\r\nits length from the root to the first branch to be 89 feet; it was as\r\nStreight as an Arrow and Taper'd but very little in proportion to its\r\nlength, so that I judged that there was 356 Solid feet of timber in this\r\nTree, clear of the branches. We saw many others of the same sort, several\r\nof which were Taller than the one we measured, and all of them very\r\nstout; there were likewise many other sorts of very Stout Timber Trees,\r\nall of them wholy unknown to any of us. We brought away a few specimens,\r\nand at 3 o'Clock we embarqued in order to return (but not before we had\r\nnamed this river the Thames,* (* The flourishing town of Thames now\r\nstands at the eastern entrance of the river: population nearly 5000. Gold\r\nis found in the vicinity.) on account of its bearing some resemblance to\r\nthat River in England) on board with the very first of the Ebb. In our\r\nreturn down the river, the inhabitants of the Village where we landed in\r\ngoing, seeing that we return'd by another Channell, put off in their\r\nCanoes and met us and Trafficked with us in the most friendly manner\r\nimmaginable, until they had disposed of the few Trifles they had. The\r\ntide of Ebb just carried us out of the narrow part of the River into the\r\nSea reach, as I may call it, where meeting with the flood and a Strong\r\nbreeze at North-North-West obliged us to come to a Grapnel, and we did\r\nnot reach the Ship until 7 o'Clock in the A.M. Intending to get under\r\nSail at high water the Long boat was sent to take up the Kedge Anchor,\r\nbut it blow'd so strong that she could not reach the Buoy, and the gale\r\nincreasing soon obliged us to vear away more Cable and Strike Top Gallant\r\nYards.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 22nd. Winds at North-North-West. The A.M. fresh Gales and\r\nhazey with rain; the remainder, moderate and Clear. At 3 p.m. the Tide of\r\nEbb making, we took up our Anchors and got under Sail and ply'd down the\r\nRiver until 8 o'Clock, when we again came to an Anchor in 7 fathoms,\r\nmuddy bottom. At 3 a.m. weigh'd with the first of the Ebb and keept\r\nplying until the flood obliged us to anchor again. After this I went in\r\nthe Pinnace over to the Western Shore, but found there neither\r\ninhabitants or anything else worthy of Note. At the time I left the Ship\r\na good many of the Natives were alongside and on board Trafficking with\r\nour people for such Trifles as they had, and seem'd to behave as well as\r\npeople could do, but one of them took the 1/2 hour glass out of the\r\nBittacle, and was caught in the very fact, and for which Mr. Hicks, who\r\nwas Commanding Officer, brought him to the Gangway and gave him a Dozen\r\nlashes with a Catt of nine Tails. The rest of the people seem'd not\r\ndispleased at it when they came to know what it was for, and some old man\r\nbeat the fellow after he had got into his Canoe; however, soon after this\r\nthey all went away.\r\n\r\nThursday, 23rd. P.M. Gentle breezes at North-North-West and fair weather.\r\nBetween 3 and 4 o'Clock got under Sail with the first of the Ebb and\r\nply'd to windward until 9 when we anchor'd in 16 fathoms over upon the\r\nEast shore. In the night had light Airs and Calm; at 3 A.M. weighed but\r\nhad little or no wind until near noon, when a light breeze sprung up at\r\nNorth-North-West. At this time we were close under the West shore in 7\r\nfathoms Water; Latitude 36 degrees 51 minutes South.\r\n\r\n[Description of Frith of Thames, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 24th. P.M., Fresh Gales and dark, Cloudy, squally weather, with\r\nThunder, Lightning, and rain. Winds from the North-West to the\r\nSouth-West, and this last carried us by 7 o'Clock without the North-West\r\npoint of the River, but the weather being bad and having land on all\r\nsides of us, and a Dark night coming on, I thought it most adviseable to\r\nTack and stretch in under ye Point where we Anchor'd in 19 fathoms. At 5\r\na.m. weighed and made Sail to the North-West under our Courses and double\r\nReef'd Topsails, the wind being at South-West by West and\r\nWest-South-West, a strong Gale and Squally blowing right off the land,\r\nwhich would not permit us to come near it, so that from the time of our\r\ngetting under Sail until' Noon (during which time we ran 12 Leagues) we\r\nhad but a slight and distant View of the Coast and was not able to\r\ndistinguish wether the points we saw were parts of the Main or Islands\r\nlaying before it, for we never once lost sight of the Main Land.* (* The\r\nEndeavour was now in Hauraki Gulf and had passed the harbour where\r\nAuckland now stands, which is hidden behind a number of islands.) At noon\r\nour Latitude by observation was 36 degrees 15 minutes 20 seconds South,\r\nbeing at this time not above 2 Miles from a Point of Land on the Main and\r\n3 1/2 Leagues from a very high Island* (* Little Barrier Island, now\r\n(1892) about to be made a reserve to protect native fauna.) which bore\r\nNorth-East by East of us; in this Situation had 26 fathoms Water. The\r\nfarthest point we could see on the Main bore from us North-West, but we\r\ncould see several small Islands laying to the Northward of that\r\ndirection. The point of land we are now abreast off, I take to be the\r\nNorth-West Extremity of the River Thames, for I shall comprehend under\r\nthat Name the Deep Bay we have been in for this week past, the North-East\r\npoint of which is the Promontory we past on Saturday morning last, and\r\nwhich I have named Cape Colvill in honour of the Right hon'ble the Lord\r\nColvill;* (* Cook had served under Rear Admiral Lord Colville in\r\nNewfoundland.) Latitude 36 degrees 26 minutes South; Longitude 184\r\ndegrees 27 minutes West. It rises directly from the Sea to a Considerable\r\nheight, but what makes it most remarkable is a high Rock standing close\r\nto the pitch of the point, and from some points of view may be\r\ndistinguished at a very great distance. From the South-West point of this\r\nCape the river Extends itself in a direct line South by East, and is no\r\nwhere less than 3 Leagues broad until' you are 14 Leagues above the Cape,\r\nthere it is at once Contracted to a Narrow stream. From this place it\r\nstill continues the same South by East Course thro' a low flat Country or\r\nbroad Valley that lies Parrallel with the Sea Coast, the End of which we\r\ncould not see. The land on the East side of the Broadest part of this\r\nriver is Tollerable high and hilly, that on the West side is rather low,\r\nbut the whole is cover'd with woods and Verdure and looks to be pretty\r\nfertile, but we saw but a few small places that were Cultivated. About\r\nthe Entrance of the narrow part of the River the land is mostly Cover'd\r\nwith Mangroves and other Shrubs, but farther in are immense woods of as\r\nstout lofty timber as is to be found perhaps in any other part of the\r\nworld. In many places the woods grow close upon the very banks of the\r\nRiver, but where it does not the land is Marshey such as we find about\r\nthe Thames in England. We saw poles stuck up in many places in the River\r\nto set nets for Catching of fish; from this we immagin'd that there must\r\nbe plenty of fish, but of what sort we know not for we saw none. The\r\nGreatest Depth of Water we found was 26 fathoms and decreaseth pretty\r\ngradually as you run up to 1 1/2 and 1 fathom. In the mouth of the\r\nfresh-water Stream or narrow part is 3 and 4 fathoms, but before this are\r\nsand banks and large flatts; Yet, I believe, a Ship of a Moderate draught\r\nof Water may go a long way up this River with a flowing Tide, for I\r\nreckon that the Tides rise upon a perpendicular near 10 feet, and is high\r\nwater at the full and Change of the Moon about 9 o'Clock. Six Leagues\r\nwithin Cape Colvill, under the Eastern Shore, are several small Islands,\r\nthese Islands together with the Main seem'd to form some good Harbours.*\r\n(* Coromandel Harbour.) Opposite to these Islands under the Western Shore\r\nlies some other Islands, and it appear'd very probable that these form'd\r\nsome good Harbours likewise.* (* Auckland Harbour is one of them.) But\r\neven supposing there were no Harbours about this River, it is good\r\nanchoring in every part of it where the depth of Water is Sufficient,\r\nbeing defended from the Sea by a Chain of Large and Small Islands which I\r\nhave named Barrier Isles, lying aCross the Mouth of it extending\r\nthemselves North-West and South-East 10 Leagues. The South end of these\r\nIslands lies North-East 4 1/2 Leagues from the North-West point of the\r\nRiver, which I have named point Rodney; it lies West-North-West 9 leagues\r\nfrom Cape Colvill, Latitude 36 degrees 15 minutes; Longitude 184 degrees\r\n58 minutes West. The Natives residing about this River do not appear to\r\nbe very numerous considering the great Extent of Country; at least not\r\nmany came off to the Ship at one Time, and as we were but little ashore\r\nourselves we could not so well judge of their numbers. They are a Strong,\r\nwell made, active People as any we have seen yet, and all of them Paint\r\ntheir Bodys with Red Oker and Oil from Head to foot, a thing that we have\r\nnot seen before. Their Canoes are large, well built and Ornamented with\r\nCarved work in general as well as most we have seen.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 25th. P.M., had fresh Gales at South-West, and Squally weather.\r\nWe kept standing along Shore to the North-West, having the Main land on\r\nthe one side and Islands on the other; our Soundings were from 26 to 12\r\nfathoms. At 1/2 past 7 p.m. we Anchor'd in a Bay in 14 fathoms, sandy\r\nbottom. We had no sooner come to an Anchor than we caught between 90 and\r\n100 Bream (a fish so called), this occasioned my giving this place the\r\nName of Bream Bay.* (* Whangarei Bay.) The 2 points which forms this Bay\r\nlie North and South 5 Leagues from each other. The Bay is every where\r\npretty broad and between 3 and 4 Leagues deep; at the bottom of it their\r\nappears to be a fresh water River.* (* Whangarei River. The district is\r\nvery fertile. Coal mines are in the vicinity, and coal is exported.) The\r\nNorth head of the Bay, called Bream head, is high land and remarkable on\r\naccount of several peaked rocks ranged in order upon the top of it; it\r\nlies in the Latitude 35 degrees 46 minutes South and North 41 degrees\r\nWest, distant 17 1/2 Leagues from Cape Colvill. This Bay may likewise be\r\nknown by some Small Islands lying before it called the Hen and Chickens,\r\none of which is pretty high and terminates at Top in 2 peaks. The land\r\nbetween Point Rodney and Bream Head, which is 10 Leagues, is low and\r\nwooded in Turfs, and between the Sea and the firm land are white sand\r\nbanks. We saw no inhabitants but saw fires in the Night, a proof that the\r\nCountry is not uninhabited. At daylight A.M. we left the Bay and directed\r\nour Course along shore to the northward, having a Gentle breeze at South\r\nby West and Clear weather. A little after sunrise found the Variation to\r\nbe 12 degrees 42 minutes Easterly. At Noon, our Latitude by observation\r\nwas 36 degrees 36 minutes South; Bream head bore South distant 10 Miles;\r\nsome small Islands (Poor Knights) at North-East by North distant 3\r\nLeagues, and the Northermost land in sight bore North-North-West, being\r\nat this Time 2 miles from the Shore, and in this Situation had 26\r\nfathoms; the land here about is rather low and pretty well cover'd with\r\nwood and seems not ill inhabited.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Brett, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 26th. P.M., Gentle breezes between the East-North-East and North,\r\nkept ranging along shore to the Northward. At the distance of 4 or 5\r\nMiles off saw several Villages and some Cultivated lands; towards evening\r\nseveral Canoes came off to us, and some of the Natives ventur'd on board;\r\nto 2, who appear'd to be Chiefs, I gave presents. After these were gone\r\nout of the Ship, the others became so Troublesome that in order to get\r\nrid of them we were at the expence of 2 or 3 Musquet Balls, and one 4\r\npound Shott, but as no harm was intended them, none they received, unless\r\nthey hapned to over heat themselves in pulling on shore. In the Night had\r\nvariable light Airs, but towards morning had a light breeze at South, and\r\nafterward at South-East; with this we proceeded slowly to the Northward.\r\nAt 6 a.m. several Canoes came off from the place where they landed last\r\nnight, and between this and noon many more came from other parts. Had at\r\none time a good many of the people on board, and about 170 alongside;\r\ntheir behaviour was Tolerable friendly, but we could not prevail upon\r\nthem to Traffic with us. At noon, the Mainland Extending from South by\r\nEast to North-West by West; a remarkable point of land bore West, distant\r\n4 or 5 miles. Latitude Observed 35 degrees 11 minutes South.\r\n\r\nMonday, 27th. P.M., Gentle breezes Easterly, and Clear weather. At 3\r\npassed the point of land afore-mentioned, which I have named Cape Brett\r\nin honour of Sir Piercy.* (* Rear Admiral Sir Piercey Brett was one of\r\nthe Lords of the Admiralty when the Endeavour sailed.) The land of this\r\nCape is considerable higher than any part of the Adjacent Coast. At the\r\nvery point of the Cape is a high round Hillock, and North-East by North,\r\nnear one Mile from this is a small high Island or Rock with a hole\r\npierced thro' it like the Arch of a Bridge, and this was one reason why I\r\ngave the Cape the above name, because Piercy seem'd very proper for that\r\nof the Island. This Cape, or at least some part of it, is called by the\r\nNatives Motugogogo; Latitude 35 degrees 10 minutes 30 seconds South,\r\nLongitude 185 degrees 25 minutes West. On the West side of Cape Brett is\r\na large and pretty deep Bay* (* The Bay of Islands.) lying in South-West\r\nby West, in which there appear'd to be several small Islands. The point\r\nthat forms the North-West entrance I have named Point Pocock; it lies\r\nWest 1/4 North, 3 or 4 Leagues from Cape Brett. On the South-West side of\r\nthis Bay we saw several Villages situated both on Islands and on the Main\r\nland, from whence came off to us several large Canoes full of People,\r\nbut, like those that had been alongside before, would not Enter into a\r\nfriendly Traffick with us, but would Cheat whenever they had an\r\nopportunity. The people in these Canoes made a very good appearance,\r\nbeing all stout well-made men, having their Hair--which was black--comb'd\r\nup and tied upon the Crown of their heads, and there stuck with white\r\nfeathers; in each of the Canoes were 2 or 3 Chiefs, and the Habits of\r\nthese were rather superior to any we had yet seen. The Cloth they wore\r\nwas of the best sort, and cover'd on the outside with Dog Skins put on in\r\nsuch a manner as to look Agreeable enough to the Eye. Few of these people\r\nwere Tattow'd or marked in the face, like those we have seen farther to\r\nthe South, but several had their Backsides Tattow'd much in the same\r\nmanner as the inhabitants of the Islands within the Tropics. In the\r\nCourse of this day, that is this afternoon and Yesterday forenoon, we\r\nreckoned that we had not less than 400 or 500 of the Natives alongside\r\nand on board the ship, and in that time did not range above 6 or 8\r\nLeagues of the Sea Coast, a strong proof that this part of the Country\r\nmust be well inhabited. In the Evening, the Wind came to the Westward of\r\nNorth, and we Tack'd and stood off North-East until 11 o'Clock, when the\r\nwind coming more favourable we stood again to the Westward. At 8 a.m we\r\nwere within a Mile of Groups of Islands lying close under the Mainland\r\nand North-West by West 1/2 West, distance 22 Miles from Cape Brett. Here\r\nwe lay for near 2 Hours, having little or no wind. During this time\r\nseveral Canoes came off to the Ship, and 2 or 3 of them sold us some\r\nfish--Cavallys as they are called--which occasioned my giving the Islands\r\nthe same name. After this some others began to Pelt us with Stones, and\r\nwould not desist at the firing of 2 Musquet Balls thro' one of their\r\nBoats; at last I was obliged to pepper 2 or 3 fellows with small Shott,\r\nafter which they retir'd, and the wind coming at North-West we stood off\r\nto Sea. At Noon, Cavally Islands bore South-West by South, distant 4\r\nMiles; Cape Brett South-East, distant 7 Leagues, and the Westermost land\r\nin sight, making like Islands, bore West by North; Latitude in per\r\nObservation 34 degrees 55 minutes South.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 28th. A Fresh breeze from the Westward all this day, which being\r\nright in our teeth, we kept beating to windward with all the sail we\r\ncould Crowd, but instead of Gaining we lost ground. A.M., being close in\r\nwith the land to the Westward of the Bay, which lies on this side of Cape\r\nBrett, we saw at some distance inland 2 pretty large Villages Pallisaded\r\nin the same manner as others we have seen. At noon, Cape Brett South-East\r\nby East 1/2 East, distant 6 Leagues; Latitude observed 35 degrees 0\r\nminutes South.\r\n\r\n[At Bay of Islands, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 29th. Fresh Gales at North-West and West-North-West, kept\r\nplying to Windward until 7 A.M., and finding that we lost ground every\r\nboard we made, I thought I could not do better than to bear up for the\r\nBay, which lies to the Westward of Cape Brett, it being at this Time not\r\nabove 2 Leagues to Leeward of us, for by putting in there we should gain\r\nsome knowledge of it, on the Contrary, by Keeping the Sea with a Contrary\r\nwind, we were sure of meeting with nothing new. These reasons induced me\r\nto bear away for the Bay,* (* The Bay of Islands.) and at 11 o'Clock we\r\nAnchor'd under the South-West side of one of the many Islands* (* Motu\r\nArohia.) that line the South-East side of it, in 4 1/2 fathoms; but as we\r\nfell into this shoald water all at once, we Anchor'd sooner than was\r\nintended, and sent the Master with 2 Boats to sound, who found that we\r\nhad got upon a Bank that spitted off from the North-West end of the\r\nIsland, and that on the outside of it was 8 and 10 fathoms Water.\r\n\r\nThursday, 30th. P.M., had the winds Westerly, with some very heavy\r\nShowers of Rain. We had no sooner come to an Anchor than between 300 and\r\n400 of the Natives Assembled in their Canoes about the Ship; some few\r\nwere admitted on board, and to one of the Chiefs I gave a piece of Broad\r\nCloth and distributed a few Nails, etc., among some others of them. Many\r\nof these People had been off to the Ship when we were at Sea, and seem'd\r\nto be very sencible of the use of Fire Arms, and in the Trade we had with\r\nthem they behaved Tolerable well, but continued so not long, before some\r\nof them wanted to take away the Buoy,* (* The buoy on the anchor.) and\r\nwould not desist at the firing of several Musquets until one of them was\r\nhurt by small Shott, after which they withdrew a small distance from the\r\nShip, and this was thought a good opportunity to try what Effect a Great\r\nGun would have, as they paid so little respect to a Musquet, and\r\naccordingly one was fir'd over their Heads. This, I believe, would have\r\nsent them quite off, if it had not been for Tupia, who soon prevail'd on\r\nthem to return to the Ship, when their behaviour was such as gave us no\r\nroom to suspect that they meant to give us any farther Trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter the Ship was moved into Deeper Water I went with the Pinnace and\r\nYawl, mann'd and Arm'd, and landed upon the Island, accompanied by Mr.\r\nBanks and Dr. Solander. We had scarce landed before all the Canoes left\r\nthe Ship and landed at different parts of the Island, and before we could\r\nwell look about us we were surrounded by 2 or 300 People, and,\r\nnotwithstanding that they were all Arm'd, they came upon us in such a\r\nconfused, straggling manner that we hardly suspected that they meant us\r\nany harm; but in this we were very soon undeceived, for upon our\r\nEndeavouring to draw a line on the sand between us and them they set up\r\nthe War dance, and immediately some of them attempted to seize the 2\r\nBoats. Being disappointed in this, they next attempted to break in upon\r\nus, upon which I fir'd a Musquet loaded with small Shott at one of the\r\nForwardest of them, and Mr. Banks and 2 of the Men fir'd immediately\r\nafter. This made them retire back a little, but in less than a minute one\r\nof the Chiefs rallied them again. Dr. Solander, seeing this, gave him a\r\npeppering with small Shott, which sent him off and made them retire a\r\nSecond time. They attempted to rally several times after, and only seem'd\r\nto want some one of resolution to head them; but they were at last\r\nintirely dispers'd by the Ship firing a few shott over their Heads and a\r\nMusquet now and then from us. In this Skirmish only one or 2 of them was\r\nHurt with small Shott, for I avoided killing any one of them as much as\r\nPossible, and for that reason withheld our people from firing. We had\r\nobserved that some had hid themselves in a Cave in one of the Rocks, and\r\nsometime after the whole was over we went Towards them. The Chief who I\r\nhave mentioned to have been on board the Ship hapned to be one of these;\r\nhe, his wife, and another came out to meet us, but the rest made off.\r\nThose 3 people came and sat down by us, and we gave them of such things\r\nas we had about us. After this we went to another part of the Island,\r\nwhere some of the inhabitants came to us, and were as meek as lambs.\r\nHaving taken a View of the Bay from the Island and Loaded both Boats with\r\nSellery, which we found here in great plenty, we return'd on board, and\r\nat 4 A.M. hove up the Anchor in order to put to Sea, with a light breeze\r\nat East, but it soon falling Calm, obliged us to come too again, and\r\nabout 8 or 9 o'Clock, seeing no probability of our getting to Sea, I sent\r\nthe Master to Sound the Harbour. But before this I order'd Matthew Cox,\r\nHenry Stevens, and Emanl Parreyra to be punished with a dozen lashes each\r\nfor leaving their duty when ashore last night, and digging up Potatoes\r\nout of one of the Plantations.* (* Cook's care to deal fairly with\r\nnatives is evinced by this punishment.) The first of the 3 I remitted\r\nback to Confinement because he insisted that there was no harm in what he\r\nhad done. All this Forenoon had abundance of the Natives about the Ship\r\nand some few on board. We Trafficked with them for a few Trifles, in\r\nwhich they dealt very fair and friendly.\r\n\r\n[December 1769.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 1st December. Winds at North-North-West a Gentle breeze. At 3\r\np.m., the Boats having return'd from sounding, I went with them over to\r\nthe South side of the Harbour, and landed upon the Main, accompanied by\r\nMr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We met with nothing new or remarkable. The\r\nplace where we landed was in a small sandy Cove, where there are 2 small\r\nStreams of Fresh Water and Plenty of Wood for fuel. Here were likewise\r\nseveral little Plantations planted with Potatoes and Yams. The Soil and\r\nNatural produce of the Country was much the same as what we have hitherto\r\nmet with. The people we saw behaved to us with great marks of friendship.\r\nIn the evening we had Some very heavy showers of rain, and this brought\r\nus on board sooner than we intended. A.M., the wind being still contrary,\r\nI sent some people ashore upon the Island to cut Grass for our Sheep, in\r\nthe doing of which the inhabitants gave them no sort of disturbance, and\r\nin the same friendly manner did those behave that were alongside the\r\nShip. Punished Matthew Cox with 6 Lashes, and then dismiss'd him.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 2nd. Winds at North-West and North. P.M. a Gentle breeze; the\r\nremainder Strong Gales and hazey, with much rain towards Noon. At 8 a.m.\r\nhoisted out the Long boat, and sent her ashore for water, and the Pinnace\r\nto haul the Sean; but they had not got well ashore before it began to\r\nblow and rain very hard. This occasioned them to return on board with one\r\nTurn of water and but a very few fish.\r\n\r\nSunday, 3rd. P.M., Strong Gales at North, with rain; the remainder Gentle\r\nbreezes from the Westward. A.M., sent 2 Boats to sound the Harbour and\r\none to haul the Sean, the latter of which met with very little Success.\r\n\r\nMonday, 4th. Gentle breezes at North-West, West-North-West, and West;\r\nvery fair weather. P.M., Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and myself landed upon\r\none of the Islands* (* Probably Motu-Rua.) on the North side of the one\r\nthe Ship lays under. This Island is about 3 Miles in Circuit, and hath\r\nupon it 40 or 50 Acres of Land cultivated and planted with roots; here\r\nare likewise several small streams of Excellent water. This Island, as\r\nwell as most others in this Bay, seem to be well inhabited. At 4 a.m.\r\nsent the Long boat to the above Island for water and some hands to cut\r\nGrass, and at 9, I went with the Pinnace and Yawl over upon the Main,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. In our way we passed by a\r\npoint of land on which stood a Hippa or Fortified Village, the\r\ninhabitants of which waved us to come ashore, and accordingly we landed,\r\nwhich we had no sooner done than the People came about us with Quantitys\r\nof various sorts of fish, which we purchased of them for meer Trifles.\r\nAfter this they shew'd us the Village, which was a neat Compact place,\r\nand its situation well Choose. There were 2 or 3 more near unto this, but\r\nthese we did not go to. We afterwards went a little way into the Country,\r\nand had some of the Natives along with us; we met with a good deal of\r\nCultivated land, planted mostly with sweet potatoes. The face of the\r\nCountry appear'd Green and pleasant, and the soil seem'd to be pretty\r\nrich and proper for Cultivation. The land is every where about this Bay\r\nof a moderate height, but full of small Hills and Vallies, and not much\r\nincumbered with wood. We met with about 1/2 a dozen Cloth plants, being\r\nthe same as the inhabitants of the Islands lying within the Tropics make\r\ntheir finest Cloth on. This plant must be very scarce among them, as the\r\nCloth made from it is only worn in small pieces by way of Ornaments at\r\ntheir ears, and even this we have seen but very seldom. Their knowing the\r\nuse of this sort of Cloth doth in some measure account for the\r\nextraordinary fondness they have shew'd for it above every other thing we\r\nhad to give them. Even a sheet of white paper is of more value than so\r\nmuch English Cloth of any sort whatever; but, as we have been at few\r\nplaces where I have not given away more or less of the latter, it's more\r\nthan probable that they will soon learn to set a value upon it, and\r\nlikewise upon Iron, a thing not one of them knows the use of or sets the\r\nleast value upon; but was European commodities in ever such Esteem among\r\nthem, they have no one thing of Equal value to give in return, at least\r\nthat we have seen.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 5th. P.M., had the winds at South-West and West-South-West, a\r\nfresh breeze. At 3 o'Clock we return'd on board, and after dinner Visited\r\nanother part of the Bay, but met with nothing new. By the evening all our\r\nEmpty Casks were fill'd with water, and had at the same time got on board\r\na large quantity of Sellery, which is found here in great Plenty. This I\r\nstill caused to be boild every morning with Oatmeal and Portable Soup for\r\nthe Ship's Company's breakfast. At 4 a.m. weigh'd with a light breeze at\r\nSouth-East, but had Variable light Airs and sometimes Calm until near\r\nNoon, when a Gentle breeze sprung up at North. At this time we had not\r\ngot out of the Bay; our Latitude by Observation was 35 degrees 9 minutes\r\nSouth. This Bay I have before observed, lies on the West side of Cape\r\nBrett: I have named it the Bay of Islands,* (* The principal settlement\r\nin the Bay of Islands is Russell. A little higher up the Waikare River,\r\nat Opua, coal obtained from mines in the vicinity is shipped. At Russell,\r\nthen called Kororarika, the first settlement of missionaries was formed\r\nin 1814 by Samuel Marsden. Here also the Government of the Island was\r\nfirst established in 1840, but was soon removed to Auckland.) on account\r\nof the Great Number which line its shores, and these help to form Several\r\nsafe and Commodious Harbours, wherein is room and Depth of Water\r\nsufficient for any number of Shipping. The one we lay in is on the\r\nSouth-West side of South-Westermost Island, that lies on the South-East\r\nside of the Bay. I have made no accurate Survey of this Bay; the time it\r\nwould have requir'd to have done this discouraged me from attempting it;\r\nbesides, I thought it quite Sufficient to be able to Affirm with\r\nCertainty that it affords a good Anchorage and every kind of refreshment\r\nfor Shipping, but as this was not the Season for roots, we got only fish.\r\nSome few we Caught ourselves with hook and line and in the Sean, but by\r\nfar the greatest part we purchased of the Natives, and these of Various\r\nsorts, such as Sharks, Stingrays, Breams, Mullet, Mackerel, and several\r\nother sorts. Their way of Catching them is the same as ours, viz., with\r\nHook and line and Seans; of the last they have some prodidgious large\r\nmade all of a Strong Kind of Grass. The Mackerel are in every respect the\r\nsame as those we have in England, only some are larger than any I ever\r\nsaw in any other Part of the World; although this is the Season for this\r\nfish, we have never been able to Catch one with hook and line. The\r\ninhabitants of this Bay are far more numerous than at any other place we\r\nhave yet been in, and seem to live in friendship one with another,\r\nalthough it doth not at all appear that they are united under one head.*\r\n(* This district was found to be very populous when the missionaries\r\ncame.) They inhabited both the Islands and the Main, and have a Number of\r\nHippas, or Strong Holds, and these are all built in such places as nature\r\nhath in a great part fortified, and what she hath left undone the people\r\nthemselves have finished. It is high water in this Bay at full and change\r\nof the Moon about 8 o'clock, and the tide at these times rises and falls\r\nupon a perpendicular 6 or 8 feet. It appears, from the few Observations I\r\nhave been able to make of the Tides on the Sea-Coast, that the flood\r\ncomes from the Southward, and I have lately had reasons to think that\r\nthere is a current which comes from the Westward and sets along shore to\r\nthe South-East or South-South-East, as the Land lays.\r\n\r\n[Sail from Bay of Islands, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 6th. P.M., had a Gentle breeze at North-North-West, with which\r\nwe kept turning out of the Bay, but gain'd little or nothing; in the\r\nevening it fell little wind; at 10 o'Clock it was Calm. At this time the\r\ntide or Current seting the Ship near one of the Islands, where we were\r\nvery near being ashore; but, by the help of our Boats and a light Air\r\nfrom the Southward, we got clear. About an hour after, when we thought\r\nourselves out of all danger, the Ship struck upon a Sunken rock* (*\r\nCalled Whale Rock, in Endeavour's chart.) and went immediately clear\r\nwithout receiving any perceptible damage. Just before the man in the\r\nChains had 17 fathoms Water, and immediately after she struck 5 fathoms,\r\nbut very soon Deepned to 20. This rock lies half-a-mile West-North-West\r\nfrom the Northermost or outermost Island that lies on the South-East side\r\nof the Bay. Had light Airs from the Land and sometimes Calm until 9\r\no'Clock a.m.; at this time we had got out of the Bay, and a breeze\r\nspringing up at North-North-West, we stood out to Sea. At noon Cape Brett\r\nbore South-South-East 1/2 South, distant 10 miles. Latitude observed, 34\r\ndegrees 59 minutes South.\r\n\r\nThursday, 7th. P.M., a fresh breeze from the Westward and Clear weather.\r\nAt 3 o'Clock took several Observations of the Sun and Moon; the mean\r\nresult of them gives 185 degrees 36 minutes West Longitude from the\r\nMeridian of Greenwich. What winds we have had this 24 hours hath been\r\nagainst us, so that at Noon we had advanced but very little to the\r\nWestward.\r\n\r\nFriday, 8th. Forepart of P.M. had a Gentle breeze at North-North-West,\r\nwith which we stood in shore and fetched close under the Cavalle Islands.\r\nThey are a Group of Small Islands lying close under the Main land, and 7\r\nLeagues North 60 West from Cape Brett, and 3 1/2 Leagues from Point\r\nRodney. From these Islands the Main land trends West by North. We were\r\nhere Visited by several Canoes, and the People in them seem'd desirous of\r\nTrafficking with us, but at this time a breeze of wind sprung up at\r\nSouth, they could not keep up with the Ship, and I would not wait for\r\nthem. The wind did not continue long at South before it veer'd to\r\nSouth-West and West, a light breeze. Found the Variation in the Evening\r\nto be 12 degrees 42 minutes East, and in the Morning 13 degrees East.\r\nKeept standing to the West-North-West and North-West until 10 A.M., at\r\nwhich time we tacked and stood in for the Shore, being about 5 Leagues\r\noff, and in this situation had 118 fathoms Water. At Noon Cape Brett bore\r\nSouth-East, distant 13 Leagues, and the Westermost land in sight bore\r\nWest by South, being at this time about 4 Leagues from Land. Latitude in\r\nper Observation, 34 degrees 42 minutes South.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 9th. P.M., had a Gentle Breeze at West, which in the Evening\r\ncame to South and continued so all night; this by daylight brought us\r\npretty well in with the land, 7 Leagues to the Westward of the Cavalle\r\nIsles, and where lies a deep Bay running in South-West by West and\r\nWest-South-West, the bottom of which we could but just see, and there the\r\nland appear'd to be low and level, the 2 points which form the Entrance\r\nlie West-North-West and East-South-East 5 Miles from each other. This Bay\r\nI have named Doubtless Bay;* (* There is a small settlement called\r\nMangonui in Doubtless Bay.) the wind not permitting us to look into this\r\nBay we steer'd for the Westermost land we had in sight, which bore from\r\nus West-North-West, distant 3 Leagues, but before we got the length of it\r\nit fell calm, and continued so until 10 o'Clock, when a breeze sprung up\r\nat West-North-West, and with it we stood off North. While we lay\r\nbecalm'd, several of the Natives came off to the Ship in 5 Canoes, but\r\nwere fearful of venturing alongside. After these were gone, 6 more came\r\noff; these last came boldly alongside, and sold us fish of different\r\nsorts sufficient to give all hands a little.\r\n\r\nAt noon, the Cavalle Islands bore South-East by East, distant 8 Leagues,\r\nand the Entrance of Doubtless Bay South by West distant 3 Leagues, and\r\nthe North-West Extremity of the Land in sight, which we judge to be the\r\nMain, bore North-West by West. Our Latitude by observation was 34 degrees\r\n44 minutes South.\r\n\r\n[Off Rangaunu Bay, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 10th. Had the winds from the Western board all this day, a Gentle\r\nbreeze and clear weather. In the evening found the Variation to be 12\r\ndegrees 41 minutes East per Azimuth and 12 degrees 40 minutes by the\r\nAmplitude; in the morning we stood Close in with the Land, 7 Leagues to\r\nthe westward of Doubtless Bay. Here the shore forms another large open\r\nBay; the Bottom of this and Doubtless Bay cannot be far from each other,\r\nbeing to all appearance only seperated by a low neck of land from which\r\njuts out a Peninsula or head land, which I have named Knockle Point. West\r\nby South 6 Leagues from this point and about the Middle of the Bay is a\r\nhigh Mountain or Hill standing upon a desart shore, on which account we\r\ncalled it Mount Camel; Latitude 34 degrees 51 minutes; Longitude 186\r\ndegrees 50 minutes. In this Bay we had 24 and 25 fathoms Water, the\r\nbottom good for Anchorage, but their seems to be nothing that can induce\r\nShipping to put into it for no Country upon Earth can look more barren\r\nthan the land about this bay doth. It is in general low, except the\r\nMountain just Mentioned, and the Soil to all appearance nothing but white\r\nsand thrown up in low irregular hills, lying in Narrow ridges parrallel\r\nwith the shore; this occasioned me to name it Sandy Bay.* (* Rangaunu\r\nBay.) The first ridge behind the Sea beach is partly cover'd with Shrubs,\r\nPlants, etc., but the second ridge hath hardly any green thing upon it,\r\nwhich induced me to think that it lies open to the Western Sea.* (* This\r\nis the fact.) As barren as this land appears it is not without\r\ninhabitants. We saw a Village on this Side of Mount Camel and another on\r\nthe Eastern side of the Bay, besides 5 Canoes that were pulling off to\r\nthe Ship, but did not come up with us. At 9 a.m. we tacked and stood to\r\nthe Northward at Noon. Latitude in Per observation 34 degrees 38 minutes.\r\nThe Cavalle Isles bore South-East by East, distant 13 Leagues; the\r\nNorthern Extremity of the land in sight making like an Island bore\r\nNorth-West 1/4 North, distant 9 Leagues, and Mount Camel bore South-West\r\nby South, distant 6 Leagues. Tacked and stood in Shore.\r\n\r\nMonday, 11th. Gentle breezes at North. M.d and pleasant weather. Keept\r\nplying all the day, but got very little to Windward; at Noon was in the\r\nLatitude of 34 degrees 32 minutes South, the Northermost inland set\r\nyesterday at noon bore North-West by West, distant 6 or 7 Leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 12th. Moderate breezes of Wind between the North-West and North\r\nand Smooth Water, yet we gain'd very little in plying to Windward; at\r\nNoon Mount Camel bore South by West 1/4, distant 4 or 5 Leagues. Latitude\r\nobserved 34 degrees 34 minutes South.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 13th. Fore part of P.M., Moderate breezes at North by West and\r\nfair weather; stood in shore until 5 O'Clock, at which time we tack'd and\r\nstood to the North-East being 2 Leagues to the Northward of Mount Camel\r\nand 1 1/2 Mile from shore, and this situation had 22 fathoms water. At 10\r\nit began to blow and rain, which brought us under double Reeft Top sails;\r\nat 12 Tack'd and Stood to the Westward until 7 A.M. when we Tack'd and\r\nstood again to North-East, being at this time about a Mile to windward of\r\nthe place where we tack'd last night. Soon after we Tack'd it came on to\r\nblow very hard at North-North-West with heavy squalls attended with rain,\r\nthis brought us under our Courses and Split the Main Top sail in such a\r\nmanner that it was necessary to unbend it and bring another to the Yard.\r\nAt 10 it fell more moderate and we set the Top sails double reef'd. At\r\nNoon had strong Gales and hazey weather, Tack'd and stood to the\r\nWestward. No land in sight for the first time since we have been upon the\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\nThursday, 14th. Strong Gales at West and West-South-West with Squalls at\r\ntimes attended with Rain. At 1/2 past 3 P.M. Tack'd and stood to the\r\nNorthward. A small Island lying off Knockle point, bore South 1/2 West,\r\ndistant half a League. In the evening brought the Ship under her Courses,\r\nhaving first Split the Fore and Mizen Top sails; at Midnight wore and\r\nStood to the Southward until 5 a.m., then Tack'd and stood to the\r\nNorth-West. At this time saw the land bearing South, distant 8 or 9\r\nLeagues; by this we found we had fell very much to Leeward since\r\nYesterday morning. Set the Top sails close Reeft and the people to dry\r\nand repair the Damaged Sails. At Noon a strong Gale and clear weather,\r\nLatitude observ'd 34 degrees 6 minutes South. Saw land bearing South-West\r\nbeing the same North-Westermost land we have seen before, and which I\r\ntake to be the Northern Extremity of this Country, as we have now a large\r\nswell rowling in from the Westward which could not well be, was we\r\ncovered by any land on that point of the Compass.* (* The Endeavour was\r\nnow to the northward of the north point of New Zealand.)\r\n\r\n[Off North Cape, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 15th. Fresh Gales at South-West, and for the most part clear\r\nweather with a large Swell from the Westward. At 8 P.M. Tack'd and Stood\r\nto the South-East until 8 a.m., and then Tack'd and stood to the Westward\r\nwith as much sail as the Ship could bear. At Noon we were in the Latitude\r\nof 34 degrees 10 minutes South, and Longitude 183 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest, and by Estimation about 15 Leagues from the Land notwithstanding we\r\nused our utmost Endeavours to keep in with it.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 16th. Fresh breezes between the South by West and South-West.\r\nClear weather with a Swell from the Westward. At 6 A.M. saw the land from\r\nthe Mast Head bearing South-South-West. Got Top Gallant Yards up and set\r\nthe Sail, unbent the Foresail to repair and brought another to the Yard.\r\nAt Noon, Latitude observ'd 33 degrees 43 minutes South; Course made since\r\nYesterday Noon North 60 degrees West; distance 56 Miles. The Land in\r\nsight bearing South by West, distant 14 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 17th. A Gentle breeze between the South-West by West and West\r\nwith Clear weather. In standing in Shore sounded several times and had no\r\nground with 90 fathoms of line. At 8 a.m. Tack'd in 108 fathoms 3 or 4\r\nmiles from the Shore, being the same point of Land as we had to the\r\nNorth-West of us before we were blown off. At Noon it bore South-West,\r\ndistant about 3 Miles. Mount Camel bore South by East, distant 11\r\nLeagues, and the Westermost land in sight bore South 75 degrees West;\r\nLatitude observ'd 34 degrees 20 minutes South. The people at work\r\nrepairing the Sails, the most of them having been Split in the late\r\nblowing weather.\r\n\r\nMonday, 18th. Moderate breezes at West and West-North-West and Clear\r\nweather. At 4 p.m. Tack'd and stood in shore, in doing of which we meet\r\nwith a Strong rippling, and the Ship fell fast to leeward, occasioned, as\r\nwe thought, by a Current setting to the Eastward. At 8 Tack'd and stood\r\noff North until 8 a.m., when we Tack'd and stood in, being about 10\r\nLeagues from the Land. At Noon the Point of Land we were near to\r\nyesterday at noon bore South-South-West, distant 5 Leagues. Latitude\r\nobserved 34 degrees 8 minutes South.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 19th. The wind still continues at West. P.M., a moderate breeze\r\nand Clear weather. At 7 Tack'd in 35 fathoms; the point of land before\r\nmentioned bore North-West by North, distant 4 or 5 Miles, having not\r\ngained one inch to windward this last 24 hours, which is a great proof\r\nthat there must be a Current setting to the Eastward.* (* This strong\r\neasterly current is now well known.) The Point of Land above mentioned I\r\nhave called North Cape, judging it to be the Northermost Extremity of\r\nthis Country. It lies in the Latitude of 34 degrees 22 minutes South and\r\nLongitude 186 degrees 55 minutes West from Greenwich,* (* This position\r\nis very correct.) and North 63 degrees West 31 Leagues from Cape Brett;\r\nit forms the North Point of Sandy Bay, and is a peninsula juting out\r\nNorth-East about 2 Miles, and Terminates in a Bluff head which is flatt\r\nat Top. The Isthmus which joins this head to the Mainland is very low, on\r\nwhich account the land off the Cape from several situations makes like an\r\nIsland. It appears still more remarkable when to the Southward of it by\r\nthe appearance of a high round Island at the South-East Point of the\r\nCape; but this is likewise a deception, being a round hill join'd to the\r\nCape by a low, narrow neck of Land; on the South-East side of the Cape\r\nthere appears to be anchorage, and where ships must be covered from\r\nSouth-East and North-West winds. We saw a Hippa or Village upon the Cape\r\nand some few inhabitants. In the night had some Squalls attended with\r\nrain, which obliged us to take another Reef in our Topsails. At 8 a.m.\r\nTack'd and stood in Shore, and being moderate loosed a Reef out of each\r\nTopsail and set the small sails. At noon we were in the Latitude of 34\r\ndegrees 2 minutes South, and being hazey over the land we did not see it.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 20th. P.M., Fresh breezes at West by North, and Clear weather.\r\nAt 6 Tack'd and stood off, North Cape bore South, distant 3 or 4 Miles.\r\nAt 4 a.m. Tack'd and stood in, Wind at West-North-West a fresh breeze,\r\nbut at 9 it increased to a Strong Gale with heavy squalls attended with\r\nThunder and Rain, which brought us under our Courses. At 11 it Cleared up\r\nand the Wind came to West-South-West; we set the Topsails, double Reef'd\r\nand Tack'd and stood to the North-West. At Noon, a Stiff Gale and Clear\r\nweather; Latitude observed 34 degrees 14 minutes South. North Cape\r\nSouth-South-West, distant 3 Leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 21st. Fresh breezes at South-West and clear weather with a\r\nheavy swell first from the West, then from the South-West. At 8 a.m.\r\nloosed the 2nd Reef out of the Topsails; at noon clear weather, no land\r\nin sight. The North Cape bore South 25 degrees East, distant 24 Leagues.\r\nLatitude observed 33 degrees 17 minutes South.\r\n\r\nFriday, 22nd. A moderate Gale at South by West and South-South-West and\r\nCloudy weather. At 8 a.m. got up Top Gallant Yards and set the sails. At\r\nNoon Latitude observ'd 33 degrees 2 minutes South. Course and distant\r\nsince Yesterday at Noon is North 69 1/2 West, 37 Miles. The North Cape\r\nbore South 39 degrees East, distant 38 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 23rd. Gentle breezes between the South by West and South-West,\r\nand Clear settled weather, with a swell from the South-West. Course and\r\ndistance sailed since Yesterday at Noon is South 60 degrees East, 30\r\nMiles. Latitude observed 33 degrees 17 minutes South. North Cape South 36\r\nminutes East, distant 27 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 24th. Light Airs next to a Calm all this 24 Hours. At 7 p.m. saw\r\nthe land from the Mast head bearing South 1/2 East; at 11 a.m. saw it\r\nagain bearing South-South-East, distant 8 Leagues. At Noon Latitude\r\nobserved 33 degrees 48 minutes South.\r\n\r\nMonday, 25th. A Gentle breeze at South-East, the weather a little hazey.\r\nP.M., stood to the South-West. At 4 the land above mentioned bore\r\nSouth-East by South, distant 4 Leagues. It proves to be a small Island,\r\nwhich we take to be the 3 Kings discover'd by Tasman; there are several\r\nSmaller Islands or Rocks lying off the South-West end and one at the\r\nNorth-East end. It lies in the Latitude of 34 degrees 10 minutes South,\r\nand Longitude 187 degrees 45 minutes West and West 14 degrees North, 14\r\nor 15 Leagues from the North Cape. At Midnight Tack'd and stood to the\r\nNorth-East until 6 a.m., then Tack'd and stood to the Southward. At Noon\r\nthe Island of the 3 Kings bore East 8 degrees North, distant 5 or 6\r\nLeagues. Latitude observed 34 degrees 12 minutes South, Longitude in 188\r\ndegrees 5 minutes West; variation per Azimuth taken this morning 11\r\ndegrees 25 minutes East.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 26th. Moderate breezes, Easterly and hazey weather; standing to\r\nthe Southward close upon a wind. At Noon was in the Latitude of 35\r\ndegrees 10 minutes South and Longitude 188 degrees 20 minutes West. The\r\nisland of the 3 Kings North 26 degrees West, distant 22 Leagues. In this\r\nsituation had no land in sight, and yet by observation we are in the\r\nLatitude of the Bay of Islands, and by my reckoning but 30 Leagues to the\r\nWestward of the North Cape, from whence it appears that the Northern part\r\nof this land must be very narrow, otherwise we must have seen some part\r\nof the West side of it.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 27th. Winds at East. P.M., a fresh Gale, with which we stood\r\nto the Southward until 12 at Night, then Tack'd and Stood to the\r\nNorthward. At 4 a.m. the wind began to freshen, and increased in such a\r\nmanner that at 9 we were obliged to bring the Ship too under her\r\nMainsail, it blowing at this time excessive hard with heavy Squalls\r\nattended with rain, and at the same time thick hazey weather. Course made\r\ngood since Yesterday at Noon South-South-West 1/2 West, distance 11\r\nMiles. Latitude in 35 degrees 19 minutes South, Longitude in 188 degrees\r\n29 minutes West. The Island of the 3 Kings, North 27 degrees East,\r\ndistant 77 Miles.\r\n\r\n[Off North End of New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 28th. The Gale continued without the least intermission until 2\r\na.m., when the wind fell a little and began to veer to the Southward and\r\nto the South-West where it fixed at 4, and we made Sail and steer'd East\r\nin for the Land under the Foresail and Mainsail, but was soon obliged to\r\ntake in the latter as it began to blow very hard and increased in such a\r\nmanner that by 8 o'Clock it was a meer Hurricane attended with rain and\r\nthe Sea run prodidgious high. At this time we wore the Ship, hauld up the\r\nTopsail, and brought her too with her head to the North-West under a\r\nReefed Mainsail, but this was scarcely done before the Main Tack gave way\r\nand we were glad to take in the Mainsail and lay too under the Mizen\r\nstaysail and Ballanced Mizen, after which we reefd the Foresail and\r\nfurl'd both it and the Mainsail. At Noon the Gale was a little abated,\r\nbut had still heavy squalls attended with rain. Our Course made good\r\nto-day is North, a little Easterly, 29 miles; Latitude in per Account 34\r\ndegrees 50 minutes South; Longitude in 188 degrees 27 minutes West; the 3\r\nKings North 41 East; distant 52 Miles.\r\n\r\nFriday, 29th. Winds at South-West and South-West by West. A very hard\r\nGale with Squalls but mostly fair weather. At 7 p.m. wore and lay on the\r\nother Tack. At 6 a.m. loosed the Reef out of the Foresail and Set it and\r\nthe Reefd Mainsail. At 11 unbent both Foresail and Mainsail to repair,\r\nand bent others and made Sail under them. At Noon Latitude observed 34\r\ndegrees 45 minutes South. Course and distance saild since yesterday East\r\nby North 29 miles.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 30th. Winds at South-West. P.M., hard Gales with some Squalls\r\nattended with rain. A.M., more moderate and fair. At 8 p.m. wore and\r\nstood to the North-West until 5 a.m., then wore and stood to the\r\nSouth-East and being pretty moderate we set the Topsails close Reef'd,\r\nbut the South-West Sea runs so high that the Ship goes Bodily to leeward.\r\nAt 6 saw the land bearing North-East distant about 6 Leagues which we\r\njudge to be the same as Tasman calls Cape Maria Van Dieman; at Noon it\r\nbore North-North-East 1/2 East and we could see the land extend to the\r\nEast and Southward as far as South-East by East. Our Latitude by\r\nobservation 34 degrees 50 minutes South.\r\n\r\nSunday, 31st. Fresh gales at South-West and South-West by South\r\naccompanied by a large Sea from the same Quarter. At 1 p.m. Tack'd and\r\nStood to the North-West until 8, then stood to the South-East. At this\r\ntime the Island of the 3 Kings bore North-West by West, distant 11\r\nLeagues, and Cape Maria Van Diemen North by East. At Midnight wore and\r\nStood to the North-West until 4 a.m., then wore and Stood to the\r\nSouth-East; at Noon our Latitude by observation was 34 degrees 42 minutes\r\nSouth. The land of Cape Maria Van Diemen bore North-East by North distant\r\nabout 5 Leagues.\r\n\r\n1770.\r\n\r\n[January 1770.]\r\n\r\nMonday, January 1st. P.M., fresh breezes at South-West by South and\r\nSqually, the remainder moderate breezes at South-West by South and\r\nSouth-West clear weather. At 7 p.m. Tack'd and stood to the Westward. At\r\nthis time Mount Camel bore North 83 degrees East and the Northermost land\r\nor Cape Maria Van Diemen North by West, being distant from the Nearest\r\nShore 3 Leagues; in this situation had 40 fathoms Water.\r\n\r\nNOTE. Mount Camel doth not appear to lay little more than a Mile from the\r\nSea on this Side* (* It is, in fact, about six miles, but the coast in\r\nfront is so low that the mistake in estimation is very natural.) and\r\nabout the same distance on the other, so that the land here cannot be\r\nabove 2 or 3 Miles broad from Sea to Sea, which is what I computed when\r\nwe were in Sandy Bay on the other side of the Coast. At 6 a.m. Tack'd and\r\nStood to the Eastward, the Island of the 3 Kings North-West by North. At\r\nNoon Tack'd again and stood to the Westward, being in the Latitude of 34\r\ndegrees 37 minutes South; the Island of the 3 Kings bore North-West by\r\nNorth, distant 10 or 11 Leagues; and Cape Maria Van Diemen North 31 East,\r\ndistant 4 1/2 Leagues; in this situation had 54 fathoms. I cannot help\r\nthinking but what it will appear a little strange that at this season of\r\nthe Year we should be 3 Weeks in getting 10 Leagues to the Westward and 5\r\nWeeks in getting 50 Leagues, for so long it is since we pass'd Cape\r\nBrett; but it will hardly be credited that in the midst of Summer and in\r\nthe Latitude of 35 degrees South such a Gale of wind as we have had could\r\nhave hapned which for its Strength and Continuance was such as I hardly\r\nwas ever in before. Fortunately at this time we were a good distance from\r\nland, otherwise it would have proved fatal to us.* (* The north point of\r\nNew Zealand is celebrated for bad weather.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 2nd. Fresh breezes at South-South-West and West accompanied with\r\na rowling Sea from the South-West. At 5 p.m. the wind Veering to the\r\nWestward we Tack'd and Stood to the Southward. At this time the North\r\nCape bore East 3/4 North and was just open of a point that lies 3 Leagues\r\nWest by South from it, being now well assured that it is the Northermost\r\nExtremity of this Country and is the East point of a Peninsula which\r\nStretches out North-West and North-West by North 17 or 18 Leagues, and as\r\nI have before observed is for the most part low and narrow except its\r\nExtremity where the land is Tollerable high and Extends 4 or 5 Leagues\r\nevery way. Cape Maria Van Diemen is the West point of the Peninsula and\r\nlies in the Latitude of 34 degrees 30 minutes South; Longitude 187\r\ndegrees 18 minutes West from Greenwich.* (* This is extraordinarily\r\naccurate, seeing that the ship was never close to the Cape, and the\r\nobservations were all taken in bad weather. The latitude is exact, and\r\nthe longitude is only three miles in error. The persistence with which\r\nCook clung to this point until he could resume his exploration and\r\nexamination of the coast is very characteristic of the man. He would not\r\nwillingly miss a mile of it, nor did he.) From this Cape the Land Trends\r\naway South-East by South and South-East to and beyond Mount Camel, and is\r\neverywhere a barren shore affording no better prospect than what ariseth\r\nfrom white sand Banks. At 1/2 past 7 p.m. the Island of the 3 Kings bore\r\nNorth-West by North and Cape Maria Van Diemen North-East by East, distant\r\n4 Leagues. At 5 a.m. Cape Maria Van Diemen bore North-North-East 1/2 East\r\nand Mount Camel East. At Noon was in the Latitude of 35 degrees 17\r\nminutes and Cape Maria Van Diemen by judgment bore North distant 16\r\nLeagues; having no land in sight, not daring to go near it as the wind\r\nblow'd fresh right on shore and a high rowling Sea from the Same Quarter,\r\nand knowing that there was no Harbour that we could put into in case we\r\nwere Caught upon a lee shore.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 3rd. Winds at West-South-West and South-West; a fresh breeze\r\nand Squally, the remainder moderate with frequent Squalls attended with\r\nrain. In the evening shortned Sail and at Midnight Tack'd and made a Trip\r\nto the North-West until 2 a.m., then wore and stood to the Southward. At\r\ndaylight made Sail and Edged away in order to make the Land; at 10 saw it\r\nbearing North-East and appeared to be high land; at Noon it extended from\r\nNorth to East-North-East distant, by Estimation, 8 or 10 Leagues, and\r\nCape Maria Van Diemen bore North 2 degrees 30 minutes West, distant 33\r\nLeagues. Our Latitude by observation was 36 degrees 2 minutes South. A\r\nhigh rowling swell from the South-West.\r\n\r\n[Off Kaipara Harbour, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 4th. Winds at South-West and South-West by South; mostly a\r\nfresh Gale accompanied with a rowling sea from the same Quarter. Being\r\ndesirous of taking as near a View of the coast as we could with safety we\r\nkeept Edging in for it until 7 o'Clock p.m., being at this time 6 Leagues\r\nfrom the Land. We then hauld our wind to South-East and keept on that\r\nCourse close upon the wind all night, sounding several times but had no\r\nground with 100 and 110 fathoms. At 8 o'Clock a.m. was about 5 Leagues\r\nfrom the Land and a place which lies in the Latitude of 36 degrees 25\r\nminutes that had the Appearance of a Bay or inlet bore East.* (* This was\r\nKaipara Harbour, although, on a closer inspection, Cook thought he had\r\nbeen deceived. It is the largest harbour on this part of the coast. The\r\ntown of Helensville stands on one of its arms.) In order to see more of\r\nthis place we kept on our Course until 11 o'Clock when we were not above\r\n3 Leagues from it, and then found that it was neither a Bay nor inlet,\r\nbut low land bounded on each side by higher lands which caused the\r\ndeception. At this time we Tack'd and stood to the North-West. At Noon we\r\nwere between 3 and 4 Leagues from the Land and in the Latitude of 36\r\ndegrees 31 minutes and Longitude 185 degrees 50 minutes West. Cape Maria\r\nVan Diemen bore North 25 West, distant 44 1/2 Leagues. From this I form\r\nmy judgment of the direction of this Coast, which is nearly\r\nSouth-South-East 3/4 East and North-North-West 3/4 West, and must be\r\nnearly a Strait Shore. In about the Latitude 35 degrees 45 minutes is\r\nsome high land adjoining to the Sea; to the Southward of that the land is\r\nof a moderate heigth, and wears a most desolate and inhospitable aspect.\r\nNothing is to be seen but long sand Hills, with hardly any Green thing\r\nupon them, and the great Sea which the prevailing Westerly winds impell\r\nupon the Shore must render this a very Dangerous Coast. This I am so\r\nfully sencible of, that was we once clear of it I am determined not to\r\ncome so near Again, if I can possible avoid it, unless we have a very\r\nfavourable wind indeed.* (* The mingled audacity and caution of Cook's\r\nnavigation off this coast must awake the admiration of every seaman.)\r\n\r\nFriday, 5th. Fresh gales at South-West with frequent Squalls attended\r\nwith rain. The South-West swell still keeping up we stood to the\r\nNorth-West all this day with a prest Sail in order to get an Offing. At\r\nNoon True Course made good North 38 West, distance 102 Miles. Latitude in\r\nper Observation 35 degrees 10 minutes South. Cape Maria Van Diemen bore\r\nNorth 10 degrees East; distant 41 Miles.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 6th. First part a fresh breeze at South-West by South; in the\r\nnight had it at South. A.M., light Airs from the Southward next to a\r\nCalm, and Clear weather. Course made good to-day is North 76 West;\r\ndistance 8 Miles; Latitude per Observation 35 degrees 8 minutes South.\r\n\r\nSunday, 7th. Variable light Airs and Sometimes Calm with Clear pleasant\r\nweather. At daylight saw the land which we took to be Cape Maria Van\r\nDiemen bearing North-North-East, distant 8 or 9 Leagues. At Noon Latitude\r\nin per Observation 35 degrees 0 minutes South. Cape Maria Van Diemen bore\r\nNorth, distant 11 Leagues.\r\n\r\nMonday, 8th. Gentle breezes at North-East and pleasant weather. At 6 p.m.\r\nsaw the land bearing East, and sometime after saw a Turtle upon the\r\nWater. At Noon the land Extending from North to East, distant 5 or 6\r\nLeagues, being the high land before mentioned and which it intersected in\r\n2 places each having the appearance of a Bay or inlet, but I believe it\r\nis only low land.* (* These were Hokianga and False Hokianga.) Course and\r\ndistance made good since Yesterday at Noon is South 33 East, 53 miles.\r\nLatitude per Observation 35 degrees 45 minutes South. Cape Maria Van\r\nDiemen North 25 West, distant 30 Leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 9th. Gentle breezes between the North-East and North-West,\r\nCloudy weather sailing along shore within sight of Land at Noon. Course\r\nand distance Sailed South 37 East, 69 Miles. Latitude in per Observation\r\n36 degrees 39 minutes South; the place we were abreast of the 4th\r\nInstant, which we at first took for a Bay or Inlet* (* Kaipara.) bore\r\nNorth-East by North, distant 5 1/2 Leagues, and Cape Maria Van Diemen\r\nbore North 29 West, distant 47 Leagues.\r\n\r\n[Off Kawhia Harbour, North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 10th. Winds at North-North-East and North, the first part a\r\nGentle breeze, the remainder a fresh breeze and Cloudy with rain towards\r\nNoon. Continued a South-East Course until' 8 o'Clock p.m. at which time\r\nwe had run 7 Leagues since Noon, and were between 3 and 4 Leagues from\r\nthe Land which appear'd to be low and Sandy such as I have before\r\nDiscribed, and we then steer'd South-East by East in a Parrallel\r\ndirection with the Coast, our Depth of Water from 48 to 34 fathoms; a\r\nblack sandy bottom; at daylight found ourselves between 2 and 3 Leagues\r\nfrom the land which was of a Moderate height and Cloathed with Wood and\r\nVerdure. At 7 o'Clock steer'd South by East and afterwards South by West,\r\nthe land laying in that direction; at 9 was abreast of a Point of Land\r\nwhich rises sloping from the Sea to a Considerable height; it lies in the\r\nLatitude of 37 degrees 43 minutes South; I named it Woodyhead. South-West\r\n1/2 West 11 Miles from this Head is a very small Island which we named\r\nGannet Island, on account of the Great Number of these Birds we saw upon\r\nit. At Noon a high Craggy point bore East-North-East, distance 1 1/2\r\nLeagues; this point I have named Albetross Point; it lies in the Latitude\r\nof 38 degrees 4 minutes South, and Longitude 184 degrees 42 minutes West,\r\nand from Woodyhead South 17 minutes West 7 Leagues. On the North side of\r\nit the shore forms a Bay wherein there appears to be anchorage and\r\nShelter for Shipping against Southerly Winds;* (* Kawhia Harbour. There\r\nis a settlement here.) our Course and distance saild since Yesterday at\r\nNoon is South 37 East, distance 69 Miles. Cape Maria Van Diemen bore\r\nNorth 30 West, distant 82 Leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 11th. At 1/2 past Noon the wind Shifted at Once from\r\nNorth-North-East to South-South-West with which we stood to the Westward\r\nuntil 4 p.m., then Tack'd and stood on Shore until' 7, when we again\r\nstood to the Westward having but little wind. At this Time Albetross\r\nPoint bore North-East, distant near 2 Leagues, and the Southermost land\r\nin sight bore South-South-West 1/2 West being a very high Mountain and\r\nmade very much like the Peak of Teneriff; in this Situation had 30\r\nfathoms Water; had little wind all night; at 4 a.m. Tacked and stood in\r\nShore, but it soon after fell Calm and being in 42 fathoms Water; the\r\nPeople caught about 10 or 12 Bream. At 11 a light breeze sprung up from\r\nthe Westward and we made Sail to the Southward. At Noon was by\r\nObservation in the Latitude of 38 degrees 4 minutes South; Albetross\r\nPoint bore due East, distant 5 or 6 Leagues.\r\n\r\nFriday, 12th. Gentle breezes from between the North-West and\r\nNorth-North-East; Fore and Middle part Clear Weather; the Latter part\r\ndark and Cloudy; steering along shore South by West and South-South-West\r\nat the distance of 4 Leagues off. At 7 p.m. saw the top of the Peaked\r\nMountain to the Southward above the Clouds bearing from us South; at the\r\nsame time the Southermost land we had in Sight bore South by West. Took\r\nseveral Azimuths both in the Evening and the Morning which gave the\r\nVariation 14 degrees 15 minutes Easterly. At Noon had the winds very\r\nVariable with dark cloudy weather attended with excessive heavy Showers\r\nof rain; at this time we were about 3 Leagues from the Shore which lies\r\nunder the Peaked Mountain before mentioned. This Peak we did not see, it\r\nbeing hid in the Clouds, but judged it to bear about South-South-East,\r\nand some very remarkable peaked Islands, lying under the Shore, bore\r\nEast-South-East, distant 3 or 4 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 13th. Winds Variable. P.M., Cloudy weather. At 7 o'Clock\r\nsounded and had 42 fathoms water, being distant from the Shore between 2\r\nand 3 Leagues and the Peaked Mountain as near as I could judge bore East.\r\nAfter it was Dark saw a fire upon the Shore, a sure sign that the Country\r\nis inhabited. In the night had some Thunder, Lightning, and Rain; at 5\r\na.m. saw for a few Minutes the Top of the Peaked Mountain above the\r\nClouds bearing North-East. It is of a prodidgious height and its Top is\r\ncover'd with Everlasting Snow; it lies in the Latitude of 39 degrees 16\r\nminutes South, and in the Longitude of 185 degrees 15 minutes West. I\r\nhave named it Mount Egmont in honour of the Earl of Egmont.* (* The Earl\r\nof Egmont was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1763 to 1766. Mount Egmont\r\nis a magnificent conical mountain, surrounded on three sides by the sea,\r\nfrom which it rises to a height of 8300 feet.) This mountain seems to\r\nhave a pretty large base and to rise with a Gradual Ascent to the Peak,\r\nand what makes it more Conspicuous is its being situated near the Sea and\r\nin the Midst of a flat Country which afforded a very good Aspect, being\r\nCloathed with Woods and Verdure. The shore under the foot of this\r\nMountain forms a large Cape which I have named Cape Egmont; it lies\r\nSouth-South-West 1/2 West, 27 Leagues from Albetross Point. On the\r\nNorth-East side of the Cape lay 2 Small Islands near to a very remarkable\r\nPoint of the Main that riseth to a good height in the very form of a\r\nSugar Loaf. To the Southward of the Cape the Land tends away South-East\r\nby East and East-South-East, and seems to be every where a bold shore. At\r\nNoon had variable light Airs and Clear weather. Latitude observ'd 39\r\ndegrees 32 minutes South. Cape Egmont bore about North-East, and we were\r\nabout 4 Leagues from the Shore in that direction; in this situation had\r\n40 fathoms Water.\r\n\r\n[In North Part of Cook's Strait.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 14th. P.M., had a Gentle Breeze at West. In the evening came to\r\nNorth-West by West and Continued so all night and blow'd a fresh breeze;\r\nwe steer'd along shore East-South-East and South-East by East, keeping\r\nbetween 2 and 3 Leagues off. At 1/2 past 7 p.m. Saw for a few Minutes\r\nMount Egmont which bore from us North 17 West, distant 10 Leagues. At 5\r\na.m. Steer'd South-East by South the land inclining more Southerly, but\r\nhalf an hour after we saw land bearing South-West by South which we hauld\r\nup for.* (* The north end of the South Island, New Zealand.) At this time\r\nthe weather was squally attended with showers of rain. At noon had a\r\nSteady fresh breeze at West by North and Cloudy weather; the South-West\r\nExtremity of the Land in sight bore South 63 degrees West and some high\r\nland, which makes like an Island lying under the Main, bore\r\nSouth-South-East, distant 5 Leagues. The bottom of the Bay* (* This was\r\nthe Northern part of Cook's Strait, but it was thought at the time to be\r\na bay.) we are now in, and which bears from us South we cannot see,\r\naltho' it is very Clear in that Quarter. Our Latitude by Observation is\r\n40 degrees 27 minutes South, Longitude 184 degrees 39 minutes West.* (*\r\nThe western side of the North Island, which Cook took such trouble to\r\nfollow, is 400 miles long, and is a most dangerous coast to explore, on\r\naccount of the winds being mostly on shore. This prevented him from\r\ngetting very close; and he missed the entrances to several harbours, such\r\nas the Manukau, the Waikato River, Whaingaroa, and others. No canoes were\r\nseen, as the coast is not favourable for such craft.)\r\n\r\nMonday, 15th. Fore and Middle parts, fresh breezes between the West and\r\nNorth-West and fair weather. At 8 p.m. we were within 2 Leagues of the\r\nLand, we discover'd in the morning, having run 10 Leagues since Noon; the\r\nland seen then bearing South 63 degrees West bore now North 59 degrees\r\nWest, distant 7 or 8 Leagues and makes like an Island. Between this land\r\nor Island and Cape Egmont is a very broad and Deep Bay or inlet the\r\nSouth-West side of which we are now upon, and here the Land is of a\r\nConsiderable height, distinguished by Hills and Valleys, and the Shore\r\nseems to form several Bays, into one of which I intend to go with the\r\nShip in order to Careen her (she being very foul) and to repair some few\r\ndefects, recruit our Stock of Wood, Water, etc. With this View we Keept\r\nplying on and off all Night, having from 80 to 63 fathoms Water; at\r\ndaylight stood in for an inlet which runs in South-West.* (* Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound, in the north-east part of the Middle Island.) At 8\r\na.m. we were got within the Entrance which may be known by a Reef of\r\nRocks stretching off from the North-West point, and some rocky Islands\r\nlying off the South-East point. At 9 o'clock being little wind and\r\nVariable we were carried by the Tide or Current within 2 Cables length of\r\nthe North-West Shore where we had 54 fathoms, but with the help of our\r\nBoats we got Clear, at this time we saw rise up twice near the Ship a Sea\r\nLyon, the Head of which was Exactly like the head of the Male one\r\ndescribed by Lord Anson. We likewise saw a Canoe with some of the Natives\r\ncross the Bay, and a Village situated upon a point of an Island, which\r\nlies 7 or 8 miles with the Entrance. At Noon we were the length of this\r\nIsland, and being little wind had the Boats ahead Towing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. EXPLORATION OF MIDDLE ISLAND OF NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\n[January 1770. In Queen Charlotte's Sound, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, 16th. Variable light Airs and Clear settled weather. At 1 p.m.\r\nhauled close round the South-West end of the Island, on which stands the\r\nVillage before mention'd, the inhabitants of which were all in Arms. At 2\r\no'Clock we anchor'd in a very Snug Cove,* (* Ship Cove, in Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound.) which is on the North-West side of the Bay facing the\r\nSouth-West end of the Island in 11 fathoms; soft Ground, and moor'd with\r\nthe Stream Anchor. By this time several of the Natives had come off to\r\nthe Ship in their Canoes, and after heaving a few stones at us and having\r\nsome Conversation with Tupia, some of them Ventur'd on board, where they\r\nmade but a very short stay before they went into their Canoes again, and\r\nsoon after left us altogether. I then went ashore in the bottom of the\r\nCove, accompanied by most of the Gentlemen on board. We found a fine\r\nStream of Excellent Water, and as to wood the land is here one intire\r\nforest. Having the Sean with us we made a few hauls and caught 300 pounds\r\nweight of different sorts of fish, which were equally distributed to the\r\nShip's Company. A.M., Careen'd the Ship, scrubb'd and pay'd the Larboard\r\nside. Several of the Natives Visited us this Morning, and brought with\r\nthem some stinking fish, which, however, I order'd to be bought up to\r\nencourage them in this kind of Traffick, but Trade at this time seem'd\r\nnot to be their Object, but were more inclinable to Quarrel, and as the\r\nShip was upon the Carreen I thought they might give us some Trouble, and\r\nperhaps hurt some of our people that were in the Boats alongside. For\r\nthis reason I fir'd some small shott at one of the first Offenders; this\r\nmade them keep at a proper distance while they stay'd, which was not long\r\nbefore they all went away. These people declared to us this morning, that\r\nthey never either saw or heard of a Ship like ours being upon this Coast\r\nbefore. From this it appears that they have no Tradition among them of\r\nTasman being here, for I believe Murtherers bay, the place where he\r\nanchor'd, not to be far from this place;* (* Tasman's Massacre Bay lies\r\n70 miles to the West-North-West.) but this cannot be it from the\r\nLatitude, for I find by an Observation made this day at Noon that we are\r\nat an Anchor in 41 degrees 5 minutes 32 seconds South, which is 15 miles\r\nto the Southward of Murtherers Bay.* (* The bay in Queen Charlotte's\r\nSound in which the Endeavour anchored, Ship Cove, lies 7 miles within the\r\nentrance on the western shore.)\r\n\r\nWednesday, 17th. Light Airs, Calm and pleasant weather. P.M., righted\r\nship and got the other Side ready for heeling out, and in the Evening\r\nHaul'd the Sean and caught a few fish. While this was doing some of us\r\nwent in the pinnace into another Cove, not far from where the Ship lays;\r\nin going thither we meet with a Woman floating upon the Water, who to all\r\nappearance had not been dead many days. Soon after we landed we meet with\r\n2 or 3 of the Natives who not long before must have been regaling\r\nthemselves upon human flesh, for I got from one of them the bone of the\r\nFore arm of a Man or Woman which was quite fresh, and the flesh had been\r\nbut lately picked off, which they told us they had eat; they gave us to\r\nunderstand that but a few days before they had taken, Kill'd, and Eat a\r\nBoats Crew of their Enemies or strangers, for I believe they look upon\r\nall strangers as Enemies. From what we could learn the woman we had seen\r\nfloating upon the Water was in this Boat and had been drowned in the\r\nfray. There was not one of us that had the least doubt but what these\r\npeople were cannibals; but the finding this bone with part of the sinews\r\nfresh upon it was a stronger proof than any we had yet met with, and, in\r\norder to be fully satisfied of the truth of what they had told us, we\r\ntold one of them that it was not the bone of a man, but that of a dog;\r\nbut he, with great fervency, took hold of his Fore Arm, and told us again\r\nthat it was that bone: and to convince us that they had eat the flesh he\r\ntook hold of the flesh of his own Arm with his teeth and made Signs of\r\nEating. A.M., Careen'd, Scrub'd, and pay'd the Starboard side of the\r\nShip; while this was doing some of the Natives came alongside seemingly\r\nonly to look at us. There was a woman among them who had her Arms,\r\nthighs, and Legs cut in several place's; this was done by way of Mourning\r\nfor her Husband who had very lately been Kill'd and Eat by some of their\r\nEnemies as they told us and pointed towards' the place where it was done,\r\nwhich lay somewhere to the Eastward. Mr. Banks got from one of them a\r\nBone of the fore Arm, much in the same state as the one before mentioned;\r\nand to show us that they eat the flesh, they bit and Naw'd the bone and\r\ndraw'd it through their Mouths, and this in such a manner as plainly\r\nShew'd that the flesh to them was a Dainty Bit.\r\n\r\nThursday, 18th. Winds mostly from the South-West; a gentle breeze and\r\nClear settled weather. P.M., righted the Ship and sent on shore all or\r\nmost of our empty Casks, and in the Morning the Coopers went about\r\nTrimming them, and the Carpenters went to work to Caulk the sides and to\r\nrepair other defects in the Ship, while the seamen are Employ'd in the\r\nhold Cutting Wood, etc., etc. I made a little Excursion in the pinnace in\r\norder to take a View of the Bay, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr.\r\nSolander. We met with nothing remarkable, and as we were on the West side\r\nof the Bay where the land is so closely cover'd with wood that we could\r\nnot penetrate into the country.\r\n\r\nFriday, 19th. Winds and weather as yesterday, and the employment of the\r\npeople the same. In the P.M. some of our people found in the Skirts of\r\nthe Wood 3 hip Bones of Men; they lay near to a Hole or Oven, that is a\r\nplace where the Natives dress their Victuals; this Circumstance, trifling\r\nas it is, is still a further proof that these people eat human flesh. In\r\nthe A.M. set up the Forge to repair the Braces of the Tiller and such\r\nother Iron work as was wanting. The Natives came alongside and sold us a\r\nquantity of large Mackrell for Nails, pieces of Cloth and paper, and in\r\nthis Traffick they never once attempted to defraud us of any one thing\r\nbut dealt as fair as people could do.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 20th. Winds Southerly and fair, pleasant weather. Employ'd\r\nwooding, Watering, etc., and in the A.M. sent part of the Powder ashore\r\nto be Air'd. Some of the Natives brought alongside in one of their Canoes\r\n4 of the heads of the Men they had lately kill'd; both the Hairy Scalps\r\nand Skin of the faces were on. Mr. Banks bought one of the 4, but they\r\nwould not part with any of the other on any account whatever. The one Mr.\r\nBanks got had received a blow on the Temple that had broke the Skull.\r\nThis morning I set out in the Pinnace accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr.\r\nSolander, in order to Survey the West Coast of the Bay; we took our rout\r\ntowards the head of the Bay, but it was near noon before we had got\r\nbeyond the place we had been before.\r\n\r\nSunday, 21st. P.M., a Gentle breeze of Wind Southerly, the remainder\r\nlight Airs and Calm with clear, settled weather. P.M., the people\r\nemploy'd as usual, and at 8 o'Clock we return'd on board the Pinnace from\r\nsurveying the bay, in the doing of which I met with an Excellent Harbour,\r\nbut saw no inhabitants or any Cultivated land. In the A.M. after hauling\r\nthe Sean for fish, I gave every body leave to go ashore at the Watering\r\nplace to amuse themselves as they thought proper.\r\n\r\nMonday, 22nd. P.M., and in the night had variable light Airs and Calms.\r\nA.M., had a fresh breeze Southerly and Cloudy weather. In the morning the\r\npeople were set about the necessary business of the Ship, and I set out\r\nin the Pinnace accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with a view of\r\nexamining the head of the inlet, but after rowing between 4 and 5 Leagues\r\nup it, and finding no probability of reaching it, or even seeing the\r\nend,* (* The head of Queen Charlotte's Sound is 20 miles from where the\r\nEndeavour was lying.) the wind being against us and the day already half\r\nspent; we landed at Noon on the South-East side in order to try to get\r\nupon one of the Hills, to view the inlet from thence.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 23rd. P.M., Winds Southerly, a fresh breeze. Agreeable to what\r\nis mentioned above I took one hand with me and Climbed up to the Top of\r\none of the Hills, but when I came there I was hindered from seeing up the\r\ninlet by higher hills, which I could not come at for impenetrable woods,\r\nbut I was abundantly recompensed for the trouble I had in assending the\r\nHill, for from it I saw what I took to be the Eastern Sea, and a Strait\r\nor passage from it into the Western Sea; a little to the Eastward of the\r\nEntrance of the inlet in which we now lay with the Ship. The Main land\r\nwhich lies on the South-East side of this inlet appeared to me to be a\r\nnarrow ridge of very high hills, and to form a part of the South-West\r\nside of the Strait;* (* Cook's Strait, which divides the two islands of\r\nNew Zealand.) the land on the opposite side seem'd to tend away East, as\r\nfar as the Eye could see. To the South-East appeared an Open Sea, and\r\nthis I took to be the Eastern. I likewise saw some Islands lying on the\r\nEast side of the inlet, which before I had taken to be a part of the main\r\nland. As soon as I had desended the hill and we had refreshed ourselves,\r\nwe set out in order to return to the Ship, and in our way passed through\r\nand Examin'd the Harbours, Coves, etc., that lay behind the Islands above\r\nmentioned. In this rout we met with an old Village in which were a good\r\nmany Houses, but no Body had lived in them lately; we likewise saw\r\nanother that was inhabited, but the day being so far spent, that we had\r\nnot time to go to it, but made the best of our way to the Ship, which we\r\nreached between 8 and 9 o'Clock. In the night had much rain with Cloudy,\r\nHazey weather, which continued by intervals until Noon.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 24th. P.M., had a fresh breeze southerly and cloudy weather.\r\nAfter dinner I employ'd myself in carrying on the survey of the place,\r\nand upon one of the Islands where I landed were a number of houses but no\r\ninhabitants, neither had any been there lately. In the morning the Gunner\r\nwas sent ashore with the remainder of the powder to-day, and the Long\r\nboat was sent with a Gang of hands to one of the Islands to cut Grass for\r\nour Sheep, and the rest of the people were employ'd about the usual work\r\nof the Ship. This forenoon some of us visited the Hippa which is situated\r\non the point of the Island mentioned on our first arrival;* (* Motuara.)\r\nthe inhabitants of this place shew'd not the least dislike at our coming,\r\nbut, on the contrary, with a great deal of seeming good nature shew'd us\r\nall over the place. We found among them some human bones, the flesh of\r\nwhich they told us they had eat; they likewise informed us that there was\r\nno passage into the Sea thro' this inlet, as I had imagined their was,\r\nbecause above where I was in the Boat it turn'd away to the Westward.\r\nLeaving these people, we Travelled to the other end of the Island, and\r\nthere took Water and Crossed over upon the Main, where we met with\r\nseveral Houses that were at present, or had very lately been, inhabited,\r\nbut we saw but very few of the inhabitants, and these were in their Boats\r\nfishing; after Viewing this place we returned on board to Dinner.\r\n\r\nThursday, 25th. Winds at North West, a Gentle breeze and fair weather.\r\nP.M. the Long boat having return'd with a Load of Grass, she was employ'd\r\nbringing on board Wood and Water, and the Caulkers having finished\r\nCaulking the Ship's sides (a thing they have been employ'd upon ever\r\nsince we came here), they were pay'd with Tar. Early in the A.M. the Long\r\nboat was sent again for Grass, and return'd at Noon with a Load.\r\n\r\nFriday, 26th. Gentle breezes and pleasant weather. In the P.M. I made a\r\nlittle Excursion in the pinnace along shore towards the Mouth of the\r\ninlet, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We found in a small\r\nCove several of the Natives, of whom we purchased a quantity of fresh\r\nfish; and upon our return to the Ship found that the Sean had been\r\nequally as Successfull, which we generally haul morning and evening, and\r\nseldom fail of getting fish sufficient for all hands. In the A.M. I made\r\nan Excursion into one of the Bays which lye on the East side of the\r\ninlet, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. Upon our landing we\r\nassended a very high hill, from which we had a full View of the passage I\r\nhad before discovered, and the land on the opposite shore, which appeared\r\nto be about 4 Leagues from us; but as it was hazey near the Horizon we\r\ncould not see far to the South-East. However, I had now seen enough of\r\nthis passage to Convince me that there was the Greatest probability in\r\nthe World of its running into the Eastern Sea, as the distance of that\r\nSea from this place cannot Exceed 20 Leagues even to where we where. Upon\r\nthis I resolved after putting to Sea to Search this passage with the\r\nShip. We found on the Top of the Hill a parcel of loose stones, of which\r\nwe built a Pyramid, and left in it some Musquet balls, small Shott,\r\nbeads, and whatever we had about us that was likely to stand the test of\r\nTime; after this we descended the hill, and found along with Tupia and\r\nthe boat's Crew several of the Natives, setting in the most free and\r\nfriendly manner imaginable. Tupia always accompanies us in every\r\nExcursion we make, and proves of infinate Service. In our return to the\r\nShip we visited the Hippa we had seen on Tuesday last, which is situated\r\non a small Island, or rather a Rock. The inhabitants of this place\r\ninvited us ashore with their usual Marks of Friendship, and shew'd us all\r\nover the place; which indeed was soon done, for it was very small, yet it\r\ncontain'd a good number of people, and they had in it, Split and hanging\r\nup to dry, a prodidgious quantity of various sorts of small fish, a part\r\nof which they sold to us for such Trifles as we had about us.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 27th. Fresh gales, Westerly. This day we got the Tiller\r\nproperly secured, which hath been the Employment of the Armourers and\r\npart of the Carpenters since we Anchor'd at this place; the former in\r\nrepairing and making new Iron work, and the Latter in fixing a Transom,*\r\n(* A transom is a curved piece of wood which supports the end of the\r\ntiller.) for the want of which the Tiller has often been in danger of\r\nbeing broke; the Iron braces that supply'd the want of a Transom have\r\nbroke every time they have been repair'd. Coopers still employ'd\r\nrepairing the Casks; some hands with the Long boat getting on board\r\nStones to put into the bottom of the bread room to bring the Ship more by\r\nthe Stern; while others were employ'd cutting wood, repairing the\r\nrigging, and fishing.\r\n\r\nSunday, 28th. Strong Gales westerly. P.M. fair and Cloudy, the remainder\r\nthick, hazey weather, with much rain.\r\n\r\nMonday, 29th. Winds as yesterday. P.M. rainy weather, the remainder fair\r\nand Cloudy. Pretty early in the A.M. an old man, who had made us several\r\nvisits upon our first Arrival here, came on board, and told us that one\r\nof our boats had fir'd upon and wounded 2 of their people, one of which\r\nwas dead of his wounds. This affair hapned on Sunday was a week, and\r\nnever before now came to my Knowledge; on that day the Master and 5 Petty\r\nofficers desir'd to have a small boat to go a fishing; but instead of\r\nKeeping within the usual bounds and under the protection of the Ship,\r\nthey went over to the Hippa on the Island, from which some of the\r\ninhabitants put off in 2 Canoes, as they thought to attack them; this\r\nCaused the Master to fire, and, according to the report of the old Man,\r\nwounded 2, one of which is since dead; but this last circumstance was\r\nsoon after contradicted by another of the Natives, who Mr. Green and\r\nTupia saw ashore, and I wish this last report may be true, because I find\r\nthe reasons for firing upon them are not very Justifiable. This morning I\r\nwent out to the Mouth of the Inlet and landed upon the West point, and\r\nfrom the Top of a pretty high hill which is there I had a view of this\r\nCoast to the North-West. The farthest land I could see in that Quarter\r\nwas an Island* (* Stephens Island. Cape Stephens, off which it lies,\r\nforms the western termination of the strait, Cook's, between the two\r\nislands of New Zealand. The Coast between this and Cape Jackson, where\r\nCook was standing, is thickly indented with inlets of great extent. The\r\ntwo Capes were named after the Secretaries of the Admiralty.) about 10\r\nLeagues off, and lying pretty near the Main, and is the same as hath been\r\nbefore mentioned. Between this Island and the place where I was lay some\r\nother Islands close under the Shore, which forms several Bays, where\r\nthere appears to be safe Anchorage for Shipping. After I had set the\r\ndifferent points, etc., we Erected upon the Top of the Hill a Tower or\r\nPile of Stones, in which we left a Piece of Silver Coin, some Musquet\r\nBalls, Beads, etc., and left flying upon it a piece of an old Pendant.\r\nAfter this we return'd to the Boat, and in our way to the Ship visited\r\nsome of the Natives we met with along shore, and purchased of them a\r\nsmall quantity of fish.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 30th. Winds at North-West, Gentle breezes, and fair weather.\r\nEarly in the A.M. a boat was sent to one of the Islands to get Sellery to\r\nboil for the People's breakfasts. While our people were gathering it near\r\nsome empty huts about 20 of the Natives landed there--Men, Women, and\r\nChildren. They had no sooner got out of their Canoe than 5 or 6 Women set\r\ndown together, and cut and sacrificed themselves--viz., their Legs,\r\nShins, Arms, and Faces, some with Shells, and others with pieces of\r\nJaspar. So far as our people could understand them, this was done on\r\naccount of their husbands being lately killed and devoured by their\r\nEnemies. While the women was performing this Ceremony, the Men went about\r\nrepairing the Huts without showing the least Concern. The Carpenter went\r\nwith part of his people into the Woods to cut and Square some Timber to\r\nsaw into boards for the use of the Ship, and to prepare two Posts to be\r\nset up with inscriptions on them.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 31st. Little wind and Variable. In the P.M. the Carpenters\r\nhaving prepared the 2 Posts with inscriptions upon them, setting forth\r\nthe Ship's Name, Month, and Year, one of them was set up at the Watering\r\nPlace, on which was hoisted the Union flag; and in the Morning I took the\r\nother over to the Island which is known by the name of Motuouru, and is\r\nthe one that lies nearest to the Sea; but before I attempted to set up\r\nthe Post I went first to the Hippa, having Dr. Monkhouse and Tupia along\r\nwith me. We here met with the old Man I have before spoke of. The first\r\nthing I did was to inquire after the Man said to be kill'd by our people,\r\nand the one that was wounded at the same time, when it did not appear to\r\nme that any such accidents had happened. I next (by means of Tupia)\r\nexplain'd to the old Man and several others that we were Come to set up a\r\nMark upon the Island, in order to shew to any ship that might put into\r\nthis place that we had been here before. They not only gave their free\r\nConsent to set it up, but promised never to pull it down. I then gave\r\nevery one a present of one thing or another; to the old man I gave\r\nSilver, three penny pieces dated 1763, and Spike Nails with the King's\r\nBroad Arrow cut deep in them; things that I thought were most likely to\r\nremain long among them. After I had thus prepared the way for setting up\r\nthe post, we took it up to the highest part of the Island, and after\r\nfixing it fast in the ground, hoisted thereon the Union flag, and I\r\ndignified this Inlet with the name of Queen Charlotte's Sound, and took\r\nformal possession of it and the Adjacent lands in the Name and for the\r\nuse of his Majesty. We then drank her Majesty's health in a Bottle of\r\nwine, and gave the Empty bottle to the old man (who had attended us up\r\nthe hill), with which he was highly pleased. Whilst the Post was setting\r\nup we asked the old man about the Strait or Passage into the Eastern sea,\r\nand he very plainly told us there was a Passage, and as I had some\r\nConjectures that the lands to the South-West of this Strait (which we are\r\nnow at) was an Island, and not a Continent, we questioned the old Man\r\nabout it, who said it consisted of two Wannuas, that is 2 lands or\r\nIslands that might be Circumnavigated in a few days, even in 4. This man\r\nspoke of 3 lands, the 2 above mentioned which he called Tovy-poinammu,*\r\n(* The two Wannuas were doubtless the peninsulas lying west of Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound. The third was the North Island. Te Wai Pounamu (The\r\nWater of the Greenstone, of which the most prized weapons were made) is\r\nthe native name of the Middle Island; but there must have been some\r\nconfusion as to the possibility of getting round this in four days. The\r\nname of the North Island is Te Ika o Maui (The Fish of Maui), but is\r\ngiven by Cook as Aeheino Mouwe. It has been suggested (Rusden) that the\r\nname given to him was Tehinga o Maui (The Fishing of Maui), and\r\nimperfectly rendered.) which Signifies green Talk or Stone, such as they\r\nmake their Tools or ornaments, etc., and for the third he pointed to the\r\nland on the East side of the Strait; this, he said, was a large land, and\r\nthat it would take up a great many Moons to sail round it; this he called\r\nAeheino Mouwe, a name many others before had called it by. That part\r\nwhich borders on the strait he called Teiria Whitte. After we had done\r\nour business upon the Island we returned on board, bringing the old Man\r\nalong with us, who after dinner went ashore in a Canoe that came to\r\nattend upon him.\r\n\r\n[February 1770.]\r\n\r\nThursday, February 1st. P.M. having compleated the Ship with wood, and\r\nfilled all our water, the Boatswain was sent ashore with a party of Men\r\nto cut and make brooms, while others were Employ'd about the rigging,\r\nfishing, etc. In the night and the remainder of the day had a Strong Gale\r\nfrom the North-West, attended with very much rain.\r\n\r\nFriday, 2nd. In the P.M. the Gale increased to a Storm, attended with\r\nrain and squalls, which came down in Excessive heavy gusts from off the\r\nhigh land, in one of which the hawser we had fast to the shore broke;\r\nthis obliged us to let go another Anchor. Towards midnight the Gale\r\nmoderated, and in the morning it fell Calm, and we took up the Sheet\r\nAnchor, looked at the best bower, and moored the ship again to the Shore.\r\nThe heavy rain, which both fell and Continues to fall, hath caused the\r\nBrook we water'd at to overflow its banks, and carry away 10 small Casks\r\nwe had Standing there full of Water, and notwithstanding we searched the\r\nwhole Cove, we could not find one of them.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 3rd. Winds Northerly, mostly fair weather. Very early in the\r\nA.M. sent the Long boat for Sellery to boil for the Ship's Company's\r\nbreakfast, and as I intended sailing the first opportunity, I went over\r\nto the Hippa, which is on the East side of the sound, and purchased of\r\nthe inhabitants a quantity of split and half dry'd fish, and such as I\r\ncould get. While we were at this Hippa, Tupia made farther enquiry about\r\nthe Lands and Strait, and these people confirm'd everything the old Man\r\nhad before told us. About noon we took our leave of them, which some\r\nseem'd not sorry for; notwithstanding they sold us their fish very\r\nfreely, there were some few among them who shew'd evident signs of\r\ndisapprobation.\r\n\r\nSunday, 4th. Winds Northerly, a fresh breeze and fair weather. In the\r\nP.M., after returning from the Hippa, some of us made an Excursion along\r\nshore to the Northward, in order to Traffic with the Natives for fish, in\r\nwhich we had no great Success. In the evening got everything off from the\r\nShore, designing to sail in the Morning, but the wind not permitting, we\r\namused ourselves in fishing, collecting of shells, etc.\r\n\r\nMonday, 5th. Winds and weather as Yesterday. In the A.M. Cast off the\r\nHawser, hove short on the Bower, and carried out the Kedge Anchor, in\r\norder to warp the Ship out of the Cove. All the dry fish we have been\r\nable to procure from the Natives since we came here were this day divided\r\namongst the Ship's Company.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 6th. At 2 p.m. hove up the Anchor, warped the Ship out of the\r\nCove, and got under Sail, but it soon after falling little wind, and that\r\nvery Variable, we anchor'd again a little above Motu-ouru. The old man,\r\nseeing us under sail, came on board to take his leave of us. Amongst\r\nother conversation that passed between him and Tupia, he was asked if\r\neither he or any of his Ancestors had ever seen or heard of any Ship like\r\nthis being in these parts; to which question he answer'd in the Negative,\r\nbut said that his Ancestors had told him that there came once to this\r\nplace a small Vessel from a distant part, wherein were 4 Men that were\r\nall kill'd upon their landing; and being asked where this distant land\r\nlay, he pointed to the North, intimating that it would take up a great\r\nmany days to go thither. Something of this land was mentioned by the\r\nPeople of the Bay of Islands, who said that some of their Ancestors had\r\nbeen there; but it is very clear to us that there knowledge of this land\r\nis only traditionary.* (* This was doubtless the tradition current among\r\nthe Maoris, that their ancestors came from islands to the north. See Note\r\nbelow.) Had it Calm all night until 6 o'clock in the Morning, when a\r\nlight breeze sprung up at North, and we got again under sail; but as the\r\nwind proved very unsteady, we got no farther than just without Motu-ouru\r\nby noon, but had a fair prospect of getting clear out of the Sound, which\r\nI shall next describe.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S SOUND.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of this Sound is situated in the Latitude of 41 degrees\r\nSouth and Longitude 184 degrees 45 minutes West, and near the middle of\r\nthe South-West side of the Strait before mentioned. The land off the\r\nSouth-East head of the Sound called by the Natives, Koamaroo (off which\r\nlies 2 Small Islands and some rocks) makes the Narrowest part of the\r\nStrait. There stretcheth out 2 Miles North-East by North from the\r\nNorth-West head a reef of rocks, a part of which is above Water. This\r\naccount of the 2 Heads will be found sufficient guide to know this sound,\r\nwhich is 3 Leagues broad at the Entrance, and lies in South-West by\r\nSouth-South-West, and West-South-West at least 10 Leagues, and is a\r\ncollection of some of the finest harbours in the world, as will evidently\r\nappear from the plan which was taken with all the accuracy that time and\r\nCircumstances would admit. The Harbour or Cove in which we lay, called\r\nShip Cove, is not inferior to any in the Sound, both in point of Security\r\nand other Conveniences. It lies on the West side of the Sound, and is the\r\nSouthermost of 3 Coves lying within Motu-ouru, which Island bears East\r\nfrom it. You may sail into this Cove either between this last mentioned\r\nIsland and the Isle Hamote, or Long Island, or between Motuouru and the\r\nWest shore; in this last Channell are 2 Ledges of Rocks 3 fathoms under\r\nwater, but they may be known by the Sea Weed which grows upon them. In\r\nsailing in or out of this sound with little wind attention must be had to\r\nthe Tides, which flow 9 or 10 o'Clock full and Change of the Moon, and\r\nrises and falls upon a Perpendicular 7 or 8 feet. The flood comes in\r\nthrough the Strait from the South-East, and sets strong over upon the\r\nNorth-West Head and the reef laying off it; the Ebb sets with great\r\nrapidity to the South-East over upon the Islands and Rocks lying off the\r\nSouth-East Head. The Variation of the Compass from good observations we\r\nfound to be 13 degrees 5 minutes East. The land about this Sound is of\r\nsuch height that we first saw it at the distance of 20 Leagues. It\r\nconsists wholy of high hills and deep Valleys, well stored with a variety\r\nof excellent Timber, fit for all purposes except Ships' Masts, for which\r\nuse it is too hard and heavy. The Sea abounds with a variety of fish, and\r\nin such plenty that, without going out of the Cove where we lay, we\r\ncaught daily, what with the Sean, Hook, and Lines, quite sufficient for\r\nall hands, and upon our first arrival we found plenty of Shags and some\r\nfew other Wild Fowls, which to people in our situation was fresh food not\r\nto be dispised. The Number of Inhabitants hardly exceeds 300 or 400\r\nPeople. They live dispers'd along the Shore in search of their daily\r\nbread, which is fish and firn roots, for they Cultivate no part of the\r\nlands. Upon the appearance of danger they Retire to their Hippas or\r\nstrongholds, for in this situation we found them, and they remain'd so\r\nfor some days after. This people are poor when compared to many we have\r\nseen, and their Canoes are mean and without ornament. The little Traffick\r\nwe had with them was wholy for fish, for we saw little else they had to\r\ndispose of. They had some knowledge of Iron, for they very readily took\r\nNails in Exchange for fish, and sometimes Prefer'd them to anything else,\r\nwhich was more than the people of any other place would do. They were at\r\nfirst fond of Paper, but when they found it spoile by being wet they\r\nwould not take it; nor did they set much value upon the cloth we got at\r\nGeorge's Island, but shew'd an extraordinary fondness for English broad\r\ncloth and red Kersey, which shew'd them to be a more sensible People than\r\nmany of their Neighbours. Besides the common dress, many of these People\r\nwore on their Heads round Caps made of Birds' feathers, which were far\r\nfrom being unbecoming.* (* Cook was not able to explore the whole of\r\nQueen Charlotte's Sound, which runs into the land for 25 miles. Towards\r\nthe southern end is Picton, the port of Blenheim, the capital of the\r\nprovince of Marlborough.)\r\n\r\n[In Cook's Strait, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 7th. In the P.M. had a light breeze at North by West, with\r\nwhich we got out of the Sound and stood over to the Eastward, in order to\r\nget the Strait well open before the tide of Ebb Made. At 7 the 2 Small\r\nIslands which lies off Cape Koamaroo, or the South-East head of Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound, bore East, distant 4 miles. At this time we had it\r\nnearly Calm, and the tide of Ebb making out, we were Carried by the\r\nRapidity of the Stream in a very short time close upon one of the\r\nIslands,* (* The Brothers. There is now a lighthouse on this island.)\r\nwhere we narrowly escaped being dashed against the Rocks by bringing the\r\nShip to an Anchor in 75 fathoms Water, with 150 fathoms of Cable out.\r\nEven this would not have saved us had not the Tide, which first set South\r\nby East, by meeting with the Island changed its direction to South-East,\r\nand carried us past the first point. When the Ship was brought up she was\r\nabout 2 Cables' Lengths of the Rocks and in the Strength of the Stream,\r\nwhich set South-East at least 4 or 5 Knotts or miles per Hour. A little\r\nbefore 12 o'Clock the Tide abated, and we began to heave; by 3 the Anchor\r\nwas at the bows, and having a light breeze at North-West, we made sail\r\nover for the Eastern Shore; but having the tide against us we made but\r\nlittle way. The wind afterwards freshned, and Came to North and\r\nNorth-East, with which and the tide of Ebb we were in a short time\r\nhurried thro' the narrowest part of the Strait, and then stood away for\r\nthe Southermost land we had in sight, which bore from us South by West.\r\nOver this land appeared a Prodigious high Mountain,* (* The Kairoura\r\nRange, the summit of which is 9500 feet high.) the Summit of which was\r\ncovered with snow. The narrowest part of the Strait we have passed lies\r\nbetween Cape Koamaroo on Tovy-poinammu and Cape Teerawhitte on\r\nAeheino-mouwe; the distance from the one to the other I judged to be\r\nbetween 4 and 5 Leagues. And notwithstanding the strength of the Tides,\r\nnow that is known, there is no great danger in passing it; in the doing\r\nof which I am of opinion that the North-East Shore is the safest to keep\r\nupon, for upon that side there appeared no danger, whereas on the other\r\nshore there are not only the Islands and Rocks lying off Cape Koamaroo,\r\nfor I discover'd from the hill from which I had the Second View of the\r\nStrait, a Reef of Rocks stretching from these Islands 6 or 7 Miles to the\r\nSouthward, and lay about 2 or 3 Miles off from the Shore. I shall not\r\npretend here to assign limits to the length of this Strait; a view of the\r\nChart will best illustrate that. About North 9 Leagues from Cape\r\nTeerawhitte, under the same shore, is a high remarkable Island, that may\r\nbe distinctly seen from Queen Charlotte Sound, from which it lies\r\nNorth-East by East 1/4 East, distant 6 or 7 Leagues. I have called it\r\nEntry Isle, and was taken Notice of when we first past it on Sunday 14th\r\nof last Month. On the East side of Cape Teerawhitte the Land Trends away\r\nSouth-East by East about 8 Leagues, where it ends in a point, and is the\r\nSouthermost land on Aeheinomouwe, which I have named Cape Pallisser in\r\nHonour of my worthy friend Capt. Pallisser.* (* Captain Palliser,\r\nafterwards Sir Hugh, was Captain of the Eagle, Cook's first ship in the\r\nRoyal Navy. He discovered Cook's talents, and was his warm friend\r\nthroughout his life. Between Cape Teerawhitte and Cape Palliser is the\r\nentrance to Port Nicholson, wherein is situated Wellington, the capital\r\nof New Zealand. This entrance is, however, narrow, and Cook was never\r\nnear enough to the land to discover it.) Latitude 41 degrees 34 minutes,\r\nLongitude 183 degrees 58 minutes, it bore from us this day at Noon South\r\n79 degrees East, distant 12 or 13 Leagues, being then in the Latitude of\r\n41 degrees 27 minutes South; at the same time Cape Koamaroo bore North\r\n1/2 East, distant 7 or 8 Leagues. The Southermost point of land in sight\r\nbore South 16 degrees West, and the snowy Mountain South-West being about\r\n3 Leagues from the shore and abreast of a Deep Bay or inlet called Cloudy\r\nbay, in the bottom of which appear'd low land cover'd with tall Trees.\r\n\r\nThursday, 8th. In the P.M. had a fresh breeze at North-North-East and\r\nCloudy weather. At 3 o'Clock was abreast of the Southermost point of land\r\nset at Noon, which I named Cape Campbell, Latitude 41 degrees 42 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude 184 degrees 47 minutes West, it lies South by West,\r\ndistant 12 or 13 Leagues from Cape Koamaroo, and together with Cape\r\nPallisser forms the Southern Entrance of the Straits; the Distance of the\r\none to the other is 13 or 14 Leagues West by South and East by North.\r\nFrom this Cape we steer'd along Shore South-West by South until 8\r\no'Clock, when the wind died away; but an Hour after a fresh breeze sprung\r\nup at South-West, and we put the Ship right before it. The reason of my\r\ndoing this was owing to a notion, which some of the Officers had just\r\nstarted, that Aeheinomouwe was not an Island; founding their opinion on a\r\nsupposition that the land might extend away to the South-East from\r\nbetween Cape Turnagain and Cape Pallisser, there being a space of about\r\n12 or 13 leagues which we had not seen. For my own part, I had seen so\r\nfar into this Sea the first time I discover'd the Strait, together with\r\nmany other Concurrent testimonies of its being an Island, that no such\r\nsupposition ever enter'd my thoughts; but being resolved to clear up\r\nevery doubt that might Arise on so important an Object, I took the\r\nopportunity of the Shifting of the Wind to Stand to the Eastward, and\r\naccordingly steer'd North-East by East all night. At 9 o'Clock A.M. we\r\nwere abreast of Cape Pallisser, where we found the Land trend away\r\nNorth-East towards Cape Turnagain, which I reckon'd to be distant from us\r\nabout 26 Leagues, but as the weather was hazey so that we could not see\r\nabove 4 or 5 Leagues ahead, we Still kept standing to the North-East,\r\nwith a light breeze at South. At Noon Cape Pallisser bore North 72\r\ndegrees West, distant 3 Leagues; our Latitude by account is 41 degrees 30\r\nminutes South.\r\n\r\n[Complete the Circuit of North Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 9th. Gentle breezes at South and South-South-East, hazey Cloudy\r\nweather. In the P.M. 3 Canoes came off to the Ship, wherein were between\r\n30 and 40 of the Natives, who had been pulling after us sometime. It\r\nappeared from the behaviour of these people that they had heard of our\r\nbeing upon the Coast, for they came alongside, and some of them on board\r\nthe Ship, without shewing the least signs of fear. They were no sooner on\r\nboard than they asked for Nails, but when Nails was given them they asked\r\nTupia what they were, which was plain that they had never seen any\r\nbefore; yet they not only knowed how to ask for them, but know'd what use\r\nto make of them, and therefore must have heard of Nails, which they call\r\nWhow, the name of a Tool among them made generally of bone, which they\r\nuse as a Chisel in making Holes, etc. These people asking so readily for\r\nNails proves that their connections must extend as far North as Cape\r\nKidnapper, which is 45 Leagues, for that was the Southermost place on\r\nthis side the coast we had any Traffick with the Natives; and it is most\r\nprobable that the inhabitants of Queen Charlotte's sound got the little\r\nknowledge they seem'd to have of Iron by the Connections they may have\r\nwith the Teerawhitteans bordering upon them; for we have no reason to\r\nthink that the inhabitants of any part of this land had the least\r\nknowledge of Iron before we came amongst them. After a short stay these\r\npeople were dismissed with proper presents, and we continued our Course\r\nalong shore to the North-East until 11 o'Clock A.M., when the weather\r\nclear'd up, and we saw Cape Turnagain bearing North by East 1/4 East,\r\ndistant 7 Leagues. I then called the Officers upon deck, and asked them\r\nif they were now satisfied that this land was an Island; to which they\r\nanswer'd in the Affirmative, and we hauled our wind to the Eastward.* (*\r\nThe Endeavour had now completely circumnavigated the North Island of New\r\nZealand, having spent four months in the exploration. That Cook had\r\ncommunicated his enthusiasm to his officers is evident; or, knowing his\r\ndetermination to leave nothing doubtful, they would not have started the\r\nidea that the North Island might not be really an island. The natural\r\nwish after so many months' absence from civilization must have been to\r\nget back to it, and to take things for granted that would otherwise delay\r\ntheir progress.) At Noon our Latitude by observation was 40 degrees 55\r\nminutes South, which is 21 Miles to the Southward of Cape Turnagain, it\r\nbearing North by East, and Cape Pallisser by this day's run bears South\r\n43 degrees West, 19 or 20 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 10th. Gentle breezes at South-East and Cloudy weather. At 4\r\nP.M. Tack'd and stood South-West until 8 A.M., when being not above 3 or\r\n4 Miles from the Shore we Tack'd, and stood off 2 hours, and then stood\r\nagain to the South-West until noon, when being in the Latitude of 41\r\ndegrees 13 minutes South, and about 2 Miles from the Shore, the land of\r\nCape Pallisser bearing South 53 degrees West, had 26 fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nSunday, 11th. P.M. had light breeze from the South-East. In the night it\r\nwas Calm until 9 a.m., when a Gentle breeze sprung up at East-North-East,\r\nwith which we made sail to the Southward, having a large swell rolling in\r\nfrom that Quarter. At Noon was in the Latitude of 41 degrees 6 minutes\r\nSouth, distant from the Shore 1 1/2 Leagues; a remarkable hillock,* (*\r\nCastle Point.) which stands close to the Sea, bore North 1/2 East,\r\ndistance 4 Leagues. At this time 2 Canoes came alongside the Ship, with\r\nwhom we had some little Traffic, and then dismissed them.\r\n\r\nMonday, 12th. Most part of P.M. had a fresh breeze at North-East, which\r\nby sunset carried us the length of Cape Pallisser, and as the weather was\r\nclear I had an opportunity of Viewing the land of this Cape, which is of\r\na height Sufficient to be seen in clear weather 12 or 14 Leagues, and is\r\nof a broken and hilly surface. Between the foot of the high land and the\r\nSea is a border of low, flat land, off which lies some rocks, that appear\r\nabove water. Between this Cape and Cape Turnagain the land near the shore\r\nis in many places low and flatt, and appear'd green and pleasant; but\r\ninland are many Hills. From Cape Pallisser to Cape Teerawhitte the land\r\nis tollerable high, making in Table-points, and the Shore forms 2 Bays;\r\nat least it appear'd so, for we were always too far off this part of the\r\nCoast to be particular.* (* The northern of these was the entrance to\r\nPort Nicholson, the harbour of Auckland.) The wind continued at\r\nNorth-East until 12 at Night, when it died away, and veer'd round to the\r\nWest, and afterwards to South and South-South-East little wind, so that\r\nby noon we had advanced no farther than 41 degrees 52 minutes South\r\nLatitude. Cape Pallisser bearing North, distant 5 Leagues, and the Snowy\r\nmountain bore South 83 degrees West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 13th. P.M. light Airs at South-East, the remainder Calm. At Noon\r\nfound ourselves in the Latitude of 42 degrees 2 minutes South, Cape\r\nPallisser bearing North 20 degrees East, distant 8 Leagues.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 14th. P.M. a fresh breeze sprung up at North-East, and we\r\nSteer'd South-West by West for the Southermost land we had in sight,\r\nwhich bore from us at sunset South 74 degrees West. At this time we found\r\nthe Variation to be 15 degrees 4 minutes East. At 8 A.M. it fell Calm; at\r\nthis time we had run 21 Leagues South 58 degrees West since Yesterday at\r\nnoon, which brought us abreast of the high Snowy mountain, it bearing\r\nfrom us North-West in this direction. It lay behind a Mountainous ridge\r\nof nearly the same height, which riseth directly from the Sea, and runs\r\nParrallel with the Shore, which lies North-East 1/2 North and South-West\r\n1/2 South. The North-East end of the ridge takes its rise but a little\r\nway inland from Cape Campbell. These mountains are distinctly seen both\r\nfrom Cape Koamaroo and Cape Pallisser, being distant from the former\r\nSouth-West 1/2 South 22 Leagues, and from the Latter West-South-West 30\r\nLeagues: but they are of a height sufficient to be seen at a much greater\r\ndistance. By some on board they are thought to be much higher than the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe, which I cannot agree to; neither do I think them so\r\nhigh as Mount Egmont, on the South-West Coast of Aeheinomouwe, founding\r\nmy opinion on the summit of the Latter being almost wholy covered with\r\nSnow, whereas it only lies upon these in patches.* (* The highest peak of\r\nthe Kaikoura Mountains, Mount Tapuaepuka, is 9500 feet high. It is\r\ntherefore higher than Mount Egmont, but not so high as the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe. The snow lies thicker on the western side of New Zealand\r\nmountains, so Cook's parallel was fallacious. The Endeavour was now near\r\nthe Kaikoura Peninsula, where a small town stands at the present day, the\r\nshipping port of an agricultural district.) At noon was in the Latitude\r\nof 42 degrees 34 minutes South; the Southermost land we had in sight bore\r\nSouth-West 1/2 West, and some low land that made like an Island lying\r\nclose under the foot of the Ridge North-West by North, distant about 5 or\r\n6 Leagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 15th. In the P.M. 4 Double Canoes, in which were 57 Men, came\r\noff to the Ship; they kept at the distance of about a Stone's throw from\r\nus, and would not be prevailed upon to put alongside by all that Tupia\r\ncould say to them. From this we concluded that they never had heard of\r\nour being upon the coast. At 8 p.m. a breeze sprung up at\r\nSouth-South-West, with which we Stretched off South-East, because some on\r\nboard thought they saw land in that Quarter. We continued on this course\r\nuntil 6 A.M., at which time we had run 11 Leagues, but saw no land but\r\nthat which we had left. Soon after this it fell calm, and continued so\r\nfor an hour; then a light breeze sprung up at West, which afterwards\r\nveer'd to the North, and we stood to the Westward. At Noon our Latitude\r\nby Observation was 42 degrees 56 minutes South, and the High Land we were\r\nabreast of yesterday at Noon, North-North-West 1/2 West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 16th. In the P.M. had a light breeze North-East, with which we\r\nsteer'd West, edging in for the land, which was distant from us about 8\r\nLeagues. At 7 o'Clock the Southermost Extream of the land in sight bore\r\nWest-South-West, being about 6 Leagues from the Shore; soon after this it\r\nfell Calm, and continued so most part of the night, with sometimes light\r\nAirs from the land. At daylight we discover'd land bearing South by West,\r\nand seemingly detached from the Coast we were upon; at 8 o'Clock a breeze\r\nsprung up at North by East, and we steer'd directly for it. At Noon was\r\nin the Latitude of 43 degrees 19 minutes South; the Peak on the Snowy\r\nMountains bore North 20 degrees East, distant 27 Leagues; the Southern\r\nExtremity we could see of that land bore West, and the land discover'd in\r\nthe morning, making like an Island, extending from South-South-West to\r\nSouth-West by West 1/2 West, distant about 8 Leagues; our Course and\r\ndistance sail'd since yesterday at Noon South-West by West, 43 Miles;\r\nVariation by this Morning's Amplitude 14 degrees 39 minutes East.\r\n\r\n[Off Banks Peninsula, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 17th. P.M. stood to the Southward for the land above mention'd,\r\nwith the wind at North, a fresh breeze and Clear weather. At 8 o'Clock we\r\nhad run 11 Leagues since Noon, when the land extended from South-West by\r\nWest to North by West, being distant from the nearest shore about 3 or 4\r\nLeagues; in this situation had 50 fathoms, a fine sandy bottom. Soon\r\nafter this it fell Calm, and continued so until 6 A.M., when a light\r\nbreeze sprung up at North-West, which afterwards veer'd to North-East. At\r\nsun rise, being very Clear, we plainly discover'd that the last mentioned\r\nland was an Island by seeing part of the Land of Tovy-poenammu open to\r\nthe Westward of it, extending as far as West by South. At 8 o'Clock the\r\nExtreams of the Island bore North 76 degrees West and North-North-East\r\n1/2 East, and an opening that had the Appearance of a Bay or Harbour,\r\nlying near the South point North 20 degrees West, distant 3 or 4 Leagues,\r\nbeing in 38 fathoms, a brown Sandy bottom. This Island,* (* It is not an\r\nisland, but a mountainous peninsula, still called after Mr. Banks, but\r\nfrom the lowness of the land it adjoins, looks like an island. On the\r\nnorth side is the fine harbour of Lyttelton, the port of Christchurch, a\r\ntown of nearly 40,000 inhabitants. The harbour on the south side, that\r\nCook saw, is Akaroa, a magnificent port.) which I have named after Mr.\r\nBanks, lies about 5 Leagues from the Coast of Tovy poenammu; the South\r\npoint bears South 21 degrees West from the higher peak on the Snowy\r\nMountain so often mention'd, and lies in the Latitude of 43 degrees 52\r\nminutes South and in the Longitude of 186 degrees 30 minutes West, by\r\nobservations made of the Sun and Moon this morning. It is of a circular\r\nfigure, and may be about 24 Leagues in Compass; the land is of a height\r\nsufficient to be seen 12 or 15 Leagues, and of a very broken, uneven\r\nSurface, and hath more the appearance of barrenness than fertility. Last\r\nnight we saw smoke up it, and this morning some people, and therefore\r\nmust be inhabited. Yesterday Lieutenant Gore, having the Morning Watch at\r\nthe time we first saw this Island, thought he saw land bearing\r\nSouth-South-East and South-East by East; but I, who was upon Deck at the\r\nsame time, was very Certain that it was only Clouds, which dissipated as\r\nthe Sun rose. But neither this, nor the running 14 Leagues to the South,\r\nnor the seeing no land to the Eastward of us in the Evening, could\r\nSatisfy Mr. Gore but what he saw in the morning was, or might be, land;\r\naltho' there was hardly a possibility of its being so, because we must\r\nhave been more than double the distance from it at that time to what we\r\nwere either last night or this morning, at both of which times the\r\nweather was Exceeding Clear, and yet we could see no land either to the\r\nEastward or Southward of us. Notwithstanding all this, Mr. Gore was of\r\nthe same opinion this morning; upon this I order'd the Ship to be wore,\r\nand to be steer'd East-South-East by Compass on the other Tack, the point\r\non which he said the land bore at this time from us.* (* Another instance\r\nof the general desire to leave nothing unexplored.) At Noon we were in\r\nthe Latitude of 44 degrees 7 minutes South; the South point of Banks\r\nIsland bore North, distant 5 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 18th. Gentle breezes at North and fair weather. P.M. stood\r\nEast-South-East in search of Mr. Gore's imaginary land until 7 o'clock,\r\nat which time we had run 28 Miles since Noon; but seeing no land but that\r\nwe had left, or signs of any, we bore away South by West, and continued\r\nupon that Course until Noon, when we found ourselves in the Latitude of\r\n45 degrees 16 minutes South. Our Course and distance sail'd since\r\nYesterday is South 8 minutes East, 70 Miles; the South point of Banks\r\nIsland North 6 degrees 30 minutes West, distant 28 Leagues; Variation per\r\nAmplitude this Morning 15 degrees 30 minutes. Seeing no signs of Land, I\r\nthought it to no purpose standing any farther to the Southward, and\r\ntherefore hauled to the Westward, thinking we were far enough to the\r\nSouthward to weather all the land we had left; but this opinion was only\r\nfounded on the information we had had from the Natives of Queen\r\nCharlotte's sound.* (* The ship was still 250 miles from the south point\r\nof New Zealand.)\r\n\r\nMonday, 19th. P.M. had a Moderate breeze at North-North-West and North\r\nuntil 8 o'clock, when it fell little wind, and was very unsettled until\r\n10, at which time it fix'd at South, and freshen'd in such a manner that\r\nbefore the morning it brought us under our close reeft Topsails. At 8\r\na.m. having run 28 Leagues upon a West by North 1/2 North Course, and now\r\njudging ourselves to be to the Westward of the Land of Tovy Poenammu, we\r\nbore away North-West with a fresh Gale at South. At 10 o'clock, having\r\nrun 11 Miles upon this Course, we saw land extending from the South-West\r\nto the North-West at the distance of about 10 Leagues from us, which we\r\nhauled up for. At Noon our Latitude per observation was 44 degrees 38\r\nminutes South; the South-East point of Banks Island bore North 59 degrees\r\n30 minutes East, distant 30 Leagues, and the Main body of the land in\r\nsight West by North. Course and distance sail'd since Yesterday at Noon\r\nis North 66 degrees 45 minutes West, 96 Miles.\r\n\r\n[Off Timaru, Middle Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 20th. All P.M. had little wind, which veer'd round from South by\r\nEast to North-North-East. Steer'd South-South-West, but got very little\r\nto the Southward on account of a head Sea. At 2 o'Clock sounded in 35\r\nfathoms, fine sandy Bottom, being about 6 Leagues from the land. At 7\r\no'Clock the Extreams of the land extending from South-West by South to\r\nNorth by West, distant from the nearest shore 6 Leagues, depth of water\r\n32 fathoms. At 12 o'Clock it fell Calm, and continued so until 4 A.M.,\r\nwhen a fresh breeze sprung up at South by West, with which we stood in\r\nshore West by South, 4 Leagues, our Depth of Water from 32 to 13 fathoms.\r\nIn this last Depth we Tack'd and Stood off, being about 3 Miles from the\r\nShore, which lies nearly North and South, and is here very low and flatt,\r\nand continues so up to the skirts of the hills, which are at least 4 or 5\r\nMiles inland. The whole face of the Country appears barren, nor did we\r\nsee any signs of inhabitants.* (* This is a little south of Timaru, a\r\nrising town in a fertile district; so deceptive is appearance from the\r\nsea.) Latitude at Noon 44 degrees 44 minutes South; Longitude made from\r\nBanks' Island to this land 2 degrees 22 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 21st. Wind at South. A fresh Gale at 2 p.m., being in 50\r\nfathoms, and 12 Leagues from the land, we tack'd and stood in Shore until\r\n8 o'Clock, when we Tack'd and Stood off until 4 a.m.; then Tack'd and\r\nStood in, at 8 o'Clock being 10 Leagues from the Land; had 57 fathoms. At\r\nNoon, being in the Latitude 44 degrees 35 minutes, and 5 or 6 Leagues\r\nfrom the land, had 36 fathoms; notwithstanding we have Carried as much\r\nsail as the Ship could bear, it is apparent from the observed Latitudes\r\nthat we have been drove 3 Leagues to leeward since Yesterday.\r\n\r\nThursday, 22nd. Moderate breezes between the South-East and South by\r\nWest, and dark gloomy weather, with a Swell from the South-East plying to\r\nwindward, keeping between 4 and 12 Leagues from the land; depth of water\r\nfrom 35 to 53 fathoms, fine sandy bottom. A great many Sea fowl and\r\nGrampusses about the Ship. In the A.M. Condemn'd 60 fathoms of the B.B.\r\nCable,* (* B.B. stands for Best Bower, one of the principal cables. The\r\nhempen cables of those days were a continual cause of solicitude, and\r\nrequired great care.) and converted it into Junk; at Noon had no\r\nObservation, but by the land judged ourselves to be about 3 Leagues\r\nfarther North than Yesterday.\r\n\r\nFriday, 23rd. Winds Southerly, a Gentle breeze, and for the most part\r\nCloudy weather. At sunset, the weather clearing up, presented to our View\r\na high peaked Mountain* (* There are so many lofty mountains in this\r\nregion that it is impossible to identify this. This ship was now no\r\nfarther south than she had been five days earlier.) bearing North-West by\r\nNorth, and at the same time we saw the Land more Distincter than at any\r\ntime we had before, extending from North to South-West by South, the\r\ninland parts of which appear'd to be high and Mountainous. We cannot tell\r\nyet whether or no this land joins to, or makes a part of, the land we\r\nhave left; from the accounts received from the Natives of Queen\r\nCharlotte's sound it ought not, because if it did it must have been\r\nimpossible for us to have sail'd round it in 4 Days; besides, the\r\nMountains inland and the soundings off the Coast seem to indicate this\r\nCountry to be more extensive than any they spoke of lying to the\r\nSouthward. Having a large hollow swell from the South-East, which made me\r\nexpect the Wind from the same quarter, we keept plying from 7 to 15\r\nLeagues from the land, depth of Water 44 to 70 fathoms; at Noon our\r\nLatitude, by Observation, was 44 degrees 40 minutes South; Longitude made\r\nfrom Banks's Island 1 degree 31 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 24th. Calm until 6 p.m., at which time a light breeze sprung up\r\nat East-North-East, with which we steer'd South-South-East all night,\r\nedging off from the Land because of a hollow swell which we had from the\r\nSouth-East; depth of water from 60 to 75 fathoms. At daylight the wind\r\nbegan to freshen, and before noon blowed a fresh Gale, and veer'd to\r\nNorth-North-East; at 8 a.m. Saw the land extending as far as South-West\r\nby South, which we steer'd directly for, and at Noon we were in the\r\nLatitude of 45 degrees 22 minutes South; the land in sight extending from\r\nSouth-West 1/2 South to North-North-West making high and hilly. Course\r\nand distance run since Yesterday at Noon is South 15 degrees West, 47\r\nMiles. In the P.M., while we lay becalm'd, Mr. Banks, in a small Boat,\r\nshott 2 Port Egmont Hens, which were in every respect the same sort of\r\nBirds as are found in great Numbers upon the Island of Faro; they are of\r\na very dark brown plumage, with a little white about the under side of\r\ntheir wings, and are as large as a Muscovy Duck. These were the first\r\nthat we have seen since we arrived upon the Coast of this Country, but we\r\nsaw of them for some days before we made land.\r\n\r\n[Off Otago, Middle Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 25th. In the P.M. Steer'd South-West by South and South-West,\r\nedging in for the land, having the Advantage of a fresh Gale at North,\r\nwhich I was over desirous of making the most of, and by that means\r\ncarried away the Maintop Gallant Mast and Foretopmast Steering Sail Boom;\r\nbut these were soon replaced by others. Altho' we keept at no great\r\nDistance from the Shore, yet the weather was so Hazey that we could see\r\nnothing distinct upon the land, only that there were a ridge of Pretty\r\nhigh Hills lying Parrallel with, and but a little way from, the Sea\r\nCoast, which lies South by West and North by East, and seem'd to End in a\r\nhigh Bluff point to the Southward, which we run the length of by 8\r\no'Clock, when, being dark, and not knowing which way the Land Trended, we\r\nbrought too for the night, having run 15 Leagues upon a South-West 1/2\r\nWest Course since Noon. The point bore at this time West, distant about 5\r\nMiles, depth of Water 37 fathoms, the bottom small pebble stones. At 4\r\nA.M. we made Sail, but by this time the Northerly wind was gone, and was\r\nsucceeded by one from the Southward, which proved very Var'ble and\r\nunsteady. At day light the point above mention'd bore North, distant 3\r\nLeagues, and we found that the land trended away from it South-West by\r\nWest, as far as we could see. This point of land I have Named Cape\r\nSaunders, in Honour of Sir Charles* (* Admiral Sir Charles Saunders was\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty in 1766. He commanded the fleet at the\r\ncapture of Quebec in 1759, in which Cook served.) (Latitude 45 degrees 55\r\nminutes South; Longitude 189 degrees 4 minutes West). It requires no\r\ndiscription to know it by, the Latitude and the Angle made here by the\r\nCoast will be found quite sufficient; however, there is a remarkable\r\nsaddle hill laying near the Shore, 3 or 4 Leagues South-West of the Cape.\r\nFrom 1 to 4 Leagues North of the Cape the Shore seem'd to form 2 or 3\r\nBays, wherein there appear'd to be Anchorage and Shelter from South-West,\r\nWesterly, and North-West winds.* (* One of these is Otago Harbour, where\r\nlies Dunedin, perhaps the most important commercial city in New Zealand.)\r\nI had some thoughts of bearing up for one of these places in the morning\r\nwhen the Wind came to South-West, but the fear of loosing time and the\r\ndesire I had of pushing to the Southward, in order to see as much of the\r\nCoast as possible, or, if this land should prove to be an Island, to get\r\nround it, prevented me. Being not far from the Shore all this morning, we\r\nhad an Opportunity of Viewing the Land pretty distinctly; it is of a\r\nModerate height, full of Hills, which appear'd green and Woody, but we\r\nsaw not the least signs of inhabitants. At Noon Cape Saunders bore North\r\n30 degrees West, distant 4 Leagues. Latitude per Log, for we had no\r\nObservation, 46 degrees 0 minutes South.\r\n\r\nMonday, 26th. In the P.M. had the wind Whifling all round the Compass,\r\nsometimes blowing a fresh Gale, and at other times almost Calm. At 5\r\no'Clock it fixed at West-South-West, and soon blow'd so hard as to put us\r\npast our Topsails, and to split the foresail all to pieces. After getting\r\nanother to the Yard, we continued standing to the Southward under 2\r\nCourses. At 1 A.M. the wind Moderating, set the Topsails with one Reef\r\nout; but soon after day light the Gale increased to a Storm, with heavy\r\nSqualls, attended with rain. This brought us again under our Courses, and\r\nthe Main Topsail being Split we unbent it and bent another. At 6 o'Clock\r\nthe Southermost land in sight bore West by North, and Cape Saunders bore\r\nNorth by West, distant 8 Leagues; at Noon it bore North 20 minutes West,\r\ndistant 14 Leagues. Latitude observed 46 degrees 35 minutes.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 27th. A very hard gale at South-West by West, and\r\nWest-South-West, with heavy squalls attended with Showers of rain, and a\r\nlarge hollow sea, without the least intermission the whole of this 24\r\nHours. We continued under our Courses from Noon until 7 P.M., when we\r\nhanded the Mainsail, and lay too under the Foresail with the head to the\r\nSouthward. Latitude at Noon 46 degrees 54 minutes; Longitude made from\r\nCape Saunders 1 degree 24 minutes East.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 28th. Strong Gale at South-West, with a large Sea from the\r\nSame quarter. At 7 p.m. made sail under the Courses; at 8 a.m. set the\r\nTopsails close reefed. At Noon, being in the Latitude of 47 degrees 43\r\nminutes South, and Longitude East from Cape Saunders 2 degrees 10\r\nminutes, wore and stood to the Northward.\r\n\r\n[March 1770.]\r\n\r\nThursday, March 1st. Winds between the South-West and North-North-West, a\r\nfresh gale. In the P.M. found the Variation to be 16 degrees 34 minutes\r\nEast. At 8 Tack'd and Stood to the Southward, with the wind at West,\r\nwhich before the morning veer'd to North-West, accompanied with hazey\r\nweather and drizzling rain; at day light loosed a reef out of Each\r\nTopsail, and set some of the small sails. At Noon our Latitude by account\r\nwas 47 degrees 52 minutes South, and Longitude made from Cape Saunders 1\r\ndegree 8 minutes East.\r\n\r\nFriday, 2nd. Strong Gales from the West, with heavy Squalls, attended\r\nwith showers of rain. In the P.M. Stood to the Southward till half-past\r\n3, when being in the Latitude 48 degrees 0 minutes South and Longitude\r\n188 degrees 00 minutes West, and seeing no Visible signs of Land, we\r\nTack'd and Stood to the Northward, having a very large swell from the\r\nSouth-West by West. Soon after we tack'd we close reef'd the Topsails,\r\nand in the night were obliged to hand them, but at day light set them\r\nagain. At Noon our Latitude by Observation was 46 degrees 42 minutes\r\nSouth, Cape Saunders bearing North 46 degrees West, distant 68 Miles.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 3rd. P.M. Wind and weather as Yesterday. A.M. quite Moderate,\r\nyet the South-West swell continues, which makes me conjecture that there\r\nis no land near in that quarter. At Noon our Latitude was 46 degrees 42\r\nminutes South, being East of Cape Saunders 1 degree 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nSunday, 4th. At 4 p.m. the Wind coming to the Northward we stood to the\r\nWestward with all the sail we could make. In the morning got up\r\nTopgallant yards, and set the sails; found the Variation to be 16 degrees\r\n16 minutes East. Saw several Whales, Seals, and one Penguin; this bird\r\nwas but Small of the sort, but seem'd to be such a one as we had never\r\nseen before. We have seen several Seals since we passed the Straits, but\r\nnever saw one upon the whole Coast of Aeheinomouwe. We sounded both in\r\nthe Night and the morning, but found no bottom with 150 fathoms Line; at\r\nNoon we saw Cape Saunders bearing North 1/2 West; our Latitude by\r\nobservation was 46 degrees 31 minutes South.* (* The Endeavour had been\r\nblown off the land for seven days, and had barely recovered her\r\nposition.)\r\n\r\n[Off South Part of Middle Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 5th. Most part of P.M. had a fresh breeze at North by East. Half\r\npast 1 saw Land bearing West by South, which we steer'd for; before dark\r\nwe were within 3 or 4 Leagues of it, and seeing no land farther to the\r\nSouth we were in hopes this would prove the Southern point. At 7 shortned\r\nsail, and kept under an easy sail all night, standing to the\r\nWest-South-West, having the wind at North-West, and North-North-West\r\nuntil 2 a.m., when it fell Calm, and soon after a breeze sprung up at\r\nSouth-East by South, and daylight coming on we made sail. During the\r\nwhole night we saw a large fire upon the land; a certain sign of its\r\nbeing inhabited. At 7 the Extreams of the land bore from North 38 degrees\r\nEast to West 6 minutes South, being distant from the Shore about 3\r\nLeagues. The land appear'd of a Moderate height, and not hilly. At 1/2\r\npast 10 o'Clock the westermost land in sight bore West 1/2 North, distant\r\n7 Leagues; at Noon had fresh Gales at South-South-East, and thick hazey\r\nweather with rain. Our Latitude by account was 46 degrees 50 minutes\r\nSouth, and Longitude made from Cape Saunders 1 degree 56 minutes West.*\r\n(* The ship was now off the south point of the Middle Island.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 6th. P.M. Winds at South by East and South-East, and thick hazey\r\nweather until 3 o'clock, when it clear'd up, and we saw the land\r\nextending from North-East by North to North-West 1/2 North, and soon\r\nafter low land, making like an Island, bearing West 1/2 South. Keeping on\r\nour Course to the West by South, we in 2 hours' time saw high land over\r\nthe low, extending to the Southward as far as South-West by South; we\r\ncould not see this land join to that to the Northward of us, there either\r\nbeing a total seperation, a deep Bay, or low land between them. At 8\r\no'Clock, being within 3 Leagues of the low land (which we now took to be\r\nan Island* (* Ruapuke Island.)), we Tack'd and stood to the Eastward,\r\nhaving the wind at South, which proved very unsettled all night; by which\r\nmeans, and a little bad management, I found the Ship in the morning\r\nconsiderably farther to the Eastward than I expected, and the wind\r\nafterwards coming to South-West and West-South-West, so that at noon we\r\nfound ourselves much about the same place as we were Yesterday, our\r\nLatitude by observation being 46 degrees 50 minutes South, the land\r\nextending from North-East by East to West by North 1/2 North, the nearest\r\npart bearing North, distance 3 Leagues; the land to the South-West just\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 7th. Light Airs in the South-West quarter. P.M. Clear weather,\r\nremainder dark and Cloudy. In the P.M. found the Variation per several\r\nAzimuths, and the Amplitude to be 15 degrees 10 minutes East, and by the\r\nAmplitude in the morning to be 15 degrees 56 minutes East. Stood to the\r\nSouth-East until 8 a.m., then tack'd and stood to the North-West; but it\r\nsoon after fell Calm, and continued so until noon, when by our account we\r\nwere in the Latitude of 47 degrees 6 minutes South, and had made 12 Miles\r\nEasting since Yesterday at Noon.\r\n\r\nThursday, 8th. Light Airs next to a Calm from South-South-East to\r\nNorth-East, with which we kept Steering to the South-West, but made but\r\nlittle way because of a swell which took us right ahead. At daylight A.M.\r\nwe saw, or thought we saw, from the Masthead, the land which we have left\r\nto the Northward of us joined to that to the South-West of us; and at the\r\nsame time we imagined we saw the land extend to the Southward as far as\r\nSouth-South-West; but after steering this Course until noon we discovered\r\nour Mistake, for there was no land to be seen to the Southward of West,\r\nwhich Course we now steer'd, being by observation in the Latitude of 47\r\ndegrees 12 minutes; Longitude made from Cape Saunders 2 degrees 2 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n[Off South Cape of New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 9th. P.M. Winds at North, a Gentle breeze and Clear weather.\r\nStood to the Westward until sunset, at which time the Extreams of the\r\nland bore from North by East to West, distant about 7 or 8 Leagues; Depth\r\nof Water 55 fathoms; Variation by the Amplitude 16 degrees 29 minutes\r\nEast. The wind now veer'd to the Westward, and as the weather was fine\r\nand Moonlight we kept standing close upon a Wind to the South-West all\r\nnight. At 4 a.m. Sounded, and had 60 fathoms; at daylight we discover'd\r\nunder our lee bow Ledges of Rocks, on which the Sea broke very high,\r\nextending from South by West to West by South, and not above 3/4 of a\r\nMile from us; yet upon sounding we had 45 fathoms, a Rocky bottom. The\r\nwind being at North-West we could not weather the Ledge, and as I did not\r\ncare to run to leeward, we tackt and made a Trip to the Eastward; but the\r\nwind soon after coming to the North enabled us to go clear of all. Our\r\nsoundings in passing within the Ledge was from 35 to 47 fathoms, a rocky\r\nbottom. This Ledge lies South-East, 6 Leagues from the Southermost part\r\nof the Land, and South-East by South from some remarkable hills which\r\nstand near the Shore. These rocks are not the only dangers that lay here,\r\nfor about 3 Leagues to the Northward of them is another Ledge of Rocks,\r\nlaying full 3 Leagues from the land, whereon the Sea broke very high. As\r\nwe passed these rocks in the night at no great distance, and discover'd\r\nthe others close under our Lee at daylight, it is apparent that we had a\r\nvery fortunate Escape. I have named them the Traps, because they lay as\r\nsuch to catch unweary Strangers.* (* The dangerous Traps lie south and\r\neast of the South Island of New Zealand. The Endeavour had now at last\r\ngot to the southward of the land. There is a small but high rock farther\r\nsouth, the Snares, that Cook did not sight this voyage.) At Noon our\r\nLatitude per observation was 47 degrees 26 minutes South; Longitude made\r\nfrom Cape Saunders 3 degrees 4 minutes West, the land in sight--which has\r\nvery much the appearance of an Island* (* South or Stewart\r\nIsland.)--extending North-East by North to North-West by West, distant\r\nfrom the Shore about 4 or 5 Leagues; the Eastermost ledge of rocks bore\r\nSouth-South-East, distant 1 1/2 Leagues; and Northermost North-East 1/2\r\nEast, 3 Leagues. This land is of a moderate height, and has a very barren\r\nAspect; not a Tree to be seen upon it, only a few Small Shrubs. There\r\nwere several white patches, on which the sun's rays reflected very\r\nstrongly, which I take to be a kind of Marble such as we have seen in\r\nmany places of this Country, particularly to the Northward.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 10th. P.M. Moderate breezes at North-West by North and North\r\nwith which we stood close upon a Wind to the Westward. At sunset the\r\nSouthermost point of land, which I afterwards named South Cape,* (* South\r\nCape is the southern point of Stewart Island. Cook's position for it is\r\nwonderfully exact.) and which lies in the Latitude of 47 degrees 19\r\nminutes South, Longitude 192 degrees 12 minutes West from Greenwich, bore\r\nNorth 38 degrees East, distant 4 Leagues, and the Westermost land in\r\nsight bore North 2 degrees East. This last was a small Island, lying off\r\nthe point of the Main.* (* Long Island, which lies, with others, on the\r\nwest side of Stewart Island.) I began now to think that this was the\r\nSouthermost land, and that we should be able to get round it by the West,\r\nfor we have had a large hollow swell from the South-West ever since we\r\nhad the last gale of wind from that Quarter, which makes one think there\r\nis no land in that direction. In the Night it began to blow, so that at\r\nor before daylight we were brought under our 2 Courses; but at 8 a.m. it\r\nfell moderate, and we set the Topsails close Reeft, and the Mizn and Mizn\r\nStaysail being split, we unbent them and bent others. At Noon, the wind\r\nComing at West, we Tackt and stood to the Northward, having no land in\r\nsight; our Latitude by observation was 47 degrees 33 minutes South,\r\nLongitude West from the South Cape 0 degrees 59 minutes.\r\n\r\nSunday, 11th. Winds between the West and North-West, a fresh Gale, and\r\nClear weather. Stood away North-North-East close upon a wind without\r\nseeing any land until 2 A.M., when we discover'd an Island bearing\r\nNorth-West by North, distant 4 or 5 Leagues. Two hours after this we saw\r\nthe Land ahead, upon which we Tackt and stood off until 6 o'Clock; then\r\nstood in, in order to take a nearer View of it. At 11, being about 3\r\nLeagues from the land, and the wind seem'd to incline on Shore, we Tackt\r\nand stood off to the Southward. And now we thought that the land to the\r\nSouthward, or that we have been sailing round these 2 days past, was an\r\nIsland, because there appeared an Open Channell between the North part of\r\nthat land and the South part of the other in which we thought we saw the\r\nSmall Island we were in with the 6th Instant; but when I came to lay this\r\nland down upon paper from the several bearings I had taken, it appeared\r\nthat there was but little reason to suppose it an Island. On the\r\ncontrary, I hardly have a doubt but what it joins to, and makes a part\r\nof, the Mainland,* (* Cook was deceived, as Stewart is an island.) the\r\nWestern extremity of which bore at Noon North 59 degrees West, and the\r\nIsland seen in the Morning* (* This was called by Cook Solander Island.)\r\nSouth 59 degrees West, distant 5 Leagues. Latitude observed 46 degrees 24\r\nminutes South, Longitude 192 degrees 49 minutes West. It is nothing but a\r\nbarren rock of about a Mile in Circuit, remarkably high, and lies full 5\r\nLeagues from the Main. The shore of the Main lies nearest East by South\r\nand West by North, and forms a large open bay, in which there is no\r\nappearance of a Harbour or other place of safety for shipping against\r\nSouth-West and Southerly winds. The face of the Country bears a very\r\nrugged Aspect, being full of high craggy hills, on the Summits of which\r\nwere several patches of Snow. However, the land is not wholy barren; we\r\ncould see wood, not only in the Valleys, but on several of the Hills; but\r\nwe saw no signs of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMonday, 12th. Fresh Gales between the West and North-West; latter part\r\nsqually, with rain. Stood to the South-West by South until 11 a.m., at\r\nwhich time the wind shifted to the South-West by West. We wore, and stood\r\nto the North-North-West, being then in the Latitude of 47 degrees 40\r\nminutes South, and Longitude 193 degrees 50 minutes West, having a Hollow\r\nSea from the South-West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 13th. Strong Gale between the South-West by West and\r\nSouth-South-West, with a large Hollow sea from the same Quarter. In the\r\nP.M. had frequent Squalls, with Showers of rain; in the night had several\r\nvery heavy squalls, attended with Showers of Hail, which obliged us to\r\ntake in our Topsails. During the night steer'd North-North-West until 6\r\na.m., when, seeing no land, we steer'd North by East, and set the Main\r\nTopsail, single reeft. At 8 set the Foretopsail, single reeft, and loosed\r\nall the Reefs out of the Maintopsail, and Steer'd North-East by East 1/2\r\nEast in order to make the land. At 10 saw it bearing East-North-East, and\r\nappeared to be very high; but, being hazey over it, we could see nothing\r\ndistinct neither now nor at Noon, when, by Observation, we were in the\r\nLatitude of 46 degrees 0 minutes South. Course and distance Sailed since\r\nYesterday North 5 degrees West, 96 Miles. Longitude made from the South\r\nCape 1 degree 40 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[Off the New Zealand Sounds.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 14th. In the P.M. had a fresh Gale from the Southward,\r\nattended with Squalls. At 2 it Clear'd up over the land, which appeared\r\nhigh and Mountainous. At 1/2 past 3 double reeft the Topsails, and hauld\r\nin for a Bay, wherein their appear'd to be good Anchorage, and into which\r\nI had thought of going with the Ship; but after standing in an hour, we\r\nfound the distance too great to run before dark, and it blow'd too hard\r\nto attempt it in the night, or even to keep to Windward; for these\r\nreasons we gave it up, and bore away along shore. This bay I have named\r\nDusky Bay. It lies in the Latitude of 45 degrees 47 minutes South; it is\r\nabout 3 or 4 Miles broad at the Entrance, and seems to be full as deep.\r\nIn it are several Islands, behind which there must be Shelter from all\r\nwinds, provided there is a Sufficient Depth of Water.* (* Dusky Bay is\r\none of the remarkable inlets known now as the New Zealand Sounds. They\r\nare very deep, narrow fiords, running into the high mountains, that here\r\ncome close to the shore, and are much visited now for the sake of the\r\ngrandeur of the scenery. Cook visited and surveyed Dusky Bay in his next\r\nvoyage. The Endeavour had nearly as much tempestuous weather in rounding\r\nthe south end of New Zealand as she had off the North Cape; but Cook\r\nmanaged to get a very fair idea of the coast, notwithstanding, by dint of\r\nperseverance.) The North point of this bay, when it bears South-East by\r\nSouth, is very remarkable, there being off it 5 high peaked rocks,\r\nstanding up like the 4 fingers and thumb of a Man's hand; on which\r\naccount I have named it Point Five Fingers. The land of this point is\r\nfarther remarkable by being the only Level land near it, and extends near\r\n2 Leagues to the Northward. It is pretty high, wholy cover'd with wood,\r\nand hath very much the Appearance of an Island, by its aspect being so\r\nvery different from the Land behind it, which is nothing but barren rocky\r\nMountains. At Sunset the Southermost Land in sight bore due South,\r\ndistant 5 or 6 Leagues; and as this is the Westermost point of land upon\r\nthe whole Coast I have called it West Cape. It lies about 3 Leagues to\r\nthe Southward of the bay above-mentioned, in the Latitude of 45 degrees\r\n54 minutes South, and Longitude 193 degrees 17 minutes West. The land of\r\nthis Cape seems to be of a moderate height next the Sea, and hath Nothing\r\nremarkable about it that we could see, Except a very White Clift 2 or 3\r\nLeagues to the Southward of it. The land to the Southward of Cape West\r\ntrends away towards the South-East; to the Northward of it it Trends\r\nNorth-North-East and North-East. At 7 o'Clock brought the Ship too under\r\nthe Foresail, with her head off Shore, having a fresh Gale at South by\r\nEast. At Midnight it moderated, and we wore and lay her head in shore\r\nuntil 4 a.m.; then made Sail, and Steer'd along shore North-East 1/2\r\nNorth, having a moderate breeze at South-South-East. At Noon we were by\r\nobservation in the Latitude 45 degrees 13 minutes South; Course and\r\ndistance sailed since Yesterday North 41 degrees East, 62 Miles;\r\nLongitude made from Cape West 0 degrees 29 minutes East, being at this\r\ntime about 1 1/2 Leagues from Shore. Sounded, and had no ground with 70\r\nfathoms Line. A little before Noon we passed a little Narrow opening in\r\nthe land, where there appear'd to be a very Snug Harbour,* (* Doubtful\r\nSound, another of the fiords mentioned in note above.) form'd by an\r\nIsland, in the Latitude of 45 degrees 16 minutes South; inland, behind\r\nthis Opening, were Mountains, the summits of which were Cover'd with Snow\r\nthat seem'd to have fallen lately, and this is not to be wondered at, for\r\nwe have found it very cold for these 2 days past. The land on each side\r\nthe Entrance of this Harbour riseth almost perpendicular from the Sea to\r\na very considerable Height; and this was the reason why I did not attempt\r\nto go in with the Ship, because I saw clearly that no winds could blow\r\nthere but what was right in or right out, that is, Westerly or Easterly;\r\nand it certainly would have been highly imprudent in me to have put into\r\na place where we could not have got out but with a wind that we have\r\nlately found to blow but one day in a Month. I mention this because there\r\nwas some on board that wanted me to harbour at any rate, without in the\r\nleast Considering either the present or future Consequences.\r\n\r\nThursday, 15th. Clear weather, Winds at South-West and South-West by\r\nSouth, a Gentle breeze, except in the night, when we had variable light\r\nAirs and Calm. In the evening, being about 2 Leagues from the land, we\r\nsounded, but had no ground with 103 fathoms. Variation per Azimuth 14\r\ndegrees East, per Amplitude 15 degrees 2 minutes East. With what wind we\r\nhad we made the best of our way along shore to the North-East, keeping at\r\nthe distance of 2 or 3 Leagues off from the Land. At Noon we were in the\r\nLatitude of 44 degrees 47 minutes, having run only 12 Leagues upon a\r\nNorth-East 1/4 North Course since Yesterday at Noon; Longitude made from\r\nCape West 1 degree 3 minutes East.\r\n\r\nFriday, 16th. Winds at South-West; a fresh breeze and Clear. Steer'd\r\nalong shore North-East 1/4 East until 6 p.m., when we Shortned Sail, and\r\nbrought too for the Night. Variation per Azimuth 13 degrees 48 minutes\r\nEast. At 4 A.M. made sail, and Stood in for the land. At daylight saw the\r\nappearance of an inlet into the land; but upon a nearer approach found\r\nthat it was only a deep Valley, bounded on each side by high lands, upon\r\nwhich we bore away North-East 1/4 East along shore, keeping about 4 or 5\r\nmiles off. At Noon the Northermost point of land in sight bore North 60\r\ndegrees East, distant 10 Miles; Latitude per Observation 44 degrees 5\r\nminutes; Longitude made from Cape West 2 degrees 8 minutes East.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 17th. Continued our Course along shore, having in the P.M. the\r\nadvantage of a fresh Gale at South-West. At 2, past by the point\r\nafore-mentioned, which is of a Moderate height, with deep Red Clifts,\r\ndown which falls 4 Small streams of Water, on which account it is named\r\nCascades Point. Latitude 44 degrees 0 minutes South; Longitude 2 degrees\r\n20 minutes East from Cape West. From this point the land at first Trends\r\nNorth 76 degrees East, but afterwards more to the Northward\r\nEast-North-East, 8 Leagues. From this point and near the Shore lies a\r\nsmall low Island, which bore from us South by East, distant 1 1/2\r\nLeagues. At 7 o'Clock we Shortned sail, and brought too under the\r\nTopsails, with her head off Shore, having 33 fathoms, and fine sandy\r\nbottom. At 10, had 50 fathoms, and at 12, wore in 65 fathoms, having\r\ndrove about 5 Miles North-North-West since we brought too. Two hours\r\nafter this had no ground with 140 fathoms; which shews that the soundings\r\nextend but a little way from the land. From 2 to 8 a.m. had it Calm and\r\nhazey, with drizzling rain, at which time a breeze sprung up at\r\nSouth-West, with which we steer'd along shore North-East by East 1/4\r\nEast, keeping about 3 Leagues from the land. At Noon had no Observation,\r\nbeing Hazey with rain. Our run since Yesterday at Noon is North-East by\r\nEast, 55 Miles; Longitude from Cape West 3 degrees 12 minutes East.\r\n\r\n[Off West Coast of Middle Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 18th. In the P.M. had a fresh breeze at South-West by West,\r\nattended with drizzling rain. At 8, being about 3 Leagues from the land,\r\nshortned sail, and brought too, having run 10 Leagues North-East by East\r\nsince noon; at this time had 44 fathoms, and 2 hours before had 17\r\nfathoms, fine sandy bottom, being then about 1 League from the land. Had\r\nit Calm the most part of the Night, and until 10 a.m., when a light\r\nbreeze sprung up at South-West by West. We Made sail along shore\r\nNorth-East by North, having a large swell from the West-South-West, which\r\nhad risen in the Night. At Noon Latitude in per Observation 43 degrees 4\r\nminutes South; Course and distance sail'd since Yesterday is North 54\r\ndegrees East, 54 Miles; Longitude made from Cape West 4 degrees 12\r\nminutes East. The Mountains and some of the Vallies we observed this\r\nmorning were wholy cover'd with Snow, part of which we suppos'd to have\r\nfallen in the P.M. and fore part of the Night, at the time that we had\r\nrain--and yet the weather is not Cold.* (* They did not see Mount Cook,\r\n12,300 feet high, and the highest mountain in New Zealand; no doubt the\r\nsummit was in the clouds.)\r\n\r\nMonday, 19th. In the P.M. had a fresh breeze at South-West by West and\r\nWest-South-West, which we made the most of until 6, when we shortned\r\nsail, and at 10 brought too, and sounded 115 fathoms, judging ourselves\r\nto be about 5 Leagues from the land. At midnight it fell little wind, on\r\nwhich account we made sail. At 8 a.m. the wind veer'd to the North-West\r\nby North, with which we stood to the North-East close upon a wind until\r\nnoon, at which time we Tack'd, being about 3 Leagues from the land, and\r\nby Observation in the Latitude of 42 degrees 8 minutes and Longitude from\r\nCape West 5 degrees 5 minutes East* (* The Endeavour had passed the mouth\r\nof the Grey River, the district of the great coalfields of New Zealand.)\r\nCourse and distance run since Yesterday at Noon North 35 degrees East, 68\r\nMiles; Depth of Water 65 fathoms, the land extending from North-East by\r\nNorth to South-South-West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 20th. Fresh Gales at North-West by North and North by West. P.M.\r\nfair weather; the remainder hazey, with rain, and Squall, which brought\r\nus under close Reeft Topsails. Stood to the Westward until 2 a.m., when\r\nwe made a Trip to the Eastward, and afterwards stood to the Westward\r\nuntil Noon, when, by our reckoning, we were in the Latitude of 42 degrees\r\n23 minutes South. Course and distance sail'd South 74 degrees West, 54\r\nMiles; Longitude made from Cape West 5 degrees 55 minutes East. Tack'd\r\nand stood to the Eastward.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 21st. In the P.M. had a fresh Gale at North by West, attended\r\nwith rain until 6, when the Wind shifted to South and South-South-West,\r\nand continued to blow a fresh Gale, with which we steer'd North-East by\r\nNorth until 6 A.M., at which time we haul'd in East by North in order to\r\nmake the land which we saw soon after. At Noon our Latitude per Account\r\nwas 41 degrees 37 minutes, and Longitude from Cape West 5 degrees 42\r\nminutes East; Course and distance sail'd since Yesterday North 60 degrees\r\nEast, 92 miles. At this time we were not above 3 or 4 Leagues from the\r\nland, but being very foggy upon it we could see nothing distinct, and as\r\nwe had not much wind, and a prodigious swell rowling in upon the Shore\r\nfrom the West-South-West, I did not think it safe to go nearer.\r\n\r\nThursday, 22nd. In the P.M. had a Gentle breeze from the\r\nSouth-South-West, with which we steer'd along shore North-East until 8,\r\nwhen being about 2 or 3 Leagues from shore we sounded, and had 34\r\nfathoms, upon which we haul'd off North-West by North until 11, then\r\nbrought too, having at this time 64 fathoms. At 4 a.m. made sail to the\r\nNorth-East, wind at South-South-West, a light breeze. At 8 the wind\r\nveer'd to the Westward, and soon after fell Calm; at this time we were\r\nabout 3 or 4 Miles from the Shore, and in 54 fathoms, having a large\r\nswell from the West-South-West rowling Obliquely upon the Shore, which\r\nput me under a good deal of Apprehension that we should be obliged to\r\nAnchor; but by the help of a light Air now and then from the South-West\r\nquarter we were Enabled to keep the Ship from driving much nearer the\r\nshore. At Noon the Northermost land in sight bore North-East by East 1/4\r\nEast, distant 8 or 10 Leagues; our Latitude by account was 40 degrees 55\r\nminutes South, Longitude from Cape West 6 degrees 35 minutes East; Course\r\nand distance sail'd since Yesterday at Noon North 36 degrees East, 42\r\nMiles; very foggy over the Land.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Farewell, Middle Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 23rd. Light Airs from the Southward, at intervals Calm, the fore\r\npart hazey, the remainder clear, pleasant weather. At Noon our Latitude,\r\nby observation, 40 degrees 36 minutes 30 seconds South, Longitude from\r\nCape West 6 degrees 52 minutes East; the Eastermost point of Land in\r\nsight* (* Cape Farewell, the north point of the Middle Island.) bore East\r\n10 degrees North, distant 7 Leagues, and a bluff head or point we were\r\nabreast of yesterday at Noon, off which lay some rocks above Water, bore\r\nSouth 18 degrees West, distant 6 Leagues. This point I have named Rocks\r\nPoint, Latitude 40 degrees 55 minutes South. Having now nearly run down\r\nthe whole of this North-West Coast of Tovy Poenammu, it is time I should\r\ndescribe the face of the Country as it hath at different times appeared\r\nto us. I have mentioned on the 11th Instant, at which time we were off\r\nthe Southern part of the Island, that the land seen then was rugged and\r\nmountainous; and there is great reason to believe that the same ridge of\r\nMountains extends nearly the whole length of the Island from between the\r\nWestermost Land seen that day and the Eastermost seen on the 13th. There\r\nis a space of about 6 or 8 Leagues of the sea Coast unexplored, but the\r\nMountains inland were Visible enough. The land near the Shore about Cape\r\nWest is rather low, and riseth with a gradual assent up to the foot of\r\nthe Mountains, and appear'd to be mostly covered with wood. From Point\r\nFive Fingers down to the Latitude of 44 degrees 20 minutes there is a\r\nnarrow ridge of Hills rising directly from the Sea, which are Cloathed\r\nwith wood; close behind these hills lies the ridge of Mountains, which\r\nare of a Prodidgious height, and appear to consist of nothing but barren\r\nrocks, covered in many places with large patches of Snow, which perhaps\r\nhave lain there since the Creation. No country upon Earth can appear with\r\na more rugged and barren Aspect than this doth; from the Sea for as far\r\ninland as the Eye can reach nothing is to be seen but the Summits of\r\nthese rocky Mountains, which seem to lay so near one another as not to\r\nadmit any Vallies between them. From the Latitude of 44 degrees 20\r\nminutes to the Latitude 42 degrees 8 minutes these mountains lay farther\r\ninland; the Country between them and the Sea consists of woody Hills and\r\nVallies of Various extent, both for height and Depth, and hath much the\r\nAppearance of Fertility. Many of the Vallies are large, low, and flatt,\r\nand appeared to be wholy covered with Wood; but it is very probable that\r\ngreat part of the land is taken up in Lakes, Ponds, etc., as is very\r\ncommon in such like places. From the last mentioned Latitude to Cape\r\nFarewell, afterwards so Called, the land is not distinguished by anything\r\nremarkable; it rises into hills directly from the Sea, and is covered\r\nwith wood. While we were upon this part of the Coast the weather was\r\nfoggy, in so much that we could see but a very little way inland;\r\nhowever, we sometimes saw the Summits of the Mountains above the fogg and\r\nClouds, which plainly shew'd that the inland parts were high and\r\nMountainous, and gave me great reason to think that there is a Continued\r\nChain of Mountains from the one End of the Island to the other.* (* This\r\nis, to a great extent, the case.)\r\n\r\nSaturday, 24th. In the P.M. had a Gentle breeze at South-West, which by\r\nDark run us the length of the Eastern Point set at Noon, and not knowing\r\nwhat Course the land took on the other side, we brought too in 34 fathoms\r\nabout one League from the land. At 8, it falling little wind, we fill'd\r\nand stood on until 12, at which time we brought too until 4 a.m., then\r\nmade Sail. At daylight we saw low land extending from the above point to\r\nthe East-South-East as far as the Eye could reach, the Eastern Extremity\r\nof which appear'd in round Hillocks; by this time the wind had veer'd to\r\nthe Eastward, which obliged us to ply to windward. At Noon the point\r\nabove mention'd bore South-West by South, distant 16 miles; Latitude\r\nobserv'd 40 degrees 19 minutes South. This point I afterwards named Cape\r\nFarewell, for reasons which will be given in their proper place.\r\n\r\nSunday, 25th. Winds Easterly; towards Noon had little winds and hazey,\r\nwith rain. Made several trips, but gain'd nothing to Windward, so that at\r\nNoon our Situation was nearly as Yesterday.\r\n\r\nMonday, 26th. At 3 p.m. the wind came to North, and we Steer'd\r\nEast-South-East with all the Sail we could set until dark, when we\r\nshortned sail until the morning, having thick Misty weather. All Night we\r\nkeept the lead going continually, and had from 37 to 48 fathoms. At day\r\nlight we saw the land bearing South-East by East, and an Island laying\r\nnear it bearing East-South-East, distant 5 Leagues. This I knew to be the\r\nIsland* (* Stephens Island.) seen from the Entrance of Queen Charlotte's\r\nsound, from which it bears North-West by North, Distant 9 Leagues. At\r\nNoon it bore South-East, distant 4 or 5 miles, and the North-West head of\r\nQueen Charlotte's sound bore South-East by South, distant 10 1/2 Leagues;\r\nLatitude ohserv'd 43 degrees 33 minutes South.\r\n\r\n[In Admiralty Bay, Middle Island, New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 27th. Fresh breeze of Wind Westerly, and hazey, Misty weather,\r\nwith Drizling rain. As we have now Circumnavigated the whole of this\r\nCountry, it is time for me to think of quitting it; but before I do this\r\nit will be necessary to compleat our Water first, especially as we have\r\non board above 30 Tons of Casks empty, and knowing that there is a Bay\r\nbetween the above-mentioned Island and Queen Charlotte's sound, wherein\r\nno doubt there is Anchorage and convenient Watering places. Accordingly,\r\nin the P.M. we hauled round the Island and into the bay,* (* Admiralty\r\nBay.) leaving 3 more Islands* (* Rangitoto Islets.) on our Starboard\r\nhand, which lay close under the West Shore 3 or 4 Miles within the\r\nEntrance. As we run in we keept the lead going, and had from 40 to 12\r\nfathoms. At 6 we Anchor'd in 11 fathoms, Muddy bottom, under the West\r\nShore, in the Second Cove within the fore-mentioned Island. At daylight I\r\ntook a Boat and went to look for a Watering place, and a proper birth to\r\nmoor the Ship in, both of which I found convenient enough. After the Ship\r\nwas moor'd I sent an Officer ashore to Superintend the Watering, and the\r\nCarpenter with his Crew to cut wood, while the Long boat was employed\r\ncarrying on shore Empty Casks.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 28th. Winds Westerly, which in the A.M. blow'd a fresh Gale,\r\nattended with rain. Employ'd getting on board Wood and Water and fishing;\r\nin the Latter we were pretty Successfull.\r\n\r\nThursday, 29th. In the P.M. had a Strong Gale from the Westward. A.M.\r\nVariable light Airs from the Eastward and hazey rainy weather the whole\r\nday; which, however, did not prevent us getting on board Wood and Water.\r\n\r\nFriday, 30th. Winds at South-East, a moderate breeze; the first and\r\nmiddle part dark, Hazey weather, with rain; the latter, fair. In the\r\nA.M., as the wind seem'd to be settled at South-East, and having nearly\r\ncompleated our Water, we warped the Ship out of the Cove in order to have\r\nroom to get under Sail. Before this was done it was Noon, at which time I\r\nwent away in the Pinnace, in order to examine the Bay, and to Explore as\r\nmuch of it as the little time I had would Admit.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 31st. In the P.M., after rowing a League and a half or 2\r\nLeagues up the Bay, I Landed upon a point of Land on the West side,\r\nwhere, from an Eminency, I could see this Western Arm of the Bay run in\r\nSouth-West by West, about 5 Leagues farther, yet did not see the Head of\r\nit. There appeared to be several other inlets, or at least small bays,\r\nbetween this and the North-West head of Queen Charlotte's sound, in every\r\none of which I make no doubt but what there is Anchorage and Shelter for\r\nShipping, as they are partly cover'd from the Sea wind by these Islands\r\nthat lay without them.* (* There is a maze of inlets and harbours between\r\nAdmiralty Bay and Queen Charlotte's Sound, a distance of 20 miles.) The\r\nland about this bay, at least what I could see of it, is of a very hilly,\r\nuneven Surface, and appears to be mostly cover'd with wood, Shrubs,\r\nFirns, etc., which renders Travelling both difficult and Fatiguing. I saw\r\nno inhabitants, neither have we seen any since we have been in this bay,\r\nbut met with several of their Huts, all of which appear'd to have been at\r\nleast 12 Months deserted.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to the Ship, in the Evening, I found the Water, etc., all\r\non board, and the Ship ready for Sea; and being now resolv'd to quit this\r\nCountry altogether, and to bend my thought towards returning home by such\r\na rout as might Conduce most to the Advantage of the Service I am upon, I\r\nconsulted with the Officers upon the most Eligible way of putting this in\r\nExecution. To return by the way of Cape Horn was what I most wished,\r\nbecause by this rout we should have been able to prove the Existance or\r\nNon-Existance of a Southern Continent, which yet remains Doubtfull; but\r\nin order to Ascertain this we must have kept in a higher Latitude in the\r\nvery Depth of Winter, but the Condition of the Ship, in every respect,\r\nwas not thought sufficient for such an undertaking. For the same reason\r\nthe thoughts of proceeding directly to the Cape of Good Hope was laid\r\naside, especially as no discovery of any Moment could be hoped for in\r\nthat rout. It was therefore resolved to return by way of the East Indies\r\nby the following rout: upon Leaving this Coast to steer to the Westward\r\nuntil we fall in with the East Coast of New Holland, and then to follow\r\nthe direction of that Coast to the Northward, or what other direction it\r\nmight take us, until we arrive at its Northern extremity; and if this\r\nshould be found impracticable, then to Endeavour to fall in with the Land\r\nor Islands discovered by Quiros.* (* Quiros, a Spanish navigator,\r\ndiscovered in 1605 Espiritu Santo, the northern island of the New\r\nHebrides, which he supposed to be a part of a great southern continent.\r\nCook, in his second voyage, thoroughly explored the New Hebrides group;\r\nand for some of the islands his charts are still the only guide.)\r\n\r\nWith this view, at daylight we got under Sail and put to Sea, having the\r\nAdvantage of a fresh Gale at South-East and Clear weather. At Noon the\r\nIsland, which lies off the North-West point of the Bay, bore East 9\r\ndegrees South, distant 10 Miles; our Latitude, by Observation, was 40\r\ndegrees 35 minutes South. This bay I have named Admiralty Bay; the\r\nNorth-West point Cape Stephens, and the East Point Jackson, after the 2\r\nSecretarys.* (* The two secretaries of the Admiralty, Philip Stephens and\r\nGeorge Jackson, both of whom showed great appreciation of Cook.) It may\r\nalways be known by the Island above mentioned, which is pretty high, and\r\nlies North-East, 2 Miles from Cape Stephens; Latitude 40 degrees 37\r\nminutes South; Longitude 185 degrees 6 minutes West. Between this Island\r\nand Cape Farewell, which is West by North and East by South, distant 14\r\nor 15 Leagues from each other, the Shore forms a large deep Bay, the\r\nbottom of which we could hardly see in sailing in a Strait line from the\r\none Cape to the other; but it is not at all improbable but what it is all\r\nlowland next the Sea, as we have met with less water here than on any\r\nother part of the Coast at the same distance from Land; however, a Bay\r\nthere is, and is known on the Chart by the Name of Blind Bay, but I have\r\nreason to believe it to be Tasman's Murderers' Bay.* (* Blind Bay is now\r\nalso known as Tasman Bay, and Massacre Bay is supposed to be a smaller\r\nbay in it, on the north-western side.)\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this land altogether I shall give a short general\r\ndiscription of the Country, its inhabitants, their manners, Customs,\r\netc., in which it is necessary to observe that many things are founded\r\nonly on Conjecture, for we were too short a time in any one place to\r\nlearn much of their interior policy, and therefore could only draw\r\nconclusions from what we saw at different times.\r\n\r\n[Description of New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT OF NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\nPart of the East* (* This should be West Coast.) Coast of this Country\r\nwas first discovered by Abel Tasman in 1642, and by him called New\r\nZeland; he, however, never landed upon it; probably he was discouraged\r\nfrom it by the Natives killing 3 or 4 of his People at the first and only\r\nplace he Anchor'd at. This country, which before now was thought to be a\r\npart of the imaginary Southern Continent, consists of 2 large Islands,\r\ndivided from each other by a Strait or Passage of 4 or 5 Leagues broad.\r\nThey are situated between the Latitude of 34 and 48 degrees South, and\r\nbetween the Longitude of 181 and 194 degrees West from the Meridian of\r\nGreenwich. The situation of few parts of the world are better determin'd\r\nthan these Islands are, being settled by some hundreds of Observations of\r\nthe Sun and Moon, and one of the Transit of Mercury made by Mr. Green,\r\nwho was sent out by the Royal Society to observe the Transit of Venus.\r\n\r\nThe Northermost of these Islands, as I have before observed, is called by\r\nthe Natives Aeheinomouwe and the Southermost Tovy Poenammu. The former\r\nname, we were well assured, comprehends the whole of the Northern Island;\r\nbut we were not so well satisfied with the latter whether it comprehended\r\nthe whole of the Southern Islands or only a part of it. This last,\r\naccording to the Natives of Queen Charlotte's Sound, ought to consist of\r\n2 Islands, one of which at least we were to have sail'd round in a few\r\ndays; but this was not verify'd by our own Observations. I am inclinable\r\nto think that they know'd no more of this land than what came within the\r\nLimits of their sight.* (* As before remarked, the natives at Queen\r\nCharlotte's Sound doubtless were speaking of the large peninsula and the\r\nislands which lie west of the Sound. There is a spot at the isthmus where\r\ncanoes could be hauled over.) The Chart* (* See copy of this chart.)\r\nwhich I have drawn will best point out the figure and Extent of these\r\nIslands, the situation of the Bays and Harbours they contain, and the\r\nlesser Islands lay about them.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have mentioned the Chart, I shall point out such places as are\r\ndrawn with sufficient accuracy to be depended upon and such as are not,\r\nbeginning at Cape Pallisser and proceed round Aeheinomouwe by the East\r\nCape, etc. The Coast between these 2 Capes I believe to be laid down\r\npretty accurate, both in its figure and the Course and distance from\r\npoint to point; the opportunities I had and the methods I made use on to\r\nobtain these requisites were such as could hardly admit of an Error. From\r\nthe East Cape to Cape Maria Van Diemen, altho' it cannot be perfectly\r\ntrue, yet it is without any very Material error; some few places,\r\nhowever, must be excepted, and these are very Doubtfull, and are not only\r\nhere, but in every other part of the Chart pointed out by a Pricked or\r\nbroken line. From Cape Maria Van Diemen up as high as the Latitude of 36\r\ndegrees 15 minutes we seldom were nearer the Shore than from 5 to 8\r\nLeagues, and therefore the line of the Sea Coast may in some places be\r\nerroneous. From the above Latitude to nearly the Length of Entry Island\r\nwe run along and near the shore all the way, and no circumstance occurd\r\nthat made me liable to commit any Material error. Excepting Cape\r\nTeerawhitte, we never came near the Shore between Entry Island and Cape\r\nPallisser, and therefore this part of the coast may be found to differ\r\nsomething from the truth; in Short, I believe that this Island will never\r\nbe found to differ Materially from the figure I have given it, and that\r\nthe Coast Affords few or no Harbours but what are either taken notice of\r\nin this Journal, or in some Measure pointed out in the Chart; but I\r\ncannot say so much for Tovy Poenammu. The Season of the Year and\r\nCircumstance of the Voyage would not permit me to spend so much time\r\nabout this Island as I had done at the other, and the blowing weather we\r\nfrequently met with made it both dangerous and difficult to keep upon the\r\nCoast. However, I shall point out the places that may be Erroneous in\r\nthis as I have done in the other. From Queen Charlotte's sound to Cape\r\nCampbell, and as far to the South-West as the Latitude 43 degrees, will\r\nbe found to be pretty Accurate; between this Latitude and the Latitude 44\r\ndegrees 20 minutes the coast is very Doubtfully laid down, a part of\r\nwhich we hardly, if at all, saw. From this last mentioned Latitude to\r\nCape Saunders we were generally at too great a distance to be Particular,\r\nand the weather at the same time was unfavourable. The Coast, as it is\r\nlaid down from Cape Saunders to Cape South, and even to Cape West, is no\r\ndoubt in many places very erroneous, as we hardly were ever able to keep\r\nnear the Shore, and were sometimes blown off altogether. From the West\r\nCape down to Cape Farewell, and even to Queen Charlotte's sound, will in\r\nmost places be found to differ not much from the truth.* (* Cook's open\r\nand plain statement as to the comparative accuracy of different parts of\r\nhis chart is much to be commended. It has been too much the fashion with\r\nfirst explorers to leave such matters to be discovered by the student.\r\nBut the astonishing accuracy of his outline of New Zealand must be the\r\nadmiration of all who understand the difficulties of laying down a coast;\r\nand when it is considered that this coastline is 2400 miles in extent,\r\nthe magnitude of the task will be realised by everybody. Never has a\r\ncoast been so well laid down by a first explorer, and it must have\r\nrequired unceasing vigilance and continual observation, in fair weather\r\nand foul, to arrive at such a satisfactory conclusion; and with such a\r\ndull sailer as the Endeavour was, the six and a half months occupied in\r\nthe work must be counted as a short interval in which to do it.)\r\n\r\n[Animals, Timber, etc., New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nMention is likewise made in the Chart of the appearance or aspect of the\r\nface of the Country. With respect to Tovy Poenammu, it is for the most\r\npart very Mountainous, and to all appearance a barren Country. The people\r\nin Queen Charlotte's sound--those that came off to us from under the\r\nSnowy Mountain, and the five we saw to the South-West of Cape\r\nSaunders--were all the inhabitants, or Signs of inhabitants, we saw upon\r\nthe whole Island; but most part of the Sea Coast of Aeheinomouwe, except\r\nthe South-West side, is well inhabited; and although it is a hilly,\r\nMountainous Country, yet the very Hills and Mountains are many of them\r\ncover'd with wood, and the Soil of the plains and Valleys appear'd to be\r\nvery rich and fertile, and such as we had an opportunity to examine we\r\nfound to be so, and not very much incumber'd with woods.\r\n\r\nIt was the Opinion of every body on board that all sorts of European\r\ngrain, fruit, Plants, etc., would thrive here; in short, was this Country\r\nsettled by an industrious people they would very soon be supplied not\r\nonly with the necessaries, but many of the Luxuries, of Life. The Sea,\r\nBays, and Rivers abound with a great Variety of Excellent Fish, the most\r\nof them unknown in England, besides Lobsters, which were allowed by every\r\none to be the best they ever had eat. Oysters and many other sorts of\r\nshell fish all Excellent in their kind. Sea and Water Fowls of all sorts\r\nare, however, in no great plenty; those known in Europe are Ducks, Shags,\r\nGannets, and Gulls, all of which were Eat by us, and found exceeding\r\ngood; indeed, hardly anything came Amiss to us that could be Eat by Man.\r\nLand fowl are likewise in no great plenty, and all of them, except\r\nQuails, are, I believe, unknown in Europe; these are exactly like those\r\nwe have in England. The Country is certainly destitute of all sorts of\r\nbeasts, either wild or tame, except dogs and Rats; the former are tame,\r\nand lived with the people, who breed and bring them up for no other\r\npurpose than to Eat, and rats are so scarce that not only I, but many\r\nothers in the Ship, never see one. Altho' we have seen some few Seals,\r\nand once a Sea Lion upon this Coast, yet I believe they are not only very\r\nscarce,* (* There are a good many seals round the southern part of New\r\nZealand, and a regular fishery is now established on Stewart Island. Cook\r\nsaw nothing of the few natives that occupied the southern parts of the\r\nIsland.) but seldom or ever come ashore; for if they did the Natives\r\nwould certainly find out some Method of Killing them, the Skins of which\r\nthey no doubt would preserve for Cloathing, as well as the Skins of Dogs\r\nand birds, the only Skins we ever saw among them. But they must sometimes\r\nget Whales, because many of the Patta Pattoas are made of the bones of\r\nsome such fish, and an Ornament they wear at their breast (on which they\r\nset great Value), which are supposed to be made of the Tooth of a Whale;\r\nand yet we know of no method or instrument they have to kill these\r\nAnimals.\r\n\r\nIn the woods are plenty of Excellent Timber, fit for all purposes except\r\nShips' Masts; and perhaps upon a Close Examination some might be found\r\nnot improper for that purpose. There grows spontainously everywhere a\r\nkind of very broad-bladed grass, like flags of the Nature of Hemp,* (*\r\nThe New Zealand flax (Phormium Tenax) is now a considerable article of\r\ncommerce. It furnishes a very strong fibre, and is made into rope, etc.)\r\nof which might be made the very best of Cordage and Canvas, etc. There\r\nare 2 sorts, one finer than the other; of these the Natives make Cloth,\r\nrope, Lines, netts, etc. Iron Ore is undoubtedly to be found here,\r\nparticularly about Mercury Bays, where we found great quantities of Iron\r\nsand; however, we met with no Ore of any Sort, neither did we ever see\r\nany sort of Metal with the Natives. We met with some stones at Admiralty\r\nBay that appear'd to be Mineral in some degree, but Dr. Solander was of\r\nOpinion that they contain'd no Sort of Metal* (* Gold and coal have been\r\nfound in New Zealand in large quantities. Gold at Otago and Hokatika in\r\nthe South Island, and at Thames in the North. The coalfields round the\r\nGrey River are enormous, and have no doubt a great future; and this\r\nuseful mineral is also found in the Bay of Islands, and other places in\r\nthe North Island. Other metals, as copper, silver, antimony, have also\r\nbeen found and worked.) The white stone we saw near the South Cape and\r\nsome other parts to the Southward, which I took to be a kind of Marble,\r\nsuch as I had seen on one of the Hills I was upon in Mercury Bay, Mr.\r\nBanks--I afterwards found--was of Opinion that they were Mineral to the\r\nhighest degree; he is certainly a much better Judge of these things than\r\nI am, and therefore I might be mistaken in my opinion, which was only\r\nfounded on what I had before seen not only in this Country, but in other\r\nparts where I have been; and at the same time I must observe we were not\r\nless than 6 or 8 Leagues from the Land, and nearer it was not possible\r\nfor us at that time to come without running the Ship into Apparent\r\nDanger. However, I am no Judge how far Mineral can be distinguished as\r\nsuch; certain it is that in Southern parts of this Country there are\r\nwhole Mountains of Nothing Else but stone, some of which, no doubt, may\r\nbe found to contain Metal.\r\n\r\nShould it ever become an object of settling this Country, the best place\r\nfor the first fixing of a Colony would be either in the River Thames or\r\nthe Bay of Islands; for at either of these places they would have the\r\nadvantage of a good Harbour, and by means of the former an Easy\r\nCommunication would be had, and settlements might be extended into the\r\ninland parts of the Country. For a very little trouble and Expence small\r\nVessels might be built in the River proper for the Navigation thereof. It\r\nis too much for me to assert how little water a Vessel ought to draw to\r\nNavigate this River, even so far up as I was in the Boat; this depends\r\nintirely upon the Depth of Water that is upon the bar or flat that lay\r\nbefore the narrow part of the River, which I had not an opportunity of\r\nmaking myself acquainted with, but I am of Opinion that a Vessel that\r\ndraws not above 10 or 12 feet may do it with Ease. So far as I have been\r\nable to Judge of the Genius of these people it does not appear to me to\r\nbe at all difficult for Strangers to form a settlement in this Country;\r\nthey seem to be too much divided among themselves to unite in opposing,\r\nby which means, and kind and Gentle usage, the Colonists would be able to\r\nform strong parties among them.\r\n\r\nThe Natives of this Country are a Strong, rawboned, well made, Active\r\nPeople, rather above than under the common size, especially the Men; they\r\nare of a very dark brown colour, with black hair, thin black beards, and\r\nwhite teeth, and such as do not disfigure their faces by tattowing, etc.,\r\nhave in general very good features. The Men generally were their Hair\r\nlong, Coomb'd up, and tied upon the Crown of their Heads; some of the\r\nwomen were it long and loose upon their Shoulders, old women especially;\r\nothers again were it crop'd short. Their coombs are made some of bones,\r\nand others of Wood; they sometimes Wear them as an Ornament stuck upright\r\nin their Hair. They seem to enjoy a good state of Health, and many of\r\nthem live to a good old Age.* (* The Maoris were remarkable for\r\nlongevity, and for health and strength in old age.) Many of the old and\r\nsome of the Middle aged Men have their faces mark'd or tattow'd with\r\nblack, and some few we have seen who have had their buttocks, thighs, and\r\nother parts of their bodies marked, but this is less common. The figures\r\nthey mostly use are spirals, drawn and connected together with great\r\nnicety and judgement. They are so exact in the application of these\r\nFigures that no difference can be found between the one side of the face\r\nand the other, if the whole is marked, for some have only one side, and\r\nsome a little on both sides; hardly any but the old Men have the whole\r\ntattow'd. From this I conclude that it takes up some time, perhaps Years,\r\nto finish the Operation, which all Who have begun may not have\r\nperseverance enough to go through, as the manner in which it must be done\r\nmust certainly cause intollerable pain, and may be the reason why so few\r\nare Marked at all--at least I know no other. The Women inlay the Colour\r\nof Black under the skins of their lips, and both sexes paint their faces\r\nand bodies at times more or less with red Oker, mixed with fish Oil.\r\n\r\n[Clothing of New Zealanders.]\r\n\r\nTheir common Cloathing are very much like square Thrumb'd Matts, that are\r\nmade of rope Yarns, to lay at the doors or passages into houses to clean\r\nones shoes upon. These they tie round their necks, the Thrumb'd side out,\r\nand are generally large enough to cover the body as low as the knee; they\r\nare made with very little Preparation of the broad Grass plant before\r\nmentioned. Beside the Thrumb'd Matts, as I call them, they have other\r\nmuch finer cloathing, made of the same plant after it is bleached and\r\nprepared in such a Manner that it is as white and almost as soft as flax,\r\nbut much stronger. Of this they make pieces of cloth about 5 feet long\r\nand 4 broad; these are wove some pieces close and others very open; the\r\nformer are as stout as the strongest sail cloth, and not unlike it, and\r\nyet it is all work'd or made by hand with no other Instrument than a\r\nNeedle or Bodkin. To one end of every piece is generally work'd a very\r\nneat border of different colours of 4 or 6 inches broad, and they very\r\noften Trim them with pieces of Dog Skin or birds' feathers. These pieces\r\nof Cloth they wear as they do the other, tying one End round their Necks\r\nwith a piece of string, to one end of which is fixed a Needle or Bodkin\r\nmade of Bone, by means of which they can easily fasten, or put the string\r\nthrough any part of the Cloth; they sometimes wear pieces of this kind of\r\nCloth round their Middles, as well as over their Shoulders. But this is\r\nnot common, especially with the Men, who hardly ever wear anything round\r\ntheir Middles, observing no sort of Decency in that respect; neither is\r\nit at all uncommon for them to go quite Naked without any one thing about\r\nthem besides a belt round their waists, to which is generally fastened a\r\nsmall string, which they tye round the prepuse; in this manner I have\r\nseen hundreds of them come off to and on board the Ship, but they\r\ngenerally had their proper Cloathing in the boat along with them to put\r\non if it rain'd, etc. The Women, on the other hand, always wear something\r\nround their Middle; generally a short, thrumbd Matt, which reaches as low\r\nas their Knees. Sometimes, indeed, I have seen them with only a Bunch of\r\ngrass or plants before, tyed on with a piece of fine platting made of\r\nsweet-scented grass; they likewise wear a piece of cloth over their\r\nShoulders as the Men do; this is generally of the Thrum kind. I hardly\r\never saw a Woman wear a piece of fine cloth. One day at Talago I saw a\r\nstrong proof that the Women never appear naked, at least before\r\nstrangers. Some of us hapned to land upon a small Island where several of\r\nthem were Naked in the Water, gathering of Lobsters and shell fish; as\r\nsoon as they saw us some of them hid themselves among the Rocks, and the\r\nrest remain'd in the Sea until they had made themselves Aprons of the Sea\r\nWeed; and even then, when they came out to us, they shew'd Manifest signs\r\nof Shame, and those who had no method of hiding their nakedness would by\r\nno means appear before us.\r\n\r\nThe Women have all very soft Voices, and may by that alone be known from\r\nthe Men. The Making of cloth and all other Domestick work is, I believe,\r\nwholy done by them, and the more Labourious work, such as building Boats,\r\nHouses, Tilling the ground, etc., by the Men. Both men and women wear\r\nornaments at their Ears and about their Necks; these are made of stone,\r\nbone, Shells, etc., and are variously shaped; and some I have seen wear\r\nhuman Teeth and finger Nails, and I think we were told that they did\r\nbelong to their deceased friends. The Men, when they are dressed,\r\ngenerally wear 2 or 3 long white feathers stuck upright in their Hair,\r\nand at Queen Charlotte's sound many, both men and women, wore Round Caps\r\nmade of black feathers.\r\n\r\n[War Practices of New Zealanders.]\r\n\r\nThe old men are much respected by the younger, who seem to be govern'd\r\nand directed by them on most Occasions. We at first thought that they\r\nwere united under one head or Chief, whose Name is Teeratu; we first\r\nheard of him in Poverty Bay, and he was own'd as Chief by every one we\r\nmet with from Cape Kidnappers to the Northward and Westward as far as the\r\nBay of Plenty, which is a great extent of territories for an Indian\r\nPrince. When we were upon the East Coast they always pointed inland to\r\nthe Westward for the place of his residence, which I believe to be in the\r\nBay of Plenty, and that those Hippas or fortified Towns are Barrier Towns\r\neither for or against him; but most likely the former, and if so, may be\r\nthe utmost Extent of his Dominions to the Westwards, for at Mercury bay\r\nthey did not own him as their Prince, nor no where else either to the\r\nWestward or Southward, or any other single person; for at whatever place\r\nwe put in at, or whatever people we spoke with upon the Coast, they\r\ngenerally told us that those that were at a little distance from them\r\nwere their Enemies; from which it appear'd to me that they were very much\r\ndivided into Parties, which make war one with another, and all their\r\nActions and behaviour towards us tended to prove that they are a brave,\r\nopen, war-like people, and void of Treachery.\r\n\r\nWhenever we were Visited by any number of them that had never heard or\r\nseen anything of us before they generally came off in the largest Canoe\r\nthey had, some of which will carry 60, 80, or 100 people. They always\r\nbrought their best Cloaths along with them, which they put on as soon as\r\nthey came near the Ship. In each Canoe were generally an old Man, in some\r\n2 or 3; these used always to direct the others, were better Cloathed, and\r\ngenerally carried a Halbard or Battle Axe in their hands, or some such\r\nlike thing that distinguished them from the others. As soon as they came\r\nwithin about a Stone's throw of the Ship they would there lay, and call\r\nout, \"Haromoi harenta a patoo ago!\" that is, \"Come here, come ashore with\r\nus, and we will kill you with our patoo patoos!\" and at the same time\r\nwould shake them at us. At times they would dance the War dance, and\r\nother times they would trade with and talk to us, and Answer such\r\nQuestions as were put to them with all the Calmness imaginable, and then\r\nagain begin the War Dance, shaking their Paddles, Patoo patoos, etc., and\r\nmake strange contortions at the same time. As soon as they had worked\r\nthemselves up to a proper pitch they would begin to attack us with Stones\r\nand darts, and oblige us, wether we would or no, to fire upon them.\r\nMusquetry they never regarded unless they felt the Effect; but great Guns\r\nthey did, because they threw stones farther than they could Comprehend.\r\nAfter they found that our Arms were so much superior to theirs, and that\r\nwe took no advantage of that superiority, and a little time given them to\r\nreflect upon it, they ever after were our very good friends; and we never\r\nhad an instance of their attempting to surprize or cut off any of our\r\npeople when they were ashore; opportunity for so doing they must have had\r\nat one time or another.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to account for what we have every where been told, of their\r\nEating their Enemies killed in Battle, which they most Certainly do;\r\nCircumstances enough we have seen to Convince us of the Truth of this.\r\nTupia, who holds this Custom in great aversion, hath very often Argued\r\nwith them against it, but they have always as streniously supported it,\r\nand never would own that it was wrong. It is reasonable to suppose that\r\nmen with whom this custom is found, seldom, if ever, give Quarter to\r\nthose they overcome in battle; and if so, they must fight desperately to\r\nthe very last. A strong proof of this supposition we had from the People\r\nof Queen Charlotte's sound, who told us, but a few days before we Arrived\r\nthat they had kill'd and Eat a whole boat's crew. Surely a single boat's\r\ncrew, or at least a part of them, when they found themselves beset and\r\noverpowered by numbers would have surrender'd themselves prisoners was\r\nsuch a thing practised among them. The heads of these unfortunate people\r\nthey preserved as Trophies; 4 or 5 of them they brought off to shew to\r\nus, one of which Mr. Banks bought, or rather forced them to sell, for\r\nthey parted with it with the utmost reluctancy, and afterwards would not\r\nso much as let us see one more for any thing we could offer them.\r\n\r\nIn the Article of Food these People have no great Variety; Fern roots,\r\nDogs, Fish, and wild fowl is their Chief diet, for Cocos, Yams, and Sweet\r\nPotatoes is not Cultivated every where. They dress their Victuals in the\r\nsame Manner as the people in the South Sea Islands; that is, dogs and\r\nLarge fish they bake in a hole in the ground, and small fish, birds, and\r\nShell fish, etc., they broil on the fire. Fern roots they likewise heat\r\nover the fire, then beat them out flat upon a stone with a wooden Mallet;\r\nafter this they are fit for Eating, in the doing of which they suck out\r\nthe Moist and Glutinous part, and Spit out the Fibrous parts. These ferns\r\nare much like, if not the same as, the mountain ferns in England.\r\n\r\nThey catch fish with Seans, Hooks and line, but more commonly with hooped\r\nnetts very ingeniously made; in the middle of these they tie the bait,\r\nsuch as Sea Ears, fish Gutts, etc., then sink the Nett to the bottom with\r\na stone; after it lays there a little time they haul it Gently up, and\r\nhardly ever without fish, and very often a large quantity. All their\r\nnetts are made of the broad Grass plant before mentioned; generally with\r\nno other preparation than by Splitting the blade of the plant into\r\nthreads. Their fish hooks are made of Crooked pieces of Wood, bones, and\r\nShells.\r\n\r\n[New Zealand Canoes, Houses, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe people shew great ingenuity and good workmanship in the building and\r\nframing their boats or Canoes. They are long and Narrow, and shaped very\r\nmuch like a New England Whale boat. Their large Canoes are, I believe,\r\nbuilt wholy for war, and will carry from 40 to 80 or 100 Men with their\r\nArms, etc. I shall give the Dimensions of one which I measured that lay\r\nashore at Tolago. Length 68 1/2 feet, breadth 5 feet, and Depths 3 1/2,\r\nthe bottom sharp, inclining to a wedge, and was made of 3 pieces hollow'd\r\nout to about 2 Inches or an Inch and a half thick, and well fastned\r\ntogether with strong platting. Each side consisted of one Plank only,\r\nwhich was 63 feet long and 10 or 12 Inches broad, and about 1 1/4 Inch\r\nthick, and these were well fitted and lashed to the bottom part. There\r\nwere a number of Thwarts laid a Cross and Lashed to each Gunwale as a\r\nstrengthening to the boat. The head Ornament projected 5 or 6 feet\r\nwithout the body of the Boat, and was 4 feet high; the Stern Ornament was\r\n14 feet high, about 2 feet broad, and about 1 1/2 inch thick; it was\r\nfixed upon the Stern of the Canoe like the Stern post of a Ship upon her\r\nKeel. The Ornaments of both head and Stern and the 2 side boards were of\r\nCarved Work, and, in my opinion, neither ill design'd nor executed. All\r\ntheir Canoes are built after this plan, and few are less than 20 feet\r\nlong. Some of the small ones we have seen with Outriggers, but this is\r\nnot Common. In their War Canoes they generally have a quantity of Birds'\r\nfeathers hung in Strings, and tied about the Head and stern as Additional\r\nOrnament. They are as various in the heads of their Canoes as we are in\r\nthose of our Shipping; but what is most Common is an odd Design'd Figure\r\nof a man, with as ugly a face as can be conceived, a very large Tongue\r\nsticking out of his Mouth, and Large white Eyes made of the Shells of Sea\r\nEars. Their paddles are small, light, and neatly made; they hardly ever\r\nmake use of sails, at least that we saw, and those they have are but ill\r\ncontrived, being generally a piece of netting spread between 2 poles,\r\nwhich serve for both Masts and Yards.\r\n\r\nThe Houses of these People are better calculated for a Cold than a Hot\r\nClimate; they are built low, and in the form of an oblong square. The\r\nframing is of wood or small sticks, and the sides and Covering of thatch\r\nmade of long Grass. The door is generally at one end, and no bigger than\r\nto admit of a man to Creep in and out; just within the door is the fire\r\nplace, and over the door, or on one side, is a small hole to let out the\r\nSmoke. These houses are 20 or 30 feet long, others not above half as\r\nlong; this depends upon the largeness of the Family they are to contain,\r\nfor I believe few familys are without such a House as these, altho' they\r\ndo not always live in them, especially in the summer season, when many of\r\nthem live dispers'd up and down in little Temporary Hutts, that are not\r\nsufficient to shelter them from the weather.\r\n\r\nThe Tools which they work with in building their Canoes, Houses, etc.,\r\nare adzes or Axes, some made of a hard black stone, and others of green\r\nTalk. They have Chiszels made of the same, but these are more commonly\r\nmade of Human Bones. In working small work and carving I believe they use\r\nmostly peices of Jasper, breaking small pieces from a large Lump they\r\nhave for that purpose; as soon as the small peice is blunted they throw\r\nit away and take another. To till or turn up the ground they have wooden\r\nspades (if I may so call them), made like stout pickets, with a piece of\r\nwood tied a Cross near the lower end, to put the foot upon to force them\r\ninto the Ground. These Green Talk Axes that are whole and good they set\r\nmuch Value upon, and never would part with them for anything we could\r\noffer.* (* The weapons of greenstone, found in the South Islands, were\r\nmuch prized. This hard material required years to shape into a mere, or\r\nshort club, and these were handed down from father to son as a most\r\nvaluable possession.) I offer'd one day for one, One of the best Axes I\r\nhad in the Ship, besides a number of Other things, but nothing would\r\ninduce the owner to part with it; from this I infer'd that good ones were\r\nscarce among them.\r\n\r\nDiversions and Musical instruments they have but few; the latter Consists\r\nof 2 or 3 sorts of Trumpets and a small Pipe or Whistle, and the former\r\nin singing and Dancing. Their songs are Harmonious enough, but very\r\ndoleful to a European ear. In most of their dances they appear like mad\r\nmen, Jumping and Stamping with their feet, making strange Contorsions\r\nwith every part of the body, and a hideous noise at the same time; and if\r\nthey happen to be in their Canoes they flourish with great Agility their\r\nPaddles, Pattoo Pattoos, various ways, in the doing of which, if there\r\nare ever so many boats and People, they all keep time and Motion together\r\nto a surprizing degree. It was in this manner that they work themselves\r\nto a proper Pitch of Courage before they used to attack us; and it was\r\nonly from their after behaviour that we could tell whether they were in\r\njest or in Earnest when they gave these Heivas, as they call them, of\r\ntheir own accord, especially at our first coming into a place. Their\r\nsigns of Friendship is the waving the hand or a piece of Cloth, etc.\r\n\r\nWe were never able to learn with any degree of certainty in what manner\r\nthey bury their dead; we were generally told that they put them in the\r\nground; if so it must be in some secret or by place, for we never saw the\r\nleast signs of a burying place in the whole Country.* (* The burying\r\nplaces were kept secret. The body was temporarily buried, and after some\r\ntime exhumed; the bones were cleaned, and hidden in some cave or cleft in\r\nthe rocks. As bones were used by enemies to make implements, it was a\r\npoint to keep these depositories secret, to prevent such desecration.)\r\nTheir Custom of mourning for a friend or relation is by cutting and\r\nScarifying their bodys, particularly their Arms and breasts, in such a\r\nmanner that the Scars remain indelible, and, I believe, have some\r\nsignification such as to shew how near related the deceased was to them.\r\n\r\n[Maori and Tahiti Words.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to religion, I believe these people trouble themselves very\r\nlittle about it; they, however, believe that there is one Supream God,\r\nwhom they call Tawney,* (* Probably Tane-mahuta, the creator of animal\r\nand vegetable life. The Maori does not pray.) and likewise a number of\r\nother inferior deities; but whether or no they worship or Pray to either\r\none or the other we know not with any degree of certainty. It is\r\nreasonable to suppose that they do, and I believe it; yet I never saw the\r\nleast Action or thing among them that tended to prove it. They have the\r\nsame Notions of the Creation of the World, Mankind, etc., as the people\r\nof the South Sea Islands have; indeed, many of their notions and Customs\r\nare the very same. But nothing is so great a proof of their all having\r\nhad one Source as their Language, which differ but in a very few words\r\nthe one from the other, as will appear from the following specimens,\r\nwhich I had from Mr. Banks, who understands their Language as well, or\r\nbetter than, any one on board.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: ENGLISH.\r\nCOLUMN 2: NEW ZEALAND.\r\nCOLUMN 3: SOUTH SEA ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nA Chief : Eareete : Eare.\r\nA Man : Taata : Taata.\r\nA Woman : Ivahina : Ivahine.\r\nThe Head : Eupo : Eupo.\r\nThe Hair : Macauve : --.\r\nThe Ear : Terringa : Terrea.\r\nThe Forehead : Erai : Erai.\r\nThe Eyes : Matu : Matu.\r\nThe Cheek : Paparinga : Paparea.\r\nThe Nose : Ahewh : Ahew.\r\nThe Mouth : Hangoutou : Outou.\r\nThe Chinn : Ecouwai : --.\r\nThe Teeth : Hennihu : Nihio.\r\nThe Arm : Haringaringu : Rema.\r\nThe Finger : Maticara : Maneow.\r\nThe Belly : Ateraboo : Oboo.\r\nThe Naval : Apeto : Peto.\r\nCome here : Haromai : Haromai.\r\nFish : Heica : Eyca.\r\nA Lobster : Kooura : Tooura.\r\nCoccos : Taro : Taro.\r\nSweet Potatoes : Cumala : Cumala.\r\nYamms : Tuphwhe : Tuphwhe.\r\nBirds : Mannu : Mannu.\r\nThe Wind : Mebaw : Mattai.\r\nA Thief : Amootoo : Teto.\r\nTo examine : Mataketake : Mataibai.\r\nTo sing : Eheiva : Heiva.\r\nBad : Keno : Eno.\r\nTrees : Oratou : Eraou.\r\nGrand Father : Toubouna : Toubouna.\r\nFriend : -- : Tio.\r\nNo : Kaoura : Oure.\r\nNumber 1 : Tahai : Tahai.\r\nNumber 2 : Rua : Rua.\r\nNumber 3 : Torou : Torou.\r\nNumber 4 : Ha : Hea.\r\nNumber 5 : Rema : Remo.\r\nNumber 6 : Ono : Ono.\r\nNumber 7 : Etu : Hetu.\r\nNumber 8 : Wharou : Wharou.\r\nNumber 9 : Iva : Hyva.\r\nNumber 10 : Angahourou : Ahourou.\r\nWhat do you call this or that? : Owy Terra : Owy Terra.\r\n\r\n[Speculations on a Southern Continent.]\r\n\r\nThere are some small differance in the Language spoke by the\r\nAeheinomoweans and those of Tovy Poenammu; but this differance seem'd to\r\nme to be only in the pronunciation, and is no more than what we find\r\nbetween one part of England and another. What is here inserted as a\r\nSpecimen is that spoke by the People of Aeheinomouwe. What is meant by\r\nthe South Sea Islands are those Islands we ourselves Touched at; but I\r\ngave it that title because we have always been told that the same\r\nLanguage is universally spoke by all the Islanders, and that this is a\r\nSufficient proof that both they and the New Zelanders have had one Origin\r\nor Source, but where this is even time perhaps may never discover.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is neither to the Southward nor Eastward, for I cannot\r\nperswaide myself that ever they came from America; and as to a Southern\r\nContinent, I do not believe any such thing exist, unless in a high\r\nLatitude. But as the Contrary opinion hath for many Years prevail'd, and\r\nmay yet prevail, it is necessary I should say something in support of\r\nmine more than what will be directly pointed out by the Track of this\r\nShip in those Seas; for from that alone it will evidently appear that\r\nthere is a large space extending quite to the Tropick in which we were\r\nnot, or any other before us that we can ever learn for certain. In our\r\nroute to the Northward, after doubling Cape Horn, when in the Latitude of\r\n40 degrees, we were in the Longitude of 110 degrees; and in our return to\r\nthe Southward, after leaving Ulietea, when in the same Latitude, we were\r\nin the Longitude of 145 degrees; the differance in this Latitude is 35\r\ndegrees of Longitude. In the Latitude of 30 degrees the differance of the\r\n2 Tracks is 21 degrees, and that differance continues as low as 20\r\ndegrees; but a view of the Chart will best illustrate this.\r\n\r\nHere is now room enough for the North Cape of the Southern Continent to\r\nextend to the Northward, even to a pretty low Latitude. But what\r\nfoundation have we for such a supposition? None, that I know of, but\r\nthis, that it must either be here or no where. Geographers have indeed\r\nlaid down part of Quiros' discoveries in this Longitude, and have told us\r\nthat he had these signs of a Continent, a part of which they have\r\nActually laid down in the Maps; but by what Authority I know not. Quiros,\r\nin the Latitude of 25 or 26 degrees South, discover'd 2 Islands, which, I\r\nsuppose, may lay between the Longitude of 130 and 140 degrees West.\r\nDalrymple lays them down in 146 degrees West, and says that Quiros saw to\r\nthe Southward very large hanging Clouds and a very thick Horizon, with\r\nother known signs of a Continent. Other accounts of their Voyage says not\r\na word about this; but supposing this to be true, hanging Clouds and a\r\nthick Horizon are certainly no signs of a Continent--I have had many\r\nproofs to the Contrary in the Course of this Voyage; neither do I believe\r\nthat Quiros looked upon such things as known signs of land, for if he had\r\nhe certainly would have stood to the Southward, in order to have\r\nsatisfied himself before he had gone to the Northward, for no man seems\r\nto have had discoveries more at heart than he had. Besides this, this was\r\nthe ultimate object of his Voyage.* (* It is conjectured that what Quiros\r\nsaw was Tahiti, but his track on this voyage is very vague. There are\r\ncertainly no islands in the latitude given except Pitcairn.) If Quiros\r\nwas in the Latitude of 26 degrees and Longitude 146 degrees West, then I\r\nam certain that no part of the Southern Continent can no where extend so\r\nfar to the Northward as the above mentioned Latitude. But the Voyage\r\nwhich seems to thrust it farthest back in the Longitude I am speaking of,\r\nviz., between 130 and 150 degrees West, is that of Admiral Roggeween, a\r\nDutchman, made in 1722, who, after leaving Juan Fernandes, went in search\r\nof Davis's Island; but not finding it, he ran 12 degrees more to the\r\nWest, and in the Latitude of 28 1/2 degrees discover'd Easter Island.\r\nDalrymple and some others have laid it down in 27 degrees South and 106\r\ndegrees 30 minutes West, and supposes it to be the same as Davis's Isle,\r\nwhich I think cannot be from the Circumstance of the Voyage; on the other\r\nhand Mr. Pingre, in his Treatise concerning the Transit of Venus, gives\r\nan extract of Roggeween's Voyage and a map of the South Seas, wherein he\r\nplaces Easter Island in the Latitude of 28 1/2 degrees South, and in the\r\nLongitude of 123 degrees West* (* Easter Island is in longitude 110\r\ndegrees West, and is considered identical with Davis' Island.) his reason\r\nfor so doing may be seen at large in the said Treatise. He likewise lays\r\ndown Roggeween's rout through those South Seas very different from any\r\nother Author I have seen; for after leaving Easter Island he makes him to\r\nsteer South-West to the height of 34 degrees South, and afterwards\r\nWest-North-West. If Roggeween really took this rout, then it is not\r\nprobable that there is any Main land to the Northward of 35 degrees\r\nSouth. However, Mr. Dalrymple and some Geographers have laid down\r\nRoggeween's track very different from Mr. Pingre. From Easter Isle they\r\nhave laid down his Track to the North-West, and afterwards very little\r\ndifferent from that of La Maire; and this I think is not probable, that a\r\nman who, at his own request, was sent to discover the Southern Continent\r\nshould take the same rout thro' these Seas as others had done before who\r\nhad the same thing in View; by so doing he must be Morally certain of not\r\nfinding what he was in search of, and of course must fail as they had\r\ndone. Be this as it may, it is a point that cannot be clear'd up from the\r\npublished accounts of the Voyage, which, so far from taking proper notice\r\nof their Longitude, have not even mentioned the Latitude of several of\r\nthe Islands they discover'd, so that I find it impossible to lay down\r\nRoggeween's rout with the least degree of accuracy.* (* Roggeween's track\r\nis still unknown.)\r\n\r\nBut to return to our own Voyage, which must be allowed to have set aside\r\nthe most, if not all, the Arguments and proofs that have been advanced by\r\ndifferent Authors to prove that there must be a Southern Continent; I\r\nmean to the Northward of 40 degrees South, for what may lie to the\r\nSouthward of that Latitude I know not. Certain it is that we saw no\r\nVisible signs of Land, according to my Opinion, neither in our rout to\r\nthe Northward, Southward, or Westward, until a few days before we made\r\nthe Coast of New Zeland. It is true we have often seen large flocks of\r\nBirds, but they were generally such as are always seen at a very great\r\ndistance from land; we likewise saw frequently peices of Sea or Rock\r\nWeed, but how is one to know how far this may drive to Sea. I am told,\r\nand that from undoubted Authority, that there is Yearly thrown up upon\r\nthe Coast of Ireland and Scotland a sort of Beans called Oxe Eyes, which\r\nare known to grow no where but in the West Indies; and yet these 2 places\r\nare not less than 1200 Leagues asunder. Was such things found floating\r\nupon the Water in the South Seas one would hardly be perswaided that one\r\nwas even out of sight of Land, so apt are we to Catch at everything that\r\nmay at least point out to us the favourite Object we are in persuit of;\r\nand yet experiance shews that we may be as far from it as ever.\r\n\r\nThus I have given my Opinion freely and without prejudice, not with any\r\nView to discourage any future attempts being made towards discovering the\r\nSouthern Continent; on the Contrary, as I think this Voyage will\r\nevidently make it appear that there is left but a small space to the\r\nNorthward of 40 degrees where the grand object can lay. I think it would\r\nbe a great pity that this thing, which at times has been the Object of\r\nmany Ages and Nations, should not now be wholy be clear'd up; which might\r\nvery Easily be done in one Voyage without either much trouble or danger\r\nor fear of Miscarrying, as the Navigator would know where to go to look\r\nfor it; but if, after all, no Continent was to be found, then he might\r\nturn his thoughts towards the discovery of those Multitude of Islands\r\nwhich, we are told, lay within the Tropical regions to the South of the\r\nLine, and this we have from very good Authority, as I have before hinted.\r\nThis he will always have in his power; for, unless he be directed to\r\nsearch for the Southern lands in a high Latitude, he will not, as we\r\nwere, be obliged to go farther to the Westward in the Latitude of 40\r\ndegrees than 140 or 145 degrees West, and therefore will always have it\r\nin his power to go to George's Island, where he will be sure of meeting\r\nwith refreshments to recruit his people before he sets out upon the\r\ndiscovery of the Islands.* (* Cook carried out this programme in his\r\nsecond voyage, when he set at rest for ever the speculation regarding the\r\nSouthern Continent.) But should it be thought proper to send a Ship out\r\nupon this Service while Tupia lives, and he to come out in her, in that\r\ncase she would have a prodidgious Advantage over every ship that hath\r\nbeen upon discoveries in those Seas before; for by means of Tupia,\r\nsupposing he did not accompany you himself, you would always get people\r\nto direct you from Island to Island, and would be sure of meeting with a\r\nfriendly reception and refreshment at every Island you came to. This\r\nwould enable the Navigator to make his discoveries the more perfect and\r\nCompleat; at least it would give him time so to do, for he would not be\r\nObliged to hurry through those Seas thro' any apprehentions of wanting\r\nProvisions.\r\n\r\n[Tupia's List of Islands.]\r\n\r\nI shall now add a list of those Islands which Tupia and Several others\r\nhave given us an account of, and Endeavour to point out the respective\r\nSituations from Otaheite, or George's Island; but this, with respect to\r\nmany of them, cannot be depended upon. Those marked thus (*) Tupia\r\nhimself has been at, and we have no reason to doubt his Veracity in this,\r\nby which it will appear that his Geographical knowledge of those Seas is\r\npretty Extensive; and yet I must observe that before he came with us he\r\nhardly had an Idea of any land being larger than Otaheite.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: NAME OF THE ISLANDS NORTH-EAST QUARTER.\r\nCOLUMN 2: BEARINGS FROM OTAHEITE.\r\n\r\nOopate : Between the North and North-North-East.\r\nOoura : Between the North and North-North-East.\r\nTeohcoa : Between the North and North-North-East.\r\nOryvoa : Between the North and North-North-East.\r\nOhevapato : Between the North and North-North-East.\r\nOtaah : North-North-East to North-East by North.\r\nOhevaroa : North-North-East to North-East by North.\r\nTemanno : North-North-East to North-East by North.\r\nOotta : North-North-East to North-East by North.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: NAME OF THE ISLANDS SOUTH-EAST QUARTER.\r\nCOLUMN 2: BEARINGS FROM OTAHEITE.\r\n\r\nMoutou : South to South-East.\r\nToomitoaroaro : South to South-East.\r\n*Tennowhammeatane : South to South-East.\r\nOhitetamaruire : South to South-East.\r\nOuropoe : South to South-East.\r\n*Mytea or Oznaburg Island : East-South-East and  East.\r\nOhevanue : East-South-East and  East.\r\nOhirotah : East-South-East and  East.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: NAME OF THE ISLANDS SOUTH-WEST QUARTER.\r\nCOLUMN 2: BEARINGS FROM OTAHEITE.\r\n\r\n*Imao or York Island : West by South and West-South-West.\r\n*Tapooamanue or Saunders Island : West by South and West-South-West.\r\n*Manua : Between the South and South-West.\r\n*Honue : Between the South and South-West.\r\n*Ohiteroa : Between the South and South-West.\r\nOnawhaa : Between the South and South-West.\r\nOtaohoera : Between the South and South-West.\r\nOpooroo : Between the South and South-West.\r\nOoonow : Between the South and South-West.\r\nTeorooromatiwhatea : Between the South and South-West.\r\n*Teatowhite : Between the South and South-West.\r\nOheavie : Between the South-West and West-South-West.\r\nPooromathetua : Between the South-West and West-South-West.\r\nTeamoorohete : Between the South-West and West-South-West.\r\nOhetotarive : Between the South-West and West-South-West.\r\nOhetotareva : Between the South-West and West-South-West.\r\nOhitetoutoumi : Between the South-West and West-South-West.\r\n*Mooenatayo : West.\r\nTetupatunaeo : West.\r\nOhiteteutenatu : West.\r\nOhitepoto : West.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: NAME OF THE ISLANDS NORTH-EAST QUARTER.\r\nCOLUMN 2: BEARINGS FROM OTAHEITE.\r\n\r\nWhareva : North-East.\r\nWhatteruro : North-East.\r\nTetioo : North-East.\r\nTetineohva : North-East.\r\nTerouwhah : North-East.\r\nWhaoa : North-North-East.\r\nWhaterretaah : North-North-East.\r\nWhaneanea : North-North-East.\r\nOhevatoutua : East by North.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: NAME OF THE ISLANDS NORTH-WEST QUARTER.\r\nCOLUMN 2: BEARINGS FROM OTAHEITE.\r\n\r\n*Tethuroa : North by West.\r\nOonnah : North by West.\r\nObaha : North by West.\r\nMaataah : North by West.\r\n*Huiheine : Between the North and West.\r\n*Ulietea : Between the North and West.\r\n*Otaha : Between the North and West.\r\n*Bolabola : Between the North and West.\r\n*Tubai : Between the North and West.\r\n*Maurua : Between the North and West.\r\nOpoopooa : Between the North and West.\r\nOpopatea : Between the North and West.\r\n*Whennuaouda : Between the North by West and West.\r\n*Motehea : Between the North by West and West.\r\n*Oourio : Between the North by West and West.\r\n*Orurutu : Between the North by West and West.\r\n*Oateea : Between the North by West and West.\r\nOahooahoo : Between the North by West and West.\r\nOweha : Between the North by West and West.\r\nOrotuma : Between the North by West and West.\r\nTenuna : Between the North by West and West.\r\nOrevavie : Between the North by West and West.\r\nToutepa : Between the North by West and West.\r\nOrarathoa : Between the North by West and West.\r\nOryvavai : Between the North by West and West.\r\nOahourou : Between the North by West and West.\r\n\r\nThe above list* was taken from a Chart of the Islands drawn by Tupia's\r\nown hands. (* This list is hopeless. With the exception of the Society\r\nGroup (Huiheine, and the names that follow), Imao (Eimeo), Tapooamanuo,\r\nTethuroa, and Ohiteroa, all lying near Tahiti, none can be recognised.\r\nThose north and east are no doubt names of the Paumotu Group, low coral\r\nislands, disposed in rings round lagoons, whose innumerable names are\r\nvery little known to this day, and very probably the Tahitians had their\r\nown names for them.) He at one time gave us an account of near 130\r\nIslands, but in his Chart he laid down only 74; and this is about the\r\nnumber that some others of the Natives of Otaheite gave us an account of;\r\nbut the account taken by and from different people differ sencibly one\r\nfrom another both in names and numbers. The first is owing to the want of\r\nrightly knowing how to pronounce the names of the Islands after them; but\r\nbe this as it may, it is very certain that there are these number of\r\nIslands, and very Probably a great many more, laying some where in the\r\nGreat South Sea, the greatest part of which have never been seen by any\r\nEuropean.\r\n\r\n[Historical Notes on New Zealand.]\r\n\r\nNOTES ON NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\nAs already stated by Cook in the Journal, New Zealand was first\r\ndiscovered by Abel Tasman, a Dutch navigator, in the year 1642. Sailing\r\nfrom Tasmania, he sighted the northern part of the Middle island, and\r\nanchored a little east of Cape Farewell in Massacre (Golden) Bay, so\r\ncalled by him because the Maoris cut off one of his boats, and killed\r\nthree of the crew.\r\n\r\nTasman never landed anywhere, but coasted from Massacre Bay along the\r\nwestern side of the North Island to the north point. He passed outside\r\nthe Three Kings, and thence away into the Pacific, to discover the\r\nFriendly Group.\r\n\r\nNo European eye again sighted New Zealand until Cook circumnavigated and\r\nmapped the islands.\r\n\r\nThe warlike character of the natives is well shown in this Journal. On\r\nnearly every occasion they either made, or attempted to make, an attack,\r\neven on the ships, and in self-defence firearms had constantly to be\r\nused. Nevertheless, Cook's judgment enabled him to inaugurate friendly\r\nrelations in most places where he stopped long enough to enable the\r\nnatives to become acquainted with the strangers.\r\n\r\nIt was not so with other voyagers. De Surville, a Frenchman, who called\r\nat Doubtless Bay very shortly after Cook left it, destroyed a village,\r\nand carried off a chief. Marion de Fresne was, in 1772, in the Bay of\r\nIslands, killed by the natives, with sixteen of his people, and eaten,\r\nfor violation of some of their customs, and illtreatment of some\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nOther outrages followed, committed on both sides, and it is no wonder\r\nthat, though Cook represented the advantages of the island for\r\ncolonization, it was not considered a desirable place in which to settle.\r\nThe cannibalism of the Maoris especially made people shy of the country.\r\n\r\nIntermittent communication took place between New Zealand and the new\r\nColony of New South Wales, and at last, in 1814, Samuel Marsden, a\r\nclergyman of the Church of England, who had seen Maoris in New South\r\nWales, landed in the Bay of Islands with other missionaries. This\r\nfearless and noble-minded man obtained the confidence of the Maoris, and\r\na commencement of colonization was made.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until 1840 that the New Zealand Company was formed\r\nto definitely colonize. They made their station at Wellington.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Captain Hobson, R.N., was sent as Lieutenant-Governor.\r\nLanding first at the Bay of Islands, he transferred his headquarters to\r\nthe Hauraki Gulf in September 1840, where he founded Auckland, which\r\nremained the capital until 1876, when the seat of Government was\r\ntransferred to Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe North Island, in which all these occurrences took place, contained by\r\nfar the greater number of the natives, and it seems strange now that the\r\nfirst efforts to settle were not made in the Middle Island, which has\r\nproved equally suitable for Europeans, and where the difficulties of\r\nsettlement, from the existence of a less numerous native population, were\r\nnot so great. It is not necessary here to follow the complicated history\r\nof New Zealand in later years, which unfortunately comprises several\r\nbloody wars with the Maoris.\r\n\r\nThe present prosperous condition of this great colony is well known, but\r\nit has not been effected without the rapid diminution of the natives, who\r\nhave met with the fate of most aborigines in contact with Europeans,\r\nespecially when the former were naturally bold and warlike.\r\n\r\nThe Maoris have retained the tradition of the original arrival of their\r\nrace in a fleet of canoes from a country called Hawaiki, which is by some\r\nsupposed to be Hawaii in the Sandwich Group. As we have seen, the\r\nlanguage was practically the same as that of Tahiti, and there is no\r\ndoubt that they came from some of the Polynesian islands. The date of the\r\nimmigration is supposed to be the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nEach canoe's crew settled in different parts of the North Island, and\r\nwere the founders of the different great tribes into which the New\r\nZealanders were divided. The more celebrated canoes were the Arawa,\r\nTainui, Aotea, Kuruhaupo, Takitumu, and others.\r\n\r\nThe Arawa claimed the first landing, and the principal idols came in her.\r\nOne of these is now in the possession of Sir George Grey. A large tribe\r\non the east coast still bears the name of Arawa, and her name, that of\r\nthe Tainui, and other of the canoes, are now borne by some of the great\r\nsteamships that run to New Zealand.\r\n\r\nCook, in the voyage with which we have to deal, completely examined the\r\nwhole group. His pertinacity and determination to follow the whole coast\r\nis a fine instance of his thoroughness in exploration. No weather nor\r\ndelay daunted him, and the accuracy with which he depicted the main\r\nfeatures of the outline of the islands is far beyond any of the similar\r\nwork of other voyagers. It is true that he missed in the south island\r\nmany of the fine harbours that have played such an important part in the\r\nprosperity of the Colony; but when we consider the narrowness of their\r\nentrances, and the enormous extent of the coast line which he laid down\r\nin such a short time, this is not astonishing.\r\n\r\nHis observations on the natives and on the country display great\r\nacuteness of observation, and had the settlers displayed the same spirit\r\nof fair treatment and respect for the customs of the natives, much of the\r\nbloody warfare that has stained the annals of the Colony might have been\r\naverted; though it is scarcely possible that with such a high-spirited\r\nrace the occupation of the islands, especially the North island, where\r\nthe majority of the Maoris were, could have taken place without some\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand now contains 630,000 Europeans, and 41,000 Maoris. Its\r\nexports are valued at 10,000,000 pounds, and the imports at 6,250,000\r\npounds. There are 2000 miles of railways open. Such is the result of\r\nfifty years of colonization in a fertile and rich island, the climate of\r\nwhich may be described as that of a genial England.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. PASSAGE FROM NEW ZEALAND TO NEW HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n[April 1770. From New Zealand to Australia.]\r\n\r\nSUNDAY, 1st April. In the P.M. had a moderate breeze at East, which in\r\nthe Night Veer'd to the North-East, and was attended with hazey, rainy\r\nweather. I have before made mention of our quitting New Zeland with an\r\nintention to steer to the Westward, which we accordingly did, taking our\r\ndeparture from Cape Farewell in the Latitude of 40 degrees 30 minutes\r\nSouth and Longitude 185 degrees 58 minutes West from Greenwich, which\r\nbore from us at 5 p.m. West 18 degrees North, distance 12 Miles. After\r\nthis we steer'd North-West and West-North-West, in order to give it a\r\ngood berth, until 8 o'Clock a.m., at which time we steered West, having\r\nthe Advantage of a fresh Gale at North by East. At Noon our Latitude by\r\naccount was 40 degrees 12 minutes South, Longitude made from Cape\r\nFarewell 1 degree 11 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 2nd. In the P.M. had a moderate Gale at North, with thick hazey\r\nweather, attended with rain. At 8 it fell little wind, and Veer'd to\r\nWest-South-West, at which time we Tack'd. At Midnight the wind came to\r\nSouth-South-West, and increased to a brisk gale with fair Cloudy weather,\r\nwhich we made the most of as soon as it was daylight. At Noon our\r\nLatitude, by Observation, was 40 degrees 0 minutes, and Longitude made\r\nfrom Cape Farewell 2 degrees 31 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 3rd. Cloudy weather; Winds at South-West and South-South-West, a\r\nfresh Gale, with which we made our Course good North-West by West, and\r\ndistance run from Yesterday at Noon to this day at Noon 38 1/2 Leagues.\r\nLatitude, by observation, 38 degrees 56 minutes South; Longitude made\r\nfrom Cape Farewell 4 degrees 36 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 4th. Had a steady brisk Gale at South-South-West with some\r\nflying showers of rain and large hollow Sea from the Southward. In the\r\nP.M. unbent the Maintopsail to repair, and brought another to the Yard\r\nand set it close reefed. At Noon our Latitude, by Observation, was 37\r\ndegrees 56 minutes South; Course and distance since Yesterday at Noon\r\nNorth 60 degrees West, 122 Miles; Longitude made from Cape Farewell 6\r\ndegrees 54 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 5th. Fresh Gales at South, which in the A.M. veer'd to\r\nSouth-East by South. At Noon our Latitude, by observation, was 37 degrees\r\n23 minutes South, Longitude made from Cape Farewell 9 degrees 10 minutes\r\nWest; Course and distance sail'd since Yesterday at Noon North 73 degrees\r\n15 minutes West, 37 Leagues.\r\n\r\nFriday, 6th. Winds between the South by East and South-East, with a\r\nContinued swell from the South-South-West. At Noon our Latitude in per\r\nObservation 37 degrees 18 minutes South; Course and distance sail'd since\r\nYesterday at Noon North 85 degrees West, 58 Miles. Longitude made from\r\nCape Farewell 10 degrees 35 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 7th. Gentle breezes at North-East, which in the A.M. Veer'd to\r\nNorth-West. In the P.M. found the Variation by the Mean of several\r\nAzimuths to be 13 degrees 50 minutes East, being then in the Latitude of\r\n37 degrees 23 minutes South, and Longitude 196 degrees 44 minutes West.\r\nIn the A.M. Punished Jno. Bowles, Marine, with 12 lashes for refusing to\r\ndo his duty when order'd by the Boatswain's Mate and Serjeant of Marines.\r\nAt Noon Latitude per Observation 37 degrees 35 minutes South, Longitude\r\nmade from Cape Farewell 11 degrees 34 minutes West; Course and distance\r\nrun since Yesterday noon South 70 degrees 15 minutes West, 50 Miles.\r\n\r\nSunday, 8th. Gentle breezes from the North-West and North. In the P.M.\r\nfound the Variation to be 13 degrees 56 minutes East. At Noon Latitude in\r\nper Observation 38 degrees 0 minutes South, Longitude made from Cape\r\nFarewell 13 degrees 2 minutes West; Course and distance sail'd since\r\nYesterday noon South 70 degrees 15 minutes West, 74 Miles.\r\n\r\nMonday, 9th. Gentle breezes at North-West; pleasant weather and a Smooth\r\nSea. In the A.M. saw a Tropic Bird, which, I believe, is uncommon in such\r\nhigh Latitudes. At Noon Latitude observ'd 38 degrees 29 minutes South,\r\nLongitude made from Cape Farewell 14 degrees 45 minutes West; Course and\r\ndistance sail'd since Yesterday noon South 70 degrees 15 minutes West, 86\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 10th. Gentle breezes at North-West by North, and clear settled\r\nweather. In the A.M. found the Variation, by the Amplitude, to be 11\r\ndegrees 25 minutes East, and by Azimuth 11 degrees 20 minutes. At Noon\r\nthe observed Latitude was 38 degrees 51 minutes South, and Longitude made\r\nfrom Cape Farewell 16 degrees 45 minutes; Longitude in 202 degrees 43\r\nminutes West; Course and distance sail'd since Yesterday noon South 76\r\ndegrees 45 minutes West, 96 Miles.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 11th. Gentle breezes from the North-West, and pleasant\r\nweather, with some few showers of rain. In the A.M. found the Variation\r\nto be 13 degrees 48 minutes East, which is 2 1/2 degrees more than it was\r\nyesterday, altho' I should have expected to have found it less, for the\r\nobservations were equally good. At Noon Latitude in 39 degrees 7 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude made from Cape Farewell 17 degrees 23 minutes; and\r\nCourse and distance sail'd since Yesterday noon South 62 degrees West, 34\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\nThursday, 12th. Calm, with now and then light Airs from the North-East\r\nand North-West; cloudy weather, but remarkably warm, and so it hath been\r\nfor some days past. At Noon we were in the Latitude of 39 degrees 11\r\nminutes, and Longitude from Cape Farewell 17 degrees 35 minutes West;\r\nCourse and distance sail'd since Yesterday noon South 66 degrees West, 10\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\nFriday, 13th. Light Airs next to a Calm, with Clear pleasant weather;\r\nwhat little wind we had was from the North-West quarter. In the Course of\r\nthis day found the Variation to be 12 degrees 27 minutes East, being at\r\nNoon, by observation, in the Latitude of 39 degrees 23 minutes South, and\r\nLongitude 204 degrees 2 minutes West; Course and distance since Yesterday\r\nnoon South 62 degrees West, 26 Miles, and Longitude made from Cape\r\nFarewell 18 degrees 4 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 14th. Calm serene weather, with sometimes light Airs from the\r\nNorthward. At sun set found the Variation to be 11 degrees 28 minutes\r\nEast, and in the Morning to be 11 degrees 30 minutes East. The Spritsail\r\nTopsail being wore to rags, it was condemn'd as not fit for its proper\r\nuse, and Converted to repair the 2 Top Gallant Sails, they being of\r\nthemselves so bad as not to be worth the Expence of new Canvas, but with\r\nthe help of this sail may be made to last some time longer. At Noon\r\nLatitude in 39 degrees 25 minutes South, Longitude made from Cape\r\nFarewell 18 degrees 21 minutes West; Course and distance since Yesterday\r\nnoon South 18 degrees West, 13 Miles.\r\n\r\nSunday, 15th. In the P.M. had light Airs at North, which in the A.M.\r\nincreased to a fresh Gale, with which we made the best of our way to the\r\nWestward, and by noon had run since yesterday upon a South 86 degrees 15\r\nminutes West Course, 79 Miles. Latitude in, by Observation, 39 degrees 30\r\nminutes South, and Longitude made from Cape Farewell 20 degrees 2 minutes\r\nWest. Some flying fish seen this day.\r\n\r\nMonday, 16th. Fresh Gales at North-North-West, with Cloudy, hazey\r\nweather. In the P.M. saw an Egg Bird, and yesterday a Gannet was seen;\r\nthese are Birds that we reckon never to go far from land. We kept the\r\nlead going all night, but found no soundings with 100 and 130 fathoms\r\nline. At noon we were in the Latitude of 39 degrees 40 minutes South, and\r\nhad made 22 degrees 2 minutes of Longitude from Cape Farewell; course and\r\ndistance sail'd since Yesterday at Noon South 82 degrees West, 108 Miles.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 17th. At 2 p.m. the wind came to West-South-West, at which time\r\nwe Tack'd and stood to the North-West. Before 5 o'Clock we were obliged\r\nto close reef our Topsails, having a Strong gale, with very heavy\r\nsqualls; about this time a Small land bird was seen to pearch upon the\r\nrigging. We sounded, but had no ground with 120 fathoms of line. At 8\r\no'Clock we wore and stood to the Southward until 12 at Night, then wore\r\nand stood to the North-West until 4 a.m., when we again stood to the\r\nSouthward, having a fresh Gale at West-South-West, attended with Squalls\r\nand dark hazey unsettled weather until 9; at which time it fell little\r\nwind, and the weather soon after Clear'd up, which, a little after 11,\r\ngave us an Opportunity of taking several observations of the Sun and\r\nMoon, the Mean result of which gave 207 degrees 56 minutes West Longitude\r\nfrom the Meridian of Greenwich. From these observations the Longitude of\r\nthe Ship at Noon was 207 degrees 58 minutes, and by the Log 208 degrees\r\n20 minutes, the difference being only 22 minutes; and this Error may as\r\nwell be in the one as the other. Our Latitude at Noon was 39 degrees 36\r\nminutes South, the Longitude made from Cape Farewell 22 degrees 22\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 18th. Winds Southerly, a hard gale, with heavy squalls,\r\nattended with Showers of rain and a great Sea from the same Quarter. At 3\r\np.m. Close reeft the Topsails, handed the Main and Mizen Topsail, and got\r\ndown Top Gallant Yards. At 6 the Gale increased to such a height as to\r\noblige us to take in the Foretopsail and Mainsail, and to run under the\r\nForesail and Mizen all night; Sounding every 2 hours, but found no ground\r\nwith 120 fathoms. At 6 a.m. set the Mainsail, and soon after the\r\nForetopsail, and before Noon the Maintopsail, both close reeft. At Noon\r\nour Latitude by observation was 38 degrees 45 minutes South, Longitude\r\nfrom Cape Farewell 23 degrees 43 minutes West; and Course and distance\r\nrun since Yesterday noon North 51 degrees West, 82 Miles. Last night we\r\nsaw a Port Egmont Hen, and this morning 2 More, a Pintado bird, several\r\nAlbetrosses, and black sheer Waters. The first of these birds are Certain\r\nsigns of the nearness of land; indeed we cannot be far from it. By our\r\nLongitude we are a degree to the Westward of the East side of Van\r\nDiemen's Land, according to Tasman, the first discoverer's, Longitude of\r\nit, who could not err much in so short a run as from this land to New\r\nZeland; and by our Latitude we could not be above 50 or 55 Leagues to the\r\nNorthward of the place where he took his departure from.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. EXPLORATION OF EAST COAST OF AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n[April 1770.]\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, 19th. In the P.M. had fresh Gales at South-South-West and\r\nCloudy Squally weather, with a large Southerly Sea; at 6 took in the\r\nTopsails, and at 1 A.M. brought too and Sounded, but had no ground with\r\n130 fathoms of line. At 5, set the Topsails close reef'd, and 6, saw\r\nland* (* The south-east coast of Australia. See chart.) extending from\r\nNorth-East to West, distance 5 or 6 Leagues, having 80 fathoms, fine\r\nsandy bottom. We continued standing to the Westward with the Wind at\r\nSouth-South-West until 8, at which time we got Topgallant Yards a Cross,\r\nmade all sail, and bore away along shore North-East for the Eastermost\r\nland we had in sight, being at this time in the Latitude of 37 degrees 58\r\nminutes South, and Longitude of 210 degrees 39 minutes West. The\r\nSouthermost point of land we had in sight, which bore from us West 1/4\r\nSouth, I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38 degrees 0 minutes South and\r\nin the Longitude of 211 degrees 7 minutes West from the Meridian of\r\nGreenwich. I have named it Point Hicks, because Lieutenant Hicks was the\r\nfirst who discover'd this Land. To the Southward of this point we could\r\nsee no land, and yet it was clear in that Quarter, and by our Longitude\r\ncompared with that of Tasman's, the body of Van Diemen's land ought to\r\nhave bore due South from us, and from the soon falling of the Sea after\r\nthe wind abated I had reason to think it did; but as we did not see it,\r\nand finding the Coast to trend North-East and South-West, or rather more\r\nto the Westward, makes me Doubtfull whether they are one land or no.* (*\r\nHad not the gale on the day before forced Cook to run to the northward,\r\nhe would have made the north end of the Furneaux Group, and probably have\r\ndiscovered Bass Strait, which would have cleared up the doubt, which he\r\nevidently felt, as to whether Tasmania was an island or not. The fact was\r\nnot positively known until Dr. Bass sailed through the Strait in a\r\nwhale-boat in 1797. Point Hicks was merely a rise in the coast-line,\r\nwhere it dipped below the horizon to the westward, and the name of Point\r\nHicks Hill is now borne by an elevation that seems to agree with the\r\nposition.) However, every one who compares this Journal with that of\r\nTasman's will be as good a judge as I am; but it is necessary to observe\r\nthat I do not take the Situation of Vandiemen's from the Printed Charts,\r\nbut from the extract of Tasman's Journal, published by Dirk Rembrantse.\r\nAt Noon we were in the Latitude of 37 degrees 50 minutes and Longitude of\r\n210 degrees 29 minutes West. The extreams of the Land extending from\r\nNorth-West to East-North-East, a remarkable point, bore North 20 degrees\r\nEast, distant 4 Leagues. This point rises to a round hillock very much\r\nlike the Ramhead going into Plymouth sound, on which account I called it\r\nby the same name; Latitude 37 degrees 39 minutes, Longitude 210 degrees\r\n22 minutes West. The Variation by an Azimuth taken this morning was 8\r\ndegrees 7 minutes East. What we have as yet seen of this land appears\r\nrather low, and not very hilly, the face of the Country green and Woody,\r\nbut the Sea shore is all a white Sand.\r\n\r\nFriday, 20th. In the P.M. and most part of the night had a fresh Gale\r\nWesterly, with Squalls, attended with Showers of rain. In the A.M. had\r\nthe Wind at South-West, with Severe weather. At 1 p.m. saw 3 Water Spouts\r\nat once; 2 were between us and the Shore, and one at some distance upon\r\nour Larboard Quarter. At 6, shortned sail, and brought too for the Night,\r\nhaving 56 fathoms fine sandy bottom. The Northermost land in sight bore\r\nNorth by East 1/2 East, and a small Island* (* Gabo Island.) lying close\r\nto a point on the Main bore West, distant 2 Leagues. This point I have\r\nnamed Cape Howe* (* Cape Howe, called after Admiral Earl Howe, is the\r\nsouth-east point of Australia. The position is almost exact.); it may be\r\nknown by the Trending of the Coast, which is North on the one Side and\r\nSouth-West on the other. Latitude 37 degrees 28 minutes South; Longitude\r\n210 degrees 3 minutes West. It may likewise be known by some round hills\r\nupon the main just within it. Having brought too with her head off Shore,\r\nwe at 10 wore, and lay her head in until 4 a.m., at which time we made\r\nsail along shore to the Northward. At 6, the Northermost land in sight\r\nbore North, being at this time about 4 Leagues from the Land. At Noon we\r\nwere in the Latitude of 36 degrees 51 minutes South and Longitude of 209\r\ndegrees 53 minutes West, and 3 Leagues from the land. Course sail'd along\r\nshore since Yesterday at Noon was first North 52 degrees East, 30 miles,\r\nthen North by East and North by West, 41 Miles. The weather being clear\r\ngave us an opportunity to View the Country, which had a very agreeable\r\nand promising aspect, diversified with hills, ridges, plains, and\r\nValleys, with some few small lawns; but for the most part the whole was\r\ncovered with wood, the hills and ridges rise with a gentle slope; they\r\nare not high, neither are there many of them.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Dromedary, New South Wales.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 21st. Winds Southerly, a Gentle breeze, and Clear weather, with\r\nwhich we coasted along shore to the Northward. In the P.M. we saw the\r\nsmoke of fire in several places; a Certain sign that the Country is\r\ninhabited. At 6, being about 2 or 3 Leagues from the land, we shortned\r\nSail, and Sounded and found 44 fathoms, a sandy bottom. Stood on under an\r\neasey sail until 12 o'Clock, at which time we brought too until 4 A.M.,\r\nwhen we made sail, having then 90 fathoms, 5 Leagues from the land. At 6,\r\nwe were abreast of a pretty high Mountain laying near the Shore, which,\r\non account of its figure, I named Mount Dromedary (Latitude 36 degrees 18\r\nminutes South, Longitude 209 degrees 55 minutes West). The shore under\r\nthe foot of the Mountain forms a point, which I have named Cape\r\nDromedary, over which is a peaked hillock. At this time found the\r\nVariation to be 10 degrees 42 minutes East. Between 10 and 11 o'Clock Mr.\r\nGreen and I took several Observations of the Sun and Moon, the mean\r\nresult of which gave 209 degrees 17 minutes West Longitude from the\r\nMeridian of Greenwich. By observation made yesterday we were in the\r\nLongitude 210 degrees 9 minutes. West 20 minutes gives 209 degrees 49\r\nminutes the Longitude of the Ship to-day at noon per yesterday's\r\nobservation, the Mean of which and to-day's give 209 degrees 33 minutes\r\nWest, by which I fix the Longitude of this Coast. Our Latitude at Noon\r\nwas 35 degrees 49 minutes South; Cape Dromedary bore South 30 degrees\r\nWest, distant 12 Leagues. An Open Bay* (* Bateman Bay.) wherein lay 3 or\r\n4 Small Islands, bore North-West by West, distant 5 or 6 Leagues. This\r\nBay seem'd to be but very little Shelter'd from the Sea Winds, and yet it\r\nis the only likely Anchoring place I have yet seen upon the Coast.\r\n\r\nSunday, 22nd. In the P.M. had a Gentle breeze at South by West with which\r\nwe steer'd along shore North by East and North-North-East at the distance\r\nof about 3 Leagues. Saw the smoke of fire in several places near the Sea\r\nbeach. At 5, we were abreast of a point of land which, on account of its\r\nperpendicular Clifts, I call'd Point Upright; Latitude 35 degrees 35\r\nminutes South; it bore from us due West, distant 2 Leagues, and in this\r\nSituation had 31 fathoms, Sandy bottom. At 6, falling little wind, we\r\nhauld off East-North-East; at this time the Northermost land in sight\r\nbore North by East 1/2 East, and at midnight, being in 70 fathoms, we\r\nbrought too until 4 A.M., at which time we made sail in for the land, and\r\nat daylight found ourselves nearly in the same Place we were at 5 o'Clock\r\nin the evening, by which it was apparent that we had been drove about 3\r\nLeagues to the Southward by a Tide or Current in the night. After this we\r\nsteer'd along shore North-North-East, having a Gentle breeze at\r\nSouth-West, and were so near the Shore as to distinguish several people\r\nupon the Sea beach. They appeared to be of a very dark or black Colour;\r\nbut whether this was the real Colour of their skins or the Cloathes they\r\nmight have on I know not. At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude\r\nof 35 degrees 27 minutes and Longitude 209 degrees 23 minutes; Cape\r\nDromedary bore South 28 degrees West, distance 15 Leagues. A remarkable\r\npeak'd hill laying inland, the Top of which looked like a Pigeon house,\r\nand occasioned my giving it that name, bore North 32 degrees 33 minutes\r\nWest, and a small low Island, laying close under the Shore, bore\r\nNorth-West, distance 2 or 3 Leagues; Variation of the Compass 9 degrees\r\n50 minutes East. When we first discover'd this Island in the morning I\r\nwas in hopes, from its appearance, that we should have found Shelter for\r\nthe Ship behind it; but when we came to approach it near I did not think\r\nthat there was even security for a Boat to land. But this, I believe, I\r\nshould have attempted had not the wind come on Shore, after which I did\r\nnot think it safe to send a Boat from the Ship, as we had a large hollow\r\nSea from the South-East rowling in upon the land, which beat every where\r\nvery high upon the Shore; and this we have had ever since we came upon\r\nthe Coast. The land near the Sea coast still continues of a moderate\r\nheight, forming alternately rocky points and Sandy beaches; but inland,\r\nbetween Mount Dromedary and the Pigeon house, are several pretty high\r\nMountains, 2 only of which we saw but what were covered with Trees, and\r\nthese lay inland behind the Pigeon House, and are remarkably flat a Top,\r\nwith Steep rocky clifts all round them. As far as we could see the Trees\r\nin this Country hath all the appearance of being stout and lofty. For\r\nthese 2 days past the observed Latitude hath been 12 or 14 Miles to the\r\nSouthward of the Ship's account given by the Log, which can be owing to\r\nnothing but a Current set to the Southward.\r\n\r\nMonday, 23rd. In the P.M. had a Gentle breeze at East, which in the night\r\nveer'd to North-East and North. At 1/2 past 4 P.M., being about 5 Miles\r\nfrom the Land, we Tack'd and stood off South-East and East until 4 A.M.,\r\nat which time we Tack'd and stood in, being then about 9 or 10 Leagues\r\nfrom the land. At 8, it fell little wind, and soon after Calm. At Noon we\r\nwere by Observation in the Latitude of 35 degrees 38 minutes and about 6\r\nLeagues from the land, Mount Dromedary bearing South 37 degrees West,\r\ndistant 17 Leagues, and the Pidgeon house North 40 degrees West; in this\r\nsituation had 74 fathoms.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 24th. In the P.M. had Variable light Airs and Calms until 6\r\no'Clock, at which time a breeze sprung up at North by West; at this time\r\nwe had 70 fathoms Water, being about 4 or 5 Leagues from the land, the\r\nPidgeon house bearing North 40 degrees West, Mount Dromedary South 30\r\ndegrees West, and the Northermost land in sight North 19 degrees East.\r\nStood to the North-East until Noon, having a Gentle breeze at North-West,\r\nat which time we Tack'd and stood to the Westward, being then, by\r\nobservation, in the Latitude of 35 degrees 10 minutes South and Longitude\r\n208 degrees 51 minutes West. A point of land which I named Cape St.\r\nGeorge, we having discovered it on that Saint's day, bore West, distant\r\n19 Miles, and the Pidgeon house South 7 degrees West, the Latitude and\r\nLongitude of which I found to be 35 degrees 19 minutes South and 209\r\ndegrees 42 minutes West. In the morning we found the Variation to be, by\r\nthe Amplitude, 7 degrees 50 minutes East, by several Azimuths 7 degrees\r\n54 minutes East.\r\n\r\n[Off Jervis Bay, New South Wales.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 25th. In the P.M. had a fresh breeze at North-West until 3\r\no'Clock, at which time it came to West, and we Tack'd and stood to the\r\nNorthward. At 5 o'Clock, being about 5 or 6 Leagues from the land, the\r\nPidgeon house bearing West-South-West, distant 9 Leagues, sounded and had\r\n86 fathoms. At 8, being very squally, with lightning, we close reef'd the\r\nTopsails and brought too, being then in 120 fathoms. At 3 A.M. made sail\r\nagain to the Northward, having the advantage of a fresh Gale at\r\nSouth-West. At Noon we were about 3 or 4 Leagues from the land and in the\r\nLatitude of 34 degrees 22 minutes and Longitude 208 degrees 36 minutes\r\nWest. Course and distance sail'd since Yesterday noon is North by East 49\r\nMiles. In the Course of this day's run we saw the Smoke of fire in\r\nseveral places near the Sea beach. About 2 Leagues to the Northward of\r\nCape St. George the Shore seems to form a bay,* (* Jervis Bay, a very\r\nfine port, but little use has been made of it up to the present time.)\r\nwhich appear'd to be shelter'd from the North-East winds; but as we had\r\nthe wind it was not in my power to look into it, and the appearance was\r\nnot favourable enough to induce me to loose time in beating up to it. The\r\nNorth point of this bay, on account of its Figure, I nam'd Long Nose.\r\nLatitude 45 degrees 4 minutes South, 8 Leagues to the Northward of this,\r\nis a point which I call'd Red Point; some part of the Land about it\r\nappeared of that Colour (Latitude 34 degrees 29 minutes South, Longitude\r\n208 degrees 49 minutes West). A little way inland to the North-West of\r\nthis point is a round hill, the top of which look'd like the Crown of a\r\nHatt.\r\n\r\nThursday, 26th. Clear, serene weather. In the P.M. had a light breeze at\r\nNorth-North-West until 5, at which time it fell Calm, we being then about\r\n3 or 4 Leagues from the land and in 48 fathoms. Variation by Azimuth 8\r\ndegrees 48 minutes East, the extreams of the land from North-East by\r\nNorth to South-West by South. Saw several smokes along shore before dark,\r\nand 2 or 3 times a fire. In the Night we lay becalm'd, driving in before\r\nthe Sea, until one o'Clock A.M., at which time we got a breeze from the\r\nland, with which we steer'd North-East, being then in 38 fathoms water.\r\nAt Noon it fell little Wind, and veer'd to North-East by North, we being\r\nthen in the Latitude of 34 degrees 10 minutes and Longitude 208 degrees\r\n27 minutes West, and about 5 Leagues from the land, which extended from\r\nSouth 37 degrees West to North 1/2 East. In this Latitude are some White\r\nClifts, which rise perpendicular from the Sea to a moderate height.\r\n\r\nFriday, 27th. Var'ble light Airs between the North-East and North-West,\r\nclear pleasant weather. In the P.M. stood off Shore until 2, then Tackt\r\nand Stood in till 6, at which time we tack'd and stood off, being then in\r\n54 fathoms and about 4 or 5 miles from the land, the Extreams of which\r\nbore from South, 28 degrees West to North 25 degrees 30 minutes East. At\r\n12 we tack'd and stood in until 4 A.M., then made a Trip off until day\r\nlight, after which we stood in for the land; in all this time we lost\r\nground, owing a good deal to the Variableness of the winds, for at Noon\r\nwe were by Observation in the Latitude of 34 degrees 21 minutes South,\r\nRed Point bearing South 27 degrees West, distant 3 Leagues. In this\r\nSituation we were about 4 or 5 Miles from the land, which extended from\r\nSouth 19 degrees 30 minutes West to North 29 degrees East.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 28th. In the P.M. hoisted out the Pinnace and Yawl in order to\r\nattempt a landing, but the Pinnace took in the Water so fast that she was\r\nobliged to be hoisted in again to stop her leakes. At this time we saw\r\nseveral people a shore, 4 of whom where carrying a small Boat or Canoe,\r\nwhich we imagin'd they were going to put in to the Water in order to Come\r\noff to us; but in this we were mistaken. Being now not above 2 Miles from\r\nthe Shore Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and myself put off in the Yawl,\r\nand pull'd in for the land to a place where we saw 4 or 5 of the Natives,\r\nwho took to the Woods as we approached the Shore; which disappointed us\r\nin the expectation we had of getting a near View of them, if not to speak\r\nto them. But our disappointment was heightened when we found that we no\r\nwhere could effect a landing by reason of the great Surf which beat\r\neverywhere upon the shore. We saw haul'd up upon the beach 3 or 4 small\r\nCanoes, which to us appeared not much unlike the Small ones of New\r\nZeland. In the wood were several Trees of the Palm kind, and no under\r\nwood; and this was all we were able to observe from the boat, after which\r\nwe return'd to the Ship about 5 in the evening.* (* The place where Cook\r\nattempted to land is near Bulli, a place where there is now considerable\r\nexport of coal. A large coal port, Wollongong, lies a little to the\r\nsouthward.) At this time it fell Calm, and we were not above a Mile and a\r\nhalf from the Shore, in 11 fathoms, and within some breakers that lay to\r\nthe Southward of us; but luckily a light breeze came off from the Land,\r\nwhich carried us out of danger, and with which we stood to the Northward.\r\nAt daylight in the morning we discover'd a Bay,* (* Botany Bay.) which\r\nappeared to be tollerably well shelter'd from all winds, into which I\r\nresolved to go with the Ship, and with this View sent the Master in the\r\nPinnace to sound the Entrance, while we keept turning up with the Ship,\r\nhaving the wind right out. At noon the Entrance bore North-North-West,\r\ndistance 1 Mile.\r\n\r\n[At Anchor, Botany Bay, New South Wales.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 29th. In the P.M. wind Southerly and Clear weather, with which we\r\nstood into the bay and Anchored under the South shore about 2 miles\r\nwithin the Entrance in 5 fathoms, the South point bearing South-East and\r\nthe North point East. Saw, as we came in, on both points of the bay,\r\nseveral of the Natives and a few hutts; Men, Women, and Children on the\r\nSouth Shore abreast of the Ship, to which place I went in the Boats in\r\nhopes of speaking with them, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and\r\nTupia. As we approached the Shore they all made off, except 2 Men, who\r\nseem'd resolved to oppose our landing. As soon as I saw this I order'd\r\nthe boats to lay upon their Oars, in order to speak to them; but this was\r\nto little purpose, for neither us nor Tupia could understand one word\r\nthey said. We then threw them some nails, beads, etc., a shore, which\r\nthey took up, and seem'd not ill pleased with, in so much that I thought\r\nthat they beckon'd to us to come ashore; but in this we were mistaken,\r\nfor as soon as we put the boat in they again came to oppose us, upon\r\nwhich I fir'd a musquet between the 2, which had no other Effect than to\r\nmake them retire back, where bundles of their darts lay, and one of them\r\ntook up a stone and threw at us, which caused my firing a Second Musquet,\r\nload with small Shott; and altho' some of the shott struck the man, yet\r\nit had no other effect than making him lay hold on a Target. Immediately\r\nafter this we landed, which we had no sooner done than they throw'd 2\r\ndarts at us; this obliged me to fire a third shott, soon after which they\r\nboth made off, but not in such haste but what we might have taken one;\r\nbut Mr. Banks being of Opinion that the darts were poisoned, made me\r\ncautious how I advanced into the Woods. We found here a few small hutts\r\nmade of the Bark of Trees, in one of which were 4 or 5 Small Children,\r\nwith whom we left some strings of beads, etc. A quantity of Darts lay\r\nabout the Hutts; these we took away with us. 3 Canoes lay upon the beach,\r\nthe worst I think I ever saw; they were about 12 or 14 feet long, made of\r\none piece of the Bark of a Tree, drawn or tied up at each end, and the\r\nmiddle keept open by means of pieces of Stick by way of Thwarts. After\r\nsearching for fresh water without success, except a little in a Small\r\nhole dug in the Sand, we embarqued, and went over to the North point of\r\nthe bay, where in coming in we saw several people; but when we landed now\r\nthere were nobody to be seen. We found here some fresh Water, which came\r\ntrinkling down and stood in pools among the rocks; but as this was\r\ntroublesome to come at I sent a party of men ashore in the morning to the\r\nplace where we first landed to dig holes in the sand, by which means and\r\na Small stream they found fresh Water sufficient to Water the Ship. The\r\nString of Beads, etc., we had left with the Children last night were\r\nfound laying in the Hutts this morning; probably the Natives were afraid\r\nto take them away. After breakfast we sent some Empty Casks a shore and a\r\nparty of Men to cut wood, and I went myself in the Pinnace to sound and\r\nexplore the Bay, in the doing of which I saw some of the Natives; but\r\nthey all fled at my Approach. I landed in 2 places, one of which the\r\npeople had but just left, as there were small fires and fresh Muscles\r\nbroiling upon them; here likewise lay Vast heaps of the largest Oyster\r\nShells I ever saw.\r\n\r\nMonday, 30th. As Soon as the Wooders and Waterers were come on board to\r\nDinner 10 or 12 of the Natives came to the watering place, and took away\r\ntheir Canoes that lay there, but did not offer to touch any one of our\r\nCasks that had been left ashore; and in the afternoon 16 or 18 of them\r\ncame boldly up to within 100 yards of our people at the watering place,\r\nand there made a stand. Mr. Hicks, who was the Officer ashore, did all in\r\nhis power to intice them to him by offering them presents; but it was to\r\nno purpose, all they seem'd to want was for us to be gone. After staying\r\na Short time they went away. They were all Arm'd with Darts and wooden\r\nSwords; the darts have each 4 prongs, and pointed with fish bones. Those\r\nwe have seen seem to be intended more for striking fish than offensive\r\nWeapons; neither are they poisoned, as we at first thought. After I had\r\nreturn'd from sounding the Bay I went over to a Cove on the North side of\r\nthe Bay, where, in 3 or 4 Hauls with the Sean, we caught about 300 pounds\r\nweight of Fish, which I caused to be equally divided among the Ship's\r\nCompany. In the A.M. I went in the Pinnace to sound and explore the North\r\nside of the bay, where I neither met with inhabitants or anything\r\nremarkable. Mr. Green took the Sun's Meridian Altitude a little within\r\nthe South Entrance of the Bay, which gave the Latitude 34 degrees 0\r\nminutes South.\r\n\r\n[May 1770.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, May 1st. Gentle breezes, Northerly. In the P.M. 10 of the\r\nNatives again visited the Watering place. I, being on board at this time,\r\nwent immediately ashore, but before I got there they were going away. I\r\nfollow'd them alone and unarm'd some distance along shore, but they would\r\nnot stop until they got farther off than I choose to trust myself. These\r\nwere armed in the same manner as those that came Yesterday. In the\r\nevening I sent some hands to haul the Saine, but they caught but a very\r\nfew fish. A little after sunrise I found the Variation to be 11 degrees 3\r\nminutes East. Last night Forby Sutherland, Seaman, departed this Life,\r\nand in the A.M. his body Was buried ashore at the watering place, which\r\noccasioned my calling the south point of this bay after his name. This\r\nmorning a party of us went ashore to some Hutts, not far from the\r\nWatering place, where some of the Natives are daily seen; here we left\r\nseveral articles, such as Cloth, Looking Glasses, Coombs, Beads, Nails,\r\netc.; after this we made an Excursion into the Country, which we found\r\ndiversified with Woods, Lawns, and Marshes. The woods are free from\r\nunderwood of every kind, and the trees are at such a distance from one\r\nanother that the whole Country, or at least great part of it, might be\r\nCultivated without being obliged to cut down a single tree. We found the\r\nSoil every where, except in the Marshes, to be a light white sand, and\r\nproduceth a quantity of good Grass, which grows in little Tufts about as\r\nbig as one can hold in one's hand, and pretty close to one another; in\r\nthis manner the Surface of the Ground is Coated. In the woods between the\r\nTrees Dr. Solander had a bare sight of a Small Animal something like a\r\nRabbit, and we found the Dung of an Animal* (* This was the kangaroo.)\r\nwhich must feed upon Grass, and which, we judge, could not be less than a\r\nDeer; we also saw the Track of a Dog, or some such like Animal. We met\r\nwith some Hutts and places where the Natives had been, and at our first\r\nsetting out one of them was seen; the others, I suppose, had fled upon\r\nour Approach. I saw some Trees that had been cut down by the Natives with\r\nsome sort of a Blunt instrument, and several Trees that were barqued, the\r\nbark of which had been cut by the same instrument; in many of the Trees,\r\nespecially the Palms, were cut steps of about 3 or 4 feet asunder for the\r\nconveniency of Climbing them. We found 2 Sorts of Gum, one sort of which\r\nis like Gum Dragon, and is the same, I suppose, Tasman took for Gum lac;\r\nit is extracted from the largest tree in the Woods.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 2nd. Between 3 and 4 in the P.M. we return'd out of the\r\nCountry, and after Dinner went ashore to the watering place, where we had\r\nnot been long before 17 or 18 of the Natives appeared in sight. In the\r\nmorning I had sent Mr. Gore, with a boat, up to the head of the Bay to\r\ndrudge for Oysters; in his return to the Ship he and another person came\r\nby land, and met with these people, who followed him at the Distance of\r\n10 or 20 Yards. Whenever Mr. Gore made a stand and faced them they stood\r\nalso, and notwithstanding they were all Arm'd, they never offer'd to\r\nAttack him; but after he had parted from them, and they were met by Dr.\r\nMonkhouse and one or 2 more, who, upon making a Sham retreat, they\r\nthrow'd 3 darts after them, after which they began to retire. Dr.\r\nSolander, I, and Tupia made all the haste we could after them, but could\r\nnot, either by words or Actions, prevail upon them to come near us, Mr.\r\nGore saw some up the Bay, who by signs invited him ashore, which he\r\nprudently declined. In the A.M. had the wind in the South-East with rain,\r\nwhich prevented me from making an Excursion up the head of the bay as I\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nThursday, 3rd. Winds at South-East, a Gentle breeze and fair weather. In\r\nthe P.M. I made a little excursion along the Sea Coast to the Southward,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. At our first entering the\r\nwoods we saw 3 of the Natives, who made off as soon as they saw us; more\r\nof them were seen by others of our people, who likewise made off as soon\r\nas they found they were discover'd. In the A.M. I went in the Pinnace to\r\nthe head of the bay, accompanied by Drs. Solander and Monkhouse, in order\r\nto Examine the Country, and to try to form some Connections with the\r\nNatives. In our way thither we met with 10 or 12 of them fishing, each in\r\na Small Canoe, who retir'd into Shoald water upon our approach. Others\r\nagain we saw at the first place we landed at, who took to their Canoes,\r\nand fled before we came near them; after this we took Water, and went\r\nalmost to the head of the inlet, were we landed and Travel'd some\r\ndistance in land. We found the face of the Country much the same as I\r\nhave before described, but the land much richer for instead of sand I\r\nfound in many places a deep black soil, which we thought was Capable of\r\nproducing any kind of grain. At present it produceth, besides Timber, as\r\nfine Meadow as ever was seen; however, we found it not all like this,\r\nsome few places were very rocky, but this, I believe, to be uncommon. The\r\nstone is sandy, and very proper for building, etc. After we had\r\nsufficiently examin'd this part we return'd to the Boat, and seeing some\r\nSmoke and Canoes at another part we went thither, in hopes of meeting\r\nwith the people, but they made off as we approached. There were 6 Canoes\r\nand 6 small fires near the Shore, and Muscles roasting upon them, and a\r\nfew Oysters laying near; from this we conjectured that there had been\r\njust 6 people, who had been out each in his Canoe picking up the Shell\r\nfish, and come a Shore to eat them, where each had made his fire to dress\r\nthem by. We tasted of their Cheer, and left them in return Strings of\r\nbeads, etc. The day being now far spent, we set out on our return to the\r\nShip.\r\n\r\nFriday, 4th. Winds northerly, serene weather. Upon my return to the Ship\r\nin the evening I found that none of the Natives had Appear'd near the\r\nWatering place, but about 20 of them had been fishing in their Canoes at\r\nno great distance from us. In the A.M., as the Wind would not permit us\r\nto sail, I sent out some parties into the Country to try to form some\r\nConnections with the Natives. One of the Midshipmen met with a very old\r\nman and Woman and 2 Small Children; they were Close to the Water side,\r\nwhere several more were in their Canoes gathering of Shell fish, and he,\r\nbeing alone, was afraid to make any stay with the 2 old People least he\r\nshould be discovr'd by those in the Canoes. He gave them a bird he had\r\nShott, which they would not Touch; neither did they speak one word, but\r\nseem'd to be much frightned. They were quite Naked; even the Woman had\r\nnothing to cover her nudities. Dr. Monkhouse and another Man being in the\r\nWoods, not far from the watering place, discover'd 6 more of the Natives,\r\nwho at first seem'd to wait his coming; but as he was going up to them he\r\nhad a dart thrown at him out of a Tree, which narrowly escaped him. As\r\nsoon as the fellow had thrown the dart he descended the Tree and made\r\noff, and with him all the rest, and these were all that were met with in\r\nthe Course of this day.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 5th. In the P.M. I went with a party of Men over to the North\r\nShore, and while some hands were hauling the Sean, a party of us made an\r\nExcursion of 3 or 4 Miles into the Country, or rather along the Sea\r\nCoast. We met with nothing remarkable; great part of the Country for some\r\ndistance inland from the Sea Coast is mostly a barren heath, diversified\r\nwith Marshes and Morasses. Upon our return to the Boat we found they had\r\ncaught a great number of small fish, which the sailors call leather\r\nJackets on account of their having a very thick skin; they are known in\r\nthe West Indies. I had sent the Yawl in the morning to fish for Sting\r\nrays, who returned in the Evening with upwards of four hundred weight;\r\none single one weigh'd 240 pounds Exclusive of the entrails. In the A.M.,\r\nas the wind Continued Northerly, I sent the Yawl again a fishing, and I\r\nwent with a party of Men into the Country, but met with nothing\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n[Description of Botany Bay, New South Wales.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 6th. In the evening the Yawl return'd from fishing, having Caught\r\n2 Sting rays weighing near 600 pounds. The great quantity of plants Mr.\r\nBanks and Dr. Solander found in this place occasioned my giving it the\r\nName of Botany Bay.* (* The Bay was at first called Stingray Bay. The\r\nplan of it at the Admiralty is called by this name, and none of the logs\r\nknow Botany Bay. It seems probable that Cook finally settled on the name\r\nafter the ship left, and when Banks had had time to examine his\r\ncollections. A monument was erected in 1870 near the spot, on the\r\nsouthern side, where Cook first landed. Botany Bay was intended to be the\r\nsite where the first settlement of convicts should be made, but on the\r\narrival of Captain Phillip, on January 18th, 1788, he found it so\r\nunsuited for the number of his colony that he started in a boat to\r\nexamine Broken Bay. On his way he went into Port Jackson, and immediately\r\ndecided on settling there. On the 25th and 26th the ships went round, and\r\nSydney was founded.) It is situated in the Latitude of 34 degrees 0\r\nminutes South, Longitude 208 degrees 37 minutes West. It is capacious,\r\nsafe, and Commodious; it may be known by the land on the Sea Coast, which\r\nis of a pretty even and moderate height, Rather higher than it is inland,\r\nwith steep rocky Clifts next the Sea, and looks like a long Island lying\r\nclose under the Shore. The Entrance of the Bay lies about the Middle of\r\nthis land. In coming from the Southward it is discover'd before you are\r\nabreast of it, which you cannot do in coming from the Northward; the\r\nentrance is little more than a Quarter of a Mile broad, and lies in\r\nWest-North-West. To sail into it keep the South shore on board until\r\nwithin a small bare Island, which lies close under the North Shore. Being\r\nwithin that Island the deepest of Water is on that side, 7, 6 and 5\r\nfathoms a good way up; there is Shoald Water a good way off from the\r\nSouth Shore--from the inner South Point quite to the head of the harbour;\r\nbut over towards the North and North-West Shore is a Channell of 12 or 14\r\nfeet at low Water, 3 or 4 Leagues up, to a place where there is 3 or 4\r\nfathoms; but there I found very little fresh Water. We Anchor'd near the\r\nSouth Shore about a Mile within the Entrance for the Conveniency of\r\nSailing with a Southerly wind and the getting of Fresh Water; but I\r\nafterwards found a very fine stream of fresh Water on the North shore in\r\nthe first sandy Cove within the Island, before which the Ship might lay\r\nalmost land locked, and wood for fuel may be got everywhere. Although\r\nwood is here in great plenty, yet there is very little Variety; the\r\nbigest trees are as large or larger than our Oaks in England, and grows a\r\ngood deal like them, and Yields a reddish Gum; the wood itself is heavy,\r\nhard, and black like Lignum Vitae. Another sort that grows tall and\r\nStrait something like Pines--the wood of this is hard and Ponderous, and\r\nsomething of the Nature of America live Oak. These 2 are all the Timber\r\ntrees I met with; there are a few sorts of Shrubs and several Palm Trees\r\nand Mangroves about the Head of the Harbour. The Country is woody, low,\r\nand flat as far in as we could see, and I believe that the Soil is in\r\ngeneral sandy. In the Wood are a variety of very beautiful birds, such as\r\nCocatoos, Lorryquets, Parrots, etc., and crows Exactly like those we have\r\nin England. Water fowl is no less plenty about the head of the Harbour,\r\nwhere there is large flats of sand and Mud, on which they seek their\r\nfood; the most of these were unknown to us, one sort especially, which\r\nwas black and white, and as large as a Goose, but most like a Pelican.*\r\n(* Most probably the Black and White or Semipalmated Goose, now\r\nexterminated in these parts.) On the sand and Mud banks are Oysters,\r\nMuscles, Cockles, etc., which I believe are the Chief support of the\r\ninhabitants, who go into Shoald Water with their little Canoes and peck\r\nthem out of the sand and Mud with their hands, and sometimes roast and\r\nEat them in the Canoe, having often a fire for that purpose, as I\r\nsuppose, for I know no other it can be for. The Natives do not appear to\r\nbe numerous, neither do they seem to live in large bodies, but dispers'd\r\nin small parties along by the Water side. Those I saw were about as tall\r\nas Europeans, of a very dark brown Colour, but not black, nor had they\r\nwoolly, frizled hair, but black and lank like ours. No sort of Cloathing\r\nor Ornaments were ever seen by any of us upon any one of them, or in or\r\nabout any of their Hutts; from which I conclude that they never wear any.\r\nSome that we saw had their faces and bodies painted with a sort of White\r\nPaint or Pigment. Altho' I have said that shell fish is their Chief\r\nsupport, yet they catch other sorts of fish, some of which we found\r\nroasting on the fire the first time we landed; some of these they strike\r\nwith Gigs,* (* A fishing implement like a trident.) and others they catch\r\nwith hook and line; we have seen them strike fish with gigs, and hooks\r\nand lines are found in their Hutts. Sting rays, I believe, they do not\r\neat, because I never saw the least remains of one near any of their Hutts\r\nor fire places. However, we could know but very little of their Customs,\r\nas we never were able to form any Connections with them; they had not so\r\nmuch as touch'd the things we had left in their Hutts on purpose for them\r\nto take away. During our stay in this Harbour I caused the English\r\nColours to be display'd ashore every day, and an inscription to be cut\r\nout upon one of the Trees near the Watering place, setting forth the\r\nShip's Name, Date, etc. [Off Port Jackson, New South Wales.]Having seen\r\neverything this place afforded, we, at daylight in the morning, weigh'd\r\nwith a light breeze at North-West, and put to Sea, and the wind soon\r\nafter coming to the Southward we steer'd along shore North-North-East,\r\nand at Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 33 degrees 50\r\nminutes South, about 2 or 3 Miles from the Land, and abreast of a Bay,\r\nwherein there appear'd to be safe Anchorage, which I called Port\r\nJackson.* (* Cook having completed his water at Botany Bay, and having\r\nmany hundreds of miles of coast before him, did not examine Port Jackson,\r\nthe magnificent harbour in which Sydney, the capital of New South Wales,\r\nnow lies. His chart gives the shape of what he could see very accurately,\r\nbut the main arm of the harbour is hidden from the sea. He named the bay\r\nafter Mr. (afterwards Sir George) Jackson, one of the Secretaries of the\r\nAdmiralty. This fact is recorded on a tablet in the Bishop Stortford\r\nChurch to the memory of Sir George Duckett, which name Sir George had\r\nassumed in later years. This interesting evidence was brought to light by\r\nSir Alfred Stephen, Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, and puts an\r\nend to the legend which was long current, that Port Jackson was named\r\nafter a sailor who first saw it. There was, moreover, no person of the\r\nname of Jackson on board.) It lies 3 leagues to the Northward of Botany\r\nBay. I had almost forgot to mention that it is high water in this Bay at\r\nthe full and change of the Moon about 8 o'Clock, and rises and falls upon\r\na Perpendicular about 4 or 5 feet.\r\n\r\nMonday, 7th. Little wind, Southerly, and Serene pleasant Weather. In the\r\nP.M. found the Variation by several Azimuths to be 8 degrees East; at\r\nsunset the Northermost land in sight bore North 26 degrees East; and some\r\nbroken land that appear'd to form a bay bore North 40 degrees West,\r\ndistant 4 Leagues. This Bay I named Broken bay,* (* The Hawkesbury River,\r\nthe largest on the east coast of Australia, runs into Broken Bay.)\r\nLatitude 33 degrees 36 minutes South. We steer'd along shore\r\nNorth-North-East all night at the distance of about 3 Leagues from the\r\nland, having from 32 to 36 fathoms, hard sandy bottom. A little after sun\r\nrise I took several Azimuths with 4 Needles belonging to the Azimuth\r\nCompass, the mean result of which gave the Variation of 7 degrees 56\r\nminutes East. At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 33\r\ndegrees 22 minutes South, and about 3 Leagues from the land, the\r\nNorthermost part of which in sight bore North 19 degrees East. Some\r\npretty high land which projected out in 3 bluff Points, and occasioned my\r\ncalling it Cape 3 Points (Latitude 33 degrees 33 minutes South), bore\r\nSouth-West, distant 5 Leagues; Longitude made from Botany Bay 0 degrees\r\n19 minutes East.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 8th. Variable Light Airs and Clear weather. In the P.M. saw some\r\nsmooks upon the Shore, and in the Evening found the Variation to be 8\r\ndegrees 25 minutes East; at this time we were about 2 or 3 Miles from the\r\nland, and had 28 fathoms Water. Our situation at Noon was nearly the same\r\nas Yesterday, having advanced not one Step to the Northward.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 9th. Winds northerly; most part a fresh breeze, with which we\r\nstood off Shore until 12 at Night. At the distance of 5 Leagues from the\r\nland had 70 fathoms, at the distance of 6 Leagues 80 fathoms, which is\r\nthe Extent of the Soundings, for at the Distance of 10 Leagues off we had\r\nno ground with 150 fathoms. Stood in Shore until 8 o'Clock A.M., and\r\nhardly fetched Cape Three Points; having a little wind at North-West by\r\nNorth, we tack'd, and stood off until Noon, at which Time we Tack'd with\r\nthe wind at North-North-East, being then in the Latitude of 33 degrees 37\r\nminutes South, Cape Three Points bearing North West by West, distance 4\r\nLeagues.\r\n\r\nThursday, 10th. In the P.M., had the wind at North-East by North, with\r\nwhich we stood in Shore until near 4 o'Clock, when we Tack'd in 23\r\nfathoms Water, being about a Mile from the land, and as much to the\r\nSouthward of Cape 3 Points. In the night the wind veer'd to North-West\r\nand West, and in the morning to South-West. Having the advantage of a\r\nlight Moon, we made the best of our way along shore to the Northward. At\r\nNoon we were by observation in the Latitude of 32 degrees 53 minutes\r\nSouth, and Longitude 208 degrees 0 minutes West, and about 2 Leagues from\r\nthe land, which extended from North 41 degrees East to South 41 degrees\r\nWest. A small round rock or Island,* (* Nobby Head, at the entrance of\r\nNewcastle Harbour, formed by the Hunter River. Newcastle is the great\r\ncoal port of New South Wales. It has a population of 20,000, and exports\r\n1,500,000 tons of coal in the year.) laying close under the land, bore\r\nSouth 82 degrees West, distance 3 or 4 Leagues. At sunrise in the Morning\r\nfound the Variation to be 8 degrees East. In the Latitude of 33 degrees 2\r\nminutes South, a little way inland, is a remarkable hill, that is shaped\r\nlike the Crown of a Hatt, which we past about 9 o'Clock in the forenoon.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Hawke, New South Wales.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 11th. Winds Southerly in the day, and in the night Westerly; a\r\nGentle breeze and Clear weather. At 4 P.M. past, at the distance of one\r\nMile, a low rocky point which I named Point Stephens (Latitude 32 degrees\r\n45 minutes); on the North side of this point is an inlet which I called\r\nPort Stephens* (* Called after Mr. Stephens, one of the Secretaries to\r\nthe Admiralty. It is a large and fine harbour.) (Latitude 32 degrees 40\r\nminutes; Longitude 207 degrees 51 minutes), that appear'd to me from the\r\nMasthead to be shelter'd from all Winds. At the Entrance lay 3 Small\r\nIslands, 2 of which are of a Tolerable height, and on the Main, near the\r\nshore, are some high round hills that make at a distance like Islands. In\r\npassing this bay at the distance of 2 or 3 miles from the Shore our\r\nsoundings were from 33 to 27 fathoms; from which I conjectured that there\r\nmust be a sufficient depth of Water for Shipping in the bay. We saw\r\nseveral smokes a little way in the Country upon the flat land; by this I\r\ndid suppose that there were Lagoons which afforded subsistance for the\r\nNatives, such as shell-fish, etc., for we as yet know nothing else they\r\nhave to live upon. At 1/2 past 5, the Northermost land in sight bore\r\nNorth 36 degrees East, and Point Stephens South-West, distant 4 Leagues,\r\nat which time we took in our Steerings,* (* Studding sails.) and run\r\nunder an Easey sail all night until 4 A.M., when we made all sail; our\r\nsoundings in the night were from 48 to 62 fathoms, at the distance of\r\nbetween 3 and 4 Leagues from the land. At 8 we were abreast of a high\r\npoint of Land, which made in 2 Hillocks; this point I called Cape Hawke*\r\n(* After Admiral Sir Edward Hawke, First Lord of the Admiralty.)\r\n(Latitude 32 degrees 14 minutes South, Longitude 207 degrees 30 minutes\r\nWest). It bore from us at this time West distant 8 Miles, and the same\r\ntime the Northermost land in sight bore North 6 degrees East, and\r\nappear'd high and like an Island. At Noon this land bore North 8 degrees\r\nEast, the Northermost land in sight North 13 degrees East, and Cape Hawke\r\nSouth 37 degrees West. Latitude in per Observation 32 degrees 2 minutes\r\nSouth, which was 12 Miles to the Southward of that given by the Log,\r\nwhich I do suppose to be owing to a Current setting that way. Course and\r\ndistance sail'd since Yesterday at Noon was first North-East by East, 27\r\nMiles, then North 10 degrees East, 37 Miles; Longitude in 207 degrees 20\r\nminutes West; Variation per morning Amplitude and Azimuth 9 degrees 10\r\nminutes East.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 12th. Winds Southerly, a Gentle breeze in the P.M. As we run\r\nalong Shore we saw several smokes a little way in land from the Sea, and\r\none upon the Top of a hill, which was the first we have seen upon\r\nelevated ground since we have been upon the Coast. At sunset we were in\r\n23 fathoms, and about a League and a half from the land, the Northermost\r\npart of which we had in sight bore North 13 degrees East; and 3\r\nremarkable large high hills lying Contigious to each other, and not far\r\nfrom the shore, bore North-North-West. As these Hills bore some\r\nresemblance to each other we called them the 3 Brothers. We steer'd\r\nNorth-East by North all Night, having from 27 to 67 fathoms, from 2 to 5\r\nand 6 Leagues from the Land, and at day light we steer'd North for the\r\nNorthermost land we had in sight. At noon we were 4 Leagues from the\r\nLand, and by observation in the Latitude of 31 degrees 18 minutes South,\r\nwhich was 15 miles to the Southward of that given by the Log. Our Course\r\nand distance made good since Yesterday noon was North 24 degrees East, 48\r\nmiles. Longitude 206 degrees 58 minutes West; several smokes seen a\r\nlittle way in land.\r\n\r\nSunday, 13th. In the P.M. stood in shore with the Wind at North-East\r\nuntil 6, at which time we Tack'd, being about 3 or 4 miles from the land,\r\nand in 24 fathoms. Stood off shore with a fresh breeze at North and\r\nNorth-North-West until midnight, then Tack'd, being in 118 fathoms and 8\r\nLeagues from the Land. At 3 a.m. the wind veer'd to the Westward, and we\r\nTack'd and stood to the Northward. At noon we were by Observation in the\r\nLatitude of 30 degrees 43 minutes South, and Longitude 206 degrees 45\r\nminutes West, and about 3 or 4 Leagues from the Land, the Northermost\r\npart of which bore from us North 13 degrees West; and a point or head\r\nland, on which were fires that Caused a great Quantity of smoke, which\r\noccasioned my giving it the name of Smokey Cape, bore South-West, distant\r\n4 Leagues; it is moderately high land. Over the pitch of the point is a\r\nround hillock; within it 2 others, much higher and larger, and within\r\nthem very low land (Latitude 30 degrees 51 minutes, Longitude 206 degrees\r\n5 minutes West). Besides the smoke seen upon this Cape we saw more in\r\nseveral places along the Coast. The observed Latitude was only 5 Miles to\r\nthe Southward of the Log.\r\n\r\nMonday, 14th. At the P.M. it fell Calm, and continued so about an hour,\r\nwhen a breeze sprung up at North-East, with which we stood in shore until\r\n6 o'Clock, when, being in 30 fathoms and 3 or 4 Miles from the land, we\r\nTack'd, having the wind at North-North-West. At this time Smoky Cape bore\r\nSouth 3/4 degrees West, distant about 5 Leagues, and the Northermost land\r\nin sight North 1/4 degrees East. At 8 we made a Trip in shore for an\r\nhour; after this the wind came off Shore, with which we stood along shore\r\nto the Northward, having from 30 to 21 fathoms, at the distance of 4 or 5\r\nMiles from the Land. At 5 A.M. the Wind veer'd to North, and blow'd a\r\nfresh breeze, attended with Squalls and dark cloudy weather. At 8 it\r\nbegan to Thunder and Rain, which lasted about an Hour, and then fell\r\nCalm, which gave us an opportunity to sound, and found 86 fathoms, being\r\nabout 4 or 5 Leagues from the Land; after this we got the wind Southerly,\r\na fresh breeze and fair weather, and we Steer'd North by West for the\r\nNorthermost land we had in sight. At noon we were about 4 Leagues from\r\nthe land, and by observation in the Latitude of 30 degrees 22 minutes\r\nSouth, which was 9 Miles to the Southward of that given by the Log.\r\nLongitude in 206 degrees 39 minutes West, and Course and distance made\r\ngood since Yesterday Noon North 16 degrees East, 22 miles; some Tolerable\r\nhigh land near the Shore bore West. As I have not mentioned the Aspect of\r\nthe Country since we left Botany Bay, I shall now describe it as it hath\r\nat different times appear'd to us. As we have advanced to the Northward\r\nthe land hath increased in height, in so much that in this Latitude it\r\nmay be called a hilly Country; but between this and Botany Bay it is\r\ndiversified with an agreeable variety of Hills, Ridges, and Valleys, and\r\nlarge plains all Cloathed with wood, which to all appearance is the same\r\nas I have before mentioned, as we could discover no Visible alteration in\r\nthe Soil. Near the shore the land is in general low and Sandy, except the\r\npoints which are rocky, and over many of them are pretty high hills,\r\nwhich at first rising out of the Water appear like a Island.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 15th. Fresh Gales at South-West, West-South-West, and\r\nSouth-South-West. In the P.M. had some heavy Squalls, attended with rain\r\nand hail, which obliged us to close reef our Topsails. Between 2 and 4 we\r\nhad some small rocky Islands* (* The Solitary Islands.) between us and\r\nthe land; the Southermost lies in the Latitude of 30 degrees 10 minutes,\r\nthe Northermost in 29 degrees 58 minutes, and about 2 Leagues or more\r\nfrom the land; we sounded, and had 33 fathoms about 12 Miles without this\r\nlast island. At 8 we brought too until 10, at which time we made sail\r\nunder our Topsails. Having the Advantage of the Moon we steer'd along\r\nshore North and North by East, keeping at the distance of about 3 Leagues\r\nfrom the land having from 30 to 25 fathoms. As soon as it was daylight we\r\nmade all the sail we could, having the Advantage of a fresh Gale and fair\r\nweather.* (* During the night the entrance of the Clarence River, now the\r\noutlet for the produce of a large and rich agricultural district, was\r\npassed, and in the morning that of the Richmond River, which serves a\r\nsimilar purpose.) At 9, being about a League from the Land, we saw upon\r\nit people and Smoke in Several places. At noon we were by observation in\r\nthe Latitude of 28 degrees 39 minutes South, and Longitude 206 degrees 27\r\nminutes West; Course and distance saild since Yesterday at Noon North 6\r\ndegrees 45 minutes East, 104 Miles. A Tolerable high point of land bore\r\nNorth-West by West, distant 3 Miles; this point I named Cape Byron* (*\r\nCaptain John Byron was one of Cook's predecessors in exploration in the\r\nPacific, having sailed round the World in H.M.S. Dolphin, in company with\r\nthe Tamar, in 1764 to 1766.) (Latitude 28 degrees 37 minutes 30 seconds\r\nSouth, Longitude 206 degrees 30 minutes West). It may be known by a\r\nremarkable sharp peaked Mountain lying in land North-West by West from\r\nit. From this point the land Trends North 13 degrees West. Inland it is\r\npretty high and hilly, but near the Shore it is low; to the Southward of\r\nthe Point the land is low, and Tolerable level.\r\n\r\n[Off Point Danger, New South Wales.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 16th. Winds Southerly, a fresh Gale, with which we steer'd\r\nNorth along shore until sunset, at which time we discover'd breakers\r\nahead, and on our Larboard bow, being at this time in 20 fathoms, and\r\nabout 5 miles from the land. Haul'd off East until 8, at which time we\r\nhad run 8 Miles, and had increased our Depth of Water to 44 fathoms. We\r\nthen brought too with her head to the Eastward, and lay on this Tack\r\nuntil 10 o'Clock, when, having increased our Soundings to 78 fathoms, we\r\nwore and lay with her head in shore until 5 o'Clock a.m., when we made\r\nSail. At daylight we were surprized by finding ourselves farther to the\r\nSouthward than we were in the evening, and yet it had blown strong all\r\nnight Southerly. We now saw the breakers again within us, which we passed\r\nat the distance of about 1 League; they lay in the Latitude of 28 degrees\r\n8 minutes South, and stretch off East 2 Leagues from a point under which\r\nis a small Island; their situation may always be found by the peaked\r\nmountain before mentioned, which bears South-West by West from them, and\r\non their account I have named it Mount Warning. It lies 7 or 8 Leagues in\r\nland in the Latitude of 28 degrees 22 minutes South. The land is high and\r\nhilly about it, but it is Conspicuous enough to be distinguished from\r\neverything else. The point off which these shoals lay I have named Point\r\nDanger;* (* Point Danger is the boundary point on the coast between New\r\nSouth Wales and Queensland.) to the Northward of it the land, which is\r\nlow, Trends North-West by North; but we soon found that it did not keep\r\nthat direction long before it turn'd again to the Northward. At Noon we\r\nwere about 2 Leagues from the land, and by observation in the Latitude of\r\n27 degrees 46 minutes, which was 17 Miles to the Southward of the Log;\r\nLongitude 206 degrees 26 minutes West. Mount Warning bore South 20\r\ndegrees West, distant 14 Leagues; the Northermost land in sight bore\r\nNorth. Our Course and distance made good since yesterday North 1 degree\r\n45 minutes West, 53 miles.\r\n\r\n[Off Moreton Bay, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 17th. Winds Southerly, mostly a fresh breeze, with which in the\r\nP.M. we steer'd along shore North 3/4 East, at the distance of about 2\r\nLeagues off. Between 4 and 5 we discover'd breakers on our Larboard bow;\r\nour Depth of Water at this time was 37 fathoms. At sunset the Northermost\r\nland in sight bore North by West, the breakers North-West by West,\r\ndistant 4 Miles, and the Northermost land set at Noon, which form'd a\r\nPoint, I named Point Lookout, bore West, distant 5 or 6 Miles (Latitude\r\n27 degrees 6 minutes).* (* There is some mistake in this latitude. It\r\nshould be 27 degrees 26 minutes.) On the North side of this point the\r\nshore forms a wide open bay, which I have named Morton's Bay,* (* James,\r\nEarl of Morton, was President of the Royal Society in 1764, and one of\r\nthe Commissioners of Longitude.) in the Bottom of which the land is so\r\nlow that I could but just see it from the Topmast head. The breakers I\r\nhave just mentioned lies about 3 or 4 Miles from Point Lookout; at this\r\ntime we had a great Sea from the Southward, which broke prodigious high\r\nupon them. Stood on North-North-East until 8, when, being past the\r\nbreakers, and having Deepned our water to 52 fathoms, we brought too\r\nuntil 12 o'Clock, then made sail to the North-North-East. At 4 A.M. we\r\nsounded, and had 135 fathoms. At daylight I found that we had in the\r\nnight got much farther to the Northward and from the Shore than I\r\nexpected from the Course we steer'd, for we were at least 6 or 7 Leagues\r\noff, and therefore hauled in North-West by West, having the Advantage of\r\na Fresh Gale at South-South-West. The Northermost land seen last night\r\nbore from us at this time South-South-West, distant 6 Leagues. This land\r\nI named Cape Morton, it being the North point of the Bay of the same Name\r\n(Latitude 26 degrees 56 minutes South, Longitude 206 degrees 28 minutes).\r\nFrom Cape Morton the Land Trends away West, further than we could see,\r\nfor there is a small space where we could see no land; some on board\r\nwhere of opinion that there is a River there because the Sea looked paler\r\nthan usual. Upon sounding we found 34 fathoms fine white sandy bottom,\r\nwhich alone is Sufficient change, the apparent Colour of Sea Water,\r\nwithout the Assistance of Rivers. The land need only to be low here, as\r\nit is in a Thousand other places upon the Coast, to have made it\r\nimpossible for us to have seen it at the distance we were off. Be this as\r\nit may, it was a point that could not be clear'd up as we had the wind;\r\nbut should any one be desirous of doing it that may come after me, this\r\nplace may always be found by 3 Hills which lay to the Northward of it in\r\nthe Latitude of 26 degrees 53 minutes South. These hills lay but a little\r\nway inland, and not far from Each other; they are very remarkable on\r\naccount of their Singular form of Elivation, which very much resembles\r\nGlass Houses,* (* The Glass houses form a well-known sea mark on entering\r\nMoreton Bay, as the name is now written. Brisbane, the capital of\r\nQueensland, stands on the river of the same name, which falls into\r\nMoreton Bay.) which occasioned my giving them that Name. The Northermost\r\nof the 3 is the highest and largest. There are likewise several other\r\npeaked hills inland to the Northward of these, but they are not near so\r\nremarkable. At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 26 degrees\r\n28 minutes South, which was 10 Miles to the Northward of the Log; a\r\nCircumstance that hath not hapned since we have been upon the Coast\r\nbefore. Our Course and distance run since Yesterday noon was North by\r\nWest 80 Miles, which brought us into the Longitude of 206 degrees 46\r\nminutes. At this time we were about 2 or 3 Leagues from the land, and in\r\n24 fathoms Water; a low bluff point, which was the Southern point of an\r\nopen Sandy bay,* (* Laguna Bay. The point is called Low Bluff.) bore\r\nNorth 52 degrees West, distant 3 Leagues, and the Northermost point of\r\nland in sight bore North 1/4 East. Several Smokes seen to-day, and some\r\npretty far inland.\r\n\r\nFriday, 18th. In steering along shore at the distance of 2 Leagues off\r\nour Soundings was from 24 to 32 fathoms Sandy bottom. At 6 P.M. the North\r\npoint set at Noon bore North 1/4 West; distant 4 Leagues; at 10 it bore\r\nNorth-West by West 1/2 West, and as we had seen no land to the Northward\r\nof it we brought too, not knowing which way to steer, having at this time\r\nbut little wind, and continued so for the most part of the night. At 2\r\nP.M. we made sail with the wind at South-West, and at daylight saw the\r\nland extending as far as North 3/4 East. The point set last night bore\r\nSouth-West by West, distant 3 or 4 Leagues; I have named it Double Island\r\nPoint, on account of its figure (Latitude 25 degrees 58 minutes South,\r\nLongitude 206 degrees 48 minutes West). The land within this point is of\r\na moderate and pretty equal height, but the point itself is of such an\r\nunequal Height that it looks like 2 Small Islands laying under the land;\r\nit likewise may be known by the white Clifts on the North side of it.\r\nHere the land trends to the North-West, and forms a large open bay,* (*\r\nWide Bay.) in the bottom of which the land appear'd to be very low, in so\r\nmuch that we could but just see it from the Deck. In crossing the mouth\r\nof this bay our Depth of Water was from 30 to 32 fathoms, a white sandy\r\nbottom. At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the Land, and in the\r\nLatitude of 25 degrees 34 minutes South, Longitude 206 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest; Double Island Point bore South 3/4 West, and the Northermost land\r\nin sight North 3/4 East. The land hereabouts, which is of a moderate\r\nheight, appears more barren than any we have yet seen on this Coast, and\r\nthe Soil more sandy, there being several large places where nothing else\r\nis to be seen; in other places the woods look to be low and Shrubby, nor\r\ndid we see many signs of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 19th. In the P.M. had Variable light Airs, and Calms; in the\r\nnight had a light breeze from the land, which in the A.M. veer'd to\r\nSouth-West and South-South-West. In the evening found the Variation to be\r\n8 degrees 36 minutes East, and in the Morning 8 degrees 20 minutes; as we\r\nhad but little wind we keept to the Northward all night, having from 23\r\nto 27 fathoms fine sandy bottom, at the Distance of 2 or 3 Leagues from\r\nthe Land. At Noon we were about 4 Miles from it, and by observation in\r\nthe Latitude of 25 degrees 4 minutes, and in this situation had but 13\r\nfathoms; the Northermost land in Sight bore North 21 degrees West,\r\ndistant 8 Miles; our Course and distance saild since yesterday at Noon\r\nwas North 13 degrees 15 minutes East, 31 Miles.\r\n\r\n[Off Sandy Cape, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 20th. Winds Southerly, Gentle breezes. At 10 p.m. we passed, at\r\nthe distance of 4 Miles, having 17 fathoms, a black bluff head or point\r\nof land, on which a number of the Natives were Assembled, which\r\noccasioned my naming it Indian Head; Latitude 25 degrees 0 minutes North\r\nby West, 4 Miles from this head, is another much like it. From this last\r\nthe land Trends a little more to the Westward, and is low and Sandy next\r\nthe Sea, for what may be behind it I know not; if land, it must be all\r\nlow, for we could see no part of it from the Mast head. We saw people in\r\nother places besides the one I have mentioned; some Smokes in the day and\r\nfires in the Night. Having but little wind all Night, we keept on to the\r\nNorthward, having from 17 to 34 fathoms, from 4 Miles to 4 Leagues from\r\nthe Land, the Northermost part of which bore from us at daylight\r\nWest-South-West, and seem'd to End in a point, from which we discover'd a\r\nReef stretching out to the Northward as far as we could see, being, at\r\nthis time, in 18 fathoms; for we had, before it was light, hauld our Wind\r\nto the Westward, and this course we continued until we had plainly\r\ndiscover'd breakers a long way upon our Lee Bow, which seem'd to Stretch\r\nquite home to the land. We then Edged away North-West and\r\nNorth-North-West, along the East side of the Shoal, from 2 to 1 Miles\r\noff, having regular, even Soundings, from 13 to 7 fathoms; fine sandy\r\nbottom. At Noon we were, by Observation, in the Latitude of 24 degrees 26\r\nminutes South, which was 13 Miles to the Northward of that given by the\r\nLog. The extream point of the Shoal we judged to bear about North-West of\r\nus; and the point of land above-mentioned bore South 3/4 West, distant 20\r\nMiles. This point I have named Sandy Cape,* (* Sandy Cape is the northern\r\npoint of Great Sandy Island. A long narrow channel separates the latter\r\nfrom the mainland, and opens at its northern end into Harvey Bay, a great\r\nsheet of water 40 miles across. This channel is now much used by the\r\ncoasting trade, as it avoids the long detour round Breaksea Spit, a most\r\ndangerous shoal.) on account of 2 very large white Patches of Sand upon\r\nit. It is of a height Sufficient to be seen 12 Leagues in Clear weather\r\n(Latitude 24 degrees 46 minutes, Longitude 206 degrees 51 minutes West);\r\nfrom it the Land trends away West-South-West and South-West as far as we\r\ncould see.\r\n\r\nMonday, 21st. In the P.M. we keept along the East side of the Shoal until\r\n2, when, judging there was water for us over, I sent a Boat a Head to\r\nsound, and upon her making the Signal for more than 5 fathoms we hauld\r\nour wind and stood over the Tail of it in 6 fathoms. At this time we were\r\nin the Latitude of 24 degrees 22 minutes South, and Sandy Cape bore South\r\n1/2 East, distant 8 Leagues; but the Direction of the Shoal is nearest\r\nNorth-North-West and South-South-East. At this time we had 6 fathoms; the\r\nboat which was not above 1/4 of a mile to the Southward of us had little\r\nmore than 5 fathoms. From 6 fathoms we had the next Cast, 13, and then 20\r\nimmediately, as fast as the Man could heave the Lead; from this I did\r\nsuppose that the West side of the Shoal is pretty steep too, whereas on\r\nthe other side we had gradual Soundings from 13 to 7 fathoms. This Shoal\r\nI called Break Sea Spit, because now we had smooth water, whereas upon\r\nthe whole Coast to the Southward of it we had always a high Sea or swell\r\nfrom the South-East. At 6, the Land of Sandy Cape extending from South 17\r\ndegrees East to South 27 degrees East, distance 8 Leagues; Depth of\r\nWater, 23 fathoms, which depth we keept all Night, as we stood to the\r\nWestward with light Airs from the Southward; but between 12 and 4 A.M. we\r\nhad it Calm, after which a Gentle breeze sprung up at South, with which\r\nwe still keept on upon a Wind to the Westward. At 7 we Saw from the\r\nMasthead the Land of Sandy Cape bearing South-East 1/2 East, distance 12\r\nor 13 Leagues. At 9, we discover'd from the Mast head land to the\r\nWestward, and soon after saw smooke upon it. Our depth of Water was now\r\ndecreased to 17 fathoms, and by Noon to 13, at which time we were by\r\nobservation in the Latitude of 24 degrees 28 minutes South, and about 7\r\nLeagues from the Land, which extended from South by West to\r\nWest-North-West. Longitude made from Sandy Cape 0 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nFor these few days past we have seen at times a sort of Sea fowl we have\r\nno where seen before that I remember; they are of the sort called\r\nBoobies. Before this day we seldom saw more than 2 or 3 at a time, and\r\nonly when we were near the land. Last night a small flock of these birds\r\npassed the Ship and went away to the North-West, and this morning from\r\n1/2 an hour before sun rise to half an hour after, flights of them were\r\ncontinually coming from the North-North-West, and flying to the\r\nSouth-South-East, and not one was seen to fly in any other direction.\r\nFrom this we did suppose that there was a Lagoon, River, or Inlet of\r\nShallow Water to the Southward of us, where these birds resorted to in\r\nthe day to feed, and that not very far to the Northward lay some Island,\r\nwhere they retir'd too in the night.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 22nd. In the P.M. had a Gentle breeze at South-East, with which\r\nwe stood in for the land South-West until 4, when, being in the Latitude\r\nof 24 degrees 36 minutes South, and about 2 Leagues from land, in 9\r\nfathoms, we bore away along shore North-West by West; at the same time we\r\ncould see the land extending to the South-South-East about 8 Leagues.\r\nNear the Sea the land is very low, but inland are some moderately high\r\nhills, and the whole appeared to be thickly Cloathed with wood. In\r\nrunning along shore we shoalded our Water from 9 to 7 fathoms, and at one\r\ntime had but 6 fathoms, which determined me to Anchor for the Night, and\r\naccordingly at 8 o'Clock we came too in 8 fathoms, fine gravelly bottom,\r\nabout 5 miles from the land. This evening we saw a Water Snake, and 2 or\r\n3 evenings ago one lay under the Ship's Stern some time; this was about 1\r\n1/2 Yards in length, and was the first we had seen. At 6 A.M. weighed\r\nwith a Gentle breeze Southerly, and Steer'd North-West 1/4 West, edging\r\nin for the land until we got Within 2 Miles of it, having from 7 to 11\r\nfathoms; we then steer'd North-North-West as the land laid. At Noon we\r\nwere by Observation in the Latitude of 24 degrees 19 minutes South;\r\nLongitude made from Sandy Cape 1 degree 14 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[At Anchor. Bustard Bay, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 23rd. Continued our Course alongshore at the distance of about\r\n2 Miles off, having from 12 to 9, 8 and 7 fathoms, until 5 o'Clock, at\r\nwhich time we were abreast of the South point of a Large open Bay,* (*\r\nBustard Bay.) wherein I intended to Anchor. Accordingly we hauld in Close\r\nupon a Wind, and sent a boat ahead to sound; after making some Trips we\r\nAnchored at 8 o'Clock in 5 fathoms, a Sandy bottom. The South point of\r\nthe bay bore East 3/4 South, distant 2 Miles; the North point North-West\r\n1/4 North, about 2 Miles from the shore, in the bottom of the bay. Last\r\nnight, some time in the Middle watch, a very extraordinary affair hapned\r\nto Mr. Orton, my Clerk. He having been drinking in the evening, some\r\nMalicious person or persons in the Ship took Advantage of his being\r\nDrunk, and cut off all the Cloaths from off his back; not being satisfied\r\nwith this, they some time after went into his Cabin and cut off a part of\r\nboth his Ears as he lay a Sleep in his Bed. The person whom he suspected\r\nto have done this was Mr. Magra, one of the Midshipmen; but this did not\r\nappear to me. Upon enquiry, however, as I had been told that Magra had\r\nonce or twice before this in their drunken Frolicks cut off his cloaths,\r\nand had been heard to say (as I was told) that if it was not for the Law\r\nhe would Murder him, these things consider'd, induced me to think that\r\nMagra was not Altogether innocent. I therefore for the present dismiss'd\r\nhim the Quarter deck, and Suspended him from doing any duty in the Ship,\r\nhe being one of those Gentlemen frequently found on board King's Ships\r\nthat can very well be spared; besides, it was necessary in me to show my\r\nimmediate resentment against the person on whom the suspicion fell, least\r\nthey should not have stop'd here. With respect to Mr. Orton, he is a man\r\nnot without faults; yet from all the inquiry I could make, it evidently\r\nappear'd to me that so far from deserving such Treatment, he had not\r\ndesigned injuring any person in the Ship; so that I do--and shall\r\nalways--look upon him as an injured man. Some reasons, however, might be\r\ngiven why this misfortune came upon him, in which he himself was in some\r\nmeasure to blame; but as this is only conjecture, and would tend to fix\r\nit upon some people in the Ship, whom I would fain believe would hardly\r\nbe guilty of such an Action, I shall say nothing about it, unless I shall\r\nhereafter discover the Offenders, which I shall take every method in my\r\npower to do, for I look upon such proceedings as highly dangerous in such\r\nVoyages as this, and the greatest insult that could be offer'd to my\r\nAuthority in this Ship, as I have always been ready to hear and redress\r\nevery complaint that have been made against any Person in the Ship.* (*\r\nThis history of Mr. Orton's misadventure is omitted from the Admiralty\r\ncopy. It is an illustration of the times to note that the fact of Orton\r\nhaving got drunk does not seem to call for the Captain's severe censure.\r\nIn these days, though the practical joker receives punishment, the\r\ndrunkard would certainly come in for a large share also.)\r\n\r\nIn the A.M. I went ashore with a party of men in order to Examine the\r\nCountry, accompanied by Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen; we landed a\r\nlittle within the South point of the Bay, where there is a Channel\r\nleading into a large Lagoon. The first thing that I did was to sound and\r\nexamine the Channell, in which I found 3 fathoms, until I got about a\r\nMile up it, where I met with a Shoal, whereon was little more than one\r\nfathom; being over this I had 3 fathoms again. The Entrance into this\r\nChannell lies close to the South point of this Bay, being form'd on the\r\nEast by the Shore, and on the West by a large Spit of sand; it is about a\r\n1/4 of a Mile broad, and lies in South by West; here is room for a few\r\nShips to lay very secure, and a small Stream of Fresh Water. After this I\r\nmade a little excursion into the Woods while some hands made 3 or 4 hauls\r\nwith the Sean, but caught not above a dozen very small fish. By this time\r\nthe flood was made, and I imbarqued in the Boats in order to row up the\r\nLagoon; but in this I was hindred by meeting everywhere with Shoal Water.\r\nAs yet we had seen no people, but saw a great deal of Smook up and on the\r\nWest side of the Lagoon, which was all too far off for us to go by land,\r\nexcepting one; this we went to and found 10 Small fires in a very small\r\nCompass, and some Cockle Shells laying by them, but the people were gone.\r\nOn the windward or South side of one of the fires was stuck up a little\r\nBark about a foot and a half high, and some few pieces lay about in other\r\nplaces; these we concluded were all the covering they had in the Night,\r\nand many of them, I firmly believe, have not this, but, naked as they\r\nare, sleep in the open air. Tupia, who was with us, observed that they\r\nwere Taata Eno's; that is, bad or poor people. The Country is visibly\r\nworse than at the last place we were at; the soil is dry and Sandy, and\r\nthe woods are free from underwoods of every kind; here are of the same\r\nsort of Trees as we found in Bottany Harbour, with a few other sorts. One\r\nsort, which is by far the most Numerous sort of any in the Woods, grow\r\nSomething like birch; the Bark at first sight looks like birch bark, but\r\nupon examination I found it to be very different, and so I believe is the\r\nwood; but this I could not examine, as having no axe or anything with me\r\nto cut down a Tree. About the Skirts of the Lagoon grows the true\r\nMangrove, such as are found in the West Indies, and which we have not\r\nseen during the Voyage before; here is likewise a sort of a palm Tree,\r\nwhich grows on low, barren, sandy places in the South Sea Islands. All,\r\nor most of the same sort, of Land and Water fowl as we saw at Botany\r\nHarbour we saw here; besides these we saw some Bustards, such as we have\r\nin England, one of which we kill'd that weighed 17 1/2 pounds, which\r\noccasioned my giving this place the Name of Bustard Bay (Latitude 24\r\ndegrees 4 minutes, Longitude 208 degrees 22 minutes West); we likewise\r\nsaw some black and white Ducks. Here are plenty of small Oysters sticking\r\nto the Rocks, Stones, and Mangrove Trees, and some few other shell fish,\r\nsuch as large Muscles, Pearl Oysters, Cockels, etc. I measured the\r\nperpendicular height of the last Tide, and found it to be 8 foot above\r\nlow water mark, and from the time of low water to-day I found that it\r\nmust be high Water at the full and Change of the Moon at 8 o'Clock.\r\n\r\nThursday, 24th. In the P.M. I was employ'd ashore in the Transactions\r\nbefore related; at 4 a.m. we weighed with a Gentle breeze at South, and\r\nmade sail out of the Bay. In standing out our soundings were from 5 to 15\r\nfathoms; when in this last Depth we were abreast of the North Point, and\r\nbeing daylight we discover'd breakers stretching out from it about\r\nNorth-North-East, 2 or 3 miles; at the Outermost point of them is a Rock\r\njust above Water. In passing these rocks at the distance of 1/2 a mile we\r\nhad from 15 to 20 fathoms; being past them, we hauld along shore\r\nWest-North-West for the farthest land we had in sight. At Noon we were by\r\nObservation in the Latitude of 23 degrees 52 minutes South; the North\r\npart of Bustard Bay bore South 62 degrees East, distance 10 miles, and\r\nthe Northermost land in sight North 60 degrees West. Longitude in 208\r\ndegrees 37 minutes West, distance from the nearest shore 6 Miles; in this\r\nsituation had 14 fathoms water.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Capricorn, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 25th. In the P.M. had it calm until 5, when a light breeze sprung\r\nup at South-East, and we steer'd North-West as the land lay until 10,\r\nthen brought too, having had all along 14 and 15 fathoms. At 5 A.M. we\r\nmade sail; at daylight the Northermost point of the Main bore North 70\r\ndegrees West, and soon after we saw more land making like Islands,\r\nbearing North-West by North; at 9 we were abreast of the point, distant\r\nfrom it 1 mile; Depth of Water 14 fathoms. I found this point to lay\r\ndirectly under the Tropic of Capricorn, and for that reason call it by\r\nthat Name. Longitude 209 degrees 0 minutes West. It is of a Moderate\r\nheight, and looks white and barren, and may be known by some Islands\r\nwhich lie to the North-West of it, and some small Rocks one League\r\nSouth-East from it; on the West side of the Cape there appeared to be a\r\nLagoon. On the 2 Spits which form the Entrance were a great Number of\r\nPelicans; at least, so I call them. The most northermost land we could\r\nsee bore from Cape Capricorn North 24 degrees West, and appeared to be an\r\nIsland;* (* Hummocky Island.) but the Main land Trended West by North 1/2\r\nNorth, which Course we steer'd, having from 15 to 16 fathoms and from 6\r\nto 9, a hard sandy bottom. At Noon our Latitude by Observation was 23\r\ndegrees 24 minutes South; Cape Capricorn bore South 60 degrees East,\r\ndistance 2 Leagues; a small Island North by East 2 Miles. In this\r\nSituation had 9 fathoms at the distance of 4 Miles from the Main land,\r\nwhich is here low and Sandy next the Sea, except the points which are\r\nmoderately high and rocky; in land the Country is hilly, and affords but\r\na very indifferent prospect.* (* Between Bustard Bay and Cape Capricorn\r\nis Port Curtis, in which stands the small town of Gladstone. Cape\r\nCapricorn is the eastern point of Curtis Island, and to the northward is\r\nKeppel Bay, into which falls the Fitzroy River. Up the latter, 35 miles\r\nfrom the sea, is Rockhampton, the second largest town of Queensland. All\r\nthis coast is encumbered with shoals, outside of which Cook had so far\r\nprudently kept. To seaward begins the long chain of islands and reefs\r\nknown as the Great Australian Barrier, which stretches up to Torres\r\nStraits. Cook was unaware of their existence, as they were out of sight,\r\nbut he became painfully acquainted with them later, where the reefs\r\napproach the land, and make navigation along the coast anxious work; but\r\nhe here began to get into difficulties with the shoals which stretch off\r\nthe coast itself.)\r\n\r\nSaturday, 26th. In the P.M. light breezes at East-South-East, with which\r\nwe stood to the North-West until 4 o'Clock, when it fell calm, and soon\r\nafter we Anchored in 12 fathoms. Cape Capricorn bearing South 54 degrees\r\nEast, distant 4 Leagues, having the Main land and Islands in a manner all\r\naround us. In the night we found the tide to rise and fall near 7 feet,\r\nand the flood to set to the Westward and Ebb to the Eastward; which is\r\nquite the reverse to what we found it when at Anchor to the Eastward of\r\nBustard Bay. At 6 a.m. we weigh'd with the Wind at South, a Gentle\r\nbreeze, and stood away to the North-West, between the Outermost range of\r\nIslands* (* The Keppel Islands.) and the Main land, leaving several small\r\nIslands between us and the Latter, which we passed Close by. Our\r\nsoundings was a little irregular, from 12 to 4 fathoms, which caused me\r\nto send a Boat ahead to sound. At noon we were about 3 Miles from the\r\nMain, about the same distance from the Islands without us; our Latitude\r\nby Observation was 23 degrees 7 minutes South, and Longitude made from\r\nCape Capricorn 18 Miles West. The Main land in this Latitude is tolerable\r\nhigh and Mountainious; and the Islands which lay off it are the most of\r\nthem pretty high and of a Small Circuit, and have more the appearance of\r\nbarrenness than fertility. We saw smookes a good way in land, which makes\r\nme think there must be a River, Lagoon, or Inlet, into the Country, and\r\nwe passed 2 places that had the Appearance of such this morning; but our\r\nDepth of Water at that Time was too little to haul in for them, where I\r\nmight expect to meet with less.\r\n\r\nSunday, 27th. We had not stood on to the Northward quite an hour before\r\nwe fell into 3 fathoms, upon which I anchor'd, and Sent away the Master\r\nwith 2 Boats to sound the Channell, which lay to Leeward of us between\r\nthe Northermost Island and the Main Land, which appear'd to me to be\r\npretty broad; but I suspected that it was Shoal, and so it was found, for\r\nthe Master reported to me upon his return that he found in many places\r\nonly 2 1/2 fathoms, and where we lay at Anchor we had only 16 feet, which\r\nwas not 2 feet more than the Ship drew.* (* This was between Great Keppel\r\nIsland and the Main. There is a mass of shoals here.) In the Evening the\r\nwind veer'd to East-North-East, which gave us an opportunity to stretch 3\r\nor 4 miles back the way we Came before the Wind Shifted to South, and\r\nobliged us again to Anchor in 6 fathoms. At 5 o'Clock in the A.M. I sent\r\naway the Master with 2 Boats to search for a Passage out between the\r\nIslands, while the Ship got under sail. As soon as it was light the\r\nSignal was made by the boats of their having found a Passage, upon which\r\nwe hoisted in the Boats, and made sail to the Northward as the land lay;\r\nsoundings from 9 to 15 fathoms, having still Some small Islands without\r\nus.* (* The ship passed out between Great Keppel Island and North Keppel\r\nIsland.) At noon we were about 2 Leagues from the Main Land, and by\r\nobservation in the Latitude of 22 degrees 53 minutes South, Longitude\r\nmade from Cape Capricorn 0 degrees 20 minutes West. At this time the\r\nNorthermost point of Land we had in sight bore North-North-West, distance\r\n10 Miles; this point I named Cape Manyfold, from the Number of high Hills\r\nover it; Latitude 22 degrees 43 minutes South; it lies North 20 degrees\r\nWest, distant 17 Leagues from Cape Capricorn. Between them the shore\r\nforms a large Bay, which I call'd Keppel Bay, and the Islands which lay\r\nin and Off it are known by the same name; in this Bay is good Anchorage,\r\nwhere there is a sufficient depth of Water; what refreshment it may\r\nafford for Shipping I know not.* (* As before mentioned, the Fitzroy\r\nRiver falls into Keppel Bay, and forms a good harbour, though much\r\nencumbered with sand banks.) We caught no fish here, notwithstanding we\r\nwere at Anchor; it can hardly be doubted but what it afforded fresh Water\r\nin several places, as both Mainland and Islands are inhabited. We saw\r\nsmokes by day and fires in the night upon the Main, and people upon one\r\nof the Islands.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Townshend, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 28th. Winds at South-South-East, a fresh breeze. At 3 o'Clock in\r\nthe P.M. we passed Cape Manifold, from which the Land Trends\r\nNorth-North-West. The land of this Cape is tolerable high, and riseth in\r\nhills directly from the Sea; it may be known by 3 Islands laying off it,\r\none near the Shore, and the other 2 Eight Miles out at Sea; the one of\r\nthese is low and flat, and the other high and round.* (* Peak and Flat\r\nIslands.) At 6 o'Clock we shortned sail and brought too; the Northermost\r\npart of the Main we had in sight bore North-West, and some Islands lying\r\noff it bore North 31 degrees West; our soundings since Noon were from 20\r\nto 25 fathoms, and in the Night 30 and 34 fathoms. At day light we made\r\nSail, Cape Manifold bearing South by East, distance 8 Leagues, and the\r\nIslands set last night in the same directions, distance from us 4 Miles.\r\nThe farthest point of the Main bore North 67 degrees West, distant 22\r\nMiles; but we could see several Islands to the Northward of this\r\ndirection.* (* The easternmost of the Northumberland Islands.) At 9\r\no'Clock we were abreast of the above point, which I named Cape Townshend*\r\n(* Charles Townshend was Chancellor of the Exchequer 1767.) (Latitude 22\r\ndegrees 13 minutes, Longitude 209 degrees 48 minutes West); the land of\r\nthis Cape is of a moderate and pretty even height, and is more barren\r\nthan woody. Several Islands lay to the Northward of it, 4 or 5 Leagues\r\nout at Sea. 3 or 4 Leagues to the South-East the Shore forms a bay,* (*\r\nShoalwater Bay, a large inlet.) in the bottom of which there appeared to\r\nbe an inlet or Harbour to the Westward of the Coast, and Trends\r\nSouth-West 1/2 South; and these form a very large Bay, which turns away\r\nto the Eastward, and probably communicates with the Inlet above\r\nmentioned, and by that Means makes the land of the Cape an Island. As\r\nsoon as we got round the Cape we hauld our wind to the Westward in order\r\nto get within the Islands which lay scatter'd up and down in this bay in\r\ngreat number, and extend out to Sea as far as we could see from the\r\nMasthead; how much farther will hardly be in my power to determine; they\r\nare as Various in their height and Circuit as they are numerous.* (* The\r\nNorthumberland islands, a very extensive group.) We had not stood long\r\nupon a Wind before we meet with Shoal Water, and was obliged to Tack\r\nabout to avoid it; after which I sent a boat ahead, and we bore away West\r\nby North, leaving many small Islands, Rocks, and Shoals between us and\r\nthe Main, and a number of Large Islands without us; soundings from 14 to\r\n17 fathoms, Sandy Bottom. A little before noon the boat made the Signal\r\nfor meeting with Shoal Water, upon which we hauld close upon a Wind to\r\nthe Eastward, but suddenly fell into 3 1/4 fathoms water, upon which we\r\nimmediately let go an Anchor, and brought the Ship up with all sails\r\nstanding, and had then 4 fathoms Coarse sandy bottom. We found here a\r\nstrong Tide setting to the North-West by West 1/2 West, at the rate of\r\nbetween 2 and 3 Miles an Hour, which was what Carried us so quickly upon\r\nthe Shoal. Our Latitude by Observation was 22 degrees 8 minutes South;\r\nCape Townshend bore East 16 degrees South, distant 13 Miles, and the\r\nWestermost part of the Main Land in sight West 3/4 North, having a number\r\nof Islands in sight all round us.* (* The ship was on the Donovan Shoal\r\nin Broad Sound Channel.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 29th. Fresh gales between the South-South-East and\r\nEast-South-East, Hazey weather, with some showers of rain. In the P.M.,\r\nhaving sounded about the Ship, and found that their was Sufficient Water\r\nfor her over the Shoal, we at 3 o'clock weigh'd and made Sail, and stood\r\nto the Westward as the Land lay, having first sent a boat ahead to sound.\r\nAt 6 we Anchor'd in 10 fathoms, Sandy bottom, about 2 Miles from the Main\r\nLand, the Westermost part of which bore West-North-West, having still a\r\nNumber of Islands in sight a long way without us. At 5 a.m. I sent away\r\nthe Master with 2 Boats to sound the Entrance of an inlet, which bore\r\nfrom us West, distance about 1 League, into which I intended to go with\r\nthe Ship to wait a few days, until the Moon increased, and in the\r\nmeantime to examine the Country. By such time as we had got the Ship\r\nunder Sail the Boats made the Signal for Anchorage, upon which we stood\r\nin with the Ship, and Anchor'd in 5 fathoms, about a League within the\r\nEntrance of the inlet, which we judged to be a River running a Good way\r\ninland, as I observed the Tides to flow and Ebb something considerable.*\r\n(* It is in reality a narrow channel which runs into Broad Sound.) I had\r\nsome thoughts of laying the Ship a Shore to Clean her bottom. With this\r\nview both the Master and I went to look for a Convenient place for that\r\npurpose, and at the same time to look for fresh Water, not one drop of\r\nwhich we could find, but met with several places where a Ship might be\r\nlaid ashore with safety.\r\n\r\n[At Anchor, Thirsty Sound.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 30th. In the P.M. I went again in search of Fresh Water, but\r\nhad no better success than before; wherefore I gave over all thoughts of\r\nlaying the Ship a Shore, being resolved to spend as little time as\r\npossible in a place that was likely to afford us no sort of refreshment.\r\nBut as I had observed from the Hills the inlet to run a good way in, I\r\nthought this a good time to penetrate into the Country to see a little of\r\nthe inland parts. Accordingly I prepared for making that Excursion in the\r\nmorning, but the first thing I did was to get upon a pretty high Hill,\r\nwhich is at the North-West entrance of the inlet, before Sunrise, in\r\norder to take a view of the Sea Coast and Islands, etc., that lay off it,\r\nand to take their bearings, having the Azimuth Compass with me for that\r\npurpose, the Needle of which differ'd from its True position something\r\nvery considerable, even above 30 degrees, in some places more, and in\r\nother less, for I try'd it in several places. I found it differ in itself\r\nabove 2 points in the space of about 14 feet. The loose stones which lay\r\nupon the Ground had no effect upon the Needle; I therefore concluded that\r\nit must be owing to Iron Ore upon the Hill, visible signs of which\r\nappeared not only here, but in several other places. As soon as I had\r\ndone here I proceeded up the inlet. I set out with the first of the\r\nflood, and long before high water got about 8 Leagues up it; its breadth\r\nthus far was from 2 to 4 or 5 Miles upon a South-West by South direction;\r\nbut here it spread every way, and formed a Large lake, which communicated\r\nwith the Sea to the North-West. I not only saw the Sea in this direction,\r\nbut found the tide of flood coming strong in from the North-West. I\r\nlikewise observ'd an Arm of this Lake extending to the Eastward, and it\r\nis not at all improbable but what it Communicates with the Sea in the\r\nbottom of the bay, which lies to the Westward of Cape Townshend.* (* This\r\nis exactly what it does.) On the South side of the Lake is a ridge of\r\npretty high hills, which I was desirous of going upon; but as the day was\r\nfar spent and high water, I was afraid of being bewilder'd among the\r\nShoals in the night, which promised to be none of the best, being already\r\nrainy, dirty weather, and therefore I made the best of my way to the\r\nShip. In this little Excursion I saw only 2 people, and those at a\r\ndistance, and are all that we have seen in this place, but we have met\r\nwith several fire places, and seen smokes at a distance. This inlet,\r\nwhich I have named Thirsty Sound, by reason we could find no fresh Water,\r\nlies in the Latitude of 22 degrees 05 minutes South, and Longitude 210\r\ndegrees 24 West; it may be known by a Group of small Islands Laying under\r\nthe shore from 2 to 5 Leagues North-West from it.* (* Barren Islands.)\r\nThere is likewise another Group of Islands laying right before it between\r\n3 and 4 Leagues out at Sea.* (* Duke Islands.) Over each of the Points\r\nthat form the Entrance is a pretty high, round Hill; that on the\r\nNorth-West is a Peninsula, surrounded by the Sea at high water; the\r\ndistance from the one to the other is about 2 Miles bold to both Shores.\r\nHere is good Anchoring in 7, 6, 5, and 4 fathoms water, and very\r\nConvenient places for laying a Ship ashore, where at Spring Tides the\r\ntides doth not rise less than 16 or 18 feet, and flows at full and Change\r\nof the Moon about 11 o'Clock. We met with no fresh water, or any other\r\nkind of refreshments whatever; we saw 2 Turtle, but caught none, nor no\r\nsort of Fish or wild fowl, except a few small land birds. Here are the\r\nsame sort of Water Fowl as we saw in Botany Bay, and like them, so shy\r\nthat it is hardly possible to get within shott of them. No signs of\r\nFertility is to be seen upon the Land; the Soil of the up lands is mostly\r\na hard, redish Clay, and produceth several sorts of Trees, such as we\r\nhave seen before, and some others, and clear of all underwoods. All the\r\nlow lands are mostly overrun with Mangroves, and at Spring tides\r\noverflow'd by the Sea; and I believe in the rainy Seasons here are large\r\nland floods, as we saw in many places Gullies, which seem'd to have been\r\nmade by torrents of Water coming from the Adjacent hills, besides other\r\nVisible signs of the Water having been a Considerable height above the\r\nCommon Spring Tides. Dr. Solander and I was upon a rising Ground up the\r\ninlet, which we thought had at one time or another been overflow'd by the\r\nSea, and if so great part of the Country must at that time been laid\r\nunder Water. Up in the lakes, or lagoons, I suppose, are shell fish, on\r\nwhich the few Natives subsist. We found Oysters sticking to most of the\r\nRocks upon the Shore, which were so small, as not to be worth the picking\r\noff.* (* Cook was very unfortunate in his landing here. The channel is at\r\nthe end of a long headland between two bays, Shoalwater Bay and Broad\r\nSound, and was a very unlikely place either to find water or get any true\r\nidea of the country.)\r\n\r\nThursday, 31st. Winds Southerly and South-East; Dark, Hazey weather, with\r\nrain. In the P.M., finding no one inducement to stay longer in this\r\nplace, we at 6 a.m. Weighed and put to Sea, and stood to the North-West,\r\nhaving the Advantage of a fresh breeze at South-South-East. We keept\r\nwithout the Group of Islands which lay in Shore, and to the North-West of\r\nThirsty Sound, as there appear'd to be no safe passage between them and\r\nthe Main; at the same time we had a number of Islands without us\r\nextending out to Sea as far as we could see; as we run in this direction\r\nour depth of Water was 10, 8 and 9 fathoms.* (* The ship passed between\r\nthe Duke Islands and the maze of reefs and islands lying North-West of\r\nThirsty Sound.) At Noon the North-West point of Thirsty Sound, which I\r\nhave named Pier head, bore South 36 degrees East, distant 5 Leagues; the\r\nEast point of the other inlet, which Communicates with the former, as I\r\nhave before mentioned, bore South by West, distance 2 1/2 Leagues, the\r\nGroup of Islands above mentioned laying between us and the point. The\r\nfarthest part of the Main in sight, on the other side of the inlet, bore\r\nNorth-West; our Latitude by Observation was 21 degrees 53 minutes South.\r\n\r\n[June 1770.]\r\n\r\nFriday, June 1st. At 1/2 an hour After Noon, upon the Boat we had ahead\r\nsounding making the Signal for Shoal Water, we hauld our wind to the\r\nNorth-East, having at that time 7 fathoms; the Next cast 5, and then 3,\r\nupon which we let go an Anchor, and brought the Ship up. The North-West\r\npoint of Thirsty Sound, or Pier Head, bore South-East, distance 6\r\nLeagues, being Midway between the Islands which lies off the East point\r\nof the Western inlet and 3 Small Islands directly without them,* (* The\r\nshoal is now known as Lake Shoal. The three Islands are the Bedwell\r\nIslands.) it being now the first of the flood which we found to set\r\nNorth-West by West 1/2 West. After having sounded about the Shoal, on\r\nwhich we found not quite 3 fathoms, but without it deep water, we got\r\nunder Sail, and hauld round the 3 Islands just mentioned, and came to an\r\nAnchor under the Lee of them in 15 fathoms, having at this time dark,\r\nhazey, rainy weather, which continued until 7 o'Clock a.m., at which time\r\nwe got again under sail, and stood to the North-West with a fresh breeze\r\nat South-South-East and fair weather, having the Main land in Sight and a\r\nNumber of Islands all round us, some of which lay out at Sea as far as we\r\ncould See. The Western Inlet before mentioned, known in the Chart by the\r\nName of Broad Sound, we had now all open. It is at least 9 or 10 Leagues\r\nwide at the Entrance, with several Islands laying in and before, and I\r\nbelieve Shoals also, for we had very irregular Soundings, from 10 to 5\r\nand 4 fathoms. At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 21\r\ndegrees 29 minutes South, and Longitude made from Cape Townshend 59\r\ndegrees West. A point of Land, which forms the North-West Entrance into\r\nBroad Sound, bore from us at this Time West, distance 3 Leagues; this\r\nCape I have named Cape Palmerston* (* Henry Viscount Palmerston was a\r\nLord of the Admiralty, 1766 to 1778.) (Latitude 21 degrees 27 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude 210 degrees 57 minutes West). Between this Cape and Cape\r\nTownshend lies the Bay of Inlets, so named from the Number of Inlets,\r\nCreeks, etc., in it.* (* The name Bay of Inlets has disappeared from the\r\ncharts. Cook applied it to the whole mass of bays in this locality,\r\ncovering over 60 miles. A look at a modern chart causes amazement that\r\nCook managed to keep his ship off the ground, as the whole sea in his\r\ntrack is strewed with dangers.)\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Hillsborough, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 2nd. Winds at South-South-East and South-East, a gentle breeze,\r\nwith which we stood to the North-West and North-West by North, as the\r\nland lay, under an easey Sail. Having a boat ahead, found our Soundings\r\nat first were very irregular, from 9 to 4 fathoms; but afterwards\r\nregular, from 9 to 11 fathoms. At 8, being about 2 Leagues from the Main\r\nLand, we Anchor'd in 11 fathoms, Sandy bottom. Soon after this we found a\r\nSlow Motion of a Tide seting to the Eastward, and rode so until 6, at\r\nwhich time the tide had risen 11 feet; we now got under Sail, and Stood\r\naway North-North-West as the land lay. From the Observations made on the\r\ntide last Night it is plain that the flood comes from the North-West;\r\nwhereas Yesterday and for Several days before we found it to come from\r\nthe South-East. This is neither the first nor second time that we have\r\nobserved the same thing, and in my Opinion easy accounted for; but this I\r\nshall do in another place. At sun rise we found the Variation to be 6\r\ndegrees 45 minutes East. In steering along shore between the Island and\r\nthe Main, at the Distance of 2 Leagues from the Latter, and 3 or 4 from\r\nthe former, our soundings were Regular, from 12 to 9 fathoms; but about\r\n11 o'Clock we were again embarrassed with Shoal Water,* (* Blackwood\r\nShoals.) but got clear without letting go an Anchor; we had at one time\r\nnot quite 3 fathoms. At Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the Main land,\r\nand about 4 from the Islands without us; our Latitude by Observation was\r\n20 degrees 56 minutes South, Longitude made from Cape Palmerston 16\r\ndegrees West; a pretty high Promontory, which I named Cape Hillsborough,*\r\n(* Earl of Hillsborough was the First Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies, and President of the Board of Trade when the Endeavour sailed.)\r\nbore West 1/2 North, distant 7 Miles. The Main Land is here pretty much\r\ndiversified with Mountains, Hills, plains, and Vallies, and seem'd to be\r\ntollerably Cloathed with Wood and Verdure. These Islands, which lay\r\nParrallel with the Coast, and from 5 to 8 or 9 Leagues off, are of\r\nVarious Extent, both for height and Circuit; hardly any Exceeds 5 Leagues\r\nin Circuit, and many again are very small.* (* The Cumberland Islands.\r\nThey stretch along the coast for 60 miles.) Besides the Chain of Islands,\r\nwhich lay at a distance from the Coast, there are other Small Ones laying\r\nunder the Land. Some few smokes were seen on the Main land.\r\n\r\nSunday, 3rd. Winds between the South by East and South-East. A Gentle\r\nbreeze and Clear weather. In the P.M. we steer'd along shore North-West\r\n1/2 West, at the distance of 2 Leagues from the Main, having 9 and 10\r\nfathoms regular soundings. At sun set the furthest point of the Main Land\r\nthat we could distinguish as such bore North 48 degrees West; to the\r\nNorthward of this lay some high land, which I took to be an Island, the\r\nNorth West point of which bore North 41 degrees West; but as I was not\r\nsure that there was a passage this way, we at 8 came to an Anchor in 10\r\nfathoms, muddy bottom. 2 hours after this we had a tide setting to the\r\nNorthward, and at 2 o'clock it had fallen 9 Feet since the time we\r\nAnchored. After this the Tide began to rise, and the flood came from the\r\nNorthward, which was from the Islands out at Sea, and plainly indicated\r\nthat there was no passage to the North-West; but as this did not appear\r\nat day light when we got under Sail, and stood away to the North-West\r\nuntil 8, at this time we discover'd low land, quite a Cross what we took\r\nfor an Opening between the Main and the Islands, which proved to be a Bay\r\nabout 5 or 6 Leagues deep. Upon this we hauld our wind to the Eastward\r\nround the Northermost point of the Bay, which bore from us at this time\r\nNorth-East by North, distance 4 Leagues. From this point we found the\r\nMain land trend away North by West 1/2 West, and a Strait or Passage\r\nbetween it and a Large Island* (* Whitsunday Island.) or Islands laying\r\nin a Parrallel direction with the Coast; this passage we Stood into,\r\nhaving the Tide of Ebb in our favour. At Noon we were just within the\r\nEntrance, and by observation in the Latitude of 20 degrees 26 minutes\r\nSouth; Cape Hillsborough bore South by East, distant 10 Leagues, and the\r\nNorth point of the Bay before mentioned bore South 19 degrees West,\r\ndistance 4 Miles. This point I have named Cape Conway* (* General H.S.\r\nConway was Secretary of State 1765 to 1768.) (Latitude 20 degrees 30\r\nminutes, Longitude 211 degrees 28 minutes), and the bay, Repulse Bay,\r\nwhich is formed by these 2 Capes. The greatest and least depth of Water\r\nwe found in it was 13 and 8 fathoms; every where safe Anchoring, and I\r\nbelieve, was it properly examined, there would be found some good Harbour\r\nin it, especIally on the North Side within Cape Conway, for just within\r\nthe Cape lay 2 or 3 Small Islands, which alone would shelter that side of\r\nthe Bay from the South-East and Southerly winds, which seem to be the\r\nprevailing or Trade Winds. Among the many islands that lay upon this\r\nCoast there is one more Remarkable than the rest,* (* Probably Blacksmith\r\nIsland.) being of a Small circuit, very high and peaked, and lies East by\r\nSouth, 10 Miles from Cape Conway at the South end of the Passage above\r\nmention'd.\r\n\r\n[In Whitsunday Passage, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 4th. Winds at South-South-East and South-East, a Gentle breeze\r\nand Clear weather. In the P.M. Steerd thro' the passage* (* Whitsunday\r\nPassage. The aspect of the shores is very pleasing.) which we found from\r\n3 to 6 or 7 Miles broad, and 8 or 9 Leagues in length, North by West 1/2\r\nWest and South by East 1/2 East. It is form'd by the Main on the West,\r\nand by Islands on the East, one of which is at least 5 Leagues in length.\r\nOur Depth of Water in running thro' was between 25 and 20 fathoms;\r\neverywhere good Anchorage; indeed the whole passage is one Continued safe\r\nHarbour, besides a Number of small Bays and Coves on each side, where\r\nships might lay as it where in a Bason; at least so it appear'd to me,\r\nfor I did not wait to Examine it, as having been in Port so lately, and\r\nbeing unwilling to loose the benefit of a light Moon. The land, both on\r\nthe Main and Islands, especially on the former, is Tolerably high, and\r\ndistinguished by Hills and Vallies, which are diversified with Woods and\r\nLawns that looked green and pleasant. On a Sandy beach upon one of the\r\nIslands we saw 2 people and a Canoe, with an outrigger, which appeared to\r\nbe both Larger and differently built to any we have seen upon the Coast.\r\nAt 6 we were nearly the length of the North end of the Passage; the North\r\nWestermost point of the Main in sight bore North 54 degrees West, and the\r\nNorth end of the Island North-North-East, having an open Sea between\r\nthese 2 points. [This passage I have named Whitsundays Passage, as it was\r\ndiscover'd on the day the Church commemorates that Festival, and the\r\nIsles which form it Cumberland Isles, in honour of His Royal Highness the\r\nDuke of Cumberland.* (* Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, was a\r\nyounger brother of George III.)] We keept under an Easey Sail and the\r\nLead going all Night, having 21, 22, and 23 fathoms, at the distance of 3\r\nLeagues from the land. At daylight A.M. we were abreast of the point\r\nabove mentioned, which is a lofty promontory; that I named Cape\r\nGloucester* (* William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, a younger\r\nbrother of George III.) (Latitude 19 degrees 57 minutes South, Longitude\r\n211 degrees 54 minutes West). It may be known by an Island which lies out\r\nat Sea North by West 1/2 West, 5 or 6 Leagues from it; this I called\r\nHolbourn Isle.* (* Admiral Francis Holbourne commanded the fleet in North\r\nAmerica in which Cook served in 1757.) There are also Islands laying\r\nunder the Land between it and Whitsundays Passage. On the West side of\r\nthe Cape the Land Trends away South-West and South-South-West, and forms\r\na deep bay. The Sand in the bottom of this bay I could but just see from\r\nthe Masthead; it is very low, and is a Continuation of the same low land\r\nas is at the bottom of Repulse Bay. Without Waiting to look into this\r\nbay, which I called Edgcumbe Bay,* (* In Port Denison, on the western\r\nside of Edgcumbe Bay, is the rising town of Bowen, the port of an\r\nagricultural district. There is good coal in the vicinity. Captain G.\r\nEdgcumbe commanded the Lancaster in the fleet in North America in 1758 in\r\nwhich Cook served. Afterwards Earl of Mount Edgcumbe.) we continued our\r\nCourse to the Westward for the Westermost land we had in sight which bore\r\nfrom us West by North 1/2 North, and appeared very high. At Noon we were\r\nabout 3 Leagues from the Land, and by observation in the Latitude of 19\r\ndegrees 47 minutes South, Cape Gloucester bearing South 63 degrees East,\r\ndistant 7 1/2 Leagues.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 5th. Winds between the South and East, a Gentle breeze, and\r\nSerene weather. At 6 a.m. we were abreast of the Western point of Land\r\nabove mentioned, distant from it 3 Miles, which I have named Cape\r\nUpstart, because being surrounded with low land it starts or rises up\r\nsingley at the first making of it (Latitude 19 degrees 39 minutes South,\r\nLongitude 212 degrees 32 minutes West); it lies West-North-West 14\r\nLeagues from Cape Gloucester, and is of a height sufficient to be seen 12\r\nLeagues; but it is not so much of a Promontory as it appears to be,\r\nbecause on each side of it near the Sea is very low land, which is not to\r\nbe seen unless you are pretty well in with the Shore. Inland are some\r\nTolerable high hills or mountains, which, like the Cape, affords but a\r\nvery barren prospect. Having past this Cape, we continued standing to the\r\nWest-North-West as the land lay, under an easey Sail, having from 16 to\r\n10 fathoms, until 2 o'Clock a.m., when we fell into 7 fathoms, upon which\r\nwe hauled our wind to the Northward, judging ourselves to be very near\r\nthe land; as so we found, for at daylight we were little more than 2\r\nLeagues off. What deceived us was the Lowness of the land, which is but\r\nvery little higher than the Surface of the Sea, but in the Country were\r\nsome hills. At noon we were in 15 fathoms Water, and about 4 Leagues from\r\nthe land. Our Latitude by Observation was 19 degrees 12 minutes South;\r\nCape Upstart bore 38 degrees 30 minutes East, distant 12 Leagues. Course\r\nand distance sail'd since Yesterday noon North 48 degrees 45 minutes, 53\r\nMiles. At and before Noon some very large smokes were Seen rise up out of\r\nthe low land. At sun rise I found the Variation to be 5 degrees 35\r\nminutes Easterly; at sun set last night the same Needle gave near 9\r\ndegrees. This being Close under Cape Upstart, I judged that it was owing\r\nto Iron ore or other Magnetical Matter Lodged in the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Off Cleveland Bay, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 6th. Light Airs at East-South-East, with which we Steer'd\r\nWest-North-West as the Land now lay; Depth of Water 12 and 14 fathoms. At\r\nNoon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 19 degrees 1 minute South,\r\nLongitude made from Cape Gloucester 1 degree 30 minutes West; Course and\r\ndistance saild since Yesterday noon West-North-West, 28 Miles. In this\r\nsituation we had the Mouth of a Bay all open extending from South 1/2\r\nEast to South-West 1/2 South, distance 2 Leagues. This bay, which I named\r\nCleveland Bay,* (* In Cleveland Bay is Townsville, the largest town in\r\nNorthern Queensland. Population 12,000.) appeared to be about 5 or 6\r\nMiles in Extent every way. The East point I named Cape Cleveland, and the\r\nWest, Magnetical Head or Island, as it had much the appearance of an\r\nIsland; and the Compass did not traverse well when near it. They are both\r\nTolerable high, and so is the Main Land within them, and the whole\r\nappeared to have the most rugged, rocky, and barren Surface of any we\r\nhave yet seen. However, it is not without inhabitants, as we saw smoke in\r\nseveral places in the bottom of the bay. The Northermost land we had in\r\nsight at this time bore North-West; this we took to be an Island or\r\nIslands, for we could not trace the Main land farther than West by North.\r\n\r\nThursday, 7th. Light Airs between the South and East, with which we\r\nsteer'd West-North-West, keeping the Main land on board, the outermost\r\npart of which at sun set bore from us West by North; but without this lay\r\nhigh land, which we took to be Islands. At daylight A.M. we were the\r\nLength of the Eastern part of this Land, which we found to Consist of a\r\nGroup of Islands* (* Palm Islands.) laying about 5 Leagues from the Main.\r\nWe being at this time between the 2, we continued advancing Slowly to the\r\nNorth-West until noon, at which time we were by observation in the\r\nLatitude of 18 degrees 49 minutes, and about 5 Leagues from the Main\r\nland, the North-West part of which bore from us North by West 1/2 West,\r\nthe Island extending from North to East; distance of the nearest 2 Miles.\r\nCape Cleveland bore South 50 degrees East, distant 18 Leagues. Our\r\nSoundings in the Course of this day's Sail were from 14 to 11 fathoms.\r\n\r\nFriday, 8th. Winds at South-South-East and South; first part light Airs,\r\nthe remainder a Gentle breeze. In the P.M. we saw several large smokes\r\nupon the Main, some people, Canoes, and, as we thought, Cocoa Nut Trees\r\nupon one of the Islands; and, as a few of these Nutts would have been\r\nvery acceptable to us at this Time, I sent Lieutenant Hicks ashore, with\r\nwhom went Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to see what was to be got. In the\r\nMeantime we keept Standing in for the Island with the Ship. At 7 they\r\nreturned on board, having met with Nothing worth Observing. The Trees we\r\nsaw were a small kind of Cabbage Palms. They heard some of the Natives as\r\nthey were putting off from the Shore, but saw none. After the Boat was\r\nhoisted in we stood away North by West for the Northermost land we had in\r\nsight, which we were abreast of at 3 o'Clock in the Morning, having\r\npassed all the Islands 3 or 4 hours before. This point I have named Point\r\nHillock,* (* Point Hillock is the east point of Hinchinbrook Island,\r\nwhich is separated from the main by a narrow and tortuous channel.) on\r\naccount of its Figure. The Land of this point is Tolerable high, and may\r\nbe known by a round Hillock or rock that appears to be detached from the\r\npoint, but I believe it joins to it. Between this Cape and Cape Cleveland\r\nthe shore forms a Large bay, which I named Hallifax bay;* (* The Earl of\r\nHalifax was Secretary of State 1763 to 1765.) before it lay the Groups of\r\nIslands before mentioned, and some others nearer the Shore. These Islands\r\nshelter the Bay in a manner from all Winds, in which is good Anchorage.\r\nThe land near the Shore in the bottom of the bay is very low and Woody;\r\nbut a little way back in the Country is a continued ridge of high land,\r\nwhich appear'd to be barren and rocky. Having passed Point Hillock, we\r\ncontinued standing to the North-North-West as the land Trended, having\r\nthe Advantage of a light Moon. At 6 a.m. we were abreast of a point of\r\nLand which lies North by West 1/2 West, 11 Miles from Point Hillick; the\r\nLand between them is very high, and of a craggy, barren surface. This\r\npoint I named Cape Sandwich;* (* Earl of Sandwich was First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty 1763.) it may not only be known by the high, craggy land over\r\nit, but by a small Island which lies East one Mile from it, and some\r\nothers about 2 Leagues to the Northward of it. From Cape Sandwich the\r\nLand trends West, and afterwards North, and forms a fine, Large Bay,\r\nwhich I called Rockingham Bay;* (* The Marquis of Rockingham was Prime\r\nMinister 1765 to 1766.) it is well Shelter'd, and affords good Anchorage;\r\nat least, so it appear'd to me, for having met with so little\r\nencouragement by going ashore that I would not wait to land or examine it\r\nfarther, but continued to range along Shore to the Northward for a parcel\r\nof Small Islands* (* The Family Islands.) laying off the Northern point\r\nof the Bay, and, finding a Channel of a Mile broad between the 3\r\nOutermost and those nearer the Shore, we pushed thro'. While we did this\r\nwe saw on one of the nearest Islands a Number of the Natives collected\r\ntogether, who seem'd to look very attentively upon the Ship; they were\r\nquite naked, and of a very Dark Colour, with short hair. At noon we were\r\nby observation in the Latitude of 17 degrees 59 minutes, and abreast of\r\nthe North point of Rockingham Bay, which bore from us West 2 Miles. This\r\nboundry of the Bay is form'd by a Tolerable high Island, known in the\r\nChart by the Name of Dunk Isle; it lays so near the Shore as not to be\r\ndistinguished from it unless you are well in with the Land. At this time\r\nwe were in the Longitude of 213 degrees 57 minutes. Cape Sandwich bore\r\nSouth by East 1/2 East, distant 19 Miles, and the northermost land in\r\nsight North 1/2 West. Our depth of Water in the Course of this day's Sail\r\nwas not more than 16, nor less than 7, fathoms.* (* About here the Great\r\nBarrier Reefs begin to close in on the land. Cook kept so close to the\r\nlatter that he was unconscious as yet of their existence; but he was soon\r\nto find them.)\r\n\r\n[Anchored near Cape Grafton, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 9th. Winds between the South and South-East, a Gentle breeze,\r\nand Clear weather, with which we steer'd North by West as the land lay,\r\nthe northern extream of which at sunset bore North 25 degrees West. We\r\nkeept on our Course under an Easey sail all night, having from 12 to 16\r\nfathoms, at the distance of about 3 or 4 Leagues from the Land. At 6 a.m.\r\nwe were abreast of Some small Islands, which we called Frankland Isles,\r\nthat lay about 2 Leagues from the Mainland, the Northern Point of which\r\nin sight bore North by West 1/2 West; but this we afterwards found to be\r\nan Island,* (* Fitzroy Island.) tolerable high, and about 4 Miles in\r\nCircuit. It lies about 2 Miles from the Point on the Main between which\r\nwe went with the ship, and were in the Middle of the Channell at Noon,\r\nand by observation in the Latitude of 16 degrees 55 minutes, where we had\r\n20 fathoms of water. The point of land we were now abreast of I called\r\nCape Grafton* (* The Duke of Grafton was Prime Minister when Cook\r\nsailed.) (Latitude 16 degrees 55 minutes South, Longitude 214 degrees 11\r\nminutes West); it is Tolerable high, and so is the whole Coast for 20\r\nLeagues to the southward, and hath a very rocky surface, which is thinly\r\ncover'd with wood. In the night we saw several fires along shore, and a\r\nlittle before noon some people.\r\n\r\nSunday, 10th. After hauling round Cape Grafton we found the land trend\r\naway North-West by West; 3 Miles to the Westward of the Cape is a Bay,\r\nwherein we Anchor'd, about 2 Miles from the Shore, in 4 fathoms, owsey\r\nbottom. The East point of the Bay bore South 74 degrees East, the West\r\npoint South 83 degrees West, and a Low green woody Island laying in the\r\nOffing bore North 35 degrees East. The Island lies North by East 1/2\r\nEast, distance 3 or 4 Leagues from Cape Grafton, and is known in the\r\nChart by the Name of Green Island. As soon as the Ship was brought to an\r\nAnchor I went ashore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander; the\r\nfirst thing I did was to look for fresh Water, and with that View rowed\r\nout towards the Cape, because in the bottom of the bay was low Mangrove\r\nland, and little probability of meeting with any there. But the way I\r\nwent I found 2 Small streams, which were difficult to get at on account\r\nof the Surf and rocks upon the Shore. As we came round the Cape we saw,\r\nin a sandy Cove, a small stream of Water run over the beach; but here I\r\ndid not go in the boat because I found that it would not be Easey to\r\nland. We hardly advanced anything into the Country, it being here hilly,\r\nwhich were steep and rocky, and we had not time to Visit the Low lands,\r\nand therefore met with nothing remarkable. My intention was to have\r\nstay'd here at least one day, to have looked into the Country had we met\r\nwith fresh water convenient, or any other Refreshment; but as we did not,\r\nI thought it would be only spending of time, and loosing as much of a\r\nlight Moon to little purpose, and therefore at 12 o'Clock at night we\r\nweighed and stood away to the North-West, having at this time but little\r\nwind, attended with Showers of rain.* (* In the next bay west of where\r\nCook anchored is Cairns, a small but rising town in the centre of a\r\nsugar-growing district.) At 4 the breeze freshned at South by East, with\r\nfair weather; we continued steering North-North-West 1/2 West as the Land\r\nlay, having 10, 12, and 14 fathoms, at a distance of 3 Leagues from the\r\nLand. At 11 we hauld off North, in order to get without a Small Low\r\nIsland* (* Low Isles. There is now a lighthouse on them.) which lay about\r\n2 Leagues from the Main; it being about high Water, about the time we\r\npassed it, great part of it lay under water. About 3 Leagues to the North\r\nWestward of this Island, close under the Main land, is another Island,*\r\n(* Snapper Island.) Tolerable high, which bore from us at Noon North 55\r\ndegrees West, distant 7 or 8 Miles; we being at this time in the Latitude\r\nof 16 degrees 20 minutes South, Cape Grafton bore South 29 degrees East,\r\ndistant 40 Miles, and the Northermost point of Land in Sight North 20\r\ndegrees West, and in this Situation had 15 fathoms Water. The Shore\r\nbetween Cape Grafton and the above Northern point forms a large but not\r\nvery deep Bay, which I named Trinity Bay, after the day on which it was\r\ndiscover'd; the North point Cape Tribulation, because here began all our\r\nTroubles. Latitude 16 degrees 6 minutes South, Longitude 214 degrees 39\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\n[The Ship Aground on Endeavour Reef.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 11th. Wind at East-South-East, with which we steer'd along shore\r\nNorth by West at the distance of 3 or 4 Leagues off, having from 14 to 10\r\nand 12 fathoms water. Saw 2 Small Islands in the Offing, which lay in the\r\nLatitude of 16 degrees 0 minutes South, and about 6 or 7 Leagues from the\r\nMain. At 6 the Northermost land in sight bore North by West 1/2 West, and\r\n2 low, woody Islands,* (* Hope Islands.) which some took to be rocks\r\nabove Water, bore North 1/2 West. At this time we shortened Sail, and\r\nhauld off shore East-North-East and North-East by East, close upon a\r\nWind. My intention was to stretch off all Night as well to avoid the\r\ndanger we saw ahead as to see if any Islands lay in the Offing,\r\nespecially as we now begun to draw near the Latitude of those discover'd\r\nby Quiros, which some Geographers, for what reason I know not, have\r\nthought proper to Tack to this land. Having the advantage of a fine\r\nbreeze of wind, and a clear Moon light Night in standing off from 6 until\r\nnear 9 o Clock, we deepned our Water from 14 to 21 fathoms, when all at\r\nonce we fell into 12, 10 and 8 fathoms. At this time I had everybody at\r\ntheir Stations to put about and come to an Anchor; but in this I was not\r\nso fortunate, for meeting again with Deep Water, I thought there could be\r\nno danger in standing on.* (* The ship passed just northward of\r\nPickersgill Reef.) Before 10 o'Clock we had 20 and 21 fathoms, and\r\nContinued in that depth until a few minutes before 11, when we had 17,\r\nand before the Man at the Lead could heave another cast, the Ship Struck\r\nand stuck fast. Immediately upon this we took in all our Sails, hoisted\r\nout the Boats and Sounded round the Ship, and found that we had got upon\r\nthe South-East Edge of a reef of Coral Rocks, having in some places round\r\nthe Ship 3 and 4 fathoms Water, and in other places not quite as many\r\nfeet, and about a Ship's length from us on the starboard side (the Ship\r\nlaying with her Head to the North-East) were 8, 10, and 12 fathoms. As\r\nsoon as the Long boat was out we struck Yards and Topmast, and carried\r\nout the Stream Anchor on our Starboard bow, got the Coasting Anchor and\r\nCable into the Boat, and were going to carry it out in the same way; but\r\nupon my sounding the 2nd time round the Ship I found the most water a\r\nStern, and therefore had this Anchor carried out upon the Starboard\r\nQuarter, and hove upon it a very great Strain; which was to no purpose,\r\nthe Ship being quite fast, upon which we went to work to lighten her as\r\nfast as possible, which seem'd to be the only means we had left to get\r\nher off. As we went ashore about the Top of High Water we not only\r\nstarted water, but threw overboard our Guns, Iron and Stone Ballast,\r\nCasks, Hoop Staves, Oil Jarrs, decay'd Stores, etc.; many of these last\r\nArticles lay in the way at coming at Heavier. All this time the Ship made\r\nlittle or no Water. At 11 a.m., being high Water as we thought, we try'd\r\nto heave her off without Success, she not being afloat by a foot or more,\r\nnotwithstanding by this time we had thrown overboard 40 or 50 Tuns\r\nweight. As this was not found sufficient we continued to Lighten her by\r\nevery method we could think off; as the Tide fell the ship began to make\r\nWater as much as two pumps could free: at Noon she lay with 3 or 4\r\nStreakes heel to Starboard; Latitude observed 15 degrees 45 minutes\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 12th. Fortunately we had little wind, fine weather, and a smooth\r\nSea, all this 24 Hours, which in the P.M. gave us an Opportunity to carry\r\nout the 2 Bower Anchors, one on the Starboard Quarter, and the other\r\nright a Stern, got Blocks and Tackles upon the Cables, brought the falls\r\nin abaft and hove taught. By this time it was 5 o'Clock p.m.; the tide we\r\nobserved now begun to rise, and the leak increased upon us, which obliged\r\nus to set the 3rd Pump to work, as we should have done the 4th also, but\r\ncould not make it work. At 9 the Ship righted, and the Leak gain'd upon\r\nthe Pumps considerably. This was an alarming and, I may say, terrible\r\ncircumstance, and threatened immediate destruction to us. However, I\r\nresolv'd to risque all, and heave her off in case it was practical, and\r\naccordingly turn'd as many hands to the Capstan and Windlass as could be\r\nspared from the Pumps; and about 20 Minutes past 10 o'Clock the Ship\r\nfloated, and we hove her into Deep Water, having at this time 3 feet 9\r\nInches Water in the hold. This done I sent the Long boat to take up the\r\nStream Anchor, got the Anchor, but lost the Cable among the Rocks; after\r\nthis turn'd all hands to the Pumps, the Leak increasing upon us.\r\n\r\nA mistake soon after hapned, which for the first time caused fear to\r\napproach upon every man in the Ship. The man that attended the well took\r\nthe Depth of water above the Ceiling; he, being relieved by another who\r\ndid not know in what manner the former had sounded, took the Depth of\r\nwater from the outside plank, the difference being 16 or 18 inches, and\r\nmade it appear that the leak had gained this upon the pumps in a short\r\ntime. This mistake was no sooner cleared up than it acted upon every man\r\nlike a Charm; they redoubled their vigour, insomuch that before 8 o'clock\r\nin the morning they gained considerably upon the leak.* (* The\r\ncircumstance related in this paragraph is from the Admiralty copy.) We\r\nnow hove up the Best Bower, but found it impossible to save the small\r\nBower, so cut it away at a whole Cable; got up the Fore topmast and\r\nForeyard, warped the Ship to the South-East, and at 11 got under sail,\r\nand stood in for the land, with a light breeze at East-South-East. Some\r\nhands employ'd sewing Oakham, Wool, etc., into a Lower Steering sail to\r\nfother the Ship; others employ'd at the Pumps, which still gain'd upon\r\nthe Leak.\r\n\r\n[Fothering the Ship.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 13th. In the P.M. had light Airs at East-South-East, with\r\nwhich we keept edging in for the Land. Got up the Maintopmast and\r\nMainyard, and having got the Sail ready for fothering of the Ship, we put\r\nit over under the Starboard Fore Chains, where we suspected the Ship had\r\nsuffer'd most, and soon after the Leak decreased, so as to be keept clear\r\nwith one Pump with ease; this fortunate circumstance gave new life to\r\nevery one on board.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to conceive than to discribe the satisfaction felt by\r\neverybody on this occasion. But a few minutes before our utmost Wishes\r\nwere to get hold of some place upon the Main, or an island, to run the\r\nShip ashore, where out of her Materials we might build a Vessel to carry\r\nus to the East Indies; no sooner were we made sencible that the outward\r\napplication to the Ship's bottom had taken effect, than the field of\r\nevery Man's hopes inlarged, so that we thought of nothing but ranging\r\nalong Shore in search of a Harbour, when we could repair the Damages we\r\nhad sustained.* (* The foregoing paragraph is from the Admiralty copy.\r\nThe situation was indeed sufficiently awkward. When it is considered that\r\nthe coast was wholly unknown, the natives decidedly hostile, the land\r\nunproductive of any means of subsistence, and the distance to the nearest\r\nDutch settlements, even if a passage should be found south of New Guinea,\r\n1500 miles, there was ample cause for apprehension if they could not save\r\nthe ship. Knowing what we now know, that all off this coast is a\r\ncontinuous line of reefs and shoals, Cook's action in standing off might\r\nseem rash. But he knew nothing of this. There was a moon; he reduced sail\r\nto double reefed topsails with a light wind, as the log tells us, and\r\nwith the cumbrous hempen cables of the day, and the imperfect means of\r\nheaving up the anchor, he was desirous of saving his men unnecessary\r\nlabour. Cook was puzzled that the next tide did not, after lightening the\r\nship, take him off; but it is now known that on this coast it is only\r\nevery alternate tide that rises to a full height, and as he got ashore\r\nnearly at the top of the higher of the two waters he had to wait\r\ntwenty-four hours until he got a similar rise. Lucky was it for them that\r\nthe wind was light. Usually at this season the trade wind is strong, and\r\nraises a considerable sea, even inside the Barrier. Hawkesworth or Banks\r\nmakes the proposition to fother the ship emanate from Mr. Monkhouse; but\r\nit is scarcely to be supposed that such a perfect seaman as Cook was not\r\nfamiliar with this operation, and he merely says that as Mr. Monkhouse\r\nhad seen it done, he confided to him the superintendence of it, as of\r\ncourse the Captain had at such a time many other things to do than stand\r\nover the men preparing the sail. In 1886 the people of Cooktown were\r\nanxious to recover the brass guns of the Endeavour which were thrown\r\noverboard, in order to place them as a memento in their town; but they\r\ncould not be found, which is not altogether surprising.) In justice to\r\nthe Ship's Company, I must say that no men ever behaved better than they\r\nhave done on this occasion; animated by the behaviour of every Gentleman\r\non board, every man seem'd to have a just sence of the Danger we were in,\r\nand exerted himself to the very utmost. The Ledge of Rocks, or Shoal, we\r\nhave been upon, lies in the Latitude of 15 degrees 45 minutes, and about\r\n6 or 7 Leagues from the Main land; but this is not the only Shoal that\r\nlay upon this part of the Coast, especially to the Northward, and one\r\nwhich we saw to the Southward, the tail of which we passed over when we\r\nhad the uneven Soundings 2 hours before we Struck. A part of this Shoal\r\nis always above Water, and looks to be white Sand; part of the one we\r\nwere upon was dry at low Water, and in that place consists of Sand and\r\nstones, but every where else Coral Rocks. At 6 we Anchored in 17 fathoms,\r\nabout 5 or 6 Leagues from the land, and one from the Shoal. At this time\r\nthe Ship made about 15 Inches Water per hour. At 6 a.m. weigh'd and stood\r\nto the North-West, edging in for the land, having a Gentle breeze at\r\nSouth-South-East. At 9 we past close without 2 small low Islands, laying\r\nin the Latitude of 15 degrees 41 minutes, and about 4 Leagues from the\r\nMain; I have named them Hope Islands, because we were always in hopes of\r\nbeing able to reach these Islands. At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from\r\nthe Land, and in the Latitude of 15 degrees 37 minutes South; the\r\nNorthermost part of the Main in sight bore North 30 degrees West, and the\r\nabove Islands extending from South 30 degrees East to South 40 degrees\r\nEast. In this situation had 12 fathoms water and several sandbanks\r\nwithout us. The Leak now decreaseth, but for fear it should break out\r\nagain we got the Sail ready fill'd for fothering; the manner this is done\r\nis thus: We Mix Oacham and Wool together (but Oacham alone would do), and\r\nchop it up Small, and then stick it loosely by handfulls all over the\r\nSail, and throw over it Sheep dung or other filth. Horse Dung for this\r\npurpose is the best. The Sail thus prepared is hauld under the Ship's\r\nbottom by ropes, and if the place of the Leak is uncertain, it must be\r\nhauld from one part of her bottom to another until one finds the place\r\nwhere it takes effect. While the Sail is under the Ship the Oacham, etc.,\r\nis washed off, and part of it carried along with the water into the Leak,\r\nand in part stops up the hole. Mr. Monkhouse, one of my Midshipmen, was\r\nonce in a Merchant Ship which Sprung a Leak, and made 48 Inches Water per\r\nhour; but by this means was brought home from Virginia to London with\r\nonly her proper crew; to him I gave the direction of this, who executed\r\nit very much to my satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[In Endeavour River, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 14th. P.M., had a Gentle breeze at South-East by East. Sent the\r\nMaster, with 2 Boats as well, to sound ahead of the Ship, as to look out\r\nfor a Harbour where we could repair our defects, and put the Ship on a\r\nproper Trim, both of which she now very much wanted. At 3 saw an Opening\r\nthat had the appearance of a Harbour; stood off and on while the Boats\r\nwere examining it, who found that there was not a sufficient depth of\r\nWater for the Ship. By this time it was almost sun set, and seeing many\r\nshoals about us we Anchored in 4 fathoms about 2 miles from the Shore,\r\nthe Main land extending from North 1/2 East to South by East 1/2 East. At\r\n8 o'clock the Pinnace, in which was one of the Mates, return'd on board,\r\nand reported that they had found a good Harbour* (* Cook Harbour,\r\nEndeavour River.) about 2 Leagues to leeward. In consequence of this\r\ninformation we, at 6 a.m., weigh'd and run down to it, first sending 2\r\nBoats ahead to lay upon the Shoals that lay in our way; and\r\nnotwithstanding this precaution, we were once in 3 fathoms with the Ship.\r\nHaving pass'd these Shoals, the Boats were sent to lay in the Channell\r\nleading into the Harbour. By this time it begun to blow in so much that\r\nthe Ship would not work, having missed stays Twice; and being entangled\r\namong Shoals, I was afraid of being drove to Leeward before the Boats\r\ncould place themselves, and therefore Anchoredd in 4 fathoms about a Mile\r\nfrom the Shore, and then made the Signal for the Boats to come on board,\r\nafter which I went myself and Buoy'd the Channell, which I found very\r\nnarrow, and the Harbour much smaller than I had been told, but very\r\nconvenient for our Purpose. At Noon Latitude observed 15 degrees 26\r\nminutes South. [Note. This day I restor'd Mr. Magra to his Duty, as I did\r\nnot find him guilty of the crimes laid to his charge.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 15th. A fresh Gale at South-East and Cloudy weather, attended\r\nwith Showers of Rain. In the Night, as it blow'd too fresh to break the\r\nShip loose to run into the Harbour, we got down the Topgallant yards,\r\nunbent the Mainsail, and some of the Small sails; got down the\r\nForetopgallant mast, and the Jibb Boom and Spritsailyard in, intending to\r\nlighten the Ship Forward as much as possible, in order to lay her ashore\r\nto come at the Leak.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 16th. Strong Gales at South-East, and Cloudy, hazey weather,\r\nwith Showers of Rain. At 6 o'Clock in the A.M. it moderated a little, and\r\nwe hove short, intending to get under sail, but was obliged to desist,\r\nand veer away again; some people were seen ashore to-day.\r\n\r\nSunday, 17th. Most part strong Gales at South-East, with some heavy\r\nshowers of rain in the P.M. At 6 a.m., being pretty moderate, we weigh'd\r\nand run into the Harbour, in doing of which we run the Ship ashore Twice.\r\nThe first time she went off without much Trouble, but the Second time she\r\nStuck fast; but this was of no consequence any farther than giving us a\r\nlittle trouble, and was no more than what I expected as we had the wind.\r\nWhile the Ship lay fast we got down the Foreyard, Foretopmast, booms,\r\netc., overboard, and made a raft of them alongside.\r\n\r\nMonday, 18th. Fresh Gales and Cloudy, with Showers of Rain. At 1 p.m. the\r\nShip floated, and we warped her into the Harbour, and moor'd her\r\nalongside of a Steep Beach on the South side; got the Anchors, Cables,\r\nand all the Hawsers ashore. In the A.M. made a Stage from the Ship to the\r\nShore, Erected 2 Tents, one for the Sick, and the other for the Stores\r\nand Provisions; Landed all the empty Casks and part of the Provisions,\r\nand sent a boat to haul the Sean, which return'd without Success.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 19th. Fresh Gales at South-East and Cloudy weather, with\r\nfrequent showers of Rain. P.M., landed all the Provisions and Part of the\r\nStores; got the Sick ashore, which amounted, at this time, to 8 or 9,\r\nafflicted with different disorders, but none very dangerously ill. This\r\nafternoon I went upon one of the highest Hills over the Harbour, from\r\nwhich I had a perfect View of the inlet or River, and adjacent country,\r\nwhich afforded but a very indifferent prospect. The Low lands near the\r\nRiver is all over run with Mangroves, among which the salt water flows\r\nevery tide, and the high land appear'd to be barren and Stoney. A.M., got\r\nthe 4 remaining Guns out of the hold, and mounted them on the Quarter\r\nDeck; got a spare Anchor and Stock ashore, and the remaining part of the\r\nStores and ballast that were in the Hold; set up the Forge, and set the\r\nArmourer and his Mate to work to make Nails, etc., to repair the Ship.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 20th. Winds at South-East, a fresh breeze, Fore and Middle\r\nparts rainy, the Latter fair. This day got out all the Officers' stores\r\nand the ground Tier of Water, having now nothing in the Fore and Main\r\nHold But the Coals and a little Stone ballast.\r\n\r\nThursday, 21st. P.M., landed the Powder, got out the stone ballast, wood,\r\netc., which brought the Ship's Draught of water to 8 feet 10 inches\r\nForward, and 13 feet abaft. This I thought, by trimming the Coals aft,\r\nwould be sufficient, as I find the Tides will rise and fall upon a\r\nPerpendicular 8 feet at Spring tides; but after the Coals was trimm'd\r\naway from over the Leak we Could hear the Water come Gushing in a little\r\nabaft the Foremast about 3 feet from her Keel. This determin'd me to\r\nclear the hold intirely; accordingly very early in the Morning we went to\r\nwork to get out the Coals, which was Employment for all hands.\r\n\r\n[Ship Beached in Endeavour River.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 22nd. Winds at South-East, fair weather. At 4 p.m., having got\r\nout most of the Coals, cast loose the Ship's moorings, and warped her a\r\nlittle higher up the Harbour to a place I had pitched upon to lay her\r\nashore to stop the Leak; draught of water Forward 7 feet 9 inches and\r\nabaft 13 feet 6 inches. At 8, being high water, hauld her bow close\r\nashore, but Keept her stern afloat, because I was afraid of Neaping her,*\r\n(* I.e., Having her so far on shore that they could not heave her off at\r\nNeap tide.) and yet it was necessary to lay the whole of her as near the\r\nground as possible.* (* The town of Cooktown now stands where the\r\nEndeavour was beached, and the (as near as can be judged) exact spot is\r\nmarked by a monument.) At 2 a.m. the Tide left her, which gave us an\r\nOpportunity to Examine the Leak, which we found to be at her Floor Heads,\r\na little before the Starboard Fore Chains; here the Rocks had made their\r\nway thro' 4 planks, quite to, and even into the Timbers, and wounded 3\r\nmore. The manner these planks were damaged--or cut out, as I may say--is\r\nhardly credible; scarce a Splinter was to be seen, but the whole was cut\r\naway as if it had been done by the Hands of Man with a blunt-edge Tool.\r\nFortunately for us the Timbers in this place were very close; other wise\r\nit would have been impossible to have saved the Ship, and even as it was\r\nit appeared very extraordinary that she made no more water than what she\r\ndid. A large peice of Coral rock was sticking in one Hole, and several\r\npeices of the Fothering, small stones, etc., had made its way in, and\r\nlodged between the Timbers, which had stopped the Water from forcing its\r\nway in in great Quantities. Part of the Sheathing was gone from under the\r\nLarboard bow, part of the False Kiel was gone, and the remainder in such\r\na Shatter'd Condition that we should be much better off if it was gone\r\nalso; her Forefoot and some part of her Main Kiel was also damaged, but\r\nnot Materially. What damage she may have received abaft we could not see,\r\nbut believe not much, as the Ship makes but little water, while the Tide\r\nKeeps below the Leak forward. At 9 the Carpenters went to work upon the\r\nShip, while the Armourers were buisy making Bolts, Nails, etc.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 23rd. Winds South Easterly, a fresh Gale and fair weather.\r\nCarpenters employed Shifting the Damaged planks as long as the tide would\r\npermit them to work. At low water P.M. we examined the Ship's bottom\r\nunder the Starboard side, she being dry as far aft as the After-part of\r\nthe Fore Chains; we could not find that she had received any other damage\r\non this side but what has been mentioned. In the morning I sent 3 Men\r\ninto the Country to shoot Pidgeons, as some of these birds had been seen\r\nflying about; in the evening they return'd with about 1/2 a Dozen. One of\r\nthe Men saw an Animal something less than a greyhound; it was of a Mouse\r\nColour, very slender made, and swift of Foot.* (* Kangaroo.) A.M., I sent\r\na Boat to haul the Sean, who return'd at noon, having made 3 Hauls and\r\ncaught only 3 fish; and yet we see them in plenty Jumping about the\r\nharbour, but can find no method of catching them.\r\n\r\nSunday, 24th. Winds and weather as Yesterday. P.M., the Carpenters\r\nfinished the Starboard side, and at 9 heeld the Ship the other way, and\r\nhauld her off about 2 feet for fear of Neaping. In the A.M. they went to\r\nwork repairing the Sheathing under the Larboard bow, where we found 2\r\nplanks cut about half thro'. Early in the morning I sent a party of Men\r\ninto the Country under the direction of Lieutenant Gore to seek for\r\nrefreshments; they return'd about noon with a few Palm Cabbages and a\r\nBunch or 2 of wild Plantains; these last were much Smaller than any I had\r\never seen, and the Pulp full of small Stones; otherwise they were well\r\ntasted. I saw myself this morning, a little way from the Ship, one of the\r\nAnimals before spoke off; it was of a light mouse Colour and the full\r\nsize of a Grey Hound, and shaped in every respect like one, with a long\r\ntail, which it carried like a Grey hound; in short, I should have taken\r\nit for a wild dog but for its walking or running, in which it jump'd like\r\na Hare or Deer. Another of them was seen to-day by some of our people,\r\nwho saw the first; they described them as having very small Legs, and the\r\nprint of the Feet like that of a Goat; but this I could not see myself\r\nbecause the ground the one I saw was upon was too hard, and the length of\r\nthe Grass hindered my seeing its legs.* (* These kangaroos were the first\r\nseen by Europeans. The name was obtained from the natives by Mr. Banks.)\r\n\r\nMonday, 25th. At low water in the P.M. While the Carpenters were buisey\r\nin repairing the Sheathing and plank under the Larboard bow I got people\r\nto go under the Ship's bottom, to examine all her Larboard side, she only\r\nbeing dry Forward, but abaft were 9 feet water. They found part of the\r\nSheathing off abreast of the Mainmast about her floor heads, and a part\r\nof one plank a little damaged. There were 3 people who went down, who all\r\nagreed in the same Story; the Master was one, who was positive that she\r\nhad received no Material Damage besides the loss of the Sheathing. This\r\nalone will be sufficient to let the worm into her bottom, which may prove\r\nof bad consequence. However, we must run all risque, for I know of no\r\nmethod to remedy this but by heaving her down, which would be a work of\r\nEmence Labour and time, if not impractical in our present situation.\r\n\r\nThe Carpenters continued hard at work under her bottom until put off by\r\nthe Tide in the evening, and the morning Tide did not Ebb out far enough\r\nto permit them to work upon her, for here we have only one Tolerable low\r\nand high tide in 24 Hours. A.M., a party of Men were employ'd ashore\r\nfilling water, while others were employ'd overhauling the rigging.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 26th. Fair weather, a South-East wind, and a fresh Gale; at low\r\nWater P.M. the Carpenters finished under the Larboard bow and every other\r\nplace the tide would permit them to come at. Lashed some Casks under the\r\nShip's bows in order to help to float her, and at high water in the Night\r\nattempted to heave her off, but could not, she not being afloat partly\r\nowing to some of the Casks not holding that were Lashed under her. A.M.,\r\nemployed getting more Casks ready for the same purpose; but I am much\r\nafraid that we shall not be able to float her now the Tides are Taking\r\noff.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 27th. A fresh breeze of Wind at South-East and Cloudy weather.\r\nP.M., lashed 38 empty Butts under the Ship's Bottom in order to float her\r\noff, which proved ineffectual, and therefore gave over all hopes of\r\ngetting her off until the Next spring tides. At daylight we got a\r\nConsiderable weight of sundry Articles from Aft forward to ease the Ship;\r\nthe Armourer at work at the Forge repairing Iron work, etc., Carpenters\r\ncaulking and Stocking one of the Spare Anchors, Seamen employ'd filling\r\nof Water and overhauling the rigging, and I went in the pinnace up the\r\nHarbour, and made several hauls with the Sean, but caught only between 20\r\nand 30 pound of fish, which were given to the sick and such as were weak\r\nand Ailing.\r\n\r\nThursday, 28th. Fresh breezes and Cloudy. All hands employ'd as\r\nYesterday.\r\n\r\nFriday, 29th. Wind and weather as Yesterday, and the employment of the\r\nPeople the same, Lieutenant Gore having been 4 or 5 miles in the Country,\r\nwhere he met with nothing remarkable. He saw the footsteps of Men, and\r\nlikewise those of 3 or 4 sorts of wild beasts, but saw neither Man nor\r\nbeast. Some others of our people who were out Yesterday on the North side\r\nof the River met with a place where the Natives have just been, as their\r\nfires was then burning; but they saw nobody, nor have we seen one since\r\nwe have been in port. In these excursions we found some Wild Yamms or\r\nCocos growing in the Swampy grounds, and this Afternoon I sent a Party of\r\nMen to gather some. The Tops we found made good greens, and eat\r\nexceedingly well when Boil'd, but the roots were so bad that few besides\r\nmyself could eat them. This night Mr. Green and I observ'd an Emersion of\r\nJupiter's first Satellite, which hapned at 2 hours 58 minutes 53 seconds\r\nin the A.M.; the same Emersion hapnd at Greenwich, according to\r\nCalculation, on the 30th at 5 hours 17 minutes 43 seconds A.M. The\r\ndifferance is 14 hours 18 minutes 50 seconds, equal to 214 degrees 42\r\nminutes 30 seconds of Longitude,* (* This was an excellent observation.\r\nThe true longitude is 214 degrees 45 minutes.) which this place is West\r\nof Greenwich, and its Latitude 15 degrees 26 minutes South. A.M., I sent\r\nsome hands in a Boat up the River to haul the Sean, while the rest were\r\nemploy'd about the rigging and sundry other Dutys.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 30th. Moderate breezes at South-East, and clear serene weather.\r\nP.M., the Boat returned from hauling the Sean, having caught as much fish\r\nas came to a pound and a half a Man. A.M., I sent her again to haul the\r\nSean, and some hands to gather greens, while others were employ'd about\r\nthe rigging, etc., etc. I likewise sent some of the Young Gentlemen to\r\ntake a plan of the Harbour, and went myself upon the hill, which is near\r\nthe South point to take a view of the Sea.* (* Grassy Hill.) At this time\r\nit was low water, and I saw what gave me no small uneasiness, which were\r\na Number of Sand Banks and Shoals laying all along the Coast; the\r\ninnermost lay about 3 or 4 Miles from the Shore, and the outermost\r\nextended off to Sea as far as I could see without my glass, some just\r\nappeared above water.* (* These were the innermost reefs of the Great\r\nBarrier. There is a tolerably clear passage about 8 miles wide between\r\nthem and the shore, though this has some small shoals in it.) The only\r\nhopes I have of getting clear of them is to the Northward, where there\r\nseems to be a Passage, for as the wind blows constantly from the\r\nSouth-East we shall find it difficult, if not impractical, to return to\r\nthe Southward.\r\n\r\n[July 1770.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 1st July. Gentle breezes at South-East, and Cloudy weather, with\r\nsome Gentle Showers in the morning. P.M., the People return'd from\r\nhauling the Sean, having caught as much fish as came to 2 1/2 pound per\r\nMan, no one on board having more than another. The few Greens we got I\r\ncaused to be boil'd among the pease, and makes a very good Mess, which,\r\ntogether with the fish, is a great refreshment to the people. A.M., a\r\nparty of Men, one from each Mess, went again a fishing, and all the rest\r\nI gave leave to go into the Country, knowing that there was no danger\r\nfrom the Natives. To-day at Noon the Thermometer in the Shade rose to 87\r\ndegrees, which is 2 or 3 Degrees higher than it hath been on any day\r\nbefore in this place.\r\n\r\nMonday, 2nd. Ditto weather. P.M., the fishing-party caught as much fish\r\nas came to 2 pounds a Man. Those that were in the Country met with\r\nnothing New. Early in the A.M. I sent the Master in the pinnace out of\r\nthe Harbour, to sound about the Shoals in the Offing and to look for a\r\nChannel to the Northward. At this time we had a breeze of wind from the\r\nland, which continued till about 9. What makes me mention this is, that\r\nit is the first Land breeze we have had since we have been in this River.\r\nAt low water lashed empty Casks under the Ship's bows, being in some\r\nhopes of floating her the next high Water, and sent some hands a fishing,\r\nwhile others were employ'd in refitting the Ship.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 3rd. Winds at South-East, Fore and Middle part gentle breeze,\r\nthe remainder a fresh gale. In the evening the fishing Party return'd,\r\nhaving got as much fish as came to 2 pounds a Man. At high water we\r\nattempted to heave the Ship off, but did not succeed. At Noon the Master\r\nreturn'd, and reported he had found a passage out to Sea between the\r\nShoals, which passage lies out East-North-East or East by North from the\r\nRiver mouth. He found these Shoals to Consist of Coral Rocks; he landed\r\nupon one, which drys at low Water, where he found very large cockles* (*\r\nTridacna.) and a Variety of other Shell fish, a quantity of which he\r\nbrought away with him. He told me that he was 5 Leagues out at Sea,\r\nhaving at that distance 21 fathoms water, and judg'd himself to be\r\nwithout all the Shoals, which I very much doubted.* (* Cook was right.\r\nThe shoals extend for four leagues farther.) After this he came in Shore,\r\nand Stood to the Northward, where he met with a Number of Shoals laying a\r\nlittle distance from the Shore. About 9 in the evening he landed in a Bay\r\nabout 3 Leagues to the Northward of this Place, where he disturbed some\r\nof the Natives, whom he supposed to be at supper; they all fled upon his\r\napproach, and Left him some fresh Sea Eggs, and a fire ready lighted\r\nbehind them; but there was neither House nor Hut near. Although these\r\nShoals lay within sight of the Coast, and abound very much with Shell\r\nfish and other small fish, which are to be caught at Low water in holes\r\nin the Rocks, yet the Natives never visit them, for if they did we must\r\nhave seen of these Large shells on shore about their  fire places. The\r\nreason I do suppose is, that they have no Boats that they dare Venture so\r\nfar out at Sea in.* (* Nevertheless the natives do get out to the islands\r\nwhich lie farther from the shore than these reefs, as Cook himself\r\nafterwards found.)\r\n\r\nWednesday, 4th. Strong gales at South-East and fair weather. P.M., the\r\nfishing party return'd with the usual success; at High water hove the\r\nship Afloat. A.M., employ'd trimming her upon an even Kiel, intending to\r\nlay her ashore once more, to come at her bottom under the Larboard Main\r\nChains.\r\n\r\nThursday, 5th. Strong breezes at South-East and fair weather. P.M. Warped\r\nthe Ship over, and at high Water laid her ashore on the Sandbank on the\r\nSouth side of the River, for I was afraid to lay her broad side to the\r\nShore where she lay before, because the ground lies upon too great a\r\ndecent, and she hath already received some Damage by laying there these\r\nlast Niep Tides, at least she still makes water.\r\n\r\n[At Anchor, Endeavour River.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 6th. Ditto weather. At low water in the P.M. had hardly 4 feet\r\nwater under the Ship; yet could not repair the Sheathing that was beat\r\noff, the place being all under water. One of the Carpenter's crew, a Man\r\nI could trust, went down and Examin'd it, and found 3 Streakes of the\r\nSheathing gone about 7 or 8 feet long, and the Main Plank a little\r\nrubbed; this account agrees with the report of the Master and others that\r\nwere under her bottom before. The Carpenter, who I look upon to be well\r\nskill'd in his profession, and a good judge in these matters, was of\r\nOpinion that this was of little consequence; and as I found that it would\r\nbe difficult, if not impractical, for us to get under her bottom to\r\nrepair it, I resolved to spend no more time about it. Accordingly at high\r\nwater hove her off, and moor'd her alongside the beach, where the Stores,\r\netc., lay, and in the A.M. got everything in readiness for taking them on\r\nboard, and at the same time got on board 8 Tuns of Water, and stow'd in\r\nthe ground Tier in the after Hold. In the Morning Mr. Banks and\r\nLieutenant Gore with 3 Men went in a small Boat up the Harbour, with a\r\nView to stay 2 or 3 days to try to Kill some of the Animals we have seen\r\nabout this place.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 7th. Fresh breezes at South-East and fair weather. Employ'd\r\ngetting on board Coals, Ballast, etc., and caulking the Ship; a work that\r\ncould not be done while she lay aground. The Armourer and his Mate are\r\nStill employ'd at the Forge making and repairing sundry Articles in the\r\nIron way.\r\n\r\nSunday, 8th. Gentle breeze and South-East, and clear weather. Early I\r\nsent the Master in a Boat out to Sea to sound again about the Shoals,\r\nbecause the account he had given of the Channell before mentioned was to\r\nme by no means Satisfactory; likewise sent some hands to haul the Sean,\r\nwho caught near 80 pounds of fish; the rest of the people I gave leave to\r\ngo into the Country.\r\n\r\nMonday, 9th. In the Day Ditto Winds, but in the night Calm. P.M., Mr.\r\nGore and Mr. Banks return'd, having met with nothing remarkable; they\r\nwere about 3 or 4 Leagues up in the Country without finding hardly any\r\nVariation either in the Soil or Produce. In the Evening the Master\r\nreturn'd, having been several Leagues out at Sea, and at that Distance\r\noff saw Shoals without him, and was of opinion there was no getting out\r\nto Sea that way. In his return he touched upon one of the Shoals, the\r\nsame as he was upon the first time he was out; he here saw a great number\r\nof Turtle, 3 of which he Caught weighing 791 pounds. This occasion'd my\r\nsending him out again this morning provided with proper gear for Striking\r\nthem, he having before nothing but a Boat Hook. Carpenters, Smiths, and\r\nCoopers at their respective Employments, and the Seamen employed getting\r\non board stones, ballast, etc. This day all hands feasted upon Turtle for\r\nthe First time.* (* As they had had nothing fresh but a little fish for\r\nfour months, and scarcely any meat since they left the Society Islands,\r\neleven months before, we can imagine that this was a feast.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 10th. Winds and weather as yesterday. Employ'd hoisting on board\r\nand stowing away the ground Tier of Water. P.M., saw 7 or 8 of the\r\nNatives on the South side of the River, and 2 of them came down upon the\r\nSandy point opposite the Ship; but as soon as I put off in a Boat in\r\norder to speak with them they run away as fast as they could. At 11 Mr.\r\nBanks, who had gone out to Sea with Mr. Molineux, the Master, return'd in\r\nhis own Small Boat, and gave but a Very bad account of our\r\nTurtlecatchers. At the time he left them, which was about 6 o'Clock, they\r\nhad not got one, nor were they likely to get any; and yet the Master was\r\nso obstinate that he would not return,* (* This seems rather hard upon\r\nthe Master.) which obliged me to send Mr. Gore out in the Yawl this\r\nmorning to order the Boat and People in, in Case they could not be\r\nemploy'd there to some Advantage. In the A.M. 4 of the Natives came down\r\nto the Sandy point on the North side of the Harbour, having along with\r\nthem a small wooden Canoe with Outriggers, in which they seem'd to be\r\nemployed striking fish, etc. Some were for going over in a Boat to them;\r\nbut this I would not suffer, but let them alone without seeming to take\r\nany Notice of them. At length 2 of them came in the Canoe so near the\r\nShip as to take some things we throw'd them. After this they went away,\r\nand brought over the other 2, and came again alongside, nearer than they\r\nhad done before, and took such Trifles as we gave them; after this they\r\nlanded close to the Ship, and all 4 went ashore, carrying their Arms with\r\nthem. But Tupia soon prevailed upon them to lay down their Arms, and come\r\nand set down by him, after which most of us went to them, made them again\r\nsome presents, and stay'd by them until dinner time, when we made them\r\nunderstand that we were going to eat, and asked them by signals to go\r\nwith us; but this they declined, and as soon as we left them they went\r\naway in their Canoe. One of these Men was something above the Middle Age,\r\nthe other 3 were young; none of them were above 5 1/2 feet high, and all\r\ntheir Limbs proportionately small. They were wholy naked, their Skins the\r\nColour of Wood soot, and this seem'd to be their Natural Colour. Their\r\nHair was black, lank, and cropt short, and neither wooly nor Frizled; nor\r\ndid they want any of their Fore Teeth, as Dampier has mentioned those did\r\nhe saw on the Western side of this Country. Some part of their Bodys had\r\nbeen painted with red, and one of them had his upper lip and breast\r\npainted with Streakes of white, which he called Carbanda. Their features\r\nwere far from being disagreeable; their Voices were soft and Tunable, and\r\nthey could easily repeat any word after us, but neither us nor Tupia\r\ncould understand one word they said.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 11th. Gentle land and Sea breezes. Employed Airing the Bread,\r\nstowing away water, Stores, etc. In the night the Master and Mr. Gore\r\nreturned with the Long Boat, and brought with them one Turtle and a few\r\nShell fish; the Yawl Mr. Gore left upon the Shoal with 6 Men to endeavour\r\nto strike more Turtle. In the morning 4 of the Natives made us another\r\nShort Visit; 3 of them had been with us the preceeding day, the other was\r\na stranger. One of these men had a hole through the Bridge* (* The\r\ncartilage of the nostril.) of his nose, in which he stuck a peice of Bone\r\nas thick as my finger. Seeing this we examin'd all their Noses, and found\r\nthat they had all holes for the same purpose; they had likewise holes in\r\ntheir Ears, but no Ornaments hanging to them; they had bracelets on their\r\nArms made of hair, and like Hoops of small Cord. They sometimes may wear\r\na kind of fillet about their Heads, for one of them had applied some part\r\nof an old shirt which I had given them to this use.\r\n\r\nThursday, 12th. Winds and weather as Yesterday, and the Employment of the\r\nPeople the same. At 2 A.M. the Yawl came on board, and brought 3 Turtle\r\nand a large Skeat, and as there was a probability of succeeding in this\r\nkind of fishery, I sent her out again after breakfast. About this time 5\r\nof the Natives came over and stay'd with us all the Forenoon. There were\r\n7 in all--5 Men, 1 Woman, and a Boy; these 2 last stay'd on the point of\r\nLand on the other side of the River about 200 Yards from us. We could\r\nvery clearly see with our Glasses that the Woman was as naked as ever she\r\nwas born; even those parts which I always before now thought Nature would\r\nhave taught a woman to Conceal were uncovered.\r\n\r\nFriday, 13th. Gentle breezes from the South-East in day, and Calm or\r\nlight Airs from the Land in the Night. Employ'd taking on board water,\r\nStores, etc. At Noon the Yawl return'd with one Turtle and a large Sting\r\nray.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 14th. Gentle breezes at South-East and Hazey weather. In the\r\nP.M. compleated our water; got on board all the Bread, and part of our\r\nStores; in the evening sent the Turtlers out again. A.M., employ'd\r\ngetting on board stone ballast and Airing the spare Sails. Mr. Gore,\r\nbeing in the Country, shott one of the Animals before spoke of; it was a\r\nsmall one of the sort, weighing only 28 pound clear of the entrails; its\r\nbody was ----* (* Blank in manuscript.) long; the head, neck, and\r\nShoulders very Small in proportion to the other parts. It was hair lipt,\r\nand the Head and Ears were most like a Hare's of any Animal I know; the\r\nTail was nearly as long as the body, thick next the Rump, and Tapering\r\ntowards the End; the fore Legs were 8 Inches long, and the Hind 22. Its\r\nprogression is by Hopping or Jumping 7 or 8 feet at each hop upon its\r\nhind Legs only, for in this it makes no use of the Fore, which seem to be\r\nonly design'd for Scratching in the ground, etc. The Skin is cover'd with\r\na Short, hairy furr of a dark Mouse or Grey Colour. It bears no sort of\r\nresemblance to any European animal I ever saw; it is said to bear much\r\nresemblance to the Jerboa, excepting in size, the Jerboa being no larger\r\nthan a common rat.\r\n\r\nSunday, 15th. Gentle breezes at South-East and East. P.M., got on board\r\nthe Spare Sails and sundry other Articles. In the A.M., as the people did\r\nnot work upon the Ship, one of the Petty Officers was desirous of going\r\nout to Catch Turtles. I let him have the Pinnace for that purpose, and\r\nsent the Long boat to haul the Sean, who caught about 60 fish.\r\n\r\nMonday, 16th. Fore and Latter parts gentle breezes at East-North-East; in\r\nthe night had light Airs and Calm. In the evening the Yawl came in with 4\r\nTurtle and a Large Sting ray, and soon after went out again; but the\r\nPinnace did not return as I expected. A.M., employ'd getting on board\r\nCables; at the same time I went upon one of the high hills on the North\r\nside of the River, from which I had an extensive view of the inland\r\nCountry, which consisted of hills, Valleys, and Large plains, agreeably\r\ndiversified with Woods and Lawns.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 17th. Wind at South-East, a fresh breeze; people employed as\r\nyesterday setting up the rigging. In the evening the Pinnace returned\r\nwith 3 Turtles, 2 of which the Yawl caught and sent in. At 7 hours 41\r\nminutes 17 seconds p.m. observ'd the first Satellite of Jupiter to\r\nEmerge, and the same Emersion hapned at Greenwich at 10 hours 00 minutes\r\n52 seconds in the a.m.; the difference is 14 hours 19 minutes 35 seconds\r\nequal to 214 degrees 53 minutes 45 seconds of Longitude. The observation\r\nmade on the 29th of last Month gave 214 degrees 42 minutes 30 seconds;\r\nthe mean is 214 degrees 48 minutes 7 1/2 seconds, which this place is\r\nWest of Greenwich.* (* As before mentioned, the true longitude is 214\r\ndegrees 45 minutes.)\r\n\r\nWednesday, 18th. Wind at East-South-East, a Gentle breeze. P.M., I sent\r\nthe Master and one of the Mates in the Pinnace to the Northward to look\r\nfor a Channell that way clear of the Shoal. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and\r\nmyself took a turn into the woods on the other side of the water, where\r\nwe met with 5 of the Natives; and although we had not seen any of them\r\nbefore, they came to us without showing any signs of fear. 2 of these\r\nwore Necklaces made of Shells, which they seem'd to Value, as they would\r\nnot part with them. In the evening the Yawl came in with 3 Turtle, and\r\nearly in the A.M. she went out again. About 8 we were Visited by several\r\nof the Natives, who now became more familiar than ever. Soon after this\r\nMr. Banks and I went over to the South* (* This should be North.) side of\r\nthe River, and Travel'd 6 or 8 miles along shore to the Northward, where\r\nwe ascended a high hill, from whence I had an extensive view of the Sea\r\nCoast; it afforded us a melancholy prospect of the difficulties we are to\r\nencounter, for in whatever direction we looked it was cover'd with Shoals\r\nas far as the Eye could see; after this we return'd to the Ship without\r\nmeeting with anything remarkable, and found several of the Natives on\r\nboard. At this time we had 12 tortoise or Turtle upon our Decks, which\r\nthey took more Notice of than anything Else in the Ship, as I was told by\r\nthe officers, for their Curiosity was Satisfied before I got on board,\r\nand they went away soon after.\r\n\r\nThursday, 19th. Gentle breezes and fair weather. Employ'd getting\r\neverything in readyness for Sea. A.M., we were Visited by 10 or 11 of the\r\nNatives; the most of them came from the other side of the Harbour, where\r\nwe saw 6 or 7 more, the most of them Women, and, like the men, quite\r\nnaked. Those that came on board were very desirous of having some of our\r\nTurtles, and took the liberty to haul 2 of them to the Gangway to put\r\nover the side; being disappointed in this, they grew a little\r\nTroublesome, and were for throwing every thing overboard they could lay\r\ntheir hands upon. As we had no Victuals dress'd at this time, I offer'd\r\nthem some bread to Eat, which they rejected with Scorn, as I believe they\r\nwould have done anything else excepting Turtle;* (* No doubt, in the\r\nnative view, the turtle belonged to them, and they considered the\r\nstrangers had annexed their property.) soon after this they all went\r\nashore, Mr. Banks, myself, and 5 or 6 of our people being their at same\r\ntime. Immediately upon their Landing one of tbem took a Handful of dry\r\ngrass and lighted it at a fire we had ashore, and before we well know'd\r\nwhat he was going about he made a larger Circuit round about us, and set\r\nfire to the grass in his way, and in an instant the whole place was in\r\nflames. Luckily at this time we had hardly anything ashore, besides the\r\nForge and a Sow with a litter of young Pigs, one of which was scorched to\r\nDeath in the fire. As soon as they had done this they all went to a place\r\nwhere some of our people were washing, and where all our nets and a good\r\ndeal of linnen were laid out to dry; here with the greatest obstinacy\r\nthey again set fire to the grass, which I and some others who were\r\npresent could not prevent, until I was obliged to fire a Musquet load\r\nwith small Shott at one of the Ring leaders, which sent them off. As we\r\nwere apprised of this last Attempt of theirs we got the fire out before\r\nit got head, but the first spread like wild fire in the Woods and grass.\r\nNotwithstanding my firing, in which one must have been a little hurt,\r\nbecause we saw a few drops of blood on some of the linnen he had gone\r\nover, they did not go far from us; for we soon after heard their Voices\r\nin the woods, upon which Mr. Banks and I and 3 or 4 more went to look for\r\nthem, and very soon met them coming toward us. As they had each 4 or 5\r\nDarts, and not knowing their intention, we seized upon 6 or 7 of the\r\nfirst darts we met with. This alarm'd them so much that they all made\r\noff, and we follow'd them for near 1/2 a Mile, and then set down and\r\ncalled to them, and they stop'd also; after some little unintelligible\r\nconversation had passed they laid down their darts, and came to us in a\r\nvery friendly manner. We now return'd the Darts we had taken from them,\r\nwhich reconcil'd everything. There were 4 Strangers among them that we\r\nhad not seen before, and these were interduced to us by name by the\r\nothers; the Man which we supposed to have been Struck with small Shott\r\nwas gone off, but he could not be much hurt as he was at a great distance\r\nwhen I fir'd. They all came along with us abreast of the Ship, where they\r\nstay'd a short time, and then went away, and soon after set the woods on\r\nfire about a Mile and a half or two Miles from us.\r\n\r\nFriday, 20th. Fresh breezes at South-East and Cloudy weather. P.M., got\r\neverything on board the Ship, new berth'd her, and let her swing with the\r\ntide. In the night the Master return'd with the pinnace, and reported\r\nthat there was no safe Passage for the Ship to the Northward at low\r\nwater. A.M., I went and Sounded and buoy'd the Bar, being now ready to\r\nput to sea the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 21st. Strong breezes at South-East and Cloudy weather. P.M.,\r\nsent a Boat to haul the Sean, which return'd with as much fish as came to\r\n1 3/4 pounds per Man; the Yawl return'd with only one Turtle, which was\r\ncaught in the Net, for it blew too hard for the Boat to strike any. In\r\nthe morning I sent her out again, but she was obliged to return, not\r\nbeing able to get to Windward. The Carpenters employ'd in repairing the\r\nBoats and overhauling the Pumps, and as the Wind would not permit us to\r\nsail, I sent the Boatswain with some hands ashore to make rope, and a\r\npetty Officer with 2 Men to gather Greens for the Ship's Company.\r\n\r\nSunday, 22nd. Fresh breezes at South-East and East-South-East. Employ'd\r\nas Yesterday. A.M., the weather would not permit us to Sail; sent the\r\nTurtlers out again. In opening of one to-day we found sticking thro' both\r\nShoulder bones a wood Harpoon, or Turtle Peg, 15 Inches long, bearded at\r\nthe end, such as we have seen among the Natives; this proves to a\r\nDemonstration that they strike Turtle, I suppose at the Time they come\r\nashore to lay their Eggs, for they certainly have no boat fit to do this\r\nat Sea, or that will carry a Turtle, and this Harpoon must have been a\r\ngood while in, as the wound was quite heal'd up.\r\n\r\nMonday, 23rd. Fresh breezes in the South-East quarter, which so long as\r\nit continues will confine us in Port. Yesterday, A.M., I sent some people\r\nin the Country to gather greens, one of which stragled from the rest, and\r\nmet with 4 of the Natives by a fire, on which they were broiling a Fowl,\r\nand the hind leg of one of the Animals before spoke of. He had the\r\npresence of mind not to run from them (being unarm'd), least they should\r\npursue him, but went and set down by them; and after he had set a little\r\nwhile, and they had felt his hands and other parts of his body, they\r\nsuffer'd him to go away without offering the least insult, and perceiving\r\nthat he did not go right for the Ship they directed him which way to go.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 24th. Winds and weather continues. The Seamen employ'd making\r\nropes, Caulking the Ship, Fishing, etc.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 25th. Fresh gales at South-East and fair weather. In the\r\nevening the Yawl came in, having not been able to Strike one Turtle on\r\naccount of the blowing weather, nor can we catch much fish with the Sean\r\nin the Harbour.\r\n\r\nThursday, 26th. Winds and weather as Yesterday. Such people as can be\r\nspared from the necessary Dutys of the Ship are employ'd fishing and\r\ngathering greens and other refreshments.\r\n\r\nFriday, 27th. Very fresh Gales at South-East by South and fair weather.\r\nA.M., caught as much fish as served 3/4 pounds a man, and Mr. Gore shott\r\none of the Animals before spoke of, which weighed 80 pounds and 54\r\npounds, exclusive of the entrails, Skin, and head; this was as large as\r\nthe most we have seen.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 28th. Winds and weather as above, without the least Variation\r\nthe whole of the 24 hours. The Carpenters finish'd caulking the Ship.\r\n\r\nSunday, 29th. Winds at South-East, a fresh breeze until 5 a.m., at which\r\ntime it fell calm, and soon after had a light breeze from the land. Upon\r\nthis I sent a Boat to see what water was upon the bar (it being 2 hours\r\nEbb), and hove up the Anchor in order to put to Sea; but upon the return\r\nof the Boat came too again, as there were only 13 feet water on the Bar,\r\nwhich was 6 Inches less water than what the Ship Draw'd. After this I\r\nsent the Yawl to look for Turtle, as those we had got before were nearly\r\nall expended. About 8 the Sea breeze set in again, which put an end to\r\nour Sailing this day; after which I sent the Pinnace to haul the Sean;\r\nshe return'd with only 20 pounds of Fish.\r\n\r\nMonday, 30th. Winds at South-East, a fresh Gale and fair weather in the\r\nP.M., the remainder Hazey, with rain, but the winds, tho more moderate,\r\nkeept in the South-East quarter.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 31st. Fresh Gales at South-East, and hazey with rain all P.M.\r\nand most part of the Night. At 2 a.m. I had thoughts of trying to Warp\r\nthe Ship out of the Harbour, but upon my going first out in a Boat I\r\nfound it blow too fresh for such an Attempt.\r\n\r\n[August 1770.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 1st August. Strong Gales from the South-East, with Squalls\r\nattended with Rain. P.M., the Yawl came in with 2 Rays, which together\r\nweighed 265 pounds; it blow'd too hard all the time they were out for\r\nstriking Turtle. Carpenters employ'd overhauling the Pumps, all of which\r\nwe find in a state of decay; and this the Carpenter says is owing to the\r\nSap having been left in, which in time has decay'd the sound wood. One of\r\nthem is quite useless, and was so rotten when hoisted up as to drop to\r\npeices. However, I cannot complain of a Leaky Ship, for the most water\r\nShe makes is not quite an Inch an Hour.\r\n\r\nThursday, 2nd. Winds and weather as yesterday, or rather more Stormy; we\r\nhave now no Success in the Sein fishing, hardly getting above 20 or 30\r\npounds a day.\r\n\r\nFriday, 3rd. Strong breezes, and hazey until 6 a.m., when it moderated,\r\nand we unmoor'd, hove up the Anchor, and began to Warp out; but the Ship\r\ntailing upon the Sand on the North side of the River, the Tide of Ebb\r\nmaking out, and a fresh breeze setting in, we were obliged to desist and\r\nmoor the Ship again just within the Barr.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 4th. In the P.M., having pretty moderate weather, I order'd the\r\nCoasting Anchor and Cable to be laid without the barr, to be ready to\r\nwarp out by, that we might not loose the least opportunity that might\r\nOffer; for laying in Port spends time to no purpose, consumes our\r\nProvisions, of which we are very Short in many Articles, and we have yet\r\na long Passage to make to the East Indies through an unknown and perhaps\r\ndangerous Sea; these Circumstances consider'd, make me very Anxious of\r\ngetting to Sea. The wind continued moderate all night, and at 5 a.m. it\r\nfell calm; this gave us an opportunity to warp out. About 7 we got under\r\nsail, having a light Air from the Land, which soon died away, and was\r\nSucceeded by the Sea breezes from South-East by South, with which we\r\nstood off to Sea East by North, having the Pinnace ahead sounding. The\r\nYawl I sent to the Turtle bank to take up the Net that was left there;\r\nbut as the wind freshen'd we got out before her, and a little After Noon\r\nAnchor'd in 15 fathoms water, Sandy bottom, for I did not think it safe\r\nto run in among the Shoals until I had well view'd them at low Water from\r\nthe Mast head, that I might be better Able to Judge which way to Steer;\r\nfor as yet I had not resolved whether I should beat back to the Southward\r\nround all the Shoals, or seek a Passage to the Eastward or Northward, all\r\nof which appeared to be equally difficult and dangerous. When at Anchor\r\nthe Harbour sail'd from bore South 70 degrees West, distant 4 or 5\r\nLeagues; the Northermost point of the Main land we have in sight, which I\r\nnamed Cape Bedford* (* Probably after John, 4th Duke, who had been First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, 1744 to 1747.) (Latitude 15 degrees 17 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude 214 degrees 45 minutes West), bore North 20 degrees\r\nWest, distant 3 1/2 Leagues; but we could see land to the North-East of\r\nthis Cape, which made like 2 high Islands;* (* Direction Islands.) the\r\nTurtle banks bore East, distant one Mile. Latitude by Observation 15\r\ndegrees 23 minutes South; our depth of Water, in standing off from the\r\nland, was from 3 1/2 to 15 fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Description of Endeavour River.]\r\n\r\nI shall now give a Short description of the Harbour, or River, we have\r\nbeen in, which I named after the Ship, Endeavour River. It is only a\r\nsmall Barr Harbour or Creek, which runs winding 3 or 4 Leagues in land,\r\nat the Head of which is a small fresh Water Brook, as I was told, for I\r\nwas not so high myself; but there is not water for Shipping above a Mile\r\nwithin the barr, and this is on the North side, where the bank is so\r\nsteep for nearly a quarter of a Mile that ships may lay afloat at low\r\nwater so near the Shore as to reach it with a stage, and is extreamly\r\nConvenient for heaving a Ship down. And this is all the River hath to\r\nrecommend it, especially for large Shipping, for there is no more than 9\r\nor 10 feet Water upon the Bar at low water, and 17 or 18 feet at high,\r\nthe Tides rises and falling about 9 feet at spring Tide, and is high on\r\nthe days of the New and full Moon, between 9 and 10 o'Clock. Besides,\r\nthis part of the Coast is barrocaded with Shoals, as to make this Harbour\r\nmore difficult of access; the safest way I know of to come at it is from\r\nthe South, Keeping the Main land close on board all the way. Its\r\nsituation may always be found by the Latitude, which hath been before\r\nmentioned. Over the South point is some high Land, but the North point is\r\nformed by a low sandy beach, which extends about 3 Miles to the\r\nNorthward, then the land is again high.\r\n\r\nThe refreshments we got here were Chiefly Turtle, but as we had to go 5\r\nLeagues out to Sea for them, and had much blowing weather, we were not\r\nover Stocked with this Article; however, what with these and the fish we\r\ncaught with the Sean we had not much reason to Complain, considering the\r\nCountry we were in. Whatever refreshment we got that would bear a\r\nDivision I caused to be equally divided among the whole Company,\r\ngenerally by weight; the meanest person in the Ship had an equal share\r\nwith myself or any one on board, and this method every commander of a\r\nShip on such a Voyage as this ought ever to Observe. We found in several\r\nplaces on the Sandy beaches and Sand Hills near the Sea, Purslain and\r\nbeans, which grows on a Creeping kind of a Vine. The first we found very\r\ngood when boiled, and the latter not to be dispised, and were at first\r\nvery serviceable to the Sick; but the best greens we found here was the\r\nTarra, or Coco Tops, called in the West Indies Indian Kale,* (* Colocasia\r\nMacrorhiza.) which grows in most Boggy Places; these eat as well as, or\r\nbetter, than Spinnage. The roots, for want of being Transplanted and\r\nproperly Cultivated, were not good, yet we could have dispensed with them\r\ncould we have got them in any Tolerable plenty; but having a good way to\r\ngo for them, it took up too much time and too many hands to gather both\r\nroot and branch. The few Cabage Palms we found here were in General\r\nsmall, and yielded so little Cabage that they were not worth the Looking\r\nafter, and this was the Case with most of the fruit, etc., we found in\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nBesides the Animals which I have before mentioned, called by the Natives\r\nKangooroo, or Kanguru, here are Wolves,* (* Probably Dingos.) Possums, an\r\nAnimal like a ratt, and snakes, both of the Venemous and other sorts.\r\nTame Animals here are none except Dogs, and of these we never saw but\r\none, who frequently came about our Tents to pick up bones, etc. The\r\nKanguru are in the greatest number, for we seldom went into the Country\r\nwithout seeing some. The land Fowls we met here, which far from being\r\nnumerous, were Crows, Kites, Hawkes, Cockadores* (* Cockatoos.) of 2\r\nSorts, the one white, and the other brown, very beautiful Loryquets of 2\r\nor 3 Sorts, Pidgeons, Doves, and a few other sorts of small Birds. The\r\nSea or Water fowl are Herns, Whisling Ducks, which perch and, I believe,\r\nroost on Trees; Curlews, etc., and not many of these neither. Some of our\r\nGentlemen who were in the Country heard and saw Wild Geese in the Night.\r\n\r\nThe Country, as far as I could see, is diversified with Hills and plains,\r\nand these with woods and Lawns; the Soil of the Hills is hard, dry, and\r\nvery Stoney; yet it produceth a thin Coarse grass, and some wood. The\r\nSoil of the Plains and Valleys are sandy, and in some places Clay, and in\r\nmany Parts very Rocky and Stoney, as well as the Hills, but in general\r\nthe Land is pretty well Cloathed with long grass, wood, Shrubs, etc. The\r\nwhole Country abounds with an immense number of Ant Hills, some of which\r\nare 6 or 8 feet high, and more than twice that in Circuit. Here are but\r\nfew sorts of Trees besides the Gum tree, which is the most numerous, and\r\nis the same that we found on the Southern Part of the Coast, only here\r\nthey do not grow near so large. On each side of the River, all the way up\r\nit, are Mangroves, which Extend in some places a Mile from its banks; the\r\nCountry in general is not badly water'd, there being several fine\r\nRivulets at no very great distance from one another, but none near to the\r\nplace where we lay; at least not in the Dry season, which is at this\r\ntime. However we were very well supply'd with water by springs which were\r\nnot far off.* (* Cooktown, which now stands on the Endeavour River, is a\r\nthriving place, and the northernmost town on this coast. It has some 2000\r\ninhabitants, and is the port for a gold mining district. A deeper channel\r\nhas now been dredged over the bar that gave Cook so much trouble, but it\r\nis not a harbour that will admit large vessels.)\r\n\r\n[At Anchor, Off Turtle Reef, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 5th. In the P.M. had a Gentle breeze at South-East and Clear\r\nweather. As I did not intend to weigh until the morning I sent all the\r\nBoats to the Reef to get what Turtle and Shell fish they could. At low\r\nwater from the Mast head I took a view of the Shoals, and could see\r\nseveral laying a long way without this one, a part of several of them\r\nappearing above water; but as it appear'd pretty clear of Shoals to the\r\nNorth-East of the Turtle Reef, I came to a Resolution to stretch out that\r\nway close upon a wind, because if we found no Passage we could always\r\nreturn back the way we went. In the Evening the Boats return'd with one\r\nTurtle, a sting ray, and as many large Clams as came to 1 1/2 pounds a\r\nMan; in each of these Clams were about 20 pounds of Meat; added to this\r\nwe Caught in the night several Sharks. Early in the morning I sent the\r\nPinnace and Yawl again to the Reef, as I did not intend to weigh until\r\nhalf Ebb, at which time the Shoals began to appear. Before 8 it came on\r\nto blow, and I made the Signal for the Boats to come on Board, which they\r\ndid, and brought with them one Turtle. We afterwards began to heave, but\r\nthe wind Freshening obliged us to bear away* (* To veer cable, i.e., pay\r\nout more cable, in order to hold the ship with the freshening wind.)\r\nagain and lay fast.\r\n\r\nMonday, 6th. Winds at South-East. At 2 o'Clock p.m. it fell pretty\r\nModerate, and we got under sail, and stood out upon a wind North-East by\r\nEast, leaving the Turtle Reef to windward, having the Pinnace ahead\r\nsounding. We had not stood out long before we discovered shoals ahead and\r\non both bows. At half past 4 o'Clock, having run off 8 Miles, the Pinnace\r\nmade the Signal for Shoal water in a place where we little Expected it;\r\nupon this we Tack'd and Stood on and off while the Pinnace stretched\r\nfarther to the Eastward, but as night was approaching I thought it safest\r\nto Anchor, which we accordingly did in 20 fathoms water, a Muddy bottom.\r\nEndeavour River bore South 52 degrees West; Cape Bedford West by North\r\n1/2 North, distant 5 Leagues; the Northermost land in sight, which made\r\nlike an Island, North; and a Shoal, a small, sandy part of which appear'd\r\nabove water, North-East, distance 2 or 3 Miles. In standing off from this\r\nTurtle Reef to this place our soundings were from 14 to 20 fathoms, but\r\nwhere the Pinnace was, about a Mile farther to the East-North-East, were\r\nno more than 4 or 5 feet of water, rocky ground; and yet this did not\r\nappear to us in the Ship. In the morning we had a strong Gale from the\r\nSouth-East, that, instead of weighing as we intended, we were obliged to\r\nbear away more Cable, and to Strike Top Gallant yards.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 7th. Strong Gales at South-East, South-East by South, and\r\nSouth-South-East, with cloudy weather at Low water in the P.M. I and\r\nseveral of the Officers kept a look out at the Mast head to see for a\r\nPassage between the Shoals; but we could see nothing but breakers all the\r\nway from the South round by the East as far as North-West, extending out\r\nto Sea as far as we could see. It did not appear to be one continued\r\nShoal, but several laying detached from each other. On the Eastermost\r\nthat we could see the Sea broke very high, which made one judge it to be\r\nthe outermost; for on many of those within the Sea did not break high at\r\nall, and from about 1/2 flood to 1/2 Ebb they are not to be seen, which\r\nmakes the Sailing among them more dangerous, and requires great care and\r\nCircumspection, for, like all other Shoals, or Reefs of Coral Rocks, they\r\nare quite steep too. Altho' the most of these Shoals consist of Coral\r\nRocks, yet a part of some of them is sand. The Turtle Reef and some\r\nothers have a small Patch of Sand generally at the North end, that is\r\nonly cover'd at high water. These generally discover themselves before we\r\ncome near them. Altho' I speak of this as the Turtle Reef, yet it is not\r\nto be doubted but what there are Turtle upon the most of them as well as\r\nthis one. After having well viewed our situation from the Mast Head, I\r\nsaw that we were surrounded on every side with Dangers, in so much that I\r\nwas quite at a loss which way to steer when the weather will permit us to\r\nget under sail, for to beat back to the South-East the way we came, as\r\nthe Master would have had me done, would be an endless peice of work, as\r\nthe winds blow constantly from that Quarter, and very Strong, without\r\nhardly any intermission;* (* The south-east trade wind blows home on this\r\ncoast very strong from about June to October. Though the Barrier Reef\r\nprevents any great sea from getting up, the continuance of this wind is a\r\ngreat nuisance for a sailing ship from many points of view though from\r\nothers it is an advantage.) on the other hand, if we do not find a\r\npassage to the Northward we shall have to come back at last. At 11 the\r\nShip drove, and obliged us to bear away to a Cable and one third, which\r\nbrought us up again; but in the morning the Gale increasing, she drove\r\nagain. This made us let go the Small Bower Anchor, and bear away a whole\r\nCable on it and 2 on the other; and even after this she still kept\r\ndriving slowly, until we had got down Top gallant Masts, struck Yards and\r\nTop masts close down, and made all snug; then she rid fast, Cape Bedford\r\nbearing West-South-West, distant 3 1/2 Leagues. In this situation we had\r\nShoals to the Eastward of us extending from the South-East by South to\r\nthe North-North-West, distant from the nearest part of them about 2\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 8th. Strong gales at South-South-East all this day, in so much\r\nthat I durst not get up Yards and Topmasts.\r\n\r\nThursday, 9th. In the P.M., the weather being something moderate, we got\r\nup the Top masts, but keept the Lower yards down. At 6 in the morning we\r\nbegan to heave in the Cable, thinking to get under sail; but it blow'd so\r\nfresh, together with a head sea, that we could hardly heave the ship a\r\nhead, and at last was obliged to desist.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Flattery, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 10th. Fresh Gales at South-South-East and South-East by South.\r\nP.M., the wind fell so that we got up the small Bower Anchor, and hove\r\ninto a whole Cable on the Best Bower. At 3 in the morning we got up the\r\nLower Yards, and at 7 weighed and stood in for the Land (intending to\r\nseek for a passage along Shore to the northward), having a Boat ahead\r\nsounding; depth of water as we run in from 19 to 12 fathoms. After\r\nstanding in an hour we edged away for 3 Small Islands* (* Now called the\r\nThree Isles.) that lay North-North-East 1/2 East, 3 Leagues from Cape\r\nBedford. To these Islands the Master had been in the Pinnace when the\r\nShip was in Port. At 9 we were abreast of them, and between them and the\r\nMain, having another low Island between us and the latter, which lies\r\nWest-North-West, 4 Miles from the 3 Islands. In this Channell had 14\r\nfathoms water; the Northermost point of the Main we had in sight bore\r\nfrom us North-North-West 1/2 West, distant 2 Leagues. 4 or 5 Leagues to\r\nthe North-East of this head land appeared 3 high Islands,* (* The\r\nDirection Islands.) with some smaller ones near them, and the Shoals and\r\nReefs without, as we could see, extending to the Northward as far as\r\nthese Islands. We directed our Course between them and the above\r\nheadland, leaving a small Island* (* The Two Isles. Cook had now got\r\namong the numerous islands and reefs which lie round Cape Flattery. There\r\nare good channels between them, but they are very confusing to a\r\nstranger. Cook's anxiety in his situation can well be imagined,\r\nespecially with his recent disaster in his mind.) to the Eastward of us,\r\nwhich lies North by East, 4 Miles from the 3 Islands, having all the\r\nwhile a boat ahead sounding. At Noon we were got between the head Land\r\nand the 3 high Islands, distant from the former 2, and from the latter 4\r\nLeagues; our Latitude by observation was 14 degrees 51 minutes South. We\r\nnow judged ourselves to be clear of all Danger, having, as we thought, a\r\nClear, open Sea before us; but this we soon found otherwise, and\r\noccasioned my calling the Headland above mentioned Cape Flattery\r\n(Latitude 14 degrees 55 minutes South, Longitude 214 degrees 43 minutes\r\nWest). It is a high Promontory, making in 2 Hills next the sea, and a\r\nthird behind them, with low sandy land on each side; but it is better\r\nknown by the 3 high Islands out at Sea, the Northermost of which is the\r\nLargest, and lies from the Cape North-North-East, distant 5 Leagues. From\r\nthis Cape the Main land trends away North-West and North-West by West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 11th. Fresh breezes at South-South-East and South-East by\r\nSouth, with which we steer'd along shore North-West by West until one\r\no'Clock, when the Petty Officer at the Masthead called out that he saw\r\nland ahead, extending quite round to the Islands without, and a large\r\nreef between us and them; upon this I went to the Masthead myself. The\r\nreef I saw very plain, which was now so far to windward that we could not\r\nweather it, but what he took for Main land ahead were only small Islands,\r\nfor such they appeared to me; but, before I had well got from Mast head\r\nthe Master and some others went up, who all asserted that it was a\r\nContinuation of the Main land, and, to make it still more alarming, they\r\nsaid they saw breakers in a Manner all round us. We immediately hauld\r\nupon a wind in for the Land, and made the Signal for the Boat, which was\r\nahead sounding, to come on board; but as she was well to leeward, we were\r\nobliged to edge away to take her up, and soon after came to an Anchor\r\nunder a point of the Main in 1/4 less 5* (* The nautical manner of\r\nexpressing four and three-quarters.) fathoms, about a Mile from the\r\nShore, Cape Flattery bearing South-East, distant 3 1/2 Leagues. After\r\nthis I landed, and went upon the point, which is pretty high, from which\r\nI had a View of the Sea Coast, which trended away North-West by West, 8\r\nor 10 Leagues, which was as far as I could see, the weather not being\r\nvery clear. I likewise saw 9 or 10 Small, Low Islands and some Shoals\r\nlaying off the Coast, and some large Shoals between the Main and the 3\r\nhigh Islands, without which, I was now well assured, were Islands, and\r\nnot a part of the Mainland as some had taken them to be. Excepting Cape\r\nFlattery and the point I am now upon, which I have named point Lookout,\r\nthe Main land next the sea to the Northward of Cape Bedford is low, and\r\nChequer'd with white sand and green Bushes, etc., for 10 or 12 Miles\r\ninland, beyond which is high land. To the northward of Point Lookout the\r\nshore appear'd to be shoal and flat some distance off, which was no good\r\nsign of meeting with a Channell in with the land, as we have hitherto\r\ndone. We saw the footsteps of people upon the sand, and smoke and fire up\r\nin the Country, and in the evening return'd on board, where I came to a\r\nresolution to visit one of the high Islands in the Offing in my Boat, as\r\nthey lay at least 5 Leagues out at Sea, and seem'd to be of such a height\r\nthat from the Top of one of them I hoped to see and find a Passage out to\r\nsea clear of the Shoals. Accordingly in the Morning I set out in the\r\nPinnace for the Northermost and largest of the 3, accompanied by Mr.\r\nBanks. At the same time I sent the Master in the Yawl to Leeward, to\r\nsound between the Low Islands and the Main. In my way to the Island I\r\npassed over a large reef of Coral Rocks and sand, which lies about 2\r\nLeagues from the Island; I left another to leeward, which lays about 3\r\nMiles from the Island. [On Lizard Island, Queensland.] On the North part\r\nof this is a low, sandy Isle, with Trees upon it; on the reef we pass'd\r\nover in the Boat we saw several Turtle, and Chased one or Two, but caught\r\nnone, it blowing too hard, and I had no time to spare, being otherways\r\nemploy'd. I did not reach the Island until half an hour after one o'Clock\r\nin the P.M. on\r\n\r\nSunday, 12th, when I immediately went upon the highest hill on the\r\nIsland,* (* Lizard Island.) where, to my Mortification, I discover'd a\r\nReef of Rocks laying about 2 or 3 Leagues without the Island, extending\r\nin a line North-West and South-East, farther than I could see, on which\r\nthe sea broke very high.* (* This was the outer edge of the Barrier\r\nReefs.) This, however, gave one great hopes that they were the outermost\r\nshoals, as I did not doubt but what I should be able to get without them,\r\nfor there appeared to be several breaks or Partitions in the Reef, and\r\nDeep Water between it and the Islands. I stay'd upon the Hill until near\r\nsun set, but the weather continued so Hazey all the time that I could not\r\nsee above 4 or 5 Leagues round me, so that I came down much disappointed\r\nin the prospect I expected to have had, but being in hopes the morning\r\nmight prove Clearer, and give me a better View of the Shoals. With this\r\nview I stay'd all night upon the Island, and at 3 in the Morning sent the\r\nPinnace, with one of the Mates I had with me, to sound between the Island\r\nand the Reefs, and to Examine one of the breaks or Channels; and in the\r\nmean time I went again upon the Hill, where I arrived by Sun Rise, but\r\nfound it much Hazier than in the Evening. About Noon the pinnace\r\nreturn'd, having been out as far as the Reef, and found from 15 to 28\r\nfathoms water. It blow'd so hard that they durst not venture into one of\r\nthe Channels, which, the Mate said, seem'd to him to be very narrow; but\r\nthis did not discourage me, for I thought from the place he was at he\r\nmust have seen it at disadvantage. Before I quit this Island I shall\r\ndescribe it. It lies, as I have before observed, about 5 Leagues from the\r\nMain; it is about 8 Miles in Circuit, and of a height sufficient to be\r\nseen 10 or 12 Leagues; it is mostly high land, very rocky and barren,\r\nexcept on the North-West side, where there are some sandy bays and low\r\nland, which last is covered with thin, long grass, Trees, etc., the same\r\nas upon the Main. Here is also fresh Water in 2 places; the one is a\r\nrunning stream, the water a little brackish where I tasted it, which was\r\nclose to the sea; the other is a standing pool, close behind the sandy\r\nbeach, of good, sweet water, as I daresay the other is a little way from\r\nthe Sea beach. The only land Animals we saw here were Lizards, and these\r\nseem'd to be pretty Plenty, which occasioned my naming the Island Lizard\r\nIsland. The inhabitants of the Main visit this Island at some Seasons of\r\nthe Year, for we saw the Ruins of Several of their Hutts and heaps of\r\nShells, etc. South-East, 4 or 5 Miles from this Island, lay the other 2\r\nhigh Islands, which are very small compared to this; and near them lay 3\r\nothers, yet smaller and lower Islands, and several Shoals or reefs,\r\nespecially to the South-East. There is, however, a clear passage from\r\nCape Flattery to those Islands, and even quite out to the outer Reefs,\r\nleaving the above Islands to the South-East and Lizard Island to the\r\nNorth-West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 13th. At 2 P.M. I left Lizard Island in order to return to the\r\nShip, and in my way landed upon the low sandy Isle mentioned in coming\r\nout. We found on this Island* (* Eagle Island.) a pretty number of Birds,\r\nthe most of them sea Fowl, except Eagles; 2 of the Latter we shott and\r\nsome of the others; we likewise saw some Turtles, but got none, for the\r\nreasons before mentioned. After leaving Eagle Isle I stood South-West\r\ndirect for the Ship, sounding all the way, and had not less than 8\r\nfathoms, nor more than 14. I had the same depth of Water between Lizard\r\nand Eagle Isle. After I got on board the Master inform'd me he had been\r\ndown to the Islands I had directed him to go too, which he judged to lay\r\nabout 3 Leagues from the Main, and had sounded the Channel between the 2,\r\nfound 7 fathoms; this was near the Islands, for in with the Main he had\r\nonly 9 feet 3 Miles off, but without the Islands he found 10, 12, and 14\r\nfathoms. He found upon the islands piles of turtle shells, and some finns\r\nthat were so fresh that both he and the boats' crew eat of them. This\r\nshowed that the natives must have been there lately. After well\r\nconsidering both what I had seen myself and the report of the Master's, I\r\nfound by experience that by keeping in with the Mainland we should be in\r\ncontinued danger, besides the risk we should run in being lock'd in with\r\nShoals and reefs by not finding a passage out to Leeward. In case we\r\npersever'd in keeping the Shore on board an accident of this kind, or any\r\nother that might happen to the ship, would infallibly loose our passage\r\nto the East India's this Season,* (* In November the wind changes to the\r\nNorth-West, which would have been a foul wind to Batavia.) and might\r\nprove the ruin of both ourselves and the Voyage, as we have now little\r\nmore than 3 Months' Provisions on board, and that at short allowance.\r\nWherefore, after consulting with the Officers, I resolved to weigh in the\r\nmorning, and Endeavour to quit the Coast altogether until such time as I\r\nfound I could approach it with less danger. With this View we got under\r\nsail at daylight in the morning, and stood out North-East for the\r\nNorth-West end of Lizard Island, having Eagle Island to windward of us,\r\nhaving the pinnace ahead sounding; and here we found a good Channell,\r\nwherein we had from 9 to 14 fathoms. At Noon the North end of Lizard\r\nIsland bore East-South-East, distant one Mile; Latitude observed 14\r\ndegrees 38 minutes South; depth of water 14 fathoms. We now took the\r\npinnace in tow, knowing that there were no dangers until we got out to\r\nthe Reefs.* (* From the 13th to the 19th the language used in Mr.\r\nCorner's copy of the Journal is quite different from that of the\r\nAdmiralty and the Queen's, though the occurrences are the same. From\r\ninternal evidences, it appears that Mr. Corner's copy was at this period\r\nthe first written up, and that Cook amended the phrases in the other fair\r\ncopies.)\r\n\r\n[Pass Outside Barrier Reef, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 14th. Winds at South-East, a steady gale. By 2 P.M. we got out\r\nto the outermost reefs, and just fetched to Windward of one of the\r\nopenings I had discover'd from the Island; we tacked and Made a short\r\ntrip to the South-West, while the Master went in the pinnace to examine\r\nthe Channel, who soon made the signal for the Ship to follow, which we\r\naccordingly did, and in a short time got safe out. This Channel* (* Now\r\nknown as Cook's Passage.) lies North-East 1/2 North, 3 Leagues from\r\nLizard Island; it is about one-third of a Mile broad, and 25 or 30\r\nfathoms deep or more. The moment we were without the breakers we had no\r\nground with 100 fathoms of Line, and found a large Sea rowling in from\r\nthe South-East. By this I was well assured we were got with out all the\r\nShoals, which gave us no small joy, after having been intangled among\r\nIslands and Shoals, more or less, ever since the 26th of May, in which\r\ntime we have sail'd above 360 Leagues by the Lead without ever having a\r\nLeadsman out of the Chains, when the ship was under sail; a Circumstance\r\nthat perhaps never hapned to any ship before, and yet it was here\r\nabsolutely necessary. I should have been very happy to have had it in my\r\npower to have keept in with the land, in order to have explor'd the Coast\r\nto the Northern extremity of the Country, which I think we were not far\r\noff, for I firmly believe this land doth not join to New Guinea. But this\r\nI hope soon either to prove or disprove, and the reasons I have before\r\nassign'd will, I presume, be thought sufficient for my leaving the Coast\r\nat this time; not but what I intend to get in with it again as soon as I\r\ncan do it with safety. The passage or channel we now came out by, which I\r\nhave named, ----* (* Blank in MS.) lies in the Latitude of 14 degrees 32\r\nminutes South; it may always be found and known by the 3 high Islands\r\nwithin it, which I have called the Islands of Direction, because by their\r\nmeans a safe passage may be found even by strangers in within the Main\r\nreef, and quite into the Main. Lizard Island, which is the Northermost\r\nand Largest of the 3, Affords snug Anchorage under the North-West side of\r\nit, fresh water and wood for fuel; and the low Islands and Reefs which\r\nlay between it and the Main, abound with Turtle and other fish, which may\r\nbe caught at all Seasons of the Year (except in such blowing weather as\r\nwe have lately had). All these things considered there is, perhaps, not a\r\nbetter place on the whole Coast for a Ship to refresh at than this\r\nIsland. I had forgot to mention in its proper place, that not only on\r\nthis Island, but on Eagle Island, and on several places of the Sea beach\r\nin and about Endeavour River, we found Bamboos, Cocoa Nutts, the seeds of\r\nsome few other plants, and Pummice-stones, which were not the produce of\r\nthe Country. From what we have seen of it, it is reasonable to suppose\r\nthat they are the produce of some lands or Islands laying in the\r\nNeighbourhood, most likely to the Eastward, and are brought hither by the\r\nEasterly trade winds. The Islands discover'd by Quiros lies in this\r\nparrallel, but how far to the Eastward it's hard to say; for altho' we\r\nfound in most Charts his discoveries placed as far to the West as this\r\ncountry yet from the account of his Voyage, compared with what we\r\nourselves have seen, we are Morally certain that he never was upon any\r\npart of this Coast.* (* The Island of Espiritu Santo, in the New\r\nHebrides, which Quiros discovered, lies 1200 miles to the eastward, and\r\nNew Caledonia, from which these objects might equally have come, is 1000\r\nmiles in the same direction.) As soon as we had got without the Reefs we\r\nShortened sail, and hoisted in the pinnace and Long boat, which last we\r\nhad hung alongside, and then stretched off East-North-East, close upon a\r\nwind, as I did not care to stand to the Northward until we had a whole\r\nday before us, for which reason we keept making short boards all night.\r\nThe large hollow sea we have now got into acquaints us with a\r\nCircumstance we did not before know, which is that the Ship hath received\r\nmore Damage than we were aware of, or could perceive when in smooth\r\nWater; for now she makes as much water as one pump will free, kept\r\nconstantly at work. However this was looked upon as trifling to the\r\nDanger we had lately made an Escape from. At day light in the morning\r\nLizard Island bore South by West, distant 10 Leagues. We now made all the\r\nsail we could, and stood away North-North-West 1/2 West, but at 9 we\r\nsteer'd North-West 1/2 North, having the advantage of a Fresh Gale at\r\nSouth-East; at Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 13 degrees\r\n46 minutes South, the Lizard Island bore South 15 degrees East, distant\r\n58 Miles, but we had no land in sight.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 15th. Fresh Trade at South-East and Clear weather. At 6 in the\r\nevening shortned sail and brought too, with her head to the North-East.\r\nBy this time we had run near 12 Leagues upon a North-West 1/2 North\r\nCourse since Noon. At 4 a.m. wore and lay her head to the South-West, and\r\nat 6 made all Sail, and steer'd West, in order to make the land, being\r\nfearful of over shooting the passage, supposing there to be one, between\r\nthis land and New Guinea. By noon we had run 10 Leagues upon this Course,\r\nbut saw no land. Our Latitude by observation was 13 degrees 2 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude 216 degrees 00 minutes West, which was 1 degree 23\r\nminutes to the West of Lizard Island.\r\n\r\n[Ship in Danger, Outside Barrier Reef.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 16th. Moderate breezes at East-South-East and fair weather. A\r\nlittle after Noon saw the Land from the Mast head bearing\r\nWest-South-West, making high; at 2 saw more land to the North-West of the\r\nformer, making in hills like Islands; but we took it to be a Continuation\r\nof the Main land. An hour after this we saw a reef, between us and the\r\nland, extending away to the Southward, and, as we thought, terminated\r\nhere to the Northward abreast of us; but this was only on op'ning, for\r\nsoon after we saw it extend away to the Northward as far as we could\r\ndistinguish anything. Upon this we hauld close upon a Wind, which was now\r\nat East-South-East, with all the sail we could set. We had hardly trimm'd\r\nour sails before the wind came to East by North, which made our\r\nweathering the Reef very doubtful, the Northern point of which in sight\r\nat sun set still bore from us North by West, distant about 2 Leagues.\r\nHowever, this being the best Tack to Clear it, we keept standing to the\r\nNorthward, keeping a good look out until 12 at night, when, fearing to\r\nrun too far upon one Course, we tack'd and stood to the southward, having\r\nrun 6 Leagues North or North by East since sun set; we had not stood\r\nabove 2 Miles to the South-South-East before it fell quite Calm. We both\r\nsounded now and several times before, but had not bottom with 140 fathoms\r\nof line.* (* The description which follows, of the situation of the ship,\r\nand the occurrences until she was safely anchored inside the Barrier\r\nReef, is from the Admiralty copy, as it is much fuller than that in Mr.\r\nCorner's.) A little after 4 o'clock the roaring of the surf was plainly\r\nheard, and at daybreak the Vast foaming breakers were too plainly to be\r\nseen not a mile from us, towards which we found the ship was carried by\r\nthe Waves surprisingly fast. We had at this time not an air of Wind, and\r\nthe depth of water was unfathomable, so that there was not a possibility\r\nof anchoring. In this distressed Situation we had nothing but Providence\r\nand the small Assistance the Boats could give us to trust to; the Pinnace\r\nwas under repair, and could not immediately be hoisted out. The Yawl was\r\nput in the Water, and the Longboat hoisted out, and both sent ahead to\r\ntow, which, together with the help of our sweeps abaft, got the Ship's\r\nhead round to the Northward, which seemed to be the best way to keep her\r\noff the Reef, or at least to delay time. Before this was effected it was\r\n6 o'clock, and we were not above 80 or 100 yards from the breakers. The\r\nsame sea that washed the side of the ship rose in a breaker prodidgiously\r\nhigh the very next time it did rise, so that between us and destruction\r\nwas only a dismal Valley, the breadth of one wave, and even now no ground\r\ncould be felt with 120 fathom. The Pinnace was by this time patched up,\r\nand hoisted out and sent ahead to Tow. Still we had hardly any hopes of\r\nsaving the ship, and full as little our lives, as we were full 10 Leagues\r\nfrom the nearest Land, and the boats not sufficient to carry the whole of\r\nus; yet in this Truly Terrible Situation not one man ceased to do his\r\nutmost, and that with as much Calmness as if no danger had been near. All\r\nthe dangers we had escaped were little in comparison of being thrown upon\r\nthis reef, where the Ship must be dashed to pieces in a Moment. A reef\r\nsuch as one speaks of here is Scarcely known in Europe. It is a Wall of\r\nCoral Rock rising almost perpendicular out of the unfathomable Ocean,\r\nalways overflown at high Water generally 7 or 8 feet, and dry in places\r\nat Low Water. The Large Waves of the Vast Ocean meeting with so sudden a\r\nresistance makes a most Terrible Surf, breaking Mountains high,\r\nespecially as in our case, when the General Trade Wind blows directly\r\nupon it. At this Critical juncture, when all our endeavours seemed too\r\nlittle, a Small Air of Wind sprung up, but so small that at any other\r\nTime in a Calm we should not have observed it. With this, and the\r\nAssistance of our Boats, we could observe the Ship to move off from the\r\nReef in a slanting direction; but in less than 10 Minutes we had as flat\r\na Calm as ever, when our fears were again renewed, for as yet we were not\r\nabove 200 Yards from the Breakers. Soon after our friendly Breeze visited\r\nus again, and lasted about as long as before. A Small Opening was now\r\nSeen in the Reef about a 1/4 of a Mile from us, which I sent one of the\r\nMates to Examine. Its breadth was not more than the Length of the Ship,\r\nbut within was Smooth Water. Into this place it was resolved to Push her\r\nif Possible, having no other Probable Views to save her, for we were\r\nstill in the very Jaws of distruction, and it was a doubt wether or no we\r\ncould reach this Opening. However, we soon got off it, when to our\r\nSurprise we found the Tide of Ebb gushing out like a Mill Stream, so that\r\nit was impossible to get in. We however took all the Advantage Possible\r\nof it, and it Carried us out about a 1/4 of a Mile from the breakers; but\r\nit was too Narrow for us to keep in long. However, what with the help of\r\nthis Ebb, and our Boats, we by Noon had got an Offing of 1 1/2 or 2\r\nMiles, yet we could hardly flatter ourselves with hopes of getting Clear,\r\neven if a breeze should Spring up, as we were by this time embay'd by the\r\nReef, and the Ship, in Spite of our Endeavours, driving before the Sea\r\ninto the bight. The Ebb had been in our favour, and we had reason to\r\nSuppose the flood which was now made would be against us. The only hopes\r\nwe had was another Opening we saw about a Mile to the Westward of us,\r\nwhich I sent Lieutenant Hicks in the Small Boat to Examine. Latitude\r\nobserved 12 degrees 37 minutes South, the Main Land in Sight distant\r\nabout 10 Leagues.\r\n\r\n[Pass Again Inside Barrier Reef.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 17th. While Mr. Hicks was Examining the opening we struggled hard\r\nwith the flood, sometime gaining a little and at other times loosing. At\r\n2 o'Clock Mr. Hicks returned with a favourable Account of the Opening. It\r\nwas immediately resolved to Try to secure the Ship in it. Narrow and\r\ndangerous as it was, it seemed to be the only means we had of saving her,\r\nas well as ourselves. A light breeze soon after sprung up at\r\nEast-North-East, with which, the help of our Boats, and a Flood Tide, we\r\nsoon entered the Opening, and was hurried thro' in a short time by a\r\nRappid Tide like a Mill race, which kept us from driving against either\r\nside, though the Channel was not more than a 1/4 of a Mile broad, having\r\n2 Boats ahead of us sounding.* (* This picture of the narrow escape from\r\ntotal shipwreck is very graphic. Many a ship has been lost under similar\r\ncircumstances, without any idea of anchoring, which would often save a\r\nvessel, as it is not often that a reef is so absolutely steep; but that\r\nCook had this possibility in his mind is clear. As a proof of the\r\ncalmness which prevailed on board, it may be mentioned that when in the\r\nheight of the danger, Mr. Green, Mr. Clerke, and Mr. Forwood the gunner,\r\nwere engaged in taking a Lunar, to obtain the longitude. The note in Mr.\r\nGreen's log is: \"These observations were very good, the limbs of sun and\r\nmoon very distinct, and a good horizon. We were about 100 yards from the\r\nreef, where we expected the ship to strike every minute, it being calm,\r\nno soundings, and the swell heaving us right on.\") Our deepth of water\r\nwas from 30 to 7 fathoms; very irregular soundings and foul ground until\r\nwe had got quite within the Reef, where we Anchor'd in 19 fathoms, a\r\nCoral and Shelly bottom. The Channel we came in by, which I have named\r\nProvidential Channell, bore East-North-East, distant 10 or 12 Miles,\r\nbeing about 8 or 9 Leagues from the Main land, which extended from North\r\n66 degrees West to South-West by South.\r\n\r\nIt is but a few days ago that I rejoiced at having got without the Reef;\r\nbut that joy was nothing when Compared to what I now felt at being safe\r\nat an Anchor within it. Such are the Visissitudes attending this kind of\r\nService, and must always attend an unknown Navigation where one steers\r\nwholy in the dark without any manner of Guide whatever. Was it not from\r\nthe pleasure which Naturly results to a man from his being the first\r\ndiscoverer, even was it nothing more than Land or Shoals, this kind of\r\nService would be insupportable, especially in far distant parts like\r\nthis, Short of Provisions and almost every other necessary. People will\r\nhardly admit of an excuse for a Man leaving a Coast unexplored he has\r\nonce discovered. If dangers are his excuse, he is then charged with\r\nTimerousness and want of Perseverance, and at once pronounced to be the\r\nmost unfit man in the world to be employ'd as a discoverer; if, on the\r\nother hand, he boldly encounters all the dangers and Obstacles he meets\r\nwith, and is unfortunate enough not to succeed, he is then Charged with\r\nTemerity, and, perhaps, want of Conduct. The former of these Aspersions,\r\nI am confident, can never be laid to my Charge, and if I am fortunate to\r\nSurmount all the Dangers we meet with, the latter will never be brought\r\nin Question; altho' I must own that I have engaged more among the Islands\r\nand Shoals upon this Coast than perhaps in prudence I ought to have done\r\nwith a single Ship* (* Cook was so impressed with the danger of one ship\r\nalone being engaged in these explorations, that in his subsequent voyages\r\nhe asked for, and obtained, two vessels.) and every other thing\r\nconsidered. But if I had not I should not have been able to give any\r\nbetter account of the one half of it than if I had never seen it; at\r\nbest, I should not have been able to say wether it was Mainland or\r\nIslands; and as to its produce, that we should have been totally ignorant\r\nof as being inseparable with the other; and in this case it would have\r\nbeen far more satisfaction to me never to have discover'd it. But it is\r\ntime I should have done with this Subject, which at best is but\r\ndisagreeable, and which I was lead into on reflecting on our late\r\nDangers.\r\n\r\nIn the P.M., as the wind would not permit us to sail out by the same\r\nChannel as we came in, neither did I care to move until the pinnace was\r\nin better repair, I sent the Master with all the other Boats to the Reef\r\nto get such refreshments as he could find, and in the meantime the\r\nCarpenters were repairing the pinnace. Variations by the Amplitude and\r\nAzimuth in the morning 4 degrees 9 minutes Easterly; at noon Latitude\r\nobserved 12 degrees 38 minutes South, Longitude in 216 degrees 45 minutes\r\nWest. It being now about low water, I and some other of the officers went\r\nto the Masthead to see what we could discover. Great part of the reef\r\nwithout us was dry, and we could see an Opening in it about two Leagues\r\nfarther to the South-East than the one we came in by; we likewise saw 2\r\nlarge spots of sand to the Southward within the Reef, but could see\r\nnothing to the Northward between it and the Main. On the Mainland within\r\nus was a pretty high promontary, which I called Cape Weymouth (Latitude\r\n12 degrees 42 minutes South, Longitude 217 degrees 15 minutes); and on\r\nthe North-West side of this Cape is a Bay, which I called Weymouth Bay.*\r\n(* Viscount Weymouth was one of the Secretaries of State when the\r\nEndeavour sailed.)\r\n\r\nSaturday, 18th. Gentle breezes at East and East-South-East. At 4 P.M. the\r\nBoats return'd from the Reef with about 240 pounds of Shell-fish, being\r\nthe Meat of large Cockles, exclusive of the Shells. Some of these Cockles\r\nare as large as 2 Men can move, and contain about 20 pounds of Meat, very\r\ngood. At 6 in the morning we got under sail, and stood away to the\r\nNorth-West, as we could not expect a wind to get out to Sea by the same\r\nChannel as we came in without waiting perhaps a long time for it, nor was\r\nit advisable at this time to go without the Shoals, least we should by\r\nthem be carried so far off the Coast as not to be able to determine\r\nwether or no New Guinea joins to or makes a part of this land. This\r\ndoubtful point I had from my first coming upon the Coast, determined, if\r\nPossible, to clear up; I now came to a fix'd resolution to keep the Main\r\nland on board, let the Consequence be what it will, and in this all the\r\nOfficers concur'd. In standing to the North-West we met with very\r\nirregular soundings, from 10 to 27 fathoms, varying 5 or 6 fathoms almost\r\nevery Cast of the Lead. However, we keept on having a Boat ahead\r\nsounding. A little before noon we passed a low, small, sandy Isle, which\r\nwe left on our Starboard side at the distance of 2 Miles. At the same\r\ntime we saw others, being part of large Shoals above water, away to the\r\nNorth-East and between us and the Main land. At Noon we were by\r\nobservation in the Latitude of 12 degrees 28 minutes South, and 4 or 5\r\nLeagues from the Main, which extended from South by West to North 71\r\ndegrees West, and some Small Islands extending from North 40 degrees West\r\nto North 54 degrees West, the Main or outer Reef seen from the Masthead\r\naway to the North-East.\r\n\r\n[Amongst Shoals off Cape Grenville.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 19th. Gentle breezes at South-East by East and Clear wether. At 2\r\nP.M., as we were steering North-West by North, saw a large shoal right\r\nahead, extending 3 or 4 points on each bow, upon which we hauld up\r\nNorth-North-East and North-East by North, in order to get round to North\r\nPoint of it, which we reached by 4 o'clock, and then Edged away to the\r\nwestward, and run between the North end of this Shoal and another, which\r\nlays 2 miles to the Northward of it, having a Boat all the time ahead\r\nsounding. Our depth of Water was very irregular, from 22 to 8 fathoms. At\r\n1/2 past 6 we Anchor'd in 13 fathoms; the Northermost of the Small\r\nIslands mentioned at Noon bore West 1/2 South, distant 3 Miles. These\r\nIslands, which are known in the Chart by the name of Forbes's Isles,* (*\r\nAdmiral John Forbes was a Commissioner of Longitude in 1768, and had been\r\na Lord of the Admiralty from 1756 to 1763.) lay about 5 Leagues from the\r\nMain, which here forms a moderate high point, which we called Bolt head,\r\nfrom which the Land trends more westerly, and is all low, sandy Land, but\r\nto the Southward it is high and hilly, even near the Sea. At 6 A.M. we\r\ngot under sail, and directed our Course for an Island which lay but a\r\nlittle way from the Main, and bore from us at this time North 40 degrees\r\nWest, distant 5 Leagues; but we were soon interrupted in our Course by\r\nmeeting with Shoals, but by the help of 2 Boats ahead and a good lookout\r\nat the Mast head we got at last into a fair Channel, which lead us down\r\nto the Island, having a very large Shoal on our Starboard side and\r\nseveral smaller ones betwixt us and the Main land. In this Channel we had\r\nfrom 20 to 30 fathoms. Between 11 and 12 o'Clock we hauld round the\r\nNorth-East side of the Island, leaving it between us and the Main from\r\nwhich it is distant 7 or 8 Miles. This Island is about a League in\r\nCircuit and of a moderate height, and is inhabited; to the North-West of\r\nit are several small, low Islands and Keys, which lay not far from the\r\nMain, and to the Northward and Eastward lay several other Islands and\r\nShoals, so that we were now incompassed on every side by one or the\r\nother, but so much does a great danger Swallow up lesser ones, that these\r\nonce so much dreaded spots were now looked at with less concern. The\r\nBoats being out of their Stations, we brought too to wait for them. At\r\nNoon our Latitude by observation was 12 degrees 0 minutes South,\r\nLongitude in 217 degrees 25 minutes West; depth of Water 14 fathoms;\r\nCourse and distance sail'd, reduced to a strait line, since yesterday\r\nNoon is North 29 degrees West, 32 Miles. The Main land within the above\r\nIslands forms a point, which I call Cape Grenville* (* George Grenville\r\nwas First Lord of the Admiralty for a few months in 1763, and afterwards\r\nPrime Minister for two years.) (Latitude 11 degrees 58 minutes, Longitude\r\n217 degrees 38 minutes); between this Cape and the Bolt head is a Bay,\r\nwhich I Named Temple Bay.* (* Richard Earl Temple, brother of George\r\nGrenville, was First Lord of the Admiralty in 1756.) East 1/2 North, 9\r\nLeagues from Cape Grenville, lay some tolerable high Islands, which I\r\ncalled Sir Charles Hardy's Isles;* (* Admiral Sir C. Hardy was second in\r\ncommand in Hawke's great action in Quiberon Bay, 1759.) those which lay\r\noff the Cape I named Cockburn Isles.* (* Admiral George Cockburn was a\r\nCommissioner of Longitude and Comptroller of the Navy when Cook left\r\nEngland. Off Cape Grenville the Endeavour again got into what is now the\r\nrecognised channel along the land inside the reefs.)\r\n\r\n[Nearing Cape York, Queensland.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 20th. Fresh breezes at East-South-East. About one P.M. the\r\npinnace having got ahead, and the Yawl we took in Tow, we fill'd and\r\nSteer'd North by West, for some small Islands we had in that direction.\r\nAfter approaching them a little nearer we found them join'd or connected\r\ntogether by a large Reef; upon this we Edged away North-West, and left\r\nthem on our Starboard hand, steering between them and the Island laying\r\noff the Main, having a fair and Clear Passage; Depth of Water from 15 to\r\n23 fathoms. At 4 we discover'd some low Islands and Rocks bearing\r\nWest-North-West, which we stood directly for. At half Past 6 we Anchor'd\r\non the North-East side of the Northermost, in 16 fathoms, distant from\r\nthe Island one Mile. This Isle lay North-West 4 Leagues from Cape\r\nGrenville. On the Isles we saw a good many Birds, which occasioned my\r\ncalling them Bird Isles. Before and at Sunset we could see the Main land,\r\nwhich appear'd all very low and sandy, Extends as far to the Northward as\r\nNorth-West by North, and some Shoals, Keys, and low sandy Isles away to\r\nthe North-East of us. At 6 A.M. we got again under sail, with a fresh\r\nbreeze at East, and stood away North-North-West for some low Islands* (*\r\nBoydong Keys.) we saw in that direction; but we had not stood long upon\r\nthis Course before we were obliged to haul close upon a wind in Order to\r\nweather a Shoal which we discover'd on our Larboard bow, having at the\r\nsame time others to the Eastward of us. By such time as we had weathered\r\nthe Shoal to Leeward we had brought the Islands well upon our Leebow; but\r\nseeing some Shoals spit off from them, and some rocks on our Starboard\r\nbow, which we did not discover until we were very near them, made me\r\nafraid to go to windward of the Islands; wherefore we brought too, and\r\nmade the signal for the pinnace, which was a head, to come on board,\r\nwhich done, I sent her to Leeward of the Islands, with Orders to keep\r\nalong the Edge off the Shoal, which spitted off from the South side of\r\nthe Southermost Island. The Yawl I sent to run over the Shoals to look\r\nfor Turtle, and appointed them a Signal to make in case they saw many; if\r\nnot, she was to meet us on the other side of the Island. As soon as the\r\npinnace had got a proper distance from us we wore, and stood After her,\r\nand run to Leeward of the Islands, where we took the Yawl in Tow, she\r\nhaving seen only one small Turtle, and therefore made no Stay upon the\r\nShoal. Upon this Island, which is only a Small Spott of Land, with some\r\nTrees upon it, we saw many Hutts and habitations of the Natives, which we\r\nsupposed come over from the Main to these Islands (from which they are\r\ndistant about 5 Leagues) to Catch Turtle at the time these Animals come\r\nashore to lay their Eggs. Having got the Yawl in Tow, we stood away after\r\nthe pinnace North-North-East and North by East to 2 other low Islands,\r\nhaving 2 Shoals, which we could see without and one between us and the\r\nMain. At Noon we were about 4 Leagues from the Main land, which we could\r\nsee Extending to the Northward as far as North-West by North, all low,\r\nflat, and Sandy. Our Latitude by observation was 11 degrees 23 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude in 217 degrees 46 minutes West, and Course and distance\r\nsail'd since Yesterday at Noon North 22 degrees West, 40 Miles; soundings\r\nfrom 14 to 23 fathoms. But these are best seen upon the Chart, as\r\nlikewise the Islands, Shoals, etc., which are too Numerous to be\r\nMentioned singly.* (* It is very difficult to follow Cook's track after\r\nentering Providential Channel to this place. The shoals and islands were\r\nso confusing that their positions are very vaguely laid down on Cook's\r\nchart. It is easy to imagine how slow was his progress and tortuous his\r\ncourse, with a boat ahead all the time constantly signalling shallow\r\nwater. Nothing is more trying to officers and men.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 21st. Winds at East by South and East-South-East, fresh breeze.\r\nBy one o'Clock we had run nearly the length of the Southermost of the 2\r\nIslands before mentioned, and finding that we could not well go to\r\nwindward of them without carrying us too far from the Main land, we bore\r\nup, and run to Leeward, where we found a fair open passage. This done, we\r\nsteer'd North by West, in a parrallel direction with the Main land,\r\nleaving a small Island between us and it, and some low sandy Isles and\r\nShoals without us, all of which we lost sight of by 4 o'Clock; neither\r\ndid we see any more before the sun went down, at which time the farthest\r\npart of the Main in sight bore North-North-West 1/2 West. Soon after this\r\nwe Anchor'd in 13 fathoms, soft Ground, about five Leagues from the Land,\r\nwhere we lay until day light, when we got again under sail, having first\r\nsent the Yawl ahead to sound. We steer'd North-North-West by Compass from\r\nthe Northermost land in sight; Variation 3 degrees 6 minutes East. Seeing\r\nno danger in our way we took the Yawl in Tow, and made all the Sail we\r\ncould until 8 o'Clock, at which time we discover'd Shoals ahead and on\r\nour Larboard bow, and saw that the Northermost land, which we had taken\r\nto be a part of the Main, was an Island, or Islands,* (*Now called Mount\r\nAdolphus Islands.) between which and the Main their appeared to be a good\r\nPassage thro' which we might pass by running to Leeward of the Shoals on\r\nour Larboard bow, which was now pretty near us. Whereupon we wore and\r\nbrought too, and sent away the Pinnace and Yawl to direct us clear of the\r\nShoals, and then stood after them. Having got round the South-East point\r\nof the Shoal we steer'd North-West along the South-West, or inside of it,\r\nkeeping a good lookout at the Masthead, having another Shoal on our\r\nLarboard side; but we found a good Channel of a Mile broad between them,\r\nwherein were from 10 to 14 fathoms. At 11 o'Clock, being nearly the\r\nlength of the Islands above mentioned, and designing to pass between them\r\nand the Main, the Yawl, being thrown a stern by falling in upon a part of\r\nthe Shoal, She could not get over. We brought the Ship too, and Sent away\r\nthe Long boat (which we had a stern, and rigg'd) to keep in Shore upon\r\nour Larboard bow, and the Pinnace on our Starboard; for altho' there\r\nappear'd nothing in the Passage, yet I thought it necessary to take this\r\nmethod, because we had a strong flood, which carried us on end very fast,\r\nand it did not want much of high water. As soon as the Boats were ahead\r\nwe stood after them, and got through by noon, at which time we were by\r\nobservation in the Latitude of 10 degrees 36 minutes 30 seconds South.\r\nThe nearest part of the Main, and which we soon after found to be the\r\nNorthermost,* (* Cape York, the northernmost point of Australia.) bore\r\nWest southerly, distant 3 or 4 Miles; the Islands which form'd the\r\npassage before mentioned extending from North to North 75 degrees East,\r\ndistant 2 or 3 Miles. At the same time we saw Islands at a good distance\r\noff extending from North by West to West-North-West, and behind them\r\nanother chain of high land, which we likewise judged to be Islands.* (*\r\nThe islands around Thursday Island.) The Main land we thought extended as\r\nfar as North 71 degrees West; but this we found to be Islands. The point\r\nof the Main, which forms one side of the Passage before mentioned, and\r\nwhich is the Northern Promontory of this Country, I have named York Cape,\r\nin honour of his late Royal Highness, the Duke of York.* (* Edward\r\nAugustus, Duke of York and Albany, was a brother of George III.) It lies\r\nin the Longitude of 218 degrees 24 minutes West, the North point in the\r\nLatitude of 10 degrees 37 minutes South, and the East point in 10 degrees\r\n41 minutes. The land over and to the Southward of this last point is\r\nrather low and very flatt as far inland as the Eye could reach, and looks\r\nbarren. To the Southward of the Cape the Shore forms a large open bay,\r\nwhich I called Newcastle bay, wherein are some small, low Islands and\r\nshoals, and the land all about it is very low, flatt, and sandy. The land\r\non the Northern part of the Cape is rather more hilly, and the shore\r\nforms some small bays, wherein there appear'd to be good Anchorage, and\r\nthe Vallies appear'd to be tolerably well Cloathed with wood. Close to\r\nthe East point of the Cape are 3 small Islands, and a small Ledge of\r\nrocks spitting off from one of them. There is also an Island laying close\r\nto the North Point. The other Islands before spoke of lay about 4 Miles\r\nwithout these; only two of them are of any extent. The Southermost is the\r\nlargest, and much higher than any part of the Main land. On the\r\nNorth-West side of this Island seem'd to be good Anchorage, and Vallies\r\nthat to all appearance would afford both wood and fresh Water. These\r\nIsles are known in the Chart by the name of York Isles.* (* Now called\r\nMount Adolphus Islands.) To the Southward and South-East of them, and\r\neven to the Eastward and Northward, are several low Islands, rocks, and\r\nShoals. Our depth of Water in sailing between them and the Main was 12,\r\n13, and 14 fathoms.* (* In this channel is the dangerous rock on which\r\nthe steamship Quetta was wrecked, with such terrible loss of life, in\r\n1890. By the Endeavour's track she must have passed very near it.)\r\n\r\n[Land upon Possession Island.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 22nd. Gentle breezes at East by South and clear weather. We\r\nhad not steer'd above 3 or 4 Miles along shore to the westward before we\r\ndiscover'd the land ahead to be Islands detached by several Channels from\r\nthe main land; upon this we brought too to Wait for the Yawl, and called\r\nthe other Boats on board, and after giving them proper instructions, sent\r\nthem away again to lead us thro' the Channell next the Main, and as soon\r\nas the Yawl was on board made sail after them with the Ship. Soon after\r\nwe discover'd rocks and Shoals in this Channell, upon which I made the\r\nSignal for the boats to lead thro' the next Channel to the Northward* (*\r\nThis led to Endeavour Strait, but the recognised track is the channel\r\nfarther north.) laying between the Islands, which they accordingly did,\r\nwe following with the Ship, and had not less than 5 fathoms; and this in\r\nthe narrowest part of the Channel, which was about a Mile and a 1/2 broad\r\nfrom Island to Island. At 4 o'Clock we Anchor'd about a Mile and a 1/2 or\r\n2 Miles within the Entrance in 6 1/2 fathoms, clear ground, distance from\r\nthe Islands on each side of us one Mile, the Main land extending away to\r\nthe South-West; the farthest point of which we could see bore from us\r\nSouth 48 degrees West, and the Southermost point of the Islands, on the\r\nNorth-West side of the Passage, bore South 76 degrees West. Between these\r\n2 points we could see no land, so that we were in great hopes that we had\r\nat last found out a Passage into the Indian seas; but in order to be\r\nbetter informed I landed with a party of men, accompanied by Mr. Banks\r\nand Dr. Solander, upon the Islands which lies at the South-East point of\r\nthe Passage. Before and after we Anchor'd we saw a Number of People upon\r\nthis Island, Arm'd in the same manner as all the others we have seen,\r\nExcept one man, who had a bow and a bundle of Arrows, the first we have\r\nseen upon this Coast. From the appearance of the people we expected they\r\nwould have opposed our landing; but as we approached the shore they all\r\nmade off, and left us in peaceable possession of as much of the Island as\r\nserved our purpose. After landing I went upon the highest hill, which,\r\nhowever, was of no great height, yet no less than twice or thrice the\r\nheight of the Ship's Mastheads; but I could see from it no land between\r\nSouth-West and West-South-West, so that I did not doubt but there was a\r\npassage. I could see plainly that the lands laying to the North-West of\r\nthis passage were compos'd of a number of Islands of Various extent, both\r\nfor height and Circuit, ranged one behind another as far to the Northward\r\nand Westward as I could see, which could not be less than 12 or 14\r\nLeagues.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied myself of the great Probability of a passage, thro'\r\nwhich I intend going with the Ship, and therefore may land no more upon\r\nthis Eastern coast of New Holland, and on the Western side I can make no\r\nnew discovery, the honour of which belongs to the Dutch Navigators, but\r\nthe Eastern Coast from the Latitude of 38 degrees South down to this\r\nplace, I am confident, was never seen or Visited by any European before\r\nus; and notwithstanding I had in the Name of his Majesty taken possession\r\nof several places upon this Coast, I now once More hoisted English\r\nColours, and in the Name of His Majesty King George the Third took\r\npossession of the whole Eastern coast from the above Latitude down to\r\nthis place by the Name of New Wales,* (* The Admiralty copy, as well as\r\nthat belonging to Her Majesty, calls it New South Wales. The island where\r\nthe ceremony was performed was named on Cook's chart Possession Island,\r\nand is still so called.) together with all the Bays, Harbours, Rivers,\r\nand Islands, situated upon the said Coast; after which we fired 3 Volleys\r\nof small Arms, which were answer'd by the like number from the Ship.\r\n\r\nThis done, we set out for the Ship, but were some time in getting on\r\nboard on account of a very Rapid Ebb Tide, which set North-East out of\r\nthe Passage. Ever since we came in amongst the Shoals this last time we\r\nhave found a Moderate Tide; the flood setting to the North-West and Ebb\r\nto the South-East; at this place is high water at full and change of the\r\nmoon, about 1 or 2 o'Clock, and riseth and falleth upon a perpendicular\r\nabout 10 or 12 feet. We saw upon all the Adjacent Lands and Islands a\r\ngreat number of smokes--a certain sign that they are inhabited--and we\r\nhave daily seen smokes on every part of the Coast we have lately been\r\nupon. Between 7 and 8 o'Clock a.m. we saw several naked people, all or\r\nmost of them Women, down upon the beach picking up Shells, etc.; they had\r\nnot a single rag of any kind of Cloathing upon them, and both these and\r\nthose we saw yesterday were in every respect the same sort of People we\r\nhave seen everywhere upon the Coast. 2 or 3 of the Men we saw Yesterday\r\nhad on pretty large breast plates, which we supposed were made of pearl\r\nOyster Shells; this was a thing, as well as the Bow and Arrows, we had\r\nnot seen before. At low water, which hapned about 10 o'Clock, we got\r\nunder sail, and stood to the South-West, with a light breeze at East,\r\nwhich afterwards veer'd to North by East, having the Pinnace ahead; depth\r\nof Water from 6 to 10 fathoms, except in one place, were we passed over a\r\nBank of 5 fathoms. At Noon Possession Island, at the South-East entrance\r\nof the Passage, bore North 53 degrees East, distant 4 Leagues; the\r\nWestern extream of the Main land in sight South 43 degrees West, distant\r\n4 or 5 Leagues, being all exceeding low. The South-West point of the\r\nlargest Island* (* Prince of Wales Island.) on the North-West side of the\r\npassage bore North 71 degrees West, distant 8 Miles; this point I named\r\nCape Cornwall (Latitude 10 degrees 43 minutes South, Longitude 218\r\ndegrees 59 minutes West),* (* This longitude is 70 minutes too far west,\r\nand one of the worst given in the Journal. There were no observations,\r\nand the dead reckoning among the shoals was difficult to keep.) and some\r\nlow Islands lying about the Middle of the Passage, which I called\r\nWallace's Isles, bore West by South 1/2 South, distance about 2 Leagues.\r\nOur Latitude by Observation was 10 degrees 46 minutes South.\r\n\r\n[In Endeavour Strait, Torres Strait.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 23rd. In the P.M. had little wind and Variable, with which and\r\nthe Tide of Flood we keept advancing to the West-North-West; depth of\r\nWater 8, 7, and 5 fathoms. At 1/2 past 1 the pinnace, which was ahead,\r\nmade the Signal for Shoal Water, upon which we Tackt and sent away the\r\nYawl to sound also, and then Tack'd again, and stood after them with the\r\nShip; 2 hours after this they both at once made the Signal for having\r\nShoal water. I was afraid to stand on for fear of running aground at that\r\ntime of the Tide, and therefore came to an Anchor in 1/4 less 7 fathoms,\r\nsandy ground. Wallice's Islands bore South by West 1/2 West, distant 5 or\r\n6 Miles, the Islands to the Northward extending from North 73 degrees\r\nEast to North 10 degrees East, and a small island* (* Booby Island.) just\r\nin sight bearing North-West 1/2 West. Here we found the flood Tide set to\r\nthe Westward and Ebb to the Contrary. After we had come to Anchor I sent\r\naway the Master with the Long boat to sound, who, upon his return in the\r\nevening, reported that there was a bank stretching North and South, upon\r\nwhich were 3 fathoms Water, and behind it 7 fathoms. We had it Calm all\r\nNight and until 9 in the morning, at which time we weigh'd, with a light\r\nbreeze at South-South-East, and steer'd North-West by West for the Small\r\nIsland above mentioned, having first sent the Boats ahead to sound; depth\r\nof Water 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 fathoms when upon the Bank,* (* The\r\nEndeavour Strait is now little used, on account of this great bank, which\r\nnearly bars its western part. There is, however, deeper water than Cook\r\nfound, a few miles to the southward; but it is just the difficulty of\r\nfinding this narrow pass, so far from land, and the fact that there is a\r\ndeep though narrow channel north of Prince of Wales Island, that has\r\ncaused it to be abandoned. The passage of Torres Strait is, however,\r\nstill an anxious bit of navigation.) it being now the last Quarter Ebb.\r\nAt this time the most Northermost Islands we had in sight bore North 9\r\ndegrees East; the South-West point of the largest Islands on the\r\nNorth-West side of the Passage, which I named Cape Cornwall, bore East;\r\ndistant 3 Leagues. This bank, at least so much as we sounded, extends\r\nnearly North and South, how far I cannot say; its breadth, however, is\r\nnot more than 1/4 or at most 1/2 a Mile. Being over the Bank, we deepned\r\nour water to a 1/4 less 7 fathoms, which depth we carried all the way to\r\nthe small Island ahead, which we reached by Noon, at which time it bore\r\nSouth, distant near 1/2 a Mile; depth of Water 5 fathoms. The most\r\nnorthermost land we had in sight (being part of the same Chain of Islands\r\nwe have had to the Northward of us since we entered the Passage) bore\r\nNorth 71 degrees East; Latitude in, by Observation, 10 degrees 33 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude 219 degrees 22 minutes West. In this situation we had no\r\npart of the Main land in sight. Being now near the island, and having but\r\nlittle wind, Mr. Banks and I landed upon it, and found it to be mostly a\r\nbarren rock frequented by Birds, such as Boobies, a few of which we\r\nshott, and occasioned my giving it the name of Booby Island.* (* Booby\r\nIsland is now the great landmark for ships making Torres Strait from the\r\nwestward. There is a light upon it.) I made but very short stay at this\r\nIsland before I return'd to the Ship; in the meantime the wind had got to\r\nthe South-West, and although it blow'd but very faint, yet it was\r\naccompanied with a Swell from the same quarter. This, together with other\r\nconcuring Circumstances, left me no room to doubt but we had got to the\r\nWestward of Carpentaria, or the Northern extremity of New Holland, and\r\nhad now an open Sea to the Westward; which gave me no small satisfaction,\r\nnot only because the danger and fatigues of the Voyage was drawing near\r\nto an end, but by being able to prove that New Holland and New Guinea are\r\n2 separate Lands or Islands, which until this day hath been a doubtful\r\npoint with Geographers.* (* Luis Vaez de Torres, commanding a Spanish\r\nship in company with Quiros in 1605, separated from his companion in the\r\nNew Hebrides. He afterwards passed through the Strait separating New\r\nGuinea from Australia, which now bears his name. This fact, however, was\r\nlittle known, as the Spaniards suppressed all account of the voyage; and\r\nthough it leaked out later, the report was so vague that it was very much\r\ndoubted whether he had really passed this way. On most charts and maps of\r\nthe period, New Guinea was shown joined to Australia, and to Cook the\r\nestablishment of the Strait may fairly be given. Only the year before\r\nBougainville, the French navigator, who preceded Cook across the Pacific,\r\nand who was steering across the Coral Sea on a course which would have\r\nled him to Lizard Island, abandoned his search in that direction, after\r\nfalling in with two reefs to the eastward of the Barrier, because he\r\nfeared falling amongst other shoals, and had no faith whatever in the\r\nreports of the existence of Torres Strait. Had he persevered, he would\r\nhave snatched from Cook the honour of the complete exploration of Eastern\r\nAustralia, and of the verification of the passage between it and New\r\nGuinea. Bougainville paid dearly for his caution, as he found that\r\nretracing his steps against the trade wind, in order to pass eastward and\r\nnorthward of New Guinea, occupied such a weary time, that he and his\r\npeople were nearly starved before they reached a place of refreshment.)\r\n\r\n[Description of Endeavour Strait.]\r\n\r\nThe North-East entrance of this passage or Strait lies in the Latitude of\r\n10 degrees 27 minutes South, and in the Longitude of 218 degrees 36\r\nminutes West from the Meridian of Greenwich.* (* As before mentioned,\r\nthis longitude is over a degree in error. The sun was not available for\r\nlunars until the 24th August, and the first was observed on the 25th,\r\nwhen the ship was at Booby Island; but the result is not recorded in Mr.\r\nGreen's log. Mr. Green was at this time ill. The latitude is a clerical\r\nerror for 10.37, which Cook's chart shows, and is nearly correct.) It is\r\nform'd by the Main, or the northern extremity of New Holland, on the\r\nSouth-East, and by a Congeries of Islands to North-West, which I named\r\nPrince of Wales's Islands. It is very Probable that the Islands extend\r\nquite to New Guinea;* (* This conjecture was very near the truth. The\r\nwhole of Torres Strait is obstructed by either islands or reefs that\r\nleave very little passage.) they are of Various Extent both for height\r\nand Circuit, and many of them seem'd to be indifferently well Cloath'd\r\nwith wood, etc., and, from the smokes we saw, some, if not all of them,\r\nmust be inhabited. It is also very probable that among these Islands are\r\nas good, if not better, passages than the one we have come thro', altho'\r\none need hardly wish for a better, was the access to it from the Eastward\r\nless dangerous; but this difficulty will remain until some better way is\r\nfound out than the one we came, which no doubt may be done was it ever to\r\nbecome an object to be looked for.* (* It is the western and not the\r\neastern approach of Endeavour Strait that forms the difficulty, now the\r\nlocality has been charted, for vessels of deeper draught than the\r\nEndeavour; though for small craft, as Cook says, you can hardly wish for\r\na better.) The northern Extent of the Main or outer reef, which limit or\r\nbounds the Shoals to the Eastward, seems to be the only thing wanting to\r\nClear up this point; and this was a thing I had neither time nor\r\ninclination to go about, having been already sufficiently harrass'd with\r\ndangers without going to look for more.* (* The east coast of Australia,\r\nwhich Cook had now followed from end to end, is 2000 miles in extent. He\r\ntook four months over it, much less time than he had given to New\r\nZealand; but this is easily accounted for. His people were getting worn\r\nout, and he was haunted by fears of not getting off the coast before the\r\nNorth-West monsoon set in, which would have been a foul wind for him in\r\ngetting from Torres Straits to Batavia, and his provisions were running\r\nshort. Besides this, there was the grave doubt whether Australia and New\r\nGuinea were really separated. If this turned out to be false, there was a\r\nlong round to make, back to the eastern extremity of the latter, and the\r\nvoyage to Batavia would have been infinitely extended. Considering these\r\ncircumstances, Cook's exploration of the coast was wonderful, and the\r\ncharts attached to this book attest the skill and unwearied pains taken\r\nin mapping it from such a cursory glance. He only stopped at four places:\r\nBotany Bay, Bustard Bay, Thirsty Sound, and the Endeavour River; and from\r\nthe neighbourhood of these, with the view obtained as he coasted along,\r\nhe had to form his opinion of the country--an opinion, as we shall see,\r\nsingularly correct.)\r\n\r\nThis passage, which I have named Endeavour Straits, after the Name of the\r\nShip, is in length North-East and South-West 10 Leagues, and about 5\r\nleagues broad, except at the North-East entrance, where it is only 2\r\nMiles broad by reason of several small Islands which lay there, one of\r\nwhich, called Possession Island, is of a Moderate height and Circuit;\r\nthis we left between us and the Main, passing between it and 2 Small\r\nround Islands, which lay North-West 2 Miles from it. There are also 2\r\nSmall low Islands, called Wallice's Isles,* (* These are probably called\r\nafter Captain Wallis, who made a voyage across the Pacific in the Dolphin\r\nin 1767, and discovered Tahiti.) laying in the Middle of the South-West\r\nentrance, which we left to the southward; the depth of Water we found in\r\nthe Straits was from 4 to 9 fathoms. Every where good Anchorage, only\r\nabout 2 Leagues to the Northward of Wallice's Islands is a Bank, whereon\r\nis not more than 3 fathoms at low Water, but probable there might be\r\nfound more was it sought for. I have not been particular in describing\r\nthis Strait, no more than I have been in pointing out the respective\r\nSituations of the Islands, Shoals, etc., on the Coast of New Wales; for\r\nthese I refer to the Chart, where they are deliniated with all the\r\naccuracy that Circumstances would admit of.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Shoals that lay upon this Coast I must observe, for\r\nthe benefit of those who may come after me, that I do not believe the one\r\n1/2 of them are laid down in my Chart; for it would be Absurd to suppose\r\nthat we Could see or find them all. And the same thing may in some\r\nMeasure be said of the Islands, especially between the Latitude of 20 and\r\n22 degrees, where we saw Islands out at Sea as far as we could\r\ndistinguish any thing. However, take the Chart in general, and I believe\r\nit will be found to contain as few Errors as most Sea Charts which have\r\nnot undergone a thorough correction.* (* Cook's pride in his chart is\r\nwell justified, as its general accuracy is marvellous, when one considers\r\nthat he simply sailed along the coast. The great feature of this shore,\r\nhowever--the Barrier Reef--only appears on it at its northern end, where\r\nits approach to the land caused Cook to make such unpleasant acquaintance\r\nwith it. See charts.) The Latitude and Longitude of all, or most of, the\r\nprincipal head lands, Bays, etc., may be relied on, for we seldom fail'd\r\nof getting an Observation every day to correct our Latitude by, and the\r\nObservation for settling the Longitude were no less Numerous, and made as\r\noften as the Sun and Moon came in play; so that it was impossible for any\r\nMaterial error to creep into our reckoning in the intermediate times. In\r\njustice to Mr. Green,* (* From this phrase, and from various remarks in\r\nMr. Green's own log, it would appear that Mr. Green was not very easy to\r\nget on with; but there is no doubt of his unwearied zeal in astronomical\r\nobservations.) I must say that he was indefatigable in making and\r\ncalculating these observations, which otherwise must have taken up a\r\ngreat deal of my time, which I could not at all times very well spare;\r\nnot only this, but by his instructions several of the petty Officers can\r\nmake and calculate these observations almost as well as himself. It is\r\nonly by such Means that this method of finding the Longitude at Sea can\r\nbe put into universal practice; a Method that we have generally found may\r\nbe depended upon within 1/2 a degree, which is a degree of Accuracy more\r\nthan sufficient for all Nautical purposes. Would Sea Officers once apply\r\nthemselves to the making and calculating these Observations they would\r\nnot find them so very difficult as they at first imagine, especially with\r\nthe Assistance of the Nautical Almanack and Astronomical Ephemeris, by\r\nthe help of which the Calculation for finding the Longitude takes up but\r\nlittle more time than that of an Azimuth for finding the Variation of the\r\nCompass; but unless this Ephemeris is Published for some time to come,\r\nmore than either one or 2 Years, it can never be of general use in long\r\nVoyages, and in short Voyages it's not so much wanted.* (* The \"Nautical\r\nAlmanac\" was first published for 1767. That for 1770 was not published\r\nuntil 1769; but it seems probable that Cook either had proof sheets, or\r\nthe manuscript calculations.) Without it the Calculations are Laborious\r\nand discouraging to beginners, and such as are not well vers'd in these\r\nkind of Calculations.\r\n\r\n[Account of New South Wales Coast.]\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT OF NEW WALES.* (* Called in Admiralty and the Queen's Copy\r\nNew South Wales. It would appear that for this part of the voyage Mr.\r\nCorner's copy was the first written, and that Cook's first idea was to\r\nchristen the country New Wales.)\r\n\r\nIn the Course of this Journal I have at different times made mention of\r\nthe Appearance or Aspect of the face of the Country, the Nature of the\r\nSoil, its produce, etc. By the first it will appear that to the Southward\r\nof 33 or 34 degrees the land in general is low and level, with very few\r\nHills or Mountains; further to the Northward it may in some places be\r\ncalled a Hilly, but hardly anywhere can be called a Mountainous, Country,\r\nfor the Hills and Mountains put together take up but a small part of the\r\nSurface in Comparison to what the Planes and Valleys do which intersect\r\nor divide these Hills and Mountains. It is indifferently well water'd,\r\neven in the dry Seasons, with small brooks and Springs, but no great\r\nRivers, unless it be in the Wet Season, when the low lands and Vallies\r\nnear the Sea, I do suppose, are mostly laid under Water. The Small Brooks\r\nmay then become large Rivers; but this can only happen with the Tropick.\r\nIt was only in Thirsty Sound that we could find no fresh Water, and that\r\nno doubt was owing to the Country being there very much intersected with\r\nSalt Creeks and Mangrove land.\r\n\r\nThe low land by the Sea, and even as far in land as we were, is for the\r\nmost part friable, loose, sandy Soil yet indifferently fertile, and\r\nCloathed with woods, long grass, shrubs, plants, etc. The Mountains or\r\nHills are checquer'd with woods and Lawns; some of the Hills are wholy\r\ncover'd with Flourishing Trees; others but thinly, and the few that are\r\nupon them are small, and the spot of Lawns or Savannahs are rocky and\r\nbarren, especially to the Northward, where the Country did not afford or\r\nproduce near the Vegetation that it does to the Southward, nor were the\r\nTrees in the Woods half so tall and stout. The Woods do not produce any\r\ngreat variety of Trees; there are only 2 or 3 sorts that can be called\r\nTimber. The largest is the gum Tree, which grows all over the country;\r\nthe wood of this Tree is too hard and ponderous for most common uses. The\r\nTree which resembles our Pines I saw nowhere in perfection but in Botany\r\nBay; this wood, as I have before observed, is something of the same\r\nNature as American Live Oak; in short, most of the large Trees in this\r\nCountry are of a hard and ponderous nature, and could not be applied to\r\nmany purposes. Here are several sorts of the Palm kind, Mangrove, and\r\nseveral other sorts of small Trees and Shrubs quite unknown to me,\r\nbesides a very great number of Plants hitherto unknown; but these things\r\nare wholy out of my way to describe, nor will this be of any loss, since\r\nnot only plants, but every thing that can be of use to the Learned World\r\nwill be very accurately described by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. The Land\r\nnaturally produces hardly anything fit for Man to eat, and the Natives\r\nknow nothing of Cultivation. There are, indeed, growing wild in the wood\r\na few sorts of Fruit (the most of them unknown to us), which when ripe do\r\nnot eat amiss, one sort especially, which we called Apples, being about\r\nthe size of a Crab Apple it is black and pulpey when ripe, and tastes\r\nlike a Damson; it hath a large hard stone or Kernel, and grows on Trees\r\nor Shrubs.* (* The Black Apple, or Sapota Australis.)\r\n\r\nIn the Northern parts of the Country, as about Endeavour River, and\r\nprobably in many other places, the Boggy or watery Lands produce Taara or\r\nCocos,* (* A species of Taro, Colocasia macrorhiza.) which, when properly\r\ncultivated, are very good roots, without which they are hardly eatable;\r\nthe Tops, however, make very good greens.\r\n\r\nLand Animals are scarce, so far as we know confin'd to a very few\r\nspecies; all that we saw I have before mentioned. The sort which is in\r\nthe greatest Plenty is the Kangooroo or Kanguru, so called by the\r\nNatives; we saw a good many of them about Endeavour River, but kill'd\r\nonly 3, which we found very good Eating. Here are likewise Lizards,\r\nSnakes, Scorpions, Centapees, etc., but not in any plenty. Tame Animals\r\nthey have none but Dogs, and of these we saw but one, and therefore must\r\nbe very scarce, probably they eat them faster than they breed them; we\r\nshould not have seen this one had he not made us frequent Visits while we\r\nlay in Endeavour River.\r\n\r\nThe land Fowls are Bustards, Eagles, Hawks, Crows, such as we have in\r\nEngland, Cockatoes of 2 sorts, White and Brown, very beautiful Birds of\r\nthe Parrot kind, such as Lorryquets, etc., Pidgeons, Doves, Quails, and\r\nseveral sorts of smaller birds. The Sea and Water Fowls are Herons,\r\nBoobies, Noddies, Guls, Curlews, Ducks, Pelicans, etc., and when Mr.\r\nBanks and Mr. Gore where in the Country, at the head of Endeavour River,\r\nthey saw and heard in the Night great numbers of Geese. The Sea is\r\nindifferently well stocked with fish of Various sorts, such as Sharks,\r\nDog-fish, Rockfish, Mullets, Breams, Cavallies, Mack'rel, old wives,\r\nLeather Jackets, Five Fingers,* (* Old wives are Enoploxus Armatus;\r\nLeather jackets, Monacanthus; Five fingers, Chilodactylus.) Sting rays,\r\nWhip rays, etc., all excellent in their kind. The Shell fish are Oysters\r\nof 3 or 4 sorts, viz., Rock Oysters and Mangrove Oysters, which are\r\nsmall, Pearl Oysters and Mud Oysters; these last are the best and Largest\r\nI ever saw. Cockles and Clams of several sorts, many of those that are\r\nfound upon the Reefs are of a prodigious size, Craw fish, Crabs, Muscles,\r\nand a variety of other sorts. Here are also upon the Shoals and Reefs\r\ngreat Numbers of the finest Green Turtle in the world, and in the River\r\nand Salt Creeks are some Aligators.\r\n\r\n[Australian Natives.]\r\n\r\nThe Natives of this Country are of a middle Stature, streight Bodied and\r\nSlender limb'd; their Skins the Colour of Wood soot, their Hair mostly\r\nblack, some Lank and others curled; they all wear it Cropt Short; their\r\nBeards, which are generally black, they likewise crop short, or Singe\r\noff. There features are far from being disagreeable, and their Voices are\r\nsoft and Tunable. They go quite Naked, both Men and Women, without any\r\nmanner of Cloathing whatever; even the Women do not so much as cover\r\ntheir privities, altho' None of us was ever very near any of their Women,\r\none Gentleman excepted, yet we are all of us as well satisfied of this as\r\nif we had lived among them. Notwithstanding we had several interviews\r\nwith the Men while we lay in Endeavour River, yet, wether through\r\nJealousy or disregard, they never brought any of their women along with\r\nthem to the Ship, but always left them on the Opposite side of the River,\r\nwhere we had frequent Opportunities viewing them thro' our Glasses. They\r\nwear as Ornaments, Necklaces made of Shells, Bracelets, or Hoops, about\r\ntheir Arms, made mostly of Hair Twisted and made like a Cord Hoop; these\r\nthey wear tight about the upper parts of their Arms, and some have\r\nGirdles made in the same manner. The Men wear a bone, about 3 or 4 Inches\r\nlong and a finger's thick, run thro' the Bridge* (* The cartilage of the\r\nnostril. Banks mentions that the bluejackets called this queer ornament\r\nthe \"spritsail yard.\") of their Nose; they likewise have holes in their\r\nEars for Ear Rings, but we never saw them wear any; neither are all the\r\nother Ornaments wore in Common, for we have seen as many without as with\r\nthem. Some of these we saw on Possession Island wore breast plates, which\r\nwe supposed were made of Mother of Pearl Shells. Many of them paint their\r\nBodies and faces with a Sort of White paste or Pigment; this they apply\r\ndifferent ways, each according to his fancy.\r\n\r\nTheir offensive weapons are Darts; some are only pointed at one end,\r\nothers are barb'd, some with wood, others with Stings of rays, and some\r\nwith Sharks' Teeth, etc.; these last are stuck fast on with Gum. They\r\nthrow the Darts with only one hand, in the doing of which they make use\r\nof a piece of wood about 3 feet long, made thin like the blade of a\r\nCutlass, with a little hook at one End to take hold of the End of the\r\ndart, and at the other end is fix'd a thin piece of bone about 3 or 4\r\nInches long; the use of this is, I believe, to keep the dart steady, and\r\nto make it quit the hand in a proper direction. By the helps of these\r\nthrowing sticks, as we call them, they will hit a mark at the Distance of\r\n40 or 50 yards, with almost, if not as much, Certainty as we can do with\r\na Musquet, and much more so than with a ball.* (* The invention of these\r\nthrowing sticks, and of the Boomerang, is sufficient to prove the\r\nintelligence of the Australian aborigines.) These throwing sticks we at\r\nfirst took for wooden swords, and perhaps on some occasions they may use\r\nthem as such; that is, when all their darts are expended. Be this as it\r\nmay, they never Travel without both them and their Darts, not for fear of\r\nEnemies, but for killing of Game, etc., as I shall show hereafter. There\r\ndefensive weapons are Targets, made of wood; but these we never saw used\r\nbut once in Botany Bay.\r\n\r\nI do not look upon them to be a warlike people; on the contrary, I think\r\nthem a Timerous and inoffensive race, no ways inclined to Cruelty, as\r\nappear'd from their behaviour to one of our people in Endeavour River,\r\nwhich I have before mentioned, neither are they very numerous. They live\r\nin small parties along by the Sea Coast, the banks of Lakes, Rivers,\r\nCreeks, etc. They seem to have no fixed habitation, but move about from\r\nplace to place like wild beasts in search of Food, and, I believe, depend\r\nwholy upon the Success of the present day for their Subsistance. They\r\nhave wooden fish Gigs, with 2, 3, or 4 prongs, each very ingeniously\r\nmade, with which they strike fish. We have also seen them strike both\r\nfish and birds with their Darts. With these they likewise kill other\r\nAnimals; they have also wooden Harpoons for striking Turtle, but of these\r\nI believe they get but few, except at the seasons they come ashore to\r\nlay. In short, these people live wholy by fishing and hunting, but mostly\r\nby the former, for we never saw one Inch of Cultivated land in the whole\r\nCountry. They know, however, the use of Taara, and sometimes eat them; we\r\ndo not know that they Eat anything raw, but roast or broil all they eat\r\non slow small fires. Their Houses are mean, small Hovels, not much bigger\r\nthan an Oven, made of Peices of Sticks, Bark, Grass, etc., and even these\r\nare seldom used but in the Wet seasons, for in the daytimes we know they\r\nas often sleep in the Open Air as anywhere else. We have seen many of\r\ntheir Sleeping places, where there has been only some branches or peices\r\nof Bark, grass, etc., about a foot high on the Windward side.\r\n\r\n[Australian Canoes.]\r\n\r\nTheir Canoes are as mean as can be conceived, especially to the\r\nSouthward, where all we saw were made of one peice of the Bark of Trees\r\nabout 12 or 14 feet long, drawn or Tied together at one end. As I have\r\nbefore made mention, these Canoes will not Carry above 2 people, in\r\ngeneral there is never more than one in them; but, bad as they are, they\r\ndo very well for the purpose they apply them to, better than if they were\r\nlarger, for as they draw but little water they go in them upon the Mud\r\nbanks, and pick up Shell fish, etc., without going out of the Canoe. The\r\nfew Canoes we saw to the Northward were made out of a Log of wood\r\nhollow'd out, about 14 feet long and very narrow, with outriggers; these\r\nwill carry 4 people. During our whole stay in Endeavour River we saw but\r\none Canoe, and had great reason to think that the few people that resided\r\nabout that place had no more; this one served them to cross the River and\r\nto go a Fishing in, etc. They attend the Shoals, and flatts, one where or\r\nanother, every day at low water to gather Shell fish, or whatever they\r\ncan find to eat, and have each a little bag to put what they get in; this\r\nbag is made of net work. They have not the least knowledge of Iron or any\r\nother Metal that we know of; their working Tools must be made of Stone,\r\nbone, and Shells; those made of the former are very bad, if I may judge\r\nfrom one of their Adzes I have seen.\r\n\r\nBad and mean as their Canoes are, they at Certain seasons of the Year (so\r\nfar as we know) go in them to the most distant Islands which lay upon the\r\nCoast, for we never landed upon one but what we saw signs of People\r\nhaving been there before. We were surprized to find Houses, etc., upon\r\nLizard Island, which lies 5 Leagues from the nearest part of the Main; a\r\ndistance we before thought they could not have gone in their Canoes.\r\n\r\nThe Coast of this Country, at least so much of it as lays to the\r\nNorthward of 25 degrees of Latitude, abounds with a great Number of fine\r\nbays and Harbours, which are Shelter'd from all winds; but the Country\r\nitself, so far as we know, doth not produce any one thing that can become\r\nan Article in Trade to invite Europeans to fix a settlement upon it.\r\nHowever, this Eastern side is not that barren and miserable country that\r\nDampier and others have described the Western side to be. We are to\r\nconsider that we see this country in the pure state of nature; the\r\nIndustry of Man has had nothing to do with any part of it, and yet we\r\nfind all such things as nature hath bestow'd upon it in a flourishing\r\nstate. In this Extensive Country it can never be doubted but what most\r\nsorts of Grain, Fruit, roots, etc., of every kind would flourish here\r\nwere they once brought hither, planted and Cultivated by the hands of\r\nIndustry; and here are Provender for more Cattle, at all seasons of the\r\nYear, than ever can be brought into the Country.* (* It says a good deal\r\nfor Cook's penetration that he wrote like this, for the coast of\r\nAustralia is not promising, especially in the dry season; and coming as\r\nhe did from the more apparently fertile countries of Tahiti and New\r\nZealand, Australia must have appeared but a barren land.) When one\r\nconsiders the Proximity of this Country with New Guinea, New Britain, and\r\nseveral other Islands which produce Cocoa Nutts and many other fruits\r\nproper for the support of man, it seems strange that they should not long\r\nago be Transplanted here; by its not being done it should seem that the\r\nNatives of this Country have no commerce with their Neighbours, the New\r\nGuineans.* (* The climate is too dry for the cocoanut palm.) It is very\r\nprobable that they are a different people, and speak a different\r\nLanguage. For the advantage of such as want to Clear up this point I\r\nshall add a small Vocabulary of a few Words in the New Holland Language\r\nwhich we learnt when in Endeavour River.* (* The languages of the\r\ndifferent tribes differ very much. This results from the continual state\r\nof war in which they live, as they have no communication the one with the\r\nother.)\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1: ENGLISH.\r\nCOLUMN 2: NEW HOLLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Head : Whageegee.\r\nThe Hair of the head : Morye or More.\r\nThe Eyes : Meul.\r\nThe Ears : Melea.\r\nThe Lips : Yembe or Jembi.\r\nThe Teeth : Mulere or Moile.\r\nThe Chinn : Jaeal.\r\nThe Beard : Waller.\r\nThe Tongue : Unjar.\r\nThe Nose : Bonjoo.\r\nThe Naval : Toolpoor or Julpur.\r\nThe Penis : Keveil or Kerrial.\r\nThe Scrotum : Coonal or Kunnol.\r\nThe Arms : Aw or Awl.\r\nThe Hand : Marigal.\r\nThe Thumb : Eboorbalga.\r\nThe Fore, Middle and Ring fingers : Egalbaiga.\r\nLittle Finger : Nakil or Eboonakil.\r\nThe Thighs : Coman.\r\nThe Knees : Ponga.\r\nThe Legs : Peegoorgo.\r\nThe Feet : Edamal.\r\nThe Nails : Kolke or Kulke.\r\nA Stone : Walba.\r\nSand : Joo'wal, Yowall, or Joralba.\r\nA Rope or Line : Goorgo or Gurka.\r\nFire : Maianang or Meanang.\r\nThe Sun : Galan or Gallan.\r\nThe Sky : Kere or Kearre.\r\nA Father : Dunjo.\r\nA Son : Jumurre.\r\nA Man : Bamma or Ba ma.\r\nA Dog : Cotta or Kota.\r\nA Lorryquet : Perpere or Pier-pier.\r\nA Cocatoo : Wanda.\r\nMale Turtle : Poonja or Poinja.\r\nFemale : Mamingo.\r\nA great Cockle : Moenjo or Moingo.\r\nCocos Yams : Maracotu (?).\r\nA Canoe : Maragan.\r\n\r\n[Australian Natives.]\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said of the Natives of New Holland they may appear to\r\nsome to be the most wretched People upon Earth; but in reality they are\r\nfar more happier than we Europeans, being wholy unacquainted not only\r\nwith the Superfluous, but with the necessary Conveniences so much sought\r\nafter in Europe; they are happy in not knowing the use of them. They live\r\nin a Tranquility which is not disturbed by the Inequality of Condition.\r\nThe earth and Sea of their own accord furnishes them with all things\r\nnecessary for Life. They covet not Magnificient Houses, Household-stuff,\r\netc.; they live in a Warm and fine Climate, and enjoy every wholesome\r\nAir, so that they have very little need of Cloathing; and this they seem\r\nto be fully sencible of, for many to whom we gave Cloth, etc., left it\r\ncarelessly upon the Sea beach and in the Woods, as a thing they had no\r\nmanner of use for; in short, they seem'd to set no Value upon anything we\r\ngave them, nor would they ever part with anything of their own for any\r\none Article we could offer them. This, in my opinion, Argues that they\r\nthink themselves provided with all the necessarys of Life, and that they\r\nhave no Superfluities.* (* The native Australians may be happy in their\r\ncondition, but they are without doubt among the lowest of mankind.\r\nConfirmed cannibals, they lose no opportunity of gratifying their love of\r\nhuman flesh. Mothers will kill and eat their own children, and the women\r\nagain are often mercilessly illtreated by their lords and masters. There\r\nare no chiefs, and the land is divided into sections, occupied by\r\nfamilies, who consider everything in their district as their own.\r\nInternecine war exists between the different tribes, which are very\r\nsmall. Their treachery, which is unsurpassed, is simply an outcome of\r\ntheir savage ideas, and in their eyes is a form of independence which\r\nresents any intrusion on THEIR land, THEIR wild animals, and THEIR rights\r\ngenerally. In their untutored state they therefore consider that any\r\nmethod of getting rid of the invader is proper. Both sexes, as Cook\r\nobserved, are absolutely nude, and lead a wandering life, with no fixed\r\nabode, subsisting on roots, fruits, and such living things as they can\r\ncatch. Nevertheless, although treated by the coarser order of colonists\r\nas wild beasts to be extirpated, those who have studied them have formed\r\nfavourable opinions of their intelligence. The more savage side of their\r\ndisposition being, however, so very apparent, it is not astonishing that,\r\nbrought into contact with white settlers, who equally consider that they\r\nhave a right to settle, the aborigines are rapidly disappearing.)\r\n\r\nI shall conclude the account of this Country with a few observations on\r\nthe Currents and Tides upon the Coast, because I have mentioned in the\r\nCourse of this Journal that the latter hath sometimes set one way and\r\nsometimes another, which I shall Endeavour to account for in the best\r\nmanner I can. From the Latitude of 32 degrees, or above downwards to\r\nSandy Cape in the Latitude of 24 degrees 46 minutes, we constantly found\r\na Current setting to the Southward at the rate of 10 or 15 Miles per Day,\r\nmore or less, according to the distance we were from the land, for it\r\nruns stronger in shore than in the Offing. All this time I had not been\r\nable to satisfy myself whether the flood-tide came from the Southward,\r\nEastward, or Northward, but judged it to come from the South-East; but\r\nthe first time we anchor'd upon the coast, which was in the Latitude of\r\n24 degrees 30 minutes, and about 10 Leagues to the South-East of Bustard\r\nBay, we found there the flood to come from the North-West. On the\r\nContrary, 30 Leagues further to the North-West, on the South side of\r\nKeppel Bay, we found the Flood to come from the East, and at the Northern\r\npart of the said Bay we found it come from the Northward, but with a much\r\nSlower Motion than the Easterly Tide. Again, on the East side of the Bay\r\nof Inlets we found the flood to set strong to the Westward as far as the\r\nOp'ning of Broad sound, but on the North side of that sound the flood\r\ncome with a Slow motion from the North-West; and when at Anchor before\r\nRepulse bay we found the flood to come from the northward. We need only\r\nadmit the flood tide to come from the East or South-East, and then all\r\nthese seeming Contradictions will be found to be conformable to reason\r\nand experience. It is well known that where there are deep Inlets, large\r\nCreeks, etc., into low lands, that it is not occasioned by fresh water\r\nRivers; there is a very great indraught of the Flood Tide, the direction\r\nof which will be determin'd according to the possition or direction of\r\nthe Coast which forms the Entrance into such Inlets; and this direction\r\nthe Tide must follow, let it be ever so contrary to their general Course\r\nout at Sea, and where the Tides are weak, as they are in general upon\r\nthis Coast, a large Inlet will, if I may so call it, attract the Flood\r\ntide for many Leagues. Any one need only cast an Eye over the Chart to be\r\nmade sencible of what I have advanced. To the Northward of Whitsundays\r\nPassage there are few or no large Inlets, and consequently the Flood sets\r\nto the Northward or North-West, according to the direction of the Coast,\r\nand Ebb the Contrary; but this is to be understood at a little distance\r\nfrom land, or where there is no Creeks or Inlets, for where such are, be\r\nthey ever so small, they draw the flood from the Southward, Eastward, and\r\nNorthward, and, as I found by experience, while we lay in Endeavour\r\nRiver.* (* Cook's reasoning on the course of the flood stream is quite\r\nsound.) Another thing I have observed upon the Tides which ought to be\r\nremarked, which is that there is only one high Tide in 24 Hours, and that\r\nis the night Tide. On the Spring Tides the difference between the\r\nperpendicular rise of the night and day Tides is not less than 3 feet,\r\nwhich is a great deal where the Tides are so inconsiderable, as they are\r\nhere.* (* This difference in the heights of consecutive tides is termed\r\nthe diurnal inequality. It results from the tide wave being made up of a\r\nlarge number of undulations, some caused by the moon, some by the sun;\r\nsome occurring twice a day, others only once. It occurs in all parts of\r\nthe world, but is inconspicuous on the coasts of Europe. In Australia it\r\nis very marked, and occasions the night tides to be the highest at one\r\ntime of the year, when the Endeavour was on the coast, and the day tides\r\nat the other. There are places on the east coast of Australia where the\r\nrange of the tide is very great, but Cook did not anchor at any of them.)\r\nThis inequality of the Tide I did not observe till we run ashore; perhaps\r\nit is much more so to the Northward than to the Southward. After we had\r\ngot within the Reefs the second time we found the Tides more considerable\r\nthan at any time before, except in the Bay of Inlets. It may be owing to\r\nthe water being confin'd in Channels between the Shoals, but the flood\r\nalways set to the North-West to the extremity of New Wales, from thence\r\nWest and South-West into the India Seas.\r\n\r\n[Historical Notes, East Coast of Australia.]\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTES ON THE EAST COAST OF AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nPREVIOUS to Cook's visit no European, so far as is known, had ever\r\nsighted the East Coast of Australia, or, as it was then called, New\r\nHolland. The Dutch had examined and mapped the shores from the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria on the north round by the west to Van Dieman's Land or\r\nTasmania, but had not decided whether the latter was a part of the\r\nmainland or no. Dampier, in 1699, had the intention of passing south to\r\nexplore the unknown eastern shore, but never carried it out, confining\r\nhis attention to the northern part of the west coast, with which, and\r\nwith good reason, he was not favourably impressed.\r\n\r\nOn all maps of the time, the east coast, from Tasmania to the north, was\r\nshown as a dotted and more or less straight line, Tasmania being joined\r\nat the south, and generally New Guinea at the north.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed one manuscript known as the Dauphin's Map, a copy of\r\nwhich is in the British Museum, of the date of about 1540, which shows a\r\ncertain amount of the north-east coast, and has been thought by some to\r\nprove that some one had visited it. But an inspection of it shows that it\r\nis far more probably a case of imaginative coast drawing, such as occurs\r\nin other places in the same map, and in many others of the same and later\r\ndates, and there is certainly no record of any voyage to this coast.\r\n\r\nAfter Cook's exploration it remained unvisited until 1788, when, owing\r\nmainly to Banks' influence, Botany Bay was pitched upon as a convict\r\nsettlement, and a squadron, consisting of H.M.S. Sirius, the Supply brig,\r\n3 storeships, and 6 transports, under the command of Captain Arthur\r\nPhillip, R.N., which had sailed from England on May 13th, 1787, arrived\r\nin that bay on January 18th, 1788, but immediately moved into Port\r\nJackson, where the settlement of Sydney was formed.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Colony was one of struggle and starvation, and\r\nit was many years before any prosperity was attained. In 1839 the\r\ndeportation of convicts ceased, but it was not until 1851, when gold was\r\nfound, that free settlers in any large number came to the Colony.\r\n\r\nQueensland, formerly the northern part of New South Wales, was formed a\r\nseparate Colony in 1859.\r\n\r\nA white population of about 1,500,000 now inhabits the eastern part of\r\nAustralia, first explored by Cook, and their numbers are rapidly\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nAlthough the products of the Colonies are mainly agricultural and\r\nmineral, a very large proportion of this population are in the large\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nSydney contains 230,000, Newcastle 20,000, Brisbane 55,000, Rockhampton\r\n13,000.\r\n\r\nWool, one of the staple products, is obtained from some 80,000,000 sheep,\r\nwhich, as Cook foresaw, have thriven well; and with 8,000,000 head of\r\ncattle supply another export in the shape of frozen meat. Coal and other\r\nminerals employ a large number of people, and the total value of exports\r\namounts to about 24,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe uninhabited shores and untracked seas of Cook's time, only 120 years\r\nago, are thus now teeming with life and trade; and it is no wonder that\r\nthe name of the great explorer is more venerated, and the memory of his\r\ndeeds is more fresh, in the Colonies than in the Mother country that sent\r\nhim forth to find new fields for British enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. FROM TORRES STRAIT TO BATAVIA.\r\n\r\n[August 1770.]\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, 24th. In the P.M. had light Airs from the South-South-West, with\r\nwhich, after leaving Booby Island, as before mentioned, we steer'd\r\nWest-North-West until 5 o'clock, when it fell Calm, and the Tide of Ebb\r\nwhich sets to the North-East soon after making, we Anchor'd in 8 fathoms\r\nsoft sandy bottom, Booby Island bearing South 50 degrees East, distant 5\r\nmiles; Prince of Wales Isles extending from North-East by North to South\r\n55 degrees East. There appear'd to be an open clear passage between these\r\nIslands extending from North 64 degrees East to East by North. At 1/2\r\npast 5 in the morning in purchasing* (* Weighing the anchor.) the Anchor,\r\nthe Cable parted about 8 or 10 fathoms from the Anchor; I immediately\r\norder'd another Anchor to be let go, which brought the ship up before she\r\nhad drove a cable's length from the Buoy; after this we carried out a\r\nKedge, and warped the ship nearer to it, and then endeavour'd to sweep\r\nthe Anchor with a Hawser, but miss'd it, and broke away the Buoy rope.*\r\n(* The kedge is a small anchor. Sweeping is dragging the middle of a\r\nrope, or hawser, held at the two ends from two boats some distance apart,\r\nalong the bottom, with the object of catching the fluke of the anchor as\r\nit lies on the bottom, and so recovering it. It is a long and wearisome\r\noperation if the bottom is uneven. Cook, however, having already lost one\r\nof his large anchors, could not afford to leave this without an effort.)\r\nWe made several Attempts afterwards, but did not succeed. While the Boats\r\nwere thus employed we hove up the Kedge Anchor, it being of no more use.\r\nAt Noon Latitude observed 10 degrees 30 minutes South. Winds at\r\nNorth-East, a fresh breeze; the Flood Tide here comes from the same\r\nQuarter.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 25th. Winds at North-East and East-North-East, a gentle breeze.\r\nBeing resolv'd not to leave the Anchor behind while there remain'd the\r\nleast probability of getting of it, after dinner I sent the Boats again\r\nto sweep for it first with a small line, which succeeded, and now we\r\nknow'd where it lay we found it no very hard matter to sweep it with a\r\nHawser. This done, we hove the Ship up to it by the same Hawser, but just\r\nas it was almost up and down the Hawser slip'd, and left us all to do\r\nover again. By this time it was dark, and obliged us to leave off until\r\ndaylight in the morning, when we sweep'd it again, and hove it up to the\r\nbows, and by 8 o'Clock weigh'd the other anchor, got under sail, and\r\nstood away North-West, having a fresh breeze at East-North-East. At Noon\r\nwe were by observation in the Latitude of 10 degrees 18 minutes South,\r\nLongitude 219 degrees 39 minutes West, having no land in sight, but about\r\n2 miles to the Southward of us lay a Shoal,* (* Cook Reef.) on which the\r\nSea broke, and I believe a part of it dry. At low Water it extended\r\nNorth-West and South-East, and might be about 4 or 5 Leagues in Circuit;\r\ndepth of Water at this time and since we weigh'd 9 fathoms.\r\n\r\nSunday, 26th. Fresh breezes at East in standing to the North-West. We\r\nbegan to Shoalden our water from 9 to 7 fathoms, and at 1/2 past one,\r\nhaving run 11 Miles since Noon, the boat which was a head made the signal\r\nfor Shoal Water, immediately upon which we let go an Anchor, and brought\r\nthe Ship up with the sails standing as the boats was but a little way\r\nahead, having but just relieved the Crew, and at same time we saw from\r\nthe Ship Shoal Water* (* Cook Shoal.) in a manner all round us, and both\r\nwind and Tide setting upon it. We lay in 6 fathoms with the Ship, but\r\nupon sounding about her found hardly 2 fathoms, a very rocky bottom, not\r\nmuch above 1/2 a cable's length from us from the east round by the North\r\nand West as far as South-West, so that there was no way to get clear but\r\nthe way we came. This was one of the many Fortunate Escapes we have had\r\nfrom Shipwreck, for it was near high water, and there run a short\r\ncockling sea that would soon have bulged the Ship had she struck. These\r\nShoals that lay a fathom or 2 under Water are the most dangerous of any,\r\nfor they do not shew themselves until you are close upon them, and then\r\nthe water upon them looks brown like the reflection of dark clouds.\r\nBetween 3 and 4 the Ebb began to make, when I sent the Master to sound to\r\nthe Southward and South Westward, and in the meantime, as the Ship\r\ntended,* (* Swung to the tide.) hove up the Anchor, and with a little\r\nSail stood to the Southward and afterwards edged away to the Westward,\r\nand got once more out of danger, where at sun set we Anchor'd in 10\r\nfathoms Sandy bottom. Having a fresh of wind at East-South-East, at 6\r\no'clock in the morning we weighed and stood West, with a fresh of wind at\r\nEast, having first sent a boat ahead to sound. I did intend to have\r\nsteer'd North-West until we had made the Coast of New Guinea, designing\r\nif Possible to touch upon that Coast, but the meeting with these Shoals\r\nlast night made me Alter the Course to West, in hopes of meeting with\r\nfewer dangers and deeper Water; and this we found, for by Noon we had\r\ndeepned our water gradually to 17 fathoms, and this time we were by\r\nobservation in the Latitude of 10 degrees 10 minutes South, Longitude 220\r\ndegrees 12 minutes West. Course and distance sail'd since yesterday at\r\nnoon North 76 degrees West, 11 Leagues, no land in sight.\r\n\r\n[Off South Coast of New Guinea.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 27th. Fresh breezes between the East by North and\r\nEast-South-East, with which we steer'd West until sun set; depth of Water\r\nfrom 27 to 23 fathoms. We now Reef'd the Topsails, shortened Sail, and\r\nhoisted in the pinnace and Long boat up alongside, and afterwards kept\r\nupon a Wind all night under our Topsails, 4 hours on one Tack and four\r\nhours on the other; depth of Water 25 fathoms, very even soundings. At\r\ndaylight made all the Sail we could, and steer'd West-North-West until 8\r\no'clock, then North-West; at Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude\r\nof 9 degrees 56 minutes South, Longitude 221 degrees 00 minutes West;\r\nVariation 2 degrees 30 minutes East. Course and distance sail'd since\r\nyesterday at Noon North 73 degrees 33 minutes West, 49 miles.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 28th. Fresh breezes at East and East by South and fair weather.\r\nContinued a North-West Course until sun set, at which time we shortned\r\nsail, and haul'd close upon a Wind to the Northward; depth of Water 21\r\nfathoms. At 8 Tack'd and stood to the Southward until 12, then stood to\r\nthe Northward under little Sail until daylight, sounding from 25 to 17\r\nfathoms; Shoalding as we stood to the Northward. At this time we made\r\nsail and steer'd North in order to make the land of New Guinea; from the\r\ntime of our making sail until noon the depth of Water gradually decreased\r\nfrom 17 to 12 fathoms, a stony and shelly bottom. We were now by\r\nObservation in the Latitude of 8 degrees 52 minutes South, which is in\r\nthe same Parrallel as the Southern parts of New Guinea as it is laid down\r\nin the Charts; but there are only 2 points so far to the South, and I\r\nreckon we are a degree to the Westward of both, and for that reason do\r\nnot see the Land which trends more to the Northward. Our Course and\r\ndistance sail'd since Yesterday is North-North-West, 69 Miles; Longitude\r\nin 221 degrees 27 minutes West. The Sea in many places is here cover'd\r\nwith a kind of a brown scum, such as Sailors generally call spawn; upon\r\nour first seeing it it alarm'd us, thinking we were among Shoals, but we\r\nfound the same depth of Water were it was as in other places; neither Mr.\r\nBanks nor Dr. Solander could tell what it was, altho' they had of it to\r\nExamine.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 29th. Continued standing to the Northward, with a fresh gale\r\nat East by South and South-East until 6 o'clock, having very irregular\r\nand uncertain soundings from 24 to 7 fathoms. At 4 we made the Land from\r\nthe Mast head, bearing North-West by North, and which appear'd to be very\r\nlow. At 6 it extended from West-North-West to North-North-East, distant 4\r\nor 5 Leagues. At this time hauld close upon a wind to the Eastward until\r\n7 o'clock, then Tack'd and stood to the Southward until 12, at which time\r\nwe wore and stood to the Northward until 4, then lay her Head off until\r\ndaylight, when we again saw the Land, and stood North-North-West directly\r\nfor it, having a fresh gale at East by South. Our Soundings in the night\r\nwere from 17 to 5 fathoms, very irregular, without any sort of Rule with\r\nrespect to our distance from the Land. At 1/2 past 6 a small low island,\r\nlaying about a League from the Main, bore North by West, distant 5 miles;\r\nthis island lays in the Latitude of 8 degrees 13 minutes South, Longitude\r\n221 degrees 25 minutes West. I find it laid down in the Charts by the\r\nName of St. Bartholomew or Whermoysen. We now steer'd North-West by West,\r\nWest-North-West, West by North, West by South, and South-West by West, as\r\nwe found the land to lay, having a Boat ahead of the Ship sounding; depth\r\nof water from 5 to 9 fathoms. When in 7, 8 or 9 fathoms we could but just\r\nsee the Land from the Deck; but I did not think we were at above 4\r\nLeagues off, because the land is exceeding low and level, and appeared to\r\nbe well cover'd with wood; one sort appeared to us to be Cocoa Nutt\r\nTrees. By the Smookes we saw in different parts as we run along shore we\r\nwere assured that the Country is inhabited. At Noon we were about 3\r\nLeagues from the land, the Westermost part of which that we could see\r\nbore South 79 degrees West; our Latitude by Observation was 8 degrees 19\r\nminutes South, Longitude 221 degrees 44 minutes West. The Island, St.\r\nBartholomew, bore North 74 degrees East, distant 20.* (* The ship was now\r\noff the south coast of New Guinea, and near what is known as Princess\r\nMarianne Strait, which separates Frederick Henry Island from the main\r\nisland. All this coast is very shallow, but very imperfectly charted to\r\nthe present day.)\r\n\r\nThursday, 30th. Fresh breezes at South-East, East-South-East, and East by\r\nSouth. After steering South-West by West, 6 miles, we discover'd on our\r\nStarboard bow and ahead a Strong appearance of Shoal Water, and by this\r\ntime we had Shoald our water from 10 to 5 fathoms; upon which I made the\r\nPinnace Signal to Edge down to it, but she not going far enough, we sent\r\nthe Yawl to sound in it, and at the same time hauld off close upon a\r\nWind, with the Ship until 4, at which time we had run 6 Miles, but did\r\nnot depen our water anything. We then Edged away South-West, 4 Miles\r\nmore, but finding still Shoal Water we brought too, and call'd the Boats\r\non board by Signal, hoisted them in, and then hauld off close upon a\r\nwind, being at this time about 3 or 4 Miles from the Land. The Yawl found\r\nonly 3 fathoms water in the place where I sent her to sound, which place\r\nI weather'd about 1/2 a mile. Between 1 and 2 we passed a Bay or Inlet,\r\nbefore which lies a small Island that seems to Shelter it from the\r\nSoutherly winds; but I very much doubt their being Water behind it for\r\nShipping. I could not attempt it because the South-East Trade wind blows\r\nright in, and we have not as yet had any land breezes. We stretched off\r\nto Sea until 12 o'Clock, at which time we were 10 and 11 Leagues from the\r\nLand, and had depen'd our Water to 29 fathoms; we now tack'd and stood in\r\nuntil 4 o'Clock, when, being in 6 1/2 fathoms, we tack'd and lay her head\r\noff until day light, at which time we saw the land bearing North-West by\r\nWest, distant about 4 Leagues. We now made sail and steer'd\r\nWest-South-West, and then West by South, but coming into 54 fathoms we\r\nhauld off South-West until we depen'd our Water to 8 fathoms; we then\r\nkeept away West by South and West, having 9 fathoms and the Land just in\r\nsight from the Deck, which we judged not above 3 or 4 Leagues off, as it\r\nis everywhere exceeding low. At Noon we were by Observation in the\r\nLatitude of 8 degrees 38 minutes South, Longitude 222 degrees 34 minutes\r\nWest. St. Bartholomew Isle bore North 69 degrees East, distant 74 Miles.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Walsche, New Guinea.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 31st. Between 12 and 1 in the P.M. Steer'd North-North-West, in\r\nwhich time we Shoalded our Water from 8 to 5 1/2, which I thought was\r\nlittle enough, and therefore keept away again West, and soon depen'd it\r\nto 7 fathoms, which depth we keept until 6, having the land just in sight\r\nfrom the Deck. At this time the Western Extream bore North, distant about\r\n4 Leagues, and Seem'd to end in a point and turn away to the Northward;\r\nwe took it to be Point St. Augustine or Walsche Caep, Latitude 8 degrees\r\n24 minutes South, Longitude 222 degrees 55 minutes West.* (* This\r\nposition is correct. Mr. Green had been assiduously observing lunars, and\r\nit appears strange that the error of the position of the north point of\r\nAustralia was not discovered; but doubtless the discrepancy was put down\r\nto current.) We now shortned sail and hauld off South-South-West and\r\nSouth by West, having the wind at South-East and South-East by East, a\r\nGentle breeze; we stood off 16 Miles, having from 7 to 27 fathoms,\r\ndeepning gradually as we run off. At midnight we Tacked and stood in\r\nuntil daylight, at which time we could see no land, and yet we had only 5\r\n1/2 fathoms. We now Steer'd North-West, having the same deepth of Water\r\nuntil near 9 o'Clock, when we began to Depen our Water to 6 1/2 and 7\r\nfathoms. By this I thought that we were far Enough to the Westward of the\r\nCape, and might haul to the Northward with Safety, which we now did,\r\nhaving the Wind at North-East by East, a light breeze. By Noon we had\r\nincreased our Water to 9 fathoms, and were by Observation in the Latitude\r\nof 8 degrees 10 minutes South, which was 10 Miles to the Northward of\r\nthat given by the Log; by which I conjectur'd that we had meet with a\r\nstrong Current setting round the Cape, not only to the Northward, but to\r\nthe Westward also, otherwise we ought to have seen the Land, which we did\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n[September 1770.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 1st September. In the P.M. and most part of the night had a\r\nfresh breeze from the South-East with which we keept standing in for the\r\nland North-East and East-North-East, close upon a wind, until half past\r\n6, when we Anchor'd in 4 1/2 fathoms, soft muddy bottom, as we have every\r\nwere found upon the Coast. About an hour before we Anchor'd we saw the\r\nland from the Mast head extending from the East by North to\r\nSouth-South-East, all very low; at the time we Anchor'd we found a small\r\ndrean* (* Drain.) of a Tide setting away to the North-West, which\r\ncontinued until 2 in the morning, when the Water had fell 9 feet or\r\nbetter. This Tide of Ebb was then succeeded by the Flood, which came from\r\nthe South-West; yet we did not find the Water to rise much upon a\r\nperpendicular, or else the greatest fall of the Tide had not been well\r\nattended to in the night, for at 6, when we got under sail, we had no\r\nmore than 3 fathoms under the ship, and yet we could not see the land\r\nfrom the Deck. After getting under sail we stood to the Northward with a\r\nlight breeze at East, and deepned our Water by noon to 10 fathoms, having\r\nthe Land just in sight from the Mast head to the South-East. At this time\r\nwe were in the Latitude of 7 degrees 39 minutes South, Longitude 222\r\ndegrees 42 minutes West; Port St. Augustine bore South 10 degrees West,\r\ndistant 15 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSunday, 2nd. In the P.M. had Calm until 2, when a light breeze sprung up\r\nat North by East, and we stood in for the Land East by North until 5, at\r\nwhich time we got the wind from the South-West, a light breeze, with\r\nwhich we steer'd North-East, edging in for the land, having it in sight\r\nfrom the Deck, and which I judged to be about 3 or 4 Leagues off, being\r\nvery low land. Found the Variation to be 2 degrees 34 minutes East, and a\r\nlittle before 8 o'Clock, having but little wind, we Anchor'd in 7\r\nfathoms, soft Muddy bottom. In the Afternoon and evening we saw several\r\nSea Snakes, some of which the people in the Boat alongside took up by\r\nhand. At daylight in the Morning we got under sail, and stood away to the\r\nNorth-North-East, having a fresh gale at East, which by noon brought us\r\ninto the Latitude of 7 degrees 14 minutes South, Longitude 222 degrees 30\r\nminutes West; Depth of Water 13 fathoms. Course and distance sail'd since\r\nYesterday Noon is North 24 degrees East, 27 Miles, having at this time no\r\nland in sight, for the Land, according to the Charts, trends more\r\nEasterly than the Wind would permit us to sail.\r\n\r\nMonday, 3rd. Steer'd North by East, with a fresh breeze at East by North\r\nuntil 7 in the Evening, when the wind came to South-East by South, with\r\nwhich we keept standing to the Eastward close upon a wind all Night,\r\nhaving from 17 to 10 fathoms pretty even Soundings. At daylight we saw\r\nthe land extending from North by East to South-East, distant about 4\r\nLeagues. We still keept standing in for it, having the advantage of a\r\nfresh gale at East-South-East and East by South, until near 9, when,\r\nbeing about 3 or 4 Miles off, and in 3 fathoms, we brought too and I went\r\nashore in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, having\r\na mind to land once in this Country before we quit it Altogether, which I\r\nnow am determin'd to do without delay; for I found that it is only\r\nspending time to little purpose, and carrying us far out of our way,\r\nstaying upon this Coast, which is so shallow that we can hardly keep\r\nwithin sight of land.\r\n\r\n[Land in New Guinea.]\r\n\r\nAt the time we put off from the Ship we saw not the least sign of\r\ninhabitants; but we had no sooner landed than we saw the print of Men's\r\nfeet fresh upon the sand, and a little way farther we found a small Shed\r\nor Hutt, about which lay green shells of Cocoa Nutts. By this we were\r\nwell assured that the inhabitants were not far off; nay, we thought we\r\nheard their Voices in the woods, which were so close and thick that we\r\ndid not think it safe to venture in, for fear of an Ambuscade, as we had\r\nonly a Boat's crew with us, a part of which were left to look after the\r\nboat, which lay about a 1/4 of a Mile from the Shore. We therefore took a\r\nwalk upon the Sea beach, but had not gone above 200 Yards before we were\r\nattack'd by 3 or 4 Men, who came out of the woods a little before us, but\r\nupon our firing upon them they retir'd. Finding that we could not search\r\nthe Country with any degree of Safety, we return'd to the boat, and was\r\nfollowed by 60, or, as some thought, about 100, of the Natives, who had\r\nadvanced in small parties out of the woods; but they suffer'd us to go to\r\nour boats without giving us any trouble. We had now time to view them\r\nattentively; we thought them to be about the size and Colour of the New\r\nHollanders, with short, Cropt Hair, and quite naked like them. I thought\r\nthese of a lighter Colour; but that may be owing to a whitish Pigment\r\nwith which we thought their bodies were painted, because some appeared\r\ndarker than others.\r\n\r\nTheir Arms were ordinary darts of about 4 feet long, made of a kind of\r\nreed, and pointed at one end with hard wood; but what appear'd more\r\nextraordinary to us was something they had which caused a flash of fire\r\nor Smoak, very much like the going off of a pistol or small Gun, but\r\nwithout any report. The deception was so great that the people in the\r\nShip actually thought that they had fire Arms; indeed, they seem'd to use\r\nthese things in imitation of such, for the moment the first man we saw\r\nmade his appearance he fir'd off one of these things, and while we lay\r\nlooking at them in the boat 4 or 5 would let them off all at once, which\r\nhad all the appearance in the world of Volleys of Small Arms; but I am\r\nconfident that nothing came from them but smook, but by what means this\r\nwas done, or what purpose it answer'd, we were not able to Guess. I\r\nthought the Combustable matter was contain'd in a reed or piece of small\r\nBamboo, which they gave a Swing round in the hand and caused it to go\r\noff.* (* The natives carry hollow canes with burning tinder for making\r\nfires.)\r\n\r\nThis place lies in the Latitude of 6 degrees 15 minutes South, about 65\r\nLeagues to the North-East of Point St. Augustine, or Walsche Caep, and is\r\nnear to what is called in the Charts by the long name of Cape de la Colta\r\nde St. Bonaventura.* (* Cook's landing place in New Guinea, on the\r\nwestern side of this great island, was on a part of the coast scarcely\r\nknown to this day. It is in the part of the island claimed by the Dutch.\r\nCook's insatiable desire to explore is well shown in this digression from\r\nhis course to Batavia.) The land is very low, like every other part of\r\nthe Coast we have seen here; it is thick and Luxuriously cloathed with\r\nwoods and Verdure, all of which appear Green and flourishing. Here were\r\nCocoa nutt Trees, Bread Fruit Trees, and Plantain Trees, but we saw no\r\nfruit but on the former, and these were small and Green; the other Trees,\r\nShrubs, Plants, etc., were likewise such as is common in the South Sea\r\nIslands and in New Holland.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to the Ship we hoisted in the boat and made sail to the\r\nWestward, with a design to leave the Coast altogether. This, however, was\r\ncontrary to the inclination and opinion of some of the Officers, who\r\nwould have had me send a Party of Men ashore to cut down the Cocoa Nutt\r\nTrees for the sake of the Nutts; a thing that I think no man living could\r\nhave justified, for as the Natives had attacked us for meer landing\r\nwithout taking away one thing, certainly they would have made a Vigerous\r\neffort to have defended their property; in which case many of them must\r\nhave been kill'd, and perhaps some of our own people too, and all this\r\nfor 2 or 300 Green Cocoa Nutts, which, when we had got them, would have\r\ndone us little service; besides nothing but the utmost necessity would\r\nhave obliged me to have taken this method to come at refreshments.\r\n\r\nIt's true I might have gone farther along the Coast to the Northward and\r\nWestward until we had found a place where the Ship could lay so near the\r\nShore as to cover the people with her Guns when landed; but it is very\r\nprobable that before we had found such a place we should have been\r\ncarried so far to the West as to have been obliged to have gone to\r\nBatavia by the way of the Moluccas, and on the North side of Java, where\r\nwe were all utter Strangers. This I did not think was so safe a Passage\r\nas to go to the South of Java and thro' the Straits of Sunda, the way I\r\npropose to myself to go. Besides, as the Ship is leakey, we are not yet\r\nsure wether or no we shall not be obliged to heave her down at Batavia;\r\nin this case it becomes the more necessary that we should make the best\r\nof our way to that place, especially as no new discovery can be Expected\r\nto be made in these Seas, which the Dutch have, I believe, long ago\r\nnarrowly examin'd, as appears from 3 Maps bound up with the French\r\nHistory of Voyages to the Terra Australis, published in 1756,* (* De\r\nBrye's Voyages.) which Maps, I do suppose, by some means have been got\r\nfrom the Dutch, as we found the Names of many of the places are in that\r\nLanguage.\r\n\r\nIt should likewise seem from the same Maps that the Spaniards and Dutch\r\nhave at one time or another circumnavigated the whole of the Island of\r\nNew Guinea, as the most of the Names are in these 2 Languages; and such\r\npart of the Coast as we were upon I found the Chart tolerable good, which\r\nobliges me to give some Credit to all the rest, notwithstanding we\r\nneither know by whom or when they were taken, and I always understood,\r\nbefore I had a sight of these Maps, that it was unknown whether or no New\r\nHolland and New Guinea was not one continued land, and so it is said in\r\nthe very History of Voyages these Maps are bound up in. However, we have\r\nnow put this wholy out of dispute; but, as I believe, it was known\r\nbefore, tho' not publicly, I claim no other Merit than the Clearing up of\r\na doubtful point. Another doubtfull point I should have liked to have\r\nclear'd up, altho' it is of very little, if of any Consequence, which is,\r\nwhether the Natives of New Holland and those of New Guinea are, or were,\r\nOriginal, one People, which one might well suppose, as these 2 Countrys\r\nlay so near to each other, and the intermediate space fill'd up with\r\nIslands. On the other hand, if these 2 people have or ever had any\r\nfriendly communication with Each other it seems strange, as I have before\r\nobserved, that they should not have transplanted from New Guinea over to\r\nNew Holland Cocoa Nutts, Bread fruit, Plantains, etc., etc., all very\r\nuseful Articles for the support of Man, that We never saw grow in the\r\nlatter, and which we have now seen in the former. La Maire hath given us\r\na Vocabulary of Words spoken by the People of New Britain (which before\r\nDampier's time was taken to be a part of New Guinea), by which it appears\r\nthat the people of New Britain speak a very different Language from those\r\nof New Holland. Now should it be found that the Natives of New Britain\r\nand those of New Guinea have had One Origin, and speak the same Language,\r\nit will follow, of Course, that the New Hollanders are a different People\r\nfrom both.* (* In the north of Australia the natives are distinctly\r\nallied to the Papuans, but on the east of the continent they are of a\r\ntype of their own, and speak many different languages.)\r\n\r\n[Off South-west Coast of New Guinea.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 4th. Stood to the Westward all this day, having at first a\r\nmoderate breeze Southerly, which afterwards freshned and Veered to\r\nSouth-East and East-South-East. We keept on sounding all the time, having\r\nfrom 14 to 30 fathoms not regular, but sometimes more and sometimes less.\r\nAt noon we were in 14 fathoms; by observation in the Latitude of 6\r\ndegrees 44 minutes South, Longitude 223 degrees 51 minutes West. Course\r\nand distance sail'd since Yesteday Noon South 76 minutes West, 120 Miles.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 5th. Winds at East by South and South-East by East, a fresh\r\ngale and Clear weather, with which were run 118 Miles upon a South 69\r\ndegrees 15 minutes West Course, which at Noon brought us into the\r\nLatitude of 7 degrees 25 minutes South, Longitude 225 degrees 41 minutes\r\nWest; depth of Water 28 fathoms, having been in soundings the whole of\r\nthis day's run, generally between 10 and 20 fathoms. At half an hour past\r\none in the Morning we past by a small low Island, which bore from us at\r\nthat time North-North-West, distant 3 or 4 Miles; depth of Water 14\r\nfathoms, and at daylight we discover'd another low Island extending from\r\nNorth-North-West and North-North-East, distant 2 or 3 Leagues. I believe\r\nI should have landed upon this Island to have known its produce, as it\r\ndid not appear to be very small, had not the wind blown too fresh for\r\nsuch an undertaking, and at the time we passed the Island we had only 10\r\nfathoms Water, a rocky bottom; I was therefore afraid of running down to\r\nleeward for fear of meeting with Shoal Water and foul ground. These\r\nIslands have no place on the Charts, unless they are the Arrow Isles,\r\nwhich, if they are, they are laid down much too far from New Guinea. I\r\nfound the South part of these to lay in the Latitude 7 degrees 6 minutes\r\nSouth, Longitude 225 degrees 0 minutes West.* (* These were probably\r\nKarang and Ennu Islands, two outliers of the Arru Islands.)\r\n\r\nThursday, 6th. A steady fresh gale at East by South and clear weather,\r\nwith which we steer'd West-South-West. At 7 in the Evening we took in the\r\nsmall Sails, reefd the Topsails, and sounded, having 50 fathoms; we still\r\nkeept West-South-West all night, going at the rate of 4 1/2 Miles an\r\nhour. At 10 had 42 fathoms; at 11, 37; and at 12 o'Clock 45; 1 o'Clock\r\n49; and at 3, 120; after which we could get no ground. In the evening we\r\ncaught 2 Boobies, which settled upon the rigging, and these were the\r\nfirst of the kind we have caught in this manner the voyage, altho' I have\r\nheard of them being caught this way in great numbers. At daylight, in the\r\nMorning, we made all the sail we could, and at 10 o'Clock saw land\r\nextending from North-North-West to West by North, distant 5 or 6 League.\r\nAt Noon it bore from North to West about the same distance; our Latitude\r\nby observation was 8 degrees 15 minutes South, Longitude 227 degrees 47\r\nminutes West. This land is of an even and moderate height, and by our run\r\nfrom New Guinea ought to be a part of the Arrow Isles;* (* This was the\r\nsouthern part of the Tenimber Islands.) but it lays a degree farther to\r\nthe South than any of these Islands are laid down in the Charts. We\r\nsounded, but had no ground, with 50 fathoms of Line.\r\n\r\n[Remarks on Charts.]\r\n\r\nFriday, 7th. As I was not able to satisfy myself from any Chart what land\r\nit was we saw to Leeward of us, and fearing it might trend away more\r\nSoutherly, and the weather being hazey so that we could not see far, we\r\nsteer'd South-West, which Course by 4 o'Clock run us out of sight of the\r\nland; by this I was assured that no part of it lay to the Southward of 8\r\ndegrees 15 minutes South. We continued standing to the South-West all\r\nnight under an Easey sail, having the advantage of a fresh gale at\r\nSouth-East by East and East-South-East, and clear moon light; we sounded\r\nevery hour, but had no bottom with 100 and 120 fathoms of line. At\r\ndaylight in the Morning we steer'd West-South-West, and afterwards West\r\nby South, which by Noon brought us into the Latitude of 9 degrees 30\r\nminutes South, and Longitude 229 degrees 34 minutes West, and by our run\r\nfrom New Guinea ought to be in sight of Wessels Isle, which, according to\r\nthe Chart is laid down about 20 or 25 Leagues from the coast of New\r\nHolland; but we saw nothing, by which I conclude that it is wrong laid\r\ndown; and this is not to be wonder'd at when we consider that not only\r\nthese Islands, but the lands which bound this Sea have been discover'd\r\nand explored by different people and at different times, and compiled and\r\nput together by others, perhaps some Ages after the first discoveries\r\nwere made. Navigation formerly wanted many of these helps towards keeping\r\nan Accurate Journal which the present Age is possessed of; it is not they\r\nthat are wholy to blame for the faultiness of the Charts, but the\r\nCompilers and Publishers, who publish to the world the rude Sketches of\r\nthe Navigator as Accurate surveys, without telling what authority they\r\nhave for so doing; for were they to do this we should then be as good or\r\nbetter judge than they, and know where to depend upon the Charts, and\r\nwhere not. Neither can I clear Seamen of this fault; among the few I have\r\nknown who are Capable of drawing a Chart or Sketch of a Sea Coast I have\r\ngenerally, nay, almost always, observed them run into this error. I have\r\nknown them lay down the line of a Coast they have never seen, and put\r\ndown Soundings where they never have sounded; and, after all, are so fond\r\nof their performances as to pass the whole off as Sterling under the\r\nTitle of a Survey Plan, etc. These things must in time be attended with\r\nbad Consequences, and cannot fail of bringing the whole of their works in\r\ndisrepute.* (* Cook had good reason for writing thus, and being himself\r\nscrupulously honest and careful, he felt this scamped work to be a\r\ndisgrace to seamen.) If he is so modest as to say, Such and such parts,\r\nor the whole of his plan is defective, the Publishers or Vendures will\r\nhave it left out, because they say it hurts the sale of the work; so that\r\nbetween the one and the other we can hardly tell when we are possessed of\r\na good Sea Chart until we ourselves have proved it.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 8th. Winds Easterly, with a high Sea from the same Quarter. Our\r\nCourse and distance sail'd this 24 Hours is South 86 degrees 30 minutes\r\nWest, 102 Miles; Latitude in 9 degrees 36 minutes South, Longitude 231\r\ndegrees 17 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 9th. Light Airs and Clear weather the most part of this 24 Hours.\r\nIn the evening found the Variation by several Azimuths to be 0 degrees 12\r\nminutes West, and by the Amplitude 0 degrees 5 minutes West. At Noon we\r\nwere by observation in the Latitude of 9 degrees 46 minutes South,\r\nLongitude 232 degrees 7 minutes West. Course and distance sail'd since\r\nyesterday at Noon South 78 degrees 45 minutes West, 52 Miles. For these 2\r\ndays past we have steer'd due West, and yet we have by observation made\r\n16 Miles Southing--6 Miles Yesterday and 10 to-day; from which it should\r\nseem that there is a Current setting to the Southward and Westward\r\nwithall, as I should suppose.\r\n\r\nMonday, 10th. Light Airs Easterly, except in the morning, when we had it\r\nat North; at sunset found the Variation to be 0 degrees 2 minutes West,\r\nat the same time saw, or thought we saw, very high land bearing\r\nNorth-West, and in the Morning saw the same appearances of land in the\r\nsame Quarter, which left us no room to doubt but what it was land, and\r\nmust be either the Island of Timor land or Timor, but which of the 2 I\r\ncannot as yet determine.* (* This was Timor. What Cook calls Timor land\r\nis probably Timor Laut, another name for the principal island of the\r\nTenimber Group.) At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 10\r\ndegrees 1 minute South, which was 15 Miles to the Southward of that given\r\nby the Log. Longitude in per Observation 233 degrees 27 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 11th. Variable light Airs and Clear weather. Steer'd North-West,\r\nin order to discover the Land plainer until 4 in the morning, at which\r\ntime the wind came to North-West and West, with which we stood to the\r\nSouthward until 9 o'Clock, when we Tack'd and stood North-West, having\r\nthe wind at West-South-West. At sun rise in the morning we could see the\r\nland extend from West-North-West to North-East; at noon we could see it\r\nextend to the Westward as far as West by South 1/2 South, but no farther\r\nto the Eastward than North by East. We were now well assured that this\r\nwas part of the Island of Timor, in consequence of which the last Island\r\nwe saw must have been Timor land, the South part of which lies in the\r\nLatitude of 8 degrees 15 minutes South, Longitude 228 degrees 10 minutes,\r\nwhereas in the Charts the South Point is laid down in Latitude 9 degrees\r\n30 minutes. It is possible that the Land we saw might be some other\r\nIsland; but then I cannot see how we could have miss'd seeing Timor land,\r\nsoposing it to be right laid down in Latitude, as we were never to the\r\nSouthward of 9 degrees 30 minutes; for my design was to have made that\r\nIsland, and to have landed upon it to have seen what it produced, as it\r\nis (according to the Charts) a large Island, and not settled by the Dutch\r\nthat I ever heard off. We were now in the Latitude of 9 degrees 37\r\nminutes, Longitude 233 degrees 54 minutes West by observation of the Sun\r\nand Moon, and Yesterday we were by Observation in 233 degrees 27 minutes\r\nWest. The difference is 27 minutes, which is exactly the same as what the\r\nLog gave; this, however, is a degree of accuracy in observation that is\r\nseldom to be expected.\r\n\r\n[Off South Coast of Timor.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 12th. Winds between the South and West, a light breeze and\r\nClear weather in the P.M.; stood in shore until 8 o'Clock, then Tack'd\r\nand stood off, being about 6 Leagues from the Land, which at dark extend\r\nfrom South-West 1/2 West to North-East; at this time we sounded and had\r\nno ground with 140 fathoms of line, being not above 4 Leagues from the\r\nLand. At 12 o'Clock we Tack'd and stood in, having but little wind, and\r\ncontinued so until noon, at which time we were by Observation in Latitude\r\n9 degrees 36 minutes South; the Log this 24 Hours gave 18 Miles Westing,\r\nbut it did not appear by the land that we had made so much. We saw\r\nseveral Smoaks upon the Land by day, and fires in the Night.\r\n\r\nThursday, 13th. Stood in shore, with a light breeze at South by West\r\nuntil 1/2 past 5 o'Clock in the P.M., when, being a Mile and a 1/2 from\r\nthe Shore, and in 16 fathoms, we tack'd and stood off. At this time the\r\nExtreams of the Land extended from North-East by East to West by South\r\n1/2 South; this last was a low point, distant from us about 3 Leagues. We\r\nwere right before a small Creek or Inlet into the low land, which lies in\r\nthe Latitude of 9 degrees 34 minutes South. Probably it might be the same\r\nas Dampier went into in his Boat, for it did not seem to have depth of\r\nWater sufficient for anything else. In standing in shore we sounded\r\nseveral times, but found no soundings until we got within 2 1/2 Miles of\r\nthe Shore, where we had 25 fathoms, soft bottom. We stood off Shore until\r\n12 o'Clock, with the wind at South, then Tack'd and stood to the Westward\r\n2 Hours, when the wind veer'd to the South-West and West-South-West, and\r\nthen we stood to the Southward. In the Morning found the Variation to be\r\n1 degree 10 minutes West by the Amplitude, and by the Azimuth 1 degree 27\r\nminutes West; at Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 9 degrees\r\n45 minutes South, Longitude 234 degrees 12 minutes West, and about 6 or 7\r\nLeagues from the land, which extended from North 31 degrees East to\r\nWest-South-West 1/2 West. Winds at South-South-West, a Gentle breeze.\r\n\r\nFriday, 14th. Light Land and Sea breezes; the former we had from West by\r\nNorth, and only a few hours in the morning, the latter we had from the\r\nSouth-South-West and South. With these winds we advanced but slowly to\r\nthe Westward. At Noon we were about 6 or 7 Leagues from the Land, which\r\nextended from North by East to South 78 degrees West; our Latitude by\r\nObservation was 9 degrees 54 minutes South. Course and Distance sail'd\r\nsince Yesterday noon South 68 degrees West, 24 Miles. We saw several\r\nSmoakes ashore in the P.M., and fires in the night, both upon the Low\r\nland and up in the Mountains.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 15th. In the P.M. had the Sea breezes at South-South-West and\r\nSouth, with which we stood to the Westward until 8 o'Clock, when being\r\nabout 3 Leagues from the Land, and having very little wind, we tack'd and\r\nlay her Head off Shore. At 11 o'Clock we got the Land wind at North by\r\nWest, with which we steer'd South-West by West along shore, keeping about\r\n4 or 5 Miles from the Land on which in the morning we saw several Houses,\r\nPlantations, etc. At 9 o'Clock we got the wind at North-East by East, a\r\nlight breeze; at Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the Land, which\r\nextended as far to the Southward as South-West by West; our Latitude by\r\nobservation was 10 degrees 1 minute South. Course and Distance sail'd\r\nsince Yesterday at Noon South 78 degrees 45 minutes West, 36 Miles.\r\n\r\nSunday, 16th. Light breezes from the North-East by East, with clear\r\nweather, except in the morning, when we had it cloudy, with a few small\r\nShowers of Rain. Steer'd along shore South-West and South-West by West\r\nuntil 6 o'Clock in the morning, when we steer'd West-South-West, and at\r\n9, West, at which time we saw the Island Rotte right ahead. At Noon we\r\nwere in the Latitude of 10 degrees 39 minutes, Longitude 235 degrees 57\r\nminutes; the South end of Timor bore North-North-West, distant 5 or 6\r\nLeagues; the Island of Rotte extending from South 75 degrees West to\r\nNorth 67 degrees West, and the Island of Anaboa as Dampier calls it, or\r\nSeman* (* Semao. This island lies off the Dutch settlement of Koepang or\r\nConcordia in Timor; but Cook was right in supposing he would have\r\nreceived but a cold reception there. The Dutch discouraged any visits at\r\ntheir outlying settlements. Rotte is a large island lying off the\r\nsouth-west end of Timor.) as it is called in the Charts, which lies of\r\nthe South end of Timor, bore North-West. Course and distance sail'd since\r\nYesterday noon South 55 degrees 15 minutes West, 67 Miles. Dampier, who\r\nhas given us a large and, so far as I know, an Accurate discription of\r\nthe Island of Timor, says that it is 70 Leagues long and 16 Broad, and\r\nthat it lies North-East and South-West. I found the East side to lie\r\nnearest North-East by East and South-West by West, and the South end to\r\nlie in the Latitude 10 degrees 23 minutes South, Longitude 236 degrees 5\r\nminutes West from Greenwich. We run about 45 Leagues along the East side,\r\nwhich I observed to be free from Danger, and, excepting near the South\r\nend, the Land which bounds the Sea is low for 2, 3, or 4 Miles inland,\r\nand seem'd in many places to be intersected with Salt Creeks. Behind the\r\nlow land are Mountains, which rise one above another to a considerable\r\nheight. We continually saw upon it smoakes by day and fires by night, and\r\nin many places houses and plantations. I was strongly importuned by some\r\nof my Officers to go to the Dutch settlement at Concordia, on this\r\nIsland, for refreshments; but this I refused to comply with, knowing that\r\nthe Dutch look upon all Europeans with a Jealous Eye that come among\r\nthese Islands, and our necessities were not so great as to oblige me to\r\nput into a place where I might expect to be but indifferently treated.\r\n\r\n[Anchor at Savu.]\r\n\r\nMonday, 17th. Winds Easterly, with which we steer'd West-North-West until\r\n2 o'Clock, when being pretty near the North end of Rotte, we hauled up\r\nNorth-North-West, in order to go between it and Anaboa. After steering 3\r\nLeagues upon this Course we edged away North-West by West, and by 6 we\r\nwere clear of all the Islands; at this time the South part of Anaboa,\r\nwhich lies in the Latitude of 10 degrees 15 minutes South, bore\r\nNorth-East, distant 4 Leagues, and the Island of Rotte extending as far\r\nto the Southward as South 36 degrees West. The North End of this Island\r\nand the South end of Timor lies North 1/2 East and 1/2 West, distant\r\nabout 3 or 4 Leagues from each other. At the West end of the Passage\r\nbetween Rotte and Anaboa are two Small Islands; the one lays near the\r\nRotte shore and the other off the South-West point of Anaboa; there is a\r\ngood Channel between the 2 of 5 or 6 Miles broad, which we came thro'.\r\nBeing now clear of the Islands we steer'd a West course all night until 6\r\na.m., when we unexpectedly saw an Island* (* Savu. An island about twenty\r\nmiles in length. It is but little visited or known by others than the\r\nDutch to this day.) bearing West-South-West, for by most of the Maps we\r\nhad on board we were to the Southward of all the Islands that lay between\r\nTimor and Java; at least there were none laid down so near Timor in this\r\nLatitude by almost one half, which made me at first think it a new\r\ndiscovery; but in this I was mistaken. We now steer'd directly for it,\r\nand by 10 o'Clock were close in with the North side, where we saw Houses,\r\nCocoa Nutt Trees, and a Flock of Cattle grazing; these were Temptations\r\nhardly to be withstood by people in our situation, especially such as\r\nwere but in a very indifferent State of Health, and I may say mind too,\r\nfor in some this last was worse than the other, since I refused to touch\r\nat the Island of Timor, whereupon I thought I could not do less than to\r\ntry to procure some refreshments here, as there appeared to be plenty.*\r\n(* Cook's utter indifference as to what he eat or drank made him regard\r\nprivations in the matter of food with an equanimity which was not shared\r\nby the rest of his companions.) With this View we hoisted out the\r\nPinnace, in which I sent Lieutenant Gore in shore to see if there were\r\nany Convenient place to land, sending some trifles along with him to give\r\nto the Natives in case he saw any. Mr. Gore landed in a small sandy cove\r\nnear to some Houses, and was met on the beach by 8 or 10 of the people,\r\nwho from both their behaviour and what they had about them shew'd that\r\nthey had Commerce with Europeans; upon Mr. Gore's returning with this\r\nreport, and likewise that there was No Anchorage for the Ship, I sent him\r\naway with both money and goods to try to purchase some refreshments,\r\nwhile we keept standing on and off with the Ship. At Noon we were about a\r\nMile from the Shore of the Island, which extends from South-East to\r\nWest-North-West, Latitude 10 degrees 27 minutes, Longitude 237 degrees 31\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 18th. As soon as Mr. Gore landed he was meet on the beach by\r\nseveral people, both Horse and Foot, who gave him to understand that\r\nthere was a Bay to Leeward where we could Anchor, and likewise get\r\nrefreshments. Upon Mr. Gore's return with this intelligence we bore away\r\nfor the Bay, in which we Anchor'd at 7 o'Clock in 38 fathoms Water, Clean\r\nsandy bottom. About a Mile from Shore the North point of the Bay bore\r\nNorth 30 degrees East, 2 1/2 Miles, and the South point or West end of\r\nthe Island bore South 63 degrees West. Two hours before we Anchor'd we\r\nsaw Dutch Colours hoisted in a Village which stands about a Mile inland,\r\nand at day light in the Morning the same Colours were hoisted on the\r\nbeach abreast of the Ship. By this I was no longer in doubt but what here\r\nwas a Dutch settlement, and accordingly sent Lieutenant Gore on shore to\r\nwait upon the Governor, or chief person residing here, to acquaint him\r\nwith the reasons that induced us to touch at this Island. Upon Mr. Gore's\r\nlanding we could perceive that he was received by a Guard of the Natives,\r\nand not Dutch Troops, and Conducted up to the Village where the Colours\r\nwere hoisted last night. Some time after this I received a message from\r\nhim, acquainting me that he was there with the king of the Island, who\r\nhad told him that he could not supply him with anything without leave\r\nfrom the Dutch Governor, who resided at another part of the Island, but\r\nthat he had sent to acquaint him of our Arrival and request.\r\n\r\n[At Anchor. Savu.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 19th. At 2 P.M. the Dutch Governor, and king of this part of\r\nthe Island, with his attendance, came on board with Mr. Gore (he having\r\nleft 2 Gentlemen ashore as Hostages). We entertained them at Dinner in\r\nthe best Manner we could, gave them plenty of good Liquor, made them some\r\nconsiderable presents, and at their going away Saluted them with 9 Guns.\r\nIn return for these favours they made many fair Promises that we should\r\nbe immediately supplied with everything we wanted at the same price the\r\nDutch East India Company had it; and that in the morning Buffaloes, Hogs,\r\nSheep, etc., should be down on the beach for us to look at, and agree\r\nupon a price. I was not at all at a loss for Interpreters, for both Dr.\r\nSolander and Mr. Sporing understood Dutch enough to keep up a\r\nConversation with the Dutchman, and several of the Natives could speak\r\nPortuguese, which language 2 or 3 of my people understood. In the morning\r\nI went on shore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and several of the Officers and\r\nGentlemen, to return the King's Visit; but my Chief Business was to see\r\nhow well they would perform their Promises in regard to the things I\r\nwanted. We had not been long ashore before we found that they had\r\npromised more than they ever intended to perform; for, instead of finding\r\nBuffaloes upon the beach, we did not so much as see one, or the least\r\npreparations making for bringing any down, either by the Dutch Factor or\r\nthe King. The former pretended he had been very ill all night, and told\r\nus that he had had a letter from the Governor of Concordia in Timor,\r\nacquainting him that a ship (meaning us) had lately passed that Island,\r\nand that if she should touch at this, and be in want of anything, he was\r\nto supply her; but he was not to suffer her to make any stay, nor to\r\ndistribute, or leave behind her to be distributed, any valuable presents\r\nto the inferior Natives. This we looked upon to be Afection that hardly\r\nanswer'd any purpose, unless it was leting us see how the Dutch had\r\ninsinuated themselves into favour with these people, which never could be\r\nhis intention. However, both he and the King still promised we should\r\nhave what we wanted, but pretended the Buffaloes were far in the Country,\r\nand could not be brought down before night. With these excuses we were\r\nobliged to be satisfied. The King gave us a dinner of boil'd Pork and\r\nRice, served up in Baskets after their manner, and Palm wine to drink;\r\nwith this, and some of our own Liquor, we fair'd Tolerable well. After we\r\nhad dined our Servants were called in to pertake of what remain'd, which\r\nwas more than they could Eat.\r\n\r\nThursday, 20th. We stay'd at the King's Pallace all the Afternoon, and at\r\nlast were obliged to return on board without doing anything farther than\r\na promise of having some Buffaloes in the morning; which we had now no\r\ngreat reason to rely on. In the morning I went on shore again, and was\r\nshowed one small Buffaloe, which they asked 5 Guineas for. I offer'd 3,\r\nwhich the man told me he would gladly take, and sent a Message to the\r\nking to let him know what I had offer'd. The Messenger soon return'd, and\r\nlet me know that I could not have it under 5 Guineas; and this I refused\r\nto give, knowing it was not worth one fifth part of the money. But this,\r\nmy refusal, had like to have overset all we had before done, for soon\r\nafter about 100 Men, some Arm'd with Musquets, others with Lances, came\r\ndown to the Landing Place. Besides the officer that commanded this party,\r\nthere came along with them a Man who spoke Portuguese, and I believe was\r\nborn of Portuguese Parents. This man is here (as we afterwards\r\nUnderstood) as an Assistant to the Dutch Factor. He deliver'd to me the\r\nKing's order, or rather those of the Dutch Factor, the purport of which\r\nwas that we were to stay no longer than this day, pretending that the\r\npeople would not trade with us because we wanted their provisions for\r\nnothing, etc.; whereas the Natives shew'd the greatest inclination\r\nimaginable to supply us with whatever they had, and were far more\r\ndesirous of goods than money, and were, before this man came, selling us\r\nFowls and Syrup as fast as they could bring these things down. From this\r\nand other Circumstances we were well Assured that this was all the\r\nDutchman's doing, in order to extort from us a sum of Money to put into\r\nhis own pocket. There hapned to be an old Raja at this time upon the\r\nbeach, whose Interest I had secured in the Morning by presenting him with\r\na Spy-glass; this man I now took by the hand, and presented him with an\r\nold broad sword. This effectually secured him in our Interest, for the\r\nMoment he got it he began to flourish it over the old Portuguese, and\r\nmade him and the Officer commanded the party to sit down at his back\r\nside. Immediately after this trade was restored again for Fowls, etc.,\r\nwith more Spirit than ever; but before I could begin a Trade for\r\nBuffaloes, which was what we most wanted, I was obliged to give 10\r\nGuineas for 2, one of which weigh'd only 160 pounds. After this I bought\r\n7 more at a more reasonable price, one of which we lost after he was paid\r\nfor. I might now have purchased as many as I pleased, for they now drove\r\nthem down to the Water side by Herds; but having got as many as I well\r\nknow'd what to do with, and likewise a number of Fowls, and a large\r\nquantity of Syrup, I resolved to make no longer stay.\r\n\r\nFriday, 21st. We got under sail, and stood away to the Westward along the\r\nNorth side of the Island, and another smaller Island, which lies farther\r\nto the Westward, which last bore from us at Noon South-South-East,\r\ndistant 2 Leagues.\r\n\r\n[Description of Savu.]\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed any further it will be proper in this place to say\r\nsomething of the Island we have been last at, which is called by the\r\nNatives Savu. The Middle of it lies in about the Latitude of 10 degrees\r\n35 minutes South, Longitude 237 degrees 30 minutes West. It may be about\r\n8 Leagues in length from East to West, but of what breadth I know not,\r\nbecause I only saw the North side. There are, as I am told, 3 Bays where\r\nShips can Anchor; the best is on the South-West side of the South-East\r\npoint; the one we lay in, called Seba, lies on the North-West side of the\r\nIsland. This bay is very well sheltered from the South-East Trade wind,\r\nbut lays wholy open to the North-West. The Land of this Island which\r\nbounds the Sea is, in general, low, but in the Middle of the Island are\r\nHills of a moderate height, and the whole is agreeably diversified with\r\nwoods and Lawns, which afford a most pleasing prospect from the Sea. We\r\nwere told that the Island is but indifferently water'd in the dry Season,\r\nespecially towards the latter end of it, at which time there is no\r\nrunning Stream upon the whole Island, only small Springs, which are all\r\nat a distance from the Sea side. The dry seasons commences in March or\r\nApril, and ends in November; the remaining 3 or 4 Months they have\r\nWesterly winds with rain, and this the time their Crops of Rice,\r\nCalivances, and Indian Corn are brought forth, which are Articles that\r\nthis Island produceth.\r\n\r\nThey also breed a great Number of Cattle, viz., Buffaloes, Horses, Hogs,\r\nSheep, and Goats. Many of the former are sent to Concordia, where they\r\nare kill'd and salted, in order to be sent to the more Northern Islands,\r\nwhich are under the Dominion of the Dutch. Sheep and Goats' flesh is\r\ndried upon this Island, packed up in Bales, and sent to Concordia for the\r\nsame purpose. The Dutch resident, from whom we had this information, told\r\nus that the Dutch at Concordia had lately behaved so ill to the Natives\r\nof Timor that they were obliged to have recourse to this Island and\r\nothers Adjacent for provisions for their own subsistance, and likewise\r\nTroops (Natives of this Island) to assist the Dutch against those of\r\nTimor. Besides the above productions, here are an Emmence Number of Palm\r\nTrees, from which is extracted the Palm Wine, as it is called, a very\r\nsweet, agreeable, cooling Liquor. What they do not immediately use they\r\nboil down and make Syrup or Sugar of, which they keep in Earthen Jarrs.\r\nHere are likewise Cocoa Nutts, Tamerind Trees, Limes etc., but in no\r\ngreat plenty; Indico, Cotton, and Cinnamon, sufficient to serve the\r\nNatives; these last Articles, we were told, the Dutch discourage the\r\ngrowth of.\r\n\r\nThe Island is divided into 5 Kingdoms, which have lived in Peace and\r\nAmity with each other for these hundred Years. At present the whole\r\nIsland is partly under the direction of the Dutch East India Company, who\r\nhave a Resident or Factor who constantly lives here, without whose leave\r\nthe Natives are not to supply any other Nation with anything whatever;\r\nbut the whole produce of the Island, besides what serves themselves, is\r\nin a manner the property of the Company. The Company by way of a Tribute\r\noblige them to raise and pay Annually a certain quantity of Rice, Indian\r\nCorn, and Callivances, for which the Company makes Each of the Kings a\r\nyearly present of a Cask of Arrack, and some other Trifles; the live\r\nstock, Sheep and Goats' flesh, etc., they pay for in goods. The small\r\nIslands which lie about a League to the Westward of this pays Annually a\r\nCertain quantity of Arica Nutts, which is almost the only produce of that\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Rotte is upon the same footing as this of Savu; both these\r\nIslands, and the 3 Solors, belong to the Government of Concordia. From\r\nwhat we could learn of the Island of Timor, it seems to be much upon the\r\nsame footing as it was in Dampier's time, which is that the Dutch possess\r\nlittle more of that Island than what lies under the Command of the Fort\r\nConcordia; the rest is in possession either of the Native Indians or the\r\nPortuguese. We were likewise told that the Island of Ende belongs to the\r\nPortuguese; that the principal settlement is at Larentucha, where there\r\nis a Fort and a good Harbour. We were told that the Concordia, on the\r\nIsland Timor, is a free Port for Ships of any nation to touch at, where\r\nthey would not only be supplied with refreshments, but Naval Stores also.\r\nTrading ships might probably meet with a good reception, but Kings'\r\nships, I am perswaided, would be looked upon as Spys. For my own part was\r\nI only in want of refreshments, and obliged to touch at any of these\r\nIslands, I should prefer going to a Portuguese settlement before any of\r\nthe Dutch, and when I was solicited by the Officers to call at Timor, I\r\nproposed going to one of the Portuguese settlements; but this Mr. Hicks\r\nmade some Objections to, which was sufficient for me to lay it aside, as\r\nI had not the least inclination to touch any where till we arriv'd at\r\nBatavia, for my falling in with Savu was more chance and not design.\r\n\r\nBut to return to this Island, the Natives of which are of a Dark brown\r\nColour, with long lank Hair; their Cloathing is a peice of Calicoe or\r\nother Cotton Cloath wrapped about their Middle; the better sort have\r\nanother peice, which they wear over their Shoulders, and the most of them\r\nwear Turbands or Handkercheifs tyed round their Heads. They Eat of all\r\nthe Tame Animals they have got, viz., Hogs, Horses, Buffaloes, Cocks and\r\nHens, Dogs, Catts, Sheep and Goats, and are esteem'd much in the same\r\norder, as I have mentioned; that is, their Hog flesh, which is certainly\r\nas good as any in the world, they prefer before anything else; next to\r\nHogs, Horses, and so on. Fish is not esteem'd by them, and is only eat by\r\nthe common or poor people, who are allowed little else of meat kind.\r\n\r\nThey have a Custom among them, that whenever a king dies all the Cattle,\r\netc., that are upon his Estate are kill'd, with which the Successor makes\r\na feast, to which is invited all the principal people of the Island, who\r\nstay until all is consumed; after this they every one, according to his\r\nAbilities, make the young King a present, by which means he gets a fresh\r\nstock, which he is obliged to Husband for some time. The other principal\r\nmen make also feasts, which are as extraordinary as these, for they\r\nseldom end so long as the giver has got anything left alive upon his\r\nEstate. They are said to be a people of good Morals, Virtuous and Chaste,\r\neach man having only one wife, which he keeps for life; Fornication and\r\nAdultry is hardly known among them. When a great Man marrys he makes\r\npresents to all his Wife's relations of European and other Foreign\r\ncommodities to the value of 100 Rix Dollars. This Custom the Dutch East\r\nIndia Company find it to their Interest to incourage. They speak a\r\nLanguage peculiar to themselves, into which the Dutch have caus'd the new\r\nTestament to be Translated, and have introduced it, with the use of\r\nletters and writing, among them. By this means several hundred of them\r\nhave been converted to Christianity; the rest are some heathens, and\r\nothers of no religion at all, and yet they all stick up to the strict\r\nrules of Morality. They all, both Men and Women, Young and Old, Chew of\r\nthe Beetle Leaf, Areca Nutts, and a sort of white lime, which I believe\r\nis made from Coral stone; this has such an effect upon the Teeth that\r\nvery few, even of the Young people, have hardly any left in their Heads,\r\nand those they have are as black as Ink. Their houses are built on posts\r\nabout 4 feet from the Ground; we asked the reason why they built them so,\r\nand was told that it was only Custom; they are, however, certainly the\r\nCooler for it. They are thatched with Palm Leaves, and the Floors and\r\nsides are boarded.\r\n\r\nThe man who resides upon this Island in behalf of the Dutch East India\r\nCompany is a German by birth. His name is Johan Christopher Lange. It is\r\nhard to say upon what footing he is here. He is so far a Governor that\r\nthe Natives dare do nothing without his consent, and yet he can transact\r\nno sort of business with Foreigners either in his own or that of the\r\nCompany's name; nor can it be a place of either Honour or Profit. He is\r\nthe only white man upon the Island, and has resided there ever since it\r\nhas been under the direction of the Dutch, which is about 10 Years. He is\r\nallowed 50 Slaves (Natives of the Island) to attend upon him. These\r\nbelong to, and are Maintained by, the Company. He goes the Circuit of the\r\nIsland once in 2 Months; but on what account he did not tell us. When he\r\nmakes these rounds he carries with him a certain quantity of Spirit to\r\ntreat the great men with, which, he says, he is obliged to look well\r\nafter, otherwise they would steal it and get drunk; and yet, at another\r\ntime, he told us that he never knew a theft committed in the Island; but\r\nsome of the Natives themselves contradicted him in this by stealing from\r\nus an Axe. However, from their behaviour to us in general I am of opinion\r\nthat they are but seldom guilty of these Crimes. This going round the\r\nIsland once in Two Months is most likely to see that the Natives make the\r\nnecessary preparations for fulfilling their engagements with the Dutch,\r\nand to see that the Large Boats or small Vessels are taken proper care\r\nof, which the Dutch keep in all the Bays of this Island in order to\r\ncollect and carry the grain, etc., to the Ship which comes Annually here.\r\nThey are likewise employed in carrying cattle, grain, etc., to Timor;\r\nand, when not wanted, they are hauled aShore into Houses or Sheds built\r\non purpose. As I have mentioned Slaves, it is necessary to observe that\r\nall the great men have Slaves which are the Natives of the Island. They\r\ncan dispose of them one to another, but cannot sell them to go out of the\r\nIsland. The price of a Slave is a good, large, fatt Hogg, Horse, etc. I\r\nhave before mentioned that many of the people can speak Portuguese, but\r\nhardly any one Dutch. From this it is probable that this Island was\r\nformerly under the Jurisdiction of the Portuguese, tho' the Dutch\r\nGovernment never own'd as much, but said that the Dutch had Traded here\r\nthese hundred years past.* (* This account of the economy of Savu is a\r\ngood example of Cook's powers of observation. He was only four days at\r\nthe island, and yet gives us a good idea of the place and its\r\ninhabitants.)\r\n\r\n[Sail from Savu.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 22nd. Winds at South-South-East, South-East, and East; a gentle\r\nbreeze, which we steer'd West-South-West by Compass. At 4 o'Clock we\r\ndiscover'd a small low Island* (* Dama Island.) bearing South-South-West,\r\ndistant 3 Leagues. The Island hath no place in any of our Charts:\r\nLatitude 10 degrees 47 minutes South, Longitude 238 degrees 28 minutes\r\nWest. At Noon we were in the Latitude of 11 degrees 9 minutes South,\r\nLongitude 239 degrees 26 minutes West. Course and distance sail'd since\r\nyesterday noon, South 63 West, 67 miles.\r\n\r\nSunday, 23rd. Winds Easterly; a moderate breeze, which by noon brought us\r\ninto the Latitude of 11 degrees 10 minutes South, Longitude 240 degrees\r\n48 minutes West. Course and distance saild since yesterday at noon is\r\nWest, 8 miles.\r\n\r\nMonday, 24th. Winds at East and South-East; a moderate breeze, and fine,\r\npleasant weather. In the evening found the Variation to be 2 degrees 44\r\nminutes West. At noon our Latitude was 11 degrees 8 minutes South,\r\nLongitude 242 degrees 13 minutes West. Since we have been clear of the\r\nIslands we have had constantly a swell from the Southward which I do not\r\nsuppose is owing to the winds blowing anywhere from thence, but to the\r\nSea, being so determined by the portion of the Coast of New Holland.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 25th. Moderate breezes at South-East, and clear, pleasant\r\nweather. At Noon our Latitude was 11 degrees 13 minutes South, and\r\nLongitude 244 degrees 41\" West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 26th. Winds and weather as yesterday. At Noon Latitude in 11\r\ndegrees 10 minutes, Longitude 245 degrees 41\" West.\r\n\r\nThursday 27th. Winds at South-South-East; a fresh breeze. In the evening\r\nfound the variation to be 3 degrees 10 minutes West. At noon we were in\r\nthe Longitude of 247 degrees 42 minutes West, and Latitude 10 degrees 47\r\nminutes, which is 25 Miles to the Northward of the Log, which I know not\r\nhow to account for.\r\n\r\nFriday 28th. Winds at South-South-East and South-East; a fresh breeze and\r\nCloudy, with some Showers of rain. At Noon Latitude observed 10 degrees\r\n51 minutes South, which is agreeable to the Logg, Longitude in 250\r\ndegrees 9 minutes, West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 29th. Moderate breeze at South-East and clear pleasant weather,\r\nSteer'd North-West all this day, in order to make the land of Java. At\r\nNoon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 9 degrees 31 minutes South\r\nand Longitude 251 degrees 40 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 30th. Fresh gales and fair weather. In the A.M. I took into my\r\npossession the Officers', Petty Officers' and Seamen's Log Books and\r\nJournals, at least all that I could find, and enjoin'd every one not to\r\ndivulge where they had been.* (* These logs are now in the Public Record\r\nOffice. Mr. Green's log ends on the 2nd October. Not being an officer,\r\nCook doubtless overlooked it at first. This log should by rights have\r\nbeen returned to Mr. Green, but as he died shortly after leaving Batavia,\r\nit has found its way, with the others, to the Record Office.) At noon our\r\nCourse and distance sail'd since Yesterday at noon, is North 20 degrees\r\nWest, 126 Miles, which brought us into the Latitude of 7 degrees 34\r\nminutes South and Longitude 252 degrees 23 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[October 1770. Enter Sunda Strait. ]\r\n\r\nMonday, 1st October. First and latter parts fresh breezes at South-East\r\nand fair weather; the Middle squally with Lightning and rain. At 7 p.m.,\r\nbeing then in the Latitude of Java head, and not seeing any land, assured\r\nus that we had got too far to the Westward; upon which we hauld up\r\nEast-North-East, having before Steerd North by East. At 12 o'Clock saw\r\nthe Land bearing East, Tack'd, and stood to the South-West until 4, then\r\nstood again to the Eastward, having very unsettled squally weather which\r\nsplit the Main Topsail very much, and obliged us to bend the other; many\r\nof our Sails are now so bad that they will hardly stand the least puff of\r\nWind. At 6 o'Clock Java head, on the West end of Java, bore South-East by\r\nEast, distant 5 Leagues; soon after this saw Princes Island, bearing East\r\n1/2 South. At 10 o'Clock saw the Island of Cracatoa* (* The great\r\neruption, and consequent destruction of the larger part of this island in\r\n1883, will be remembered. It lies in the centre of Sunda Strait.) bearing\r\nNorth-East, distant 7 Leagues; Princes Island extending from South 53\r\ndegrees East to South by West, distant 3 Leagues. Course and distance\r\nsaild since Yesterday at Noon is North 24 degrees 30 minutes East, 70\r\nMiles. Latitude in per Observation, 6 degrees 29 minutes South, Longitude\r\n251 degrees 54 minutes; but either our Longitude must be erroneous or the\r\nStraits of Sunda must be faltily laid down in all Books and Charts; but\r\nthis no doubt we shall have an opportunity to settle.* (* Cook's\r\nlongitude was in error nearly three degrees. No lunars had been taken\r\nsince they left Savu, and there is a current running westward. It is a\r\ngood example of the error of dead reckoning, even with the most careful\r\nof navigators.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 2nd. In the P.M., had the wind at South-South-East, South-East\r\nby South and South-South-East, with which we stood to the Eastward close\r\nupon a wind. At 6 o'Clock the Hill on Princes Island bore South-West by\r\nSouth, and Cracatoa Island, North 10 Miles; in this situation had 58\r\nfathoms, standing still to the Eastward. At 8 o'Clock had 52 fathoms,\r\nmuddy bottom, at 10 23 fathoms. By 4 in the morning we fetched close in\r\nwith the Java shore in 15 fathoms, then steer'd along shore. At 5 it fell\r\nCalm, which continued with some Variable light Airs until noon, at which\r\ntime Anger Point bore North-East, distant 1 League, and Thwart-the-way\r\nIsland North. In the morning I sent a Boat ashore to try to get some\r\nfruits for Tupia, who is very ill, and, likewise, to get some grass,\r\netc., for the Buffaloes we have still left. The Boats return'd with only\r\n4 Cocoa Nutts, a small bunch of Plantains, which they purchased of the\r\nNatives for a Shilling, and a few Shrubs for the Cattle.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 3rd. Soon after 12 o'Clock it fell quite Calm, which obliged\r\nus to Anchor in 18 fathoms, Muddy bottom, about 2 Miles from shore, where\r\nwe found a strong Current setting to the South-West. Not long before we\r\nAnchor'd we saw a Dutch Ship laying off Anger Point, on board which I\r\nsent Mr. Hicks to enquire after News.* (* It will be recollected that the\r\nEndeavour was now two years and two months from England, without the\r\nslightest chance of any news from home. We can imagine the anxiety and\r\nexcitement on board on thus approaching civilisation, though they had no\r\nprospect of personal letters. With the frequent communication of modern\r\ntimes, we can scarcely realise such circumstances, and should certainly\r\nconsider them as an exceeding hardship.) Upon his return he inform'd me\r\nthat there were 2 Dutch Ships from Batavia, one bound for Ceylon, and the\r\nother to the Coast of Mallabar, besides a small Fly-boat or Packet, which\r\nis stationed here to carry all Packets, Letters, etc., from all Dutch\r\nShips to Batavia; but it seems more Probable that she is stationed here\r\nto examine all Ships that pass and repass these Straits. We now first\r\nheard the agreeable news of His Majesty's Sloop The Swallow being at\r\nBatavia about 2 Years ago.* (* The Swallow, Captain Cartaret, had sailed\r\nwith the Dolphin in 1766, but separated from her on emerging from the\r\nStrait of Magellan. The Dolphin had reached England some months before\r\nCook sailed, but nothing had been heard of the Swallow, and fears were\r\nentertained of her loss.) At 7 o'Clock a breeze sprung up at\r\nSouth-South-West, with which we weighed and stood to the North-East\r\nbetween Thwart-the-way Island and the Cap:* (* Thwart-the-Way is an\r\nisland that lies right across the fairway of Sunda Strait. The Cap is\r\nanother smaller island that lies North-East of it.) soundings from 18 to\r\n26 fathoms. We had but little Wind all night, and having a Strong Current\r\nagainst us, we got no further by 8 o'Clock in the morning than under\r\nBantam Point. At this time the wind came to North-East, and obliged us to\r\nAnchor in 22 fathoms about 2 Miles from the Shore. The above point bore\r\nNorth-East by East, distant 1 League. Here we found a strong Current\r\nsetting to the North-West. In the morning we saw the Dutch packet\r\nstanding after us, but after the wind Shifted to the North-East she bore\r\naway. One of the Dutch Captains told Mr. Hicks yesterday that the Current\r\nsets constantly to the South-Westward, and that it would continue to set\r\nso for a Month or Six Weeks longer.\r\n\r\n[In Sunda Strait.]\r\n\r\nThursday, 4th. In the P.M. had the wind at North-East by North, which\r\nobliged us to lay fast. About 6 o'Clock in the evening one of the Country\r\nBoats came alongside in which was the Commander of the Packet before\r\nmentioned; he seem'd to have 2 Motives for coming, one to take an account\r\nof the Ship, and the other to sell us refreshments, for in the Boat were\r\nTurtle, Fowls, Birds, etc., all of which they held at a pretty high\r\nPrice, and had brought to a bad market, as our Savu stock was not all\r\nexpended. I gave a Spanish Dollar for a small Turtle which weighed only\r\n36 pounds. With respect to the Ship, he wanted to know her name, the\r\nCaptain's, the place we came last from and were bound, as I would not see\r\nhim myself. I order'd that no account should be given him from whence we\r\ncame; but Mr. Hicks, who wrote the Ship's name down in his book, put down\r\nfrom Europe. Seeing this he expressed some surprise, and said that we\r\nmight write down what we pleased, for it was of no other use than for the\r\ninformation of such of our Country men as might pass these Streights. At\r\n7 o'Clock a light breeze sprung up at South-South-East, with which we got\r\nunder sail. At 1 A.M. Anchor'd again, having not wind to stem the Current\r\nwhich we found to run 3 Knotts; at 2 o'Clock we weighed again, but,\r\nfinding that we lost ground, we were obliged to Anchor in 18 fathoms, the\r\nIsland Pulo Morack, which lies close under the Shore 3 Miles to the\r\nWestward of Bantam Point: bore South-East by South, distance 1 1/2 miles.\r\nLatitude observed, 5 degrees 55 minutes South.\r\n\r\nFriday, 5th. At 5 in the P.M. we weighed with a light breeze at\r\nSouth-West by South, which continued not long before it fell Calm, and\r\nobliged us to Anchor again. At 1 o'Clock we weigh'd with the Land wind at\r\nSouth-South-East, which died away in the Morning, and the Current running\r\nstrong against us we Anchor'd in 17 fathoms. A little before this, a Proe\r\ncame alongside, wherein was a Dutch Officer who came upon the same\r\nbusiness as the other. He sent me down a printed paper in English\r\ncontaining 9 Articles or Questions, of which this is a Copy.\r\n\r\n\"The Commanders and Officers of the Ships where this Paper may be\r\npresented, will be pleased to answer on the following Questions: viz.,\r\n1. \"To what Nation the Ship belongs, and its Name.\r\n2. \"If it comes from Europe or any other place.\r\n3. \"From what place it lastly departed from.\r\n4. \"Where unto design'd to go.\r\n5. \"What, and how many, ships of the Dutch Company by departure from the\r\nlast shore there lay'd, and their names.\r\n6. \"If one or more of these ships in Company with this is departed for\r\nthis or any other place.\r\n7. \"If during the Voyage any particularity is hapned or seen.\r\n8. \"If not any ships in Sea, or the Streights of Sunda have seen or\r\nHail'd in, and which.\r\n9. \"If any other News worth Attention at the place from whence the Ship\r\nlastly departed or during the vogage is hapned.\r\n\r\n\"Batavia in the Castle,\r\nthe\r\nBy Order of the Governor\r\nGeneral and the Counselors of India.\r\n\r\n\"J. BRANDER BUNGL, Sect.\"\r\n\r\nThe first and fourth of these Questions I only answer'd, which when the\r\nOfficer saw, he made use of the very same words the other had done\r\nbefore, viz.: that we might write what we pleased, for it was of no\r\nconsequence, etc., and yet he immediately said that he must send that\r\nvery paper away to Batavia by water, and that it would be there by\r\nto-morrow noon, which shows that the Governor and Counselors of India\r\nlook upon such papers to be of some consequence. Be this as it may, my\r\nreason for taking notice of it in this Journal, is because I am well\r\ninform'd that it is but of very late years that the Dutch have taken upon\r\nthem to examine all Ships that pass these Streights. At 10 o'Clock we\r\nweigh'd with a light breeze at South-West, but did little more than stem\r\nthe Current. At Noon, Bantam Point* (* Bantam Point, now called St.\r\nNicholas Point, is the north-west point of Java, and forms the\r\nnorth-eastern extreme of Sunda Strait.) and Pula Baba, in one bearing\r\nEast by North, distant from the Point 1 1/2 Mile. Latitude observed, 5\r\ndegrees 53 minutes South.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 6th. At 2 o'Clock P.M., finding we could not stem the Current,\r\nwe anchor'd, with the Kedge Anchor, under Bantam Point, where we lay\r\nuntil 9, at which time Current made Slowly to the Eastward, and at the\r\nsame time a light breeze springing up, we weigh'd and stood to the East\r\nuntil 10 o'Clock in the A.M., when the Current oblig'd us again to Anchor\r\nin 22 fathoms, Pula Baba bearing East by South 1/2 South, distant 3 or 4\r\nMiles. Our sounding from Bantam Point to this place was from 36 to 22\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nSunday 7th. Light Air from the Southward with frequent Calms. At 6\r\no'Clock P.M., weighed with a light breeze at South-South-West, which was\r\nnot sufficient to stem the current, and was therefore obliged to come too\r\nagain, in 15 fathoms. At 10 o'Clock weighed again and stood to the\r\nEastward with the Wind at South-South-East. At 11 A.M., Anchor'd in 21\r\nfathoms, the West end of Wapping Island bore South, distant 3 Miles, and\r\nthe Thousand Islands North by East 1/2 East, distant 3 or 4 Miles. Found\r\nthe Current still set to the Westward.\r\n\r\nMonday, 8th. Had it Calm until 4 in the P.M., when we got the Sea breeze\r\nat North-East very faint, with which we weighed and stood to the\r\nEastward, past Wapping Island, and the first Island to the Eastward of\r\nit. Falling little wind we were carried by the Current between this last\r\nIsland and the 2nd Island, to the Eastward of Wapping Island, where we\r\nwere obliged to Anchor in 30 fathoms, being very near a ledge of Rocks\r\nwhich spitted out from one of the Islands. At 1/2 past 2 o'Clock in the\r\nA.M., weighed with the land wind at South and stood out clear of the\r\nshoal, where we were again obliged to come to an Anchor, having Variable\r\nlight winds attended with Thunder and rain. At 5 o'Clock the weather\r\nbeing fair, and a light breeze at South, we weighed, but making little or\r\nno way against the Current, we soon came too again, in 28 fathoms, near a\r\nsmall Island not laid down in the Charts; Pulo Pare* (* Wapping Island is\r\nnow known as Hoorn, and Pulo Pare as Agenietan Islands. They lie, among\r\nmany others, to the north-west of Batavia Roads.) bore East-North-East,\r\ndistant 6 or 7 Miles. While we lay here a Proe came alongside, where in\r\nwere 2 Malays, who sold us 3 Turtles, weighing 147 pounds, for a Spanish\r\nDollar. Some on board thought them dear, but I thought they were cheap,\r\nfounding my Judgment on the price the two Dutchmen that were on board\r\nbefore set upon those they had, one of which we paid a Dollar for, that\r\nweighed only 36 pounds.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 9th. A little past Noon weigh'd with a light breeze at\r\nNorth-East, and stood to the Eastward until 5 o'Clock, when, not being\r\nable to weather Pulo Pare, we Anchor'd in 30 fathoms, the said Island\r\nextending from South-East to South-South-West, distant 1 Mile. At 10 got\r\nthe land wind at South, with which we weighed and stood to the\r\nEast-South-East all night; depth of water, from 30 to 22 fathoms, and\r\nfrom 22 to 16 fathoms. When we Anchor'd at 10 o'Clock in the A.M. to wait\r\nfor the Sea breeze, the Island of Edam bore South-West by West, distant 6\r\nor 7 Miles. At Noon we weighed and stood in for Batavia Road, having the\r\nadvantage of the Sea breeze at North-North-East.\r\n\r\n[Arrival at Batavia.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 10th, according to our reckoning, but by the people here\r\nThursday, 11th. At 4 o'Clock in the P.M. Anchor'd in Batavia road, where\r\nwe found the Harcourt Indiaman from England, 2 English Country Ships,* (*\r\nA country ship is a vessel under the English flag, but belonging to a\r\nport in English possessions abroad.) 13 Sail of large Dutch Ships, and a\r\nnumber of small Vessels. As soon as we Anchor'd* (* The Endeavour took\r\nnine days, and had to anchor fifteen times, in getting from Java Head, at\r\nthe entrance of Sunda Strait, to Batavia, a distance of 120 miles.) I\r\nsent Lieutenant Hicks a shore to acquaint the Governor of our Arrival,\r\nand to make an excuse for not Saluting; as we could only do it with 3\r\nGuns I thought it was better let alone.\r\n\r\n[At Batavia.]\r\n\r\nThe Carpenter now deliver'd me in the defects of the ship, of which the\r\nfollowing is a copy:--\r\n\r\n\"The Defects of His Majesty's Bark Endeavour, Lieutenant James Cook,\r\nCommander.\r\n\r\n\"The Ship very leaky (as she makes from 12 to 6 Inches water per hour),\r\noccasioned by her Main Kiel being wounded in many places and the Scarfe\r\nof her Stem being very open. The false Kiel gone beyond the Midships\r\n(from Forward and perhaps further), as I had no opportunity of seeing for\r\nthe water when hauld ashore for repair. Wounded on her Starboard side\r\nunder the Main Chains, where I immagine is the greatest leakes (but could\r\nnot come at it for the water). One pump on the Starboard side useless,\r\nthe others decayed within 1 1/2 Inch of the bore, otherwise Masts, Yards,\r\nBoats, and Hull in pretty good condition.\r\n\r\n\"Dated in Batavia Road,\r\n\r\n\"this 10th of October, 1770.\r\n\r\n\"J. SATTERLY.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to the above, I had consulted with the Carpenter and all the\r\nother Officers concerning the Leake, and they were all unanimously of\r\nOpinion that it was not safe to proceed to Europe without first seeing\r\nher bottom; accordingly I resolved to apply for leave to heave her down\r\nat this place, and, as I understood that this was to be done in writing,\r\nI drew up the following request to be presented to the Governor, etc.,\r\netc.:--\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant James Cook, commander of His Brittannick Majesty's Bark\r\nEndeavour, Requests of the Right Hon'ble Petrus Albertus Van der Parra,\r\nGovernor-General, etc., etc., etc., the Indulgence of the following\r\nArticles, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"Firstly, That he may be allow'd a proper and convenient place to heave\r\ndown and repair His Brittannick Majesty's Ship under his command.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, That he may have leave to purchase such few Trifling Naval\r\nstores as he may be in want of.\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, That he may be permitted daily to purchase such provisions as\r\nhe may want; also such an Additional quantity as may enable him to\r\nproceed on his passage home to England.\r\n\r\n\"Dated on board His Brittannick Majesty's\r\nBark Endeavour, in Batavia Road, the 11th\r\nOctober, 1770.\r\n\r\n\"JAMES COOK.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning I went on shore myself and had the foregoing request\r\nTranslated into Dutch by a Scotch Gentleman, a Merchant here.\r\n\r\nFriday, 12th. At 5 o'clock P.M. I was introduced to the Governor-General,\r\nwho received me very politely and told me that I should have every thing\r\nI wanted, and that in the Morning my request should be laid before the\r\nCouncil where I was desir'd to attend.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o'clock in the Evening we had much rain, with some very heavy\r\nClaps of Thunder, one of which carried away a Dutch Indiaman's Main Mast\r\nby the Deck, and split it, the Maintopmast and Topgallantmast all to\r\nshivers. She had had an Iron Spindle at the Maintopgallant Mast head\r\nwhich had first attracted the Lightning. The ship lay about 2 Cable\r\nlengths from us, and we were struck with the Thunder at the same time,\r\nand in all probability we should have shared the same fate as the\r\nDutchman, had it not been for the Electrical Chain which we had but just\r\nbefore got up; this carried the Lightning or Electrical matter over the\r\nside clear of the Ship. The Shock was so great as to shake the whole ship\r\nvery sencibly. This instance alone is sufficient to recommend these\r\nChains to all Ships whatever, and that of the Dutchman ought to Caution\r\npeople from having Iron Spindles at their Mast heads.* (* No instance is\r\nknown of ships fitted with properly constructed lightning conductors\r\nhaving received any damage.)\r\n\r\n[At Batavia.]\r\n\r\nIn the morning I went on shore to the Council Chamber and laid my request\r\nbefore the Governour and Council, who gave me for answer that I should\r\nhave every thing I wanted.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 13th. Received on board a Cask of Arrack and some Greens for\r\nthe Ship's Company.\r\n\r\nSunday, 14th. Early this morning a ship sail'd from hence for Holland by\r\nwhich I had just time to write 2 or 3 lines to Mr. Stephens, Secretary of\r\nthe Admiralty, to acquaint him of our Arrival, after which I went on\r\nshore and waited upon the Shabander, who has the direction of the Town,\r\nPort, etc., to get an order to the Superintendent at Onrust to receive us\r\nat that Island, but this, I was told, would not be ready before Tuesday\r\nnext. Received from the Shore Fresh Beef and Greens for the Ship's\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nMonday, 15th. Fresh Sea and land breezes and fair weather. I had forgot\r\nto mention, that upon our arrival here I had not one man upon the Sick\r\nList; Lieut. Hicks, Mr. Green, and Tupia were the only people that had\r\nany complaints occasioned by a long continuance at Sea.* (* This was an\r\nachievement indeed, and Cook records it in this simple observation. Of\r\nthe many ships which had arrived at Batavia after voyages across the\r\nPacific, none but had come to an anchor with crews decimated and\r\nenfeebled through scurvy. Hawksworth mentions, probably on the authority\r\nof Banks, that when passing Torres Straits there were several incipient\r\ncases of this disease in the Endeavour. The fresh provisions obtained at\r\nSavu probably dissipated these symptoms, if they were symptoms; but Mr.\r\nPerry, the surgeon, in his report, given in the Introduction, distinctly\r\nstates that there were no cases after leaving Tahiti.)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 16th. Finding, by a strict inquiry, that there were no private\r\nperson or persons in the place that could at this time advance me a\r\nsufficient sum of money to defray the charge I might be at in repairing\r\nand refitting the Ship--at least, if there were any, they would be afraid\r\nto do it without leave from the Governor--wherefore I had nothing left\r\nbut to apply to the Governor himself, and accordingly drew up the\r\nfollowing request, which I laid before the Governor and Council this\r\nmorning, in consequence of which the Shebander had orders to supply me\r\nwith what money I wanted out of the Company's Treasure:--\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant James Cook, Commander of His Brittannick Majesty's Bark the\r\nEndeavour, begs leave to represent to His Excellency the Right Honourable\r\nPetrus Albertus Van der Parra, Governor-General, etc., etc., That he will\r\nbe in want of a Sum or Sums of Money in order to defray the Charge he\r\nwill be at in repairing and refiting His Brittannick Majesty's Ship at\r\nthis place; which sum or sums of money he is directed by his\r\nInstructions, and empower'd by his commission, to give Bills of Exchange\r\non the respective Offices which Superintend His Brittannick Majesty's\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\n\"The said Lieutenant James Cook Requests of His Excellency, That he will\r\nbe pleased to order him to be supply'd with such sum or sums of money,\r\neither out of the Company's Treasure, or permit such private persons to\r\ndo it as may be willing to advance money for Bills of Exchange on the\r\nHonourable and Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Brittannick\r\nMajesty's Navy, the Commissioners for Victualling His Majesty's Navy, and\r\nthe Commissioners for taking care of the Sick and Hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Dated on board His Brittannick Majesty's\r\nBark the Endeavour, in Batavia Road,\r\nthe 16th of October, 1770.\r\n\r\n\"JAMES COOK.\"\r\n\r\nWednesday, 17th.

I waited upon the Superintendent of Onrust,\r\nwith an order from the Shebander, to receive us at that Island, but this\r\norder, the Superintendent told me, was not sufficient to impower him to\r\ngive me the conveniences and assistance I wanted, and when I came to call\r\nupon the Shebander, I found this mistake was owing to the word \"heave\r\ndown\" being wrong translated; this Circumstance, trifling as it is, will\r\ncause a delay of some days, as it cannot be set to rights until next\r\nCouncil day, which is not till Friday.\r\n\r\nThursday, 18th. In the P.M. received on board 2 live Oxen, 150 Gallons of\r\nArrack, 3 Barrels of Tar, and one of Pitch; at daylight in the A.M. took\r\nup our Anchor and run down to Onrust.\r\n\r\nAt 9 Anchor'd in 7 fathoms off Coopers Island, which lies close to\r\nOnrust. There are wharfs at both of these Islands, and ships land there\r\nstores, sometimes on the one and sometimes on the other, but it is only\r\nat Onrust where the proper conveniences are for heaving down. Soon after\r\nwe Anchor'd I went on shore to the Officer of the Yard, to see if they\r\ncould not allow us some place to land our stores, but this could not be\r\ngranted without orders.\r\n\r\nFriday, 19th. In the P.M. I sent a Petty Officer to Mr. Hicks, who Lodges\r\nashore at Batavia for the recovery of his health, with orders to desire\r\nhim to wait upon the Shebander, in order to get the necessary orders\r\nrespecting us dispatched to this place as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 20th. Employ'd unrigging the ship, etc.\r\n\r\nSunday, 21st. In the P.M. orders came down to the Officers of the yard to\r\ncomply with everything I wanted, but we could not yet get a Wharfe to\r\nland our Stores, they being all taken up by shipping.\r\n\r\nMonday, 22nd. In the A.M. two ships went from the Wharfes at Coopers\r\nIsland, when we prepared to go along side one of them.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 23rd. In the P.M. hauled along side one of the Wharfes, in order\r\nto take out our stores, etc., after which the Ship is to be deliver'd\r\ninto the Charge of the proper Officers at Onrust, who will (as I am\r\ninform'd) heave her down, and repair her, with their own people, while\r\nours must stand and look on, who, if we were permitted, could do every\r\nthing wanting to the Ship ourselves.* (* Here Mr. Corner's copy of the\r\nJournal ends abruptly. The record for the next day explains the reason,\r\nand there is no doubt that this was the copy of the Journal sent home.\r\nThe Queen's copy ends on 10th October. The remainder of the Journal is\r\ntaken from the Admiralty copy.)\r\n\r\n[Reports Sent Home from Batavia.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, 24th. Employ'd clearing the Ship, having a Store House to put\r\nour Stores, etc., in. In the P.M. I went up to Town in order to put on\r\nboard the first Dutch Ship that Sails, a pacquet for the Admiralty\r\ncontaining a Copy of my Journal, a Chart of the South Sea, another of New\r\nZeeland, and one of the East Coast of New Holland. In the morning the\r\nGeneral, accompanied by the Water Fiscall, some of the Council, and the\r\nCommodore, each in their respective Boats, went out into the Road on\r\nboard the oldest Captain, in order to appoint him Commodore of the Fleet,\r\nready to Sail for Holland. The Ships was drawn up in 2 Lines, between\r\nwhich the General past to the new Commodore's Ship, which lay the\r\nfarthest out. Each ship as he passed and repassed gave him 3 Cheers, and\r\nas soon as he was on board, and the Dutch Flag Hoisted at the Main\r\nTopmast Head, the other Commodore Saluted him with 21 Guns, and\r\nimmediately after Struck his Broad Pendant, which was again hoisted as\r\nsoon as the General left the other Ship; he was then Saluted with 17 Guns\r\nby the new made Commodore, who now hoisted a Common Pendant. This\r\nCeremony of appointing a Commodore over the Grand Fleet, as they call it,\r\nwe were told is Yearly perform'd. I went out in my Boat on purpose to see\r\nit, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, because we were told it\r\nwas one of the Grandest sights Batavia afforded; that may be too, and yet\r\nit did not recompense us for our trouble. I thought that the whole was\r\nbut ill conducted, and the Fleet appear'd to be very badly mann'd. This\r\nfleet consists of 10 or 12 stout Ships; not only these, but all or most\r\nof their other Ships are pierced for 50 Guns, but have only their upper\r\nTier mounted, and these are more by half than they have men to fight.\r\n\r\nThursday, 25th. In the evening I sent the Admiralty Packet on board the\r\nKronenburg, Captain Fredrick Kelger, Commodore, who, together with\r\nanother Ship, sails immediately for the Cape, where she waits for the\r\nremainder of the Fleet.*\r\n\r\n(* The following letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty (now in Public\r\nRecord Office) was also dispatched:--\r\n\r\n\"To Philip Stephens, Esq.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Please to acquaint my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty that I left\r\nRio de Janeiro the 8th of December, 1768, and on the 16th of January\r\nfollowing arrived in Success Bay in Straits La Maire, where we recruited\r\nour Wood and Water; on the 21st of the same month we quitted Straits La\r\nMaire, and arrived at George's Island on the 13th of April. In our\r\nPassage to this Island I made a far more Westerly Track than any Ship had\r\never done before; yet it was attended with no discovery until we arrived\r\nwithin the Tropick, where we discovered several Islands. We met with as\r\nFriendly a reception by the Natives of George's Island as I could wish,\r\nand I took care to secure ourselves in such a manner as to put it out of\r\nthe power of the whole Island to drive us off. Some days preceeding the\r\n3rd of June I sent Lieutenant Hicks to the Eastern part of this Island,\r\nand Lieutenant Gore to York Island, with others of the Officers (Mr.\r\nGreen having furnished them with Instruments), to observe the Transit of\r\nVenus, that we may have the better Chance of succeeding should the day\r\nprove unfavourable; but in this We were so fortunate that the\r\nobservations were everywhere attended with every favourable Circumstance.\r\nIt was the 13th of July before I was ready to quitt this Island, after\r\nwhich I spent near a month in exploring some other Islands which lay to\r\nthe Westward, before we steer'd to the Southward. On the 14th of August\r\nwe discovered a small Island laying in the Latitude of 22 degrees 27\r\nminutes South, Longitude 150 degrees 47 minutes West. After quitting this\r\nIsland I steered to the South, inclining a little to the East, until we\r\narrived in the Latitude 40 degrees 12 minutes South, without seeing the\r\nleast signs of Land. After this I steer'd to the Westward, between the\r\nLatitude of 30 and 40 degrees until the 6th of October, on which day we\r\ndiscovered the East Coast of New Zeland, which I found to consist of 2\r\nlarge Islands, extending from 34 to 48 degrees of South Latitude, both of\r\nwhich I circumnavigated. On the 1st of April, 1770, I quitted New Zeland,\r\nand steer'd to the Westward, until I fell in with the East Coast of New\r\nHolland, in the Latitude of 30 degrees South. I coasted the shore of this\r\nCountry to the North, putting in at such places as I saw Convenient,\r\nuntil we arrived in the Latitude of 15 degrees 45 minutes South, where,\r\non the night of the 10th of June, we struck upon a Reef of Rocks, were we\r\nlay 23 Hours, and received some very considerable damage. This proved a\r\nfatal stroke to the remainder of the Voyage, as we were obliged to take\r\nshelter in the first Port we met with, were we were detain'd repairing\r\nthe damage we had sustain'd until the 4th of August, and after all put to\r\nSea with a leaky Ship, and afterwards coasted the Shore to the Northward\r\nthrough the most dangerous Navigation that perhaps ever ship was in,\r\nuntil the 22nd of same month, when, being in the Latitude of 10 degrees\r\n30 minutes South, we found a Passage into the Indian Sea between the\r\nNorthern extremity of New Holland and New Guinea. After getting through\r\nthe Passage I stood for the Coast of New Guinea, which we made on the\r\n29th; but as we found it absolutely necessary to heave the Ship down to\r\nStop her leaks before we proceeded home, I made no stay here, but quitted\r\nthis Coast on the 30th of September, and made the best of my way to\r\nBatavia, where we Arrived on the 10th instant, and soon after obtained\r\nleave of the Governor and Council to be hove down at Onrust, where we\r\nhave but just got alongside of the Wharf in order to take out our Stores,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"I send herewith a copy of my Journal, containing the Proceedings of the\r\nwhole Voyage, together with such Charts as I have had time to Copy, which\r\nI judge will be sufficient for the present to illustrate said Journal. In\r\nthis Journal I have with undisguised truth and without gloss inserted the\r\nwhole Transactions of the Voyage, and made such remarks and have given\r\nsuch discriptions of things as I thought was necessary in the best manner\r\nI was Capable off. Altho' the discoverys made in this Voyage are not\r\ngreat, yet I flatter myself they are such as may Merit the Attention of\r\ntheir Lordships; and altho' I have failed in discovering the so much\r\ntalked of Southern Continent (which perhaps do not exist), and which I\r\nmyself had much at heart, yet I am confident that no part of the Failure\r\nof such discovery can be laid to my charge. Had we been so fortunate not\r\nto have run a shore much more would have been done in the latter part of\r\nthe Voyage than what was; but as it is, I presume this Voyage will be\r\nfound as compleat as any before made to the South Seas on the same\r\naccount. The plans I have drawn of the places I have been at were made\r\nwith all the Care and accuracy that time and Circumstances would admit\r\nof. Thus far I am certain that the Latitude and Longitude of few parts of\r\nthe World are better settled than these. In this I was very much assisted\r\nby Mr. Green, who let slip no one opportunity for making of Observations\r\nfor settling the Longitude during the whole Course of the Voyage; and the\r\nmany Valuable discoveries made by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander in Natural\r\nHistory, and other things useful to the learned world, cannot fail of\r\ncontributing very much to the Success of the Voyage. In justice to the\r\nOfficers and the whole Crew, I must say they have gone through the\r\nfatigues and dangers of the whole Voyage with that cheerfulness and\r\nAllertness that will always do Honour to British Seamen, and I have the\r\nsatisfaction to say that I have not lost one Man by sickness during the\r\nwhole Voyage. I hope that the repairs wanting to the Ship will not be so\r\ngreat as to detain us any length of time. You may be assured that I shall\r\nmake no unnecessary delay either here or at any other place, but shall\r\nmake the best of my way home. I have the Honour to be with the greatest\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your most Obedient Humble Servant,\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) JAMES COOK.\r\n\r\n\"Endeavour Bark,\r\nat Onrust, near Batavia,\r\nthe 23rd of October, 1770.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although the discoveries made in this voyage are not great.\" In these\r\nmodest words does Cook describe his work. I read them to mean that with\r\nhis love of accuracy he did not wish to claim his explorations of New\r\nZealand and the East Coast of Australia as discoveries, as it was already\r\nknown that lands existed there; but seeing how little was known, and how\r\ncompletely he did his work, there are but few men who would have\r\nrefrained from classing them, as indeed he truly might have, as\r\ndiscoveries.)\r\n\r\nFriday, 26th. Set up the Ship's Tent for the reception of the Ship's\r\nCompany, several of them begin to be taken ill, owing, as I suppose, to\r\nthe extream hot weather.\r\n\r\n[Heaving down at Batavia.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 27th. Employed getting out Stores, Ballast, etc.\r\n\r\nSunday, 28th. Employ'd as above.\r\n\r\nMonday, 29th, Tuesday, 30th, Wednesday, 31st. Employ'd clearing the Ship.\r\n\r\n[November 1770.]\r\n\r\nThursday, November 1st. Got every thing out of the Ship, and all clear\r\nfor going alongside of the Carreening, but about Noon I received a\r\nmessage from the Officer at Onrust acquainting me that they could not\r\nreceive us there until they had first despatched the Ships bound to\r\nEurope, which were down here taking in pepper.\r\n\r\nFriday, 2nd, Saturday, 3rd, Sunday, 4th. Employ'd overhauling the\r\nrigging, and making rope, making and repairing Sails.\r\n\r\nMonday, 5th. Clear, hot sultry weather. In the A.M. transported the ship\r\nover to Onrust, alongside one of the Carreening Wharfs.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 6th. In the A.M. the officers of the Yard took the Ship in hand,\r\nand sent on board a number of Carpenters, Caulkers, Riggers, Slaves,\r\netc., to make ready to heave down.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 7th. Employ'd getting ready to heave down in the P.M. We had\r\nthe misfortune to loose Mr. Monkhouse, the Surgeon, who died at Batavia\r\nof a Fever after a short illness, of which disease and others several of\r\nour people are daily taken ill, which will make his loss be the more\r\nseverely felt; he was succeeded by Mr. Perry, his mate, who is equally as\r\nwell skilled in his profession.\r\n\r\nThursday, 8th. In the night had much Thunder, Lightning, and Rain; during\r\nthe day fair weather, which gave us time to get everything in readiness\r\nfor heaving down.\r\n\r\nFriday, 9th. In the P.M. hove the Larboard side of the Ship, Kiel out,\r\nand found her bottom to be in a far worse condition than we expected; the\r\nfalse kiel was gone to within 20 feet of the Stern post, the main Kiel\r\nwounded in many places very considerably, a great quantity of Sheathing\r\noff, and several planks much damaged, especially under the Main Channell\r\nnear the Kiel, where 2 planks and a 1/2, near 6 feet in length, were\r\nwithin 1/8th of an inch of being cutt through; and here the worms had\r\nmade their way quite into the timbers, so that it was a matter of\r\nsurprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water,\r\nand yet in this condition we had sailed some hundreds of Leagues, in as\r\ndangerous a Navigation as in any part of the World, happy in being\r\nignorant of the continual danger we were in. In the evening righted the\r\nShip, having only time to patch up some of the worst places to prevent\r\nthe water getting in in large quantitys for the present. In the morning\r\nhove her down again, and most of the Carpenters and Caulkers in the Yard\r\n(which are not a few) were set to work upon her Bottom, and at the same\r\ntime a number of Slaves were employ'd bailing the water out of the Hold.\r\nOur people, altho' they attend, were seldom called upon; indeed, by this\r\ntime we were so weakned by sickness that we could not muster above 20 Men\r\nand Officers that were able to do duty, so little should we have been\r\nable to have hove her down and repair'd her ourselves, as I at one time\r\nthought us capable of.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 10th. In the P.M. we were obliged to righten the ship before\r\nnight, by reason of her making water in her upper works faster than we\r\ncould free; it made it necessary to have her weather works inside and out\r\ncaulked, which before was thought unnecessary.\r\n\r\nSunday, 11th. In the A.M., having caulked her upper works, hove out the\r\nLarboard side again, which a number of Workmen were employ'd repairing.\r\n\r\nMonday, 12th. In the P.M. finished the Larboard side, and in the A.M.\r\nbegan to get ready to heave out the other.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 13th. This day they hove the Starboard side Kiel out, which we\r\nfound very little damaged, and was therefore soon done with.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 14th. Employ'd clearing the Ship of the Carreening gear, her\r\nbottom being now thoroughly repair'd, and very much to my satisfaction.\r\nIn justice to the Officers and Workmen of this Yard, I must say that I do\r\nnot believe that there is a Marine Yard in the World where work is done\r\nwith more alertness than here, or where there are better conveniences for\r\nheaving Ships down both in point of safety and despatch. Here they heave\r\ndown by 2 masts, which is not now Practised by the English; but I hold it\r\nto be much safer and more expeditious than by heaving down by one mast; a\r\nman must not only be strongly bigotted to his own customs, but in some\r\nmeasure divested of reason, that will not allow this, after seeing with\r\nhow much ease and safety the Dutch at Onrust heave down their largest\r\nships.\r\n\r\nThursday, 15th. In the A.M. transported the Ship from Onrust to Cooper's\r\nIsland, and moored her alongside the Wharf.\r\n\r\nFriday, 16th. Employ'd taking in Coals and Ballast; sent one of the\r\ndecay'd Pumps up to Batavia to have a new one made by it.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 17th, Sunday, 18th, Monday, 19th, Tuesday, 20th, Wednesday,\r\n21st, Thursday, 22nd, Friday, 23rd, Saturday, 24th, Sunday, 25th.\r\nEmploy'd rigging the Ship, getting on board Stores and Water, which last\r\nwe have sent from Batavia at the rate of Six shillings and 8 pence a\r\nLeager, or 150 Gallons. We are now become so sickly that we seldom can\r\nmuster above 12 or 14 hands to do duty.\r\n\r\nMonday, 26th. In the night had much rain, after which the Westerly\r\nMonsoons set in, which blow here generally in the night from the\r\nSouth-West or from the land, in the day from the North-West or North.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 27th, Wednesday, 28th, Thursday, 29th, Friday, 30th, [December\r\n1770.] Saturday, December 1st, Sunday, 2nd, Monday, 3rd, Tuesday, 4th,\r\nWednesday, 5th, Thursday, 6th, Friday, 7th. Employ'd getting on board\r\nStores, Provisions, Water, rigging the Ship, repairing and bending the\r\nSails. On the last of these days, having got all the Sick on board, and\r\nevery other thing from the Island, we hauled off from the Wharfe with a\r\ndesign to run up to Batavia road, but the Wind proving scant obliged us\r\nto lay at anchor.\r\n\r\n[At Batavia.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 8th. Fresh breezes Westerly, and fair weather. At 10 A.M.\r\nweigh'd and run up to Batavia road, where we anchor'd in 4 1/2 fathoms\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSunday, 9th. First and latter parts ditto weather, middle squally with\r\nrain. In the P.M. sent on shore a Boat load of empty casks, and at the\r\nsame time went myself in order to forward the things we wanted, and in\r\nthe evening sent on board the new Pump, with some other stores that were\r\nimmediately wanting.\r\n\r\nMonday, 10th. For the most part Squally, with rain; the people employ'd\r\nscraping the paint work.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 11th, Wednesday, 12th, Thursday, 13th, Friday, 14th. For the\r\nmost part of these days fair weather. Employ'd taking on board Provisions\r\nand Water; this last is put on board at 5 shillings a Leager or 150\r\nGallons.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 15th. In the P.M. anchor'd here the Earl of Elgin, Captain\r\nCooke, an English East India Company Ship from Madras, bound to China,\r\nbut having lost her passage, put in here to wait for the next Season.\r\n\r\nSunday, 16th, Monday, 17th. Employ'd taking on board Provisions; Scraping\r\nand Painting the Ship.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 18th. Gentle breezes and fair weather. Anchored here the\r\nPhoenix, Captain Black, an English Country Ship from Bencoolen.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 19th, Thursday, 20th, Friday, 21st, Saturday, 22nd, Sunday,\r\n23rd, Monday, 24th. Fresh breezes, and for the most part fair weather.\r\nCompleted taking on board Provisions, Water, etc., and getting the Ship\r\nready for sea.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 25th. Having now compleatly refitted the ship, and taken in a\r\nsufficient quantity of Provisions of all kinds, I this afternoon took\r\nleave of the General, and such others of the principal Gentlemen as I had\r\nany connection with, all of whom upon every occasion gave me all the\r\nassistance I required. A small dispute, however, now hapned between me\r\nand some of the Dutch Naval Officers about a Seaman that had run from one\r\nof the Dutch Ships in the Road, and enter'd on board mine; this man the\r\nGeneral demanded as a Subject of Holland, and I promised to deliver him\r\nup provided he was not an English Subject, and sent the necessary orders\r\non board for that purpose. In the morning the Commodore's Captain came\r\nand told me that he had been on board my ship for the man, but that the\r\nOfficer had refused to give him up, alledging that he was an Englishman,\r\nand that he, the Captain, was just then come from the General to demand\r\nthe man of me as a Deanish Subject, he standing upon their Ship's books\r\nas born at Elsinore. I told him that I believed there must be some\r\nmistake in the General's message, for I apprehended he would not demand a\r\nDeanish Seaman from me who had committed no other crime than preferring\r\nthe English Service before that of the Dutch; but to convince him how\r\nunwilling I was to disoblige any one concerned, I had sent orders on\r\nboard to deliver the man to him in case he was found to be a Foreigner;\r\nbut as that was not done I suspected that the man was a Subject of\r\nEngland, and if I found him to be such I was resolved to keep him. Soon\r\nafter this I received a letter from Mr. Hicks, which I carried to the\r\nShabander, and desired that it might be shewn to the General, and at the\r\nsame time to acquaint him that, after my having such unanswerable proof\r\nof the man's being an English Subject, as was mentioned in that letter,\r\nit was impossible for me to deliver him up. After this I heard no more\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 26th. In the P.M. myself, Mr. Banks, and all the Gentlemen\r\ncame on board, and at 6 a.m. weigh'd and came to sail with a light breeze\r\nat South-West. The Elgin Indiaman saluted us with 3 cheers and 13 Guns,\r\nand soon after the Garrison with 14, both of which we return'd. Soon\r\nafter this the Sea breeze set in at North by West, which obliged us to\r\nAnchor just without the Ships in the Road. The number of Sick on board at\r\nthis time amounts to 40 or upwards, and the rest of the Ship's Company\r\nare in a weakly condition, having been every one sick except the\r\nSailmaker, an old Man about 70 or 80 years of age; and what is still more\r\nextraordinary in this man is his being generally more or less drunk every\r\nday. But notwithstanding this general sickness, we lost but 7 men in the\r\nwhole: the Surgeon, 3 Seamen, Mr. Green's Servant, and Tupia and his\r\nServant, both of which fell a sacrifice to this unwholesome climate\r\nbefore they had reached the object of their wishes. Tupia's death,\r\nindeed, cannot be said to be owing wholy to the unwholesome air of\r\nBatavia; the long want of a Vegetable Diet, which he had all his life\r\nbefore been used to, had brought upon him all the Disorders attending a\r\nSea life. He was a shrewd, sensible, ingenious man, but proud and\r\nobstinate, which often made his situation on board both disagreeable to\r\nhimself and those about him, and tended much to promote the diseases\r\nwhich put a Period to his Life.* (* It is rather curious that Cook does\r\nnot here record his sense of the value of Tupia's services as\r\ninterpreter, which he has before alluded to in the Journal. There is no\r\ndoubt that his presence on board when the ship was in New Zealand was the\r\ngreatest advantage, affording a means of communication with the natives,\r\nwhich prevented the usual gross misunderstandings which arise as to the\r\nobject of the visit of an exploring ship. Without him, even with Cook's\r\nhumane intention and good management, friendly relations would have been\r\nmuch more difficult to establish.)\r\n\r\n[Description of Batavia.]\r\n\r\nBatavia is a place that hath been so often visited by Europeans, and so\r\nmany accounts of it extant, that any discription I could give would seem\r\nunnecessary; besides, I have neither abilities nor materials sufficient\r\nfor such an undertaking, for whoever gives a faithful account of this\r\nplace must in many things contradict all the Authors I have had an\r\nopportunity to consult; but this task I shall leave to some abler hand,\r\nand only take notice of such things that seem to me necessary for Seamen\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nThe City of Batavia is situated on a low flatt near the Sea, in the\r\nBottom of a large Bay of the same name, which lies on the North side of\r\nJava, about 8 Leagues from the Straits of Sunda; it lies in 6 degrees 10\r\nminutes South Latitude, and 106 degrees 50 minutes East Longitude from\r\nthe Meridian of Greenwich, settled by Astronomical Observations made on\r\nthe spot by the Reverend Mr. Mohr, who has built a very ellegant\r\nObservatory, which is as well furnished with Instruments as most in\r\nEurope. Most of the Streets in the City have canals of water running\r\nthrough them, which unite into one Stream about 1/2 a mile before they\r\ndischarge themselves into the Sea; this is about 100 feet broad, and is\r\nbuilt far enough out into the Sea to have at its entrance a sufficient\r\ndepth of Water to admit Small Craft, Luggage boats, etc. The\r\ncommunication between the Sea and the City is by this Canal alone, and\r\nthis only in the day; for it is shut up every night by a Boom, through\r\nwhich no Boats can pass from about 6 o'clock in the evening to between 5\r\nand 6 the next morning. Here stands the Custom house, where all goods,\r\neither imported or exported, pay the Customary Dutys; at least, an\r\nAccount is here taken of them, and nothing can pass without a Permit,\r\nwether it pays duty or no. All kinds of refreshments, Naval Stores, and\r\nSea Provisions are to be had here; but there are few Articles but what\r\nbear a very high Price, especially if you take them of the Company, which\r\nyou are obliged to do if you want any Quantity; that is, of such Articles\r\nas they monoplie to themselves, which are all manner of Naval Stores and\r\nSalted Provisions.\r\n\r\nThe Road of Batavia, or place where Shipping Anchor, lies right before\r\nthe City, and is so large as to contain any number of Shipping. You\r\nanchor with the Dome of the Great Church, bearing about South in 7, 6, or\r\n5 fathoms water, about 1 1/2 or 2 miles from the Shore; and nearer you\r\ncannot come with Large Ships, by reason of a Mud bank which lines all the\r\nShore of the Bay. The ground that you Anchor in is of such a nature that\r\nthe Anchors buries themselves so deep that it is with difficulty they are\r\ngot out; for this reason Ships always lays at Single Anchor, being in no\r\nmanner of danger of fouling them. You lay apparently open to the winds\r\nfrom the North-West to the East-North-East; but the Sea that is caused by\r\nthese winds is a good deal broke before it reaches the Road by the small\r\nIslands and Shoals without. These Shoals have all of them either Buoys or\r\nBeacons upon them; but if these Guides should be moved, there is a very\r\ngood Chart of this Bay and the Coast of Java as far as the Straits of\r\nSunda, bound up in the English East India Pilot, sold by Mount & Page. In\r\nthis Chart everything seems to be very accurately delineated.\r\n\r\nFresh water and wood for fuel must be purchased here. The water is put on\r\nboard the Ship in the Road at a Spanish Dollar, or 5 shillings a Leager,\r\ncontaining 150 Gallons; but if sent to Onrust, which is one League from\r\nthe Road, it cost a Duccatoon, or 6 shillings 8 pence. The supplying\r\nshipping with water, especially Foreigners, is a perquisite of the\r\nCommodore, who is always an Officer in the State's Service, but acts here\r\nunder the Company. He takes care to tell you that the Water is very good,\r\nand will keep sweet at Sea; whereas everybody else tells you that it is\r\nnot so.\r\n\r\nBe this as it will, Batavia is certainly a place that Europeans need not\r\ncovet to go to; but if necessity obliges them, they will do well to make\r\ntheir stay as short as possible, otherwise they will soon feel the\r\neffects of the unwholesome air of Batavia, which, I firmly believe, is\r\nthe Death of more Europeans than any other place upon the Globe of the\r\nsame extent. Such, at least, is my opinion of it, which is founded on\r\nfacts. We came in here with as healthy a Ship's Company as need go to\r\nSea, and after a stay of not quite 3 months left it in the condition of\r\nan Hospital Ship, besides the loss of 7 men; and yet all the Dutch\r\nCaptains I had an opportunity to converse with said that we had been very\r\nlucky, and wondered that we had not lost half our people in that time.*\r\n(* Batavia bears an evil reputation for health to this day; but it must\r\nbe remembered that the Endeavour lay there during the rainy or most\r\nunhealthy season.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. BATAVIA TO CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.\r\n\r\n[December 1770.]\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, 27th. Moderate breezes at West and North-West, with fair\r\nweather. At 6 a.m. weighed, and stood out to Sea; at Noon the Island of\r\nEdam bore North by East, distant 3 miles.\r\n\r\nFriday, 28th. Winds variable between the North and West. At 6 in the\r\nEvening anchored in 13 fathoms, Edam Island bearing East, distant 1 1/2\r\nmiles. At day light in the morning weighed again, and keept plying to\r\nwindward between Edam and Duffin's Island, but gained very little owing\r\nto the variableness of the winds.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 29th. In the P.M. anchored in 12 fathoms water in the Evening\r\nuntil daylight, when we got again under Sail, with the wind at\r\nWest-South-West, and stood out North-West for the Thousand Islands.\r\nBefore noon the wind veer'd to North-West, and we endeavour'd to turn\r\nthrough between Pulo Pare and Wapping Island.\r\n\r\nSunday, 30th. After making a short trip to the North-East, we tacked, and\r\nweather'd Pulo Pare, and stood in for the Main, having the wind at\r\nNorth-West, a fresh breeze. We fetched Maneaters Island (a small island\r\nlaying under the Main midway between Batavia and Bantam) after making a\r\ntrip to the North-East, and finding that we lost ground, we stood in\r\nshore again and anchored in 13 fathoms, the above mentioned Island\r\nbearing South-West by West, distant 1 mile, and in one with Bantam Hill.\r\nAt 7 A.M. weighed, with the wind at West-South-West, and stood to the\r\nNorth-West, and weather'd Wapping Island, having the current in our\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nMonday, 31st. At 1 P.M. the wind veer'd to the Northward; we tack and\r\nstood to the Westward, and weather'd Pulo Baby. In the Evening Anchor'd\r\nbetween this Island and Bantam Bay, the Island bearing North, distant 2\r\nmiles, and Bantam Point West; at 5 a.m. weighed with the wind at West by\r\nSouth, which afterwards proved variable; at noon Bantam Point South-West\r\n1/2 West, distant 3 Leagues.\r\n\r\nJANUARY, 1771.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 1st. In the P.M. stood over for the Sumatra Shore, having the\r\nwind at South-South-West, a fresh breeze, and the current in our favour;\r\nbut this last shifted and set to the Eastward in the Evening, and obliged\r\nus to Anchor in 30 fathoms, under the Islands which lay off Verekens\r\npoint, which point constitutes the narrowest part of the Straits of\r\nSunda. Here we found the current set to the South-West the most part of\r\nthe night; at 5 a.m. weigh'd with the wind at North-West, and stood to\r\nthe South-West between the Island Thwart-the-way and Sumatra; the wind\r\nsoon after coming to the westward we stood over for the Java Shore. At\r\nnoon the South point of Peper Bay bore South-West by South, and Anger\r\nPoint North-East 1/2 East, distant 2 Leagues; tacked and stood to the\r\nNorth-West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 2nd. First and middle parts fresh breezes at South-West, and\r\nfair the remainder, squally with rain; plying to windward between\r\nCracatoa and the Java shore without gaining anything.\r\n\r\nThursday, 3rd. In the P.M. had it very squally, with heavy showers of\r\nrain; at 1/2 past 7 anchor'd in 19 fathoms, Cracatoa Island South-West,\r\ndistance 3 Leagues. In the morning came to sail, having very squally\r\nvariable weather; at Noon Cracatoa West 2 Leagues.\r\n\r\nFriday, 4th. Most part of these 24 hours squally, rainy weather, winds\r\nvariable between the North-North-West and South-South-West; at 5 p.m.\r\nanchor'd in 28 fathoms water, Cracatoa West, distant 3 miles. Some time\r\nafter the wind veer'd to North-West, with which we got under sail, but\r\nthe wind dying away we advanced but little to the South-West before noon,\r\nat which time Princes Island bore South-West, distance 8 or 9 Leagues.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 5th. Had fresh breezes at South-West, with squally, rainy\r\nweather until the evening, when it clear up, and the wind veer'd to South\r\nand South-East, with which we stood to the South-West all night. In the\r\nmorning the wind veer'd to North-East, which was still in our favour; at\r\nnoon Princes Island bore West 1/2 South, distant 3 Leagues.\r\n\r\n[At Anchor. Princes Island, Sunda Strait.]\r\n\r\nSunday, 6th. At 3 o'clock in the P.M. anchor'd under the South-East side\r\nof Princes Island in 18 fathoms water, in order to recruite our wood and\r\nwater, and to procure refreshments for the people, which are now in a\r\nmuch worse state of health than when we left Batavia. After coming to an\r\nanchor I went on shore to look at the watering place, and to speak with\r\nthe Natives, some of whom were upon the Beach. I found the watering place\r\nconvenient, and the water to all appearance good, Provided proper care is\r\ntaken in the filling of it. The Natives seemed inclined to supply us with\r\nTurtle, Fowls, etc.; Articles that I intended laying in as great a stock\r\nas possible for the benefit of the Sick, and to suffer every one to\r\npurchase what they pleased for themselves, as I found these people as\r\neasy to traffick with as Europeans. In the morning sent the Gunner ashore\r\nwith some hands to fill water, while others were empboy'd putting the\r\nwhole to rights, sending on shore Empty Casks, etc. Served Turtle to the\r\nShip's Company. Yesterday was the only Salt meat day they have had since\r\nour arrival at Java, which is now near 4 months.\r\n\r\nMonday, 7th. From this day till Monday 14th we were employ'd wooding and\r\nwatering, being frequently interrupted by heavy rains. Having now\r\ncompleated both we hoisted in the Long boat, and made ready to put to\r\nSea, having on board a pretty good stock of refreshments, which we\r\npurchased of the natives, such as Turtle, Fowls, Fish, two species of\r\nDeer, one about as big as a small sheep, the other no bigger than a\r\nRabbit; both sorts eat very well, but are only for present use, as they\r\nseldom lived above 24 hours in our possession. We likewise got fruit of\r\nseveral sorts, such as Cocoa Nutts, plantains, Limes, etc. The Trade on\r\nour part was carried on chiefly with money (Spanish Dollars); the natives\r\nset but little value upon any thing else. Such of our people as had not\r\nthis Article traded with Old Shirts, etc., at a great disadvantage.\r\n\r\n[Batavia to Capetown.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 15th. Had variable light airs of wind, with which we could not\r\nget under sail until the morning, when we weighed with a light breeze at\r\nNorth-East, which was soon succeeded by a calm.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 16th. Had it calm all P.M., which at 5 o'clock obliged us to\r\nAnchor under the South Point of Princes Island, the said Point bearing\r\nSouth-West by West, distance 2 miles. At 8 o'clock in the A.M. a light\r\nbreeze sprung up at North, with which we weigh'd and stood out to Sea. At\r\nnoon Java Head bore South-East by South, distance 2 Leagues, and the West\r\nPoint of Princes Island North-North-West, distance 5 Leagues; Latitude\r\nObserved 6 degrees 45 minutes South. Java Head, from which I take my\r\ndeparture, lies in the Latitude of 6 degrees 49 minutes South, and\r\nLongitude 255 degrees 12 minutes West from the Meridian of Greenwich,\r\ndeduced from several Astronomical Observations made at Batavia by the\r\nReverend Mr. Mohr.* (* The true longitude of Java Head is 254 degrees 49\r\nminutes West.)\r\n\r\nThursday, 17th. Little wind and fair at 6 p.m. Java head bore\r\nEast-North-East, distant 4 or 5 Leagues; at 6 a.m. it bore\r\nNorth-North-East, 12 Leagues. Wind North-East; course South 27 degrees 15\r\nminutes West; distance 48 miles; latitude 7 degrees 32 minutes South;\r\nlongitude 255 degrees 35 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 18th. Light Airs and Calms, with Showers of Rain. Wind Variable;\r\ncourse South-West 1/2 South; distance 30 miles; latitude 7 degrees 55\r\nminutes South; longitude 255 degrees 54 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 19th. For the most part of these 24 hours had little wind and\r\nfair weather. Wind Westerly; course South 3 degrees East; distance 53\r\nmiles; latitude 8 degrees 48 minutes South; longitude 255 degrees 51\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 20th. Light Airs and Calms, with some Showers of Rain. Saw 2 Sail\r\nin the North-West Quarter standing to the South-West; one of them shew'd\r\nDutch Colours. Wind North Westerly; course South 44 degrees West;\r\ndistance 36 miles; latitude 9 degrees 14 minutes South; longitude 256\r\ndegrees 15 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 21st. First part Little wind, the remainder a Gentle breeze; the\r\n2 Sail in sight. Wind Easterly; course South 57 degrees West; distance 58\r\nmiles; latitude 9 degrees 46 minutes South; longitude 257 degrees 5\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 22nd. Little wind and fair weather. Wind South-Westerly; course\r\nNorth 10 degrees West; distance 17 miles; latitude 9 degrees 29 minutes\r\nSouth; longitude 257 degrees 8 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 23rd. Ditto weather; a swell from the Southward, and which we\r\nhave had ever since we left the Straits of Sunda. Wind Ditto; course East\r\nSoutherly; distance 18 miles; latitude 9 degrees 30 minutes South;\r\nlongitude 256 degrees 50 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 24th. First part Light Airs, the remainder Calm. In the A.M.\r\ndied John Trusslove, Corporal of Marines, a man much esteem'd by every\r\nbody on board. Many of our people at this time lay dangerously ill of\r\nFevers and Fluxes. We are inclinable to attribute this to the water we\r\ntook in at Princes Island, and have put lime into the Casks in order to\r\npurifie it. Wind South-West by South to South-South-East; course South;\r\ndistance 4 miles; latitude 9 degrees 34 minutes South; longitude 256\r\ndegrees 50 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 25th. Light Airs and Calms; hot, sultry weather. Departed this\r\nlife Mr. Sporing, a Gentleman belonging to Mr Banks's retinue. Wind\r\nVariable and Calms; course South 30 degrees East; distance 12 miles;\r\nlatitude 9 degrees 44 minutes South; longitude 256 degrees 44 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 26th.

Wind South Westerly; course South-East; distance 17 miles;\r\nlatitude 9 degrees 56 minutes South; longitude 256 degrees 32 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSunday, 27th. Little wind, and sometimes calm. In the evening found the\r\nVariation to be 2 degrees 51 minutes West. Departed this life Mr. Sydney\r\nParkinson, Natural History Painter to Mr. Banks, and soon after John\r\nRavenhill, Sailmaker, a man much advanced in years. Wind Variable; course\r\nSouth 30 degrees West; distance 19 miles; latitude 10 degrees 12 minutes\r\nSouth; longitude 256 degrees 41 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 28th.

Very variable weather; sometimes squally, with rain, other\r\ntimes little wind and calms. In the Night died Mr. Charles Green, who was\r\nsent out by the Royal Society to observe the Transit of Venus. He had\r\nlong been in a bad state of health, which he took no care to repair, but,\r\non the contrary, lived in such a manner as greatly promoted the disorders\r\nhe had had long upon him; this brought on the Flux, which put a period to\r\nhis life. Wind North Westerly; course South 40 degrees West; distance 74\r\nmiles; latitude 11 degrees 57 minutes South; longitude 258 degrees 15\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 30th.

First part Moderate and fair, the remainder frequent\r\nSqualls, attended with Showers of Rain. In the course of this 24 Hours we\r\nhave had 4 men died of the Flux, viz., John Thompson, Ship's Cook;\r\nBenjamin Jordan, Carpenter's Mate; James Nickolson and Archibald Wolf,\r\nSeamen; a melancholy proof of the calamitieous situation we are at\r\npresent in, having hardly well men enough to tend the Sails and look\r\nafter the Sick, many of whom are so ill that we have not the least hopes\r\nof their recovery. Wind East-South-East; course South-West; distance 80\r\nmiles; latitude 13 degrees 42 minutes South; longitude 259 degrees 55\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\n[February 1771.]\r\n\r\nFriday, February 1st. Fresh Gales, with flying showers of rain. Clean'd\r\nbetween Decks, and washed with Vinegar. Wind South-East by South; course\r\nSouth 58 1/2 degrees West; distance 119 miles; latitude 14 degrees 44\r\nminutes South; longitude 261 degrees 40 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 2nd. A Fresh Trade, and mostly fair weather. Departed this life\r\nDaniel Roberts, Gunner's Servant, who died of the Flux. Since we have had\r\na fresh Trade Wind this fatal disorder hath seem'd to be at a stand; yet\r\nthere are several people which are so far gone, and brought so very low\r\nby it, that we have not the least hopes of their recovery. Wind\r\nEast-South-East; course South 61 degrees West; distance 131 miles;\r\nlatitude 15 degrees 48 minutes South; longitude 264 degrees 16 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSunday, 3rd. Ditto weather. In the Evening found the variation to be 2\r\ndegrees 56 minutes West. Departed this life John Thurman, Sailmaker's\r\nAssistant. Wind Ditto; course South 65 degrees West; distance 128 miles;\r\nlatitude 16 degrees 40 minutes South; longitude 266 degrees 16 West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 4th. A fresh Trade and hazey weather, with some Squalls, attended\r\nwith Small Rain; unbent the Main Topsail to repair, and bent another. In\r\nthe night died of the Flux Mr. John Bootie, Midshipman, and Mr. John\r\nGathrey, Boatswain. Wind South-East; course South 69 degrees West;\r\ndistance 141 miles; latitude 17 degrees 30 minutes South; longitude 268\r\ndegrees 32 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 5th. A fresh Trade wind, and hazey, cloudy weather. Employ'd\r\nrepairing Sails; appointed Samuel Evans, one of the Boatswain's Mates,\r\nand Coxswain of the Pinnace, to be Boatswain, in the room of Mr. Gathrey,\r\ndeceased, and order'd a Survey to be taken of the Stores. Wind East by\r\nSouth; course West 15 degrees South; distance 141 miles; latitude 18\r\ndegrees 6 minutes South; longitude 270 degrees 54 minutes West.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 6th. A Fresh Trade wind and fair weather. In the night died\r\nMr. John Monkhouse, Midshipman, and Brother to the late Surgeon. Wind\r\nSouth-East; course West 12 degrees South; distance 126 miles; latitude 18\r\ndegrees 30 minutes South; longitude 272 degrees 28 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 7th. Gentle Gales, with some Showers in the night. In the\r\nEvening found the variation to be 3 degrees 24 minutes West, and in the\r\nMorning I took several observations of the Sun and Moon, the mean result\r\nof which, carried on to Noon, gave 276 degrees 19 minutes West Longitude\r\nfrom Greenwich, which is 2 degrees to the Westward of that given by the\r\nLog; this, I believe, is owing to a following Sea, which I have not as\r\nyet allowed, for I judge it to be 6 miles a day since we have had the\r\nSouth-East Trade wind. Wind South-East; course South 75 degrees 15\r\nminutes West; distance 110 miles; latitude 18 degrees 58 minutes South;\r\nlongitude 274 degrees 20 minutes per Log, 276 degrees 19 minutes per\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\nFriday, 8th. Winds as Yesterday; clear weather in the day, and Showrey in\r\nthe Night. In the morning took Observations again of the Sun and Moon,\r\nthe mean result of which, reduced to noon, gave 278 degrees 50 minutes\r\nWest, which is 2 degrees 31 minutes West of Yesterday's Observation; the\r\nlog gives 2 degrees 20 minutes. Wind South-East; course South 78 degrees\r\nWest; distance 127 miles; latitude 19 degrees 24 minutes South; longitude\r\n276 degrees 40 minutes per Log, 278 degrees 50 minutes per Observation.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 9th.

Died Alexander Lindsay,\r\nSeaman; this man was one of those we got at Batavia, and had been some\r\ntime in India. Winds Ditto; course South 73 degrees 15 minutes West;\r\ndistance 105 miles; latitude 22 degrees 21 minutes South; longitude 288\r\ndegrees 3 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 15th. Ditto Weather.

Wind South-East by South; course\r\nSouth 79 degrees 45 minutes West; distance 157 miles; latitude 23 degrees\r\n20 minutes South; longitude 295 8 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 18th. Fair and pleasant weather. Wind South-East by East; course\r\nSouth 75 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 148 miles; latitude 23 degrees\r\n57 minutes South; longitude 297 degrees 46 minutes West.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 19th.

Wind South; course South 75 degrees 45\r\nminutes West; distance 127 miles; latitude 24 degrees 57 minutes South;\r\nlongitude 302 degrees 21 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 21st. First and middle parts fair weather; Latter Squally,\r\nattended with Showers of Rain. Between 2 and 3 o'Clock p.m. took several\r\nObservations of the Sun and Moon; the mean result of them gave 306\r\ndegrees 33 minutes West Longitude from Greenwich, which is 1 degree 55\r\nminutes West of account, and corresponds very well with the last\r\nObservations, for at that time the Ship was 2 degrees 10 minutes West of\r\naccount. In the Night died of the Flux Alexander Simpson, a very good\r\nSeaman. In the Morning punished Thomas Rossiter with 12 lashes for\r\ngetting Drunk, grossly assaulting the Officer of the Watch, and beating\r\nsome of the Sick. Wind South to East-South-East; course West by South;\r\ndistance 126 miles; latitude 25 degrees 21 minutes South; longitude 304\r\ndegrees 39 minutes per Account, 306 degrees 34 minutes per Observation.\r\n\r\nFriday, 22nd. Fresh Trade and fair weather. Nothing remarkable. Wind\r\nSouth-East by South; course South 70 degrees 45 minutes West; distance\r\n133 miles; latitude 26 degrees 5 minutes South; longitude 306 degrees 59\r\nminutes West, 308 degrees 54 minutes per Observation.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 23rd.

Gentle breezes and fair weather. In the A.M. took the\r\nopportunity of a fine morning to stay the Main Mast, and set up the\r\nTopmast Rigging. Saw an Albatross. Wind Ditto; course South 66 degrees 45\r\nminutes West; distance 117 miles; latitude 27 degrees 45 minutes South;\r\nlongitude 311 degrees 7 minutes West, 313 degrees 41 minutes per\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\nMonday, 25th. Gentle Gales, and fair weather. Variation per Evening\r\nAzimuth 24 degrees 20 minutes West, and by the Morning Amplitude 24\r\ndegrees West Longitude; by Observation of the [circle around a dot, sun]\r\nand [crescent, moon] is 3 degrees to the Westwarn of the Log, which shews\r\nthat the Ship has gain'd upon the Log 1 degree 5 minutes in 3 Days, in\r\nwhich time we have always found the Observ'd Latitude to the Southward of\r\nthat given by the Log. These Joint Observations proves that there must be\r\na current setting between the South and West. Wind East by South; course\r\nSouth 58 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 122 miles; latitude 28 degrees\r\n49 minutes South; longitude 313 degrees 6 minutes West, 316 degrees 6\r\nminutes per Observation.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 26th.

Ditto Gales and Cloudy. In the A.M. died of the Flux\r\nHenry Jeffs, Emanuel Parreyra, and Peter Morgan, Seamen; the last came\r\nSick on board at Batavia, of which he never recover'd, and the other 2\r\nhad long been past all hopes of recovery, so that the death of these 3\r\nmen in one day did not in the least alarm us.* (* These were the last\r\ndeaths directly attributable to the dysentery contracted at Batavia.\r\nThough always enjoying an unenviable reputation, Batavia seems to have\r\nhad, this year, a more unhealthy season than usual. The Endeavour lost\r\nseven persons while at Batavia, and twenty-three after sailing up to this\r\ndate.) On the contrary, we are in hopes that they will be the last that\r\nwill fall a sacrifice to this fatal disorder, for such as are now ill of\r\nit are in a fair way of recovering. Wind East by South, East by\r\nNorth-North-East; course South 77 degrees 15 minutes West; distance 108\r\nmiles; latitude 29 degrees 30 minutes South; longitude 317 degrees 25\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 28th. Moderate breezes and fair weather until near 5 o'Clock in\r\nthe A.M., when a heavy Squall from the South-West, attended with rain,\r\ntook us all aback, and obliged us to put before the wind, the better to\r\ntake in our Sails; but before this could be done the Foretopsail was\r\nsplit in several places. By 6 o'clock the Topsails and Mainsail were\r\nhanded, and we brought too under the Foresail and Mizen; at 8 it fell\r\nmore moderate, and we set the Mainsail, and brought another Foretopsail\r\nto the Yard; at Noon had strong Gales and Cloudy weather. Wind North-East\r\nby East, North, and South-West; course South 85 1/2 degrees West;\r\ndistance 88 miles; latitude 29 degrees 37 minutes South; longitude 319\r\ndegrees 5 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[March 1771.]\r\n\r\nFriday, March 1st. Fresh Gales and Cloudy. Found the Bitts which secures\r\nthe foot of the Bowsprit, loose; this obliged us to put before the wind\r\nuntil they were secured in the best manner our situation would admit;\r\nthis done, we hauld our wind again to the Westward under the Courses and\r\nclose Reef'd Topsails. Wind South-West to South by West; course South 86\r\ndegrees 45 minutes West; distance 71 miles; latitude 29 degrees 41\r\nminutes South; longitude 320 degrees 26 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 2nd. First part fresh Gales and Cloudy; remainder little wind,\r\nwith some few showers of rain; a Sea from the South-West. Wind Southerly;\r\ncourse South 60 degrees West; distance 80 miles; latitude 30 degrees 21\r\nminutes South; longitude 321 degrees 46 minutes West.\r\n\r\nSunday, 3rd. First part little wind; remainder Gentle gales and clear\r\nweather, and the Sea pretty smooth. Wind North-East; course South 58\r\ndegrees 15 minutes West; distance 71 miles; latitude 31 degrees 1 minute\r\nSouth; longitude 323 degrees 2 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 4th. In the P.M. had a moderate breeze, which continued until 5\r\no'clock in the A.M., when it fell calm, and soon after a breeze sprung up\r\nat South-West. In the Evening, and most part of the Night, the weather\r\nwas dark and cloudy, with much Lightning to the Westward. Variation 25\r\ndegrees 35 minutes West. Winds North-East to South-West; course South 67\r\ndegrees 45 minutes West; distance 87 miles; latitude 31 degrees 54\r\nminutes South; longitude 324 degrees 36 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[Off Coast of Natal.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 5th. Fresh Gales from the South-South-West, with squally, rainy\r\nweather, with which we stood to the Westward. In the evening some people\r\nthought they saw the appearance of land to the Northward; but this\r\nappear'd so improbable that I, who was not on deck at this time, was not\r\nacquainted with it until dark, when I order'd them to sound, but found no\r\nground with 80 fathoms, upon which we concluded that no land was near.\r\nBut daylight in the Morning proved this to be a mistake by shewing us the\r\nland at the distance of about 2 Leagues off. We had now the wind at\r\nSouth-East, blowing fresh right upon the land. When we made the land we\r\nwere standing to the Westward; but, thinking the other the best tack to\r\nget off on, we wore, and hauld off to the Eastward, and by Noon had got\r\nan Offing of about 4 Leagues, the land at this time extending from\r\nNorth-East by North to West-South-West. This part of the Coast of Africa\r\nwhich we fell in with lies in about the Latitude of 32 degrees 0 minutes\r\nSouth, and Longitude 331 degrees 29 minutes West, and near to what is\r\ncalled in the Charts Point Nattall.* (* Natal.) It was a steep, craggy\r\npoint, very much broke, and looked as if the high, craggy rocks were\r\nIslands. To the North-East of this point the land in General appear'd to\r\nrise, sloping from the Sea to a Moderate height; the Shore, alternately\r\nRocks and Sands. About 2 Leagues to the North-East of the Point appear'd\r\nto be the mouth of a River, which probably may be that of St. Johns. At\r\nthis time the weather was very hazey, so that we had but a very imperfect\r\nview of the land, which did not appear to great advantage. Wind\r\nSouth-South-West to South-East; course per Log North 31 degrees West;\r\ndistance 32 miles; latitude 31 degrees 5 minutes South per Observation,\r\n31 degrees 7 minutes per Reckoning; longitude 331 degrees 19 minutes per\r\nObservation, 324 degrees 56 minutes per Reckoning.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 6th. Moderate Gales, with hazey, rainy weather. Stood to the\r\nEastward all the day, having the land in sight, which at 4 p.m. extended\r\nfrom North-East by North to South-West by West, distant 5 Leagues. At 6\r\nin the Morning we could only see it at West distant 7 or 8 Leagues. At\r\nNoon found the Ship by Observation 90 Miles to the Southward of account.\r\nThus far the current has carried us to the South since the last\r\nobservation, which was only 2 days ago; but it is plain, from the\r\nposition of the Coast, that we have been carried full as far to the West\r\nalso, notwithstanding we have been standing all the time to the\r\nEast-North-East* (* The ship was now in the Agulhas Current.) Wind\r\nSoutherly; course South 54 degrees East; distance 37 miles; latitude 32\r\ndegrees 4 minutes South; 330 degrees 44 minutes per Observation, 323\r\ndegrees 36 minutes per Reckoning.\r\n\r\nThursday, 7th. Cloudy, hazey weather; winds varying between the\r\nSouth-West by South and South-East by South; a light breeze at 1 p.m.\r\nTack'd, and stood to the Westward, land at North, distant about 8\r\nLeagues. At 6 saw it extending from North by West to West by North,\r\ndistant 5 or 6 Leagues; at 8 tack'd, and stood to the Eastward till 12;\r\nthen again to the Westward, standing 4 hours on one tack, and 4 on the\r\nother. At Noon very cloudy; had no observation; saw the land extending\r\nfrom North by West to West by North. Wind Southerly; course South 156\r\ndegrees 5 minutes West; distance 72 miles; latitude 32 degrees 54 minutes\r\nSouth; longitude 331 degrees 56 minutes West per Observation, 323 degrees\r\n54 per Reckoning.\r\n\r\nFriday, 8th. In the P.M. stood to the Westward, with the wind at South by\r\nWest until 4 o'clock; then again to the Eastward, having the land in\r\nsight, extending from North-North-East to West by North, distant 8\r\nLeagues. At 12 the wind veer'd to the Eastward, and before Noon blow'd a\r\nfresh breeze, with which we steer'd South-West. At 7, the land extending\r\nfrom North-North-West to East-North-East, distant 10 or 12 Leagues, found\r\nthe Variation by the Amplitude to be 28 degrees 30 minutes West, and by\r\nan Azimuth 28 degrees 8 minutes West. At Noon Latitude observ'd 34\r\ndegrees 18 minutes, which is 93 miles to the Southward of that given by\r\nthe Log, or dead reckoning since the last observation. Wind Easterly;\r\ncourse South 39 1/2 degrees West; distance 109 miles; latitude 34 degrees\r\n18 minutes South; longitude 333 degrees 19 minutes West per Observation,\r\n324 degrees 23 minutes per Reckoning.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 9th. A steady, fresh Gale, and settled weather. At 4 in the\r\nP.M. had high land in sight, bearing North-East by North. At Noon had\r\nlittle wind and clear weather; the observed Latitude 46 miles to the\r\nSouthward of the Log, which is conformable to what has hapned the 4\r\npreceeding days; and by Observation made of the Sun and Moon this morning\r\nfound that the Ship had gain'd 7 degrees 4 minutes West of the Log since\r\nthe last observation, 13 days ago. Wind Ditto; course South 65 degrees\r\nWest; distance 210 miles; latitude 35 degrees 44 minutes South; longitude\r\n337 degrees 6 minutes West per Observation, 326 degrees 53 minutes per\r\nReckoning.\r\n\r\nSunday, 10th. In the P.M. had a light breeze at North-East until 4\r\no'clock, when it fell calm, and continued so until 11, at which time a\r\nbreeze sprung up at West-North-West, with which we stood to the\r\nNorthward. In the Morning found the Variation to be 22 degrees 46\r\nminutes; at Noon the observ'd Latitude was 14 Miles to the Northward of\r\nthe Log, which shews that the current must have shifted. Wind North-East\r\nWesterly; course North 17 degrees 15 minutes West; distance 55 miles;\r\nlatitude 34 degrees 52 minutes South; longitude 337 degrees 25 minutes\r\nWest per Observation, 327 degrees 12 minutes per Reckoning.\r\n\r\nMonday, 11th. First part light Airs at West; the remainder had a fresh\r\ngale at South-East, with which we steer'd West and West-North-West, in\r\norder to make the Land, which was seen from the Deck at 10 A.M. At Noon\r\nit extended from North-East to North-West, distant 5 Leagues; the middle\r\nappear'd high and mountainous, and the two Extremes low. Took several\r\nObservations of the Sun and Moon, which gave the Longitude, reduced to\r\nNoon, as per Column. Wind Ditto South-East; course North 85 degrees West;\r\ndistance 79 miles; latitude 34 degrees 45 minutes South; longitude 338\r\ndegrees 48 minutes West per Observation, 328 degrees 35 minutes per\r\nReckoning.\r\n\r\n[Off Cape Agulhas.]\r\n\r\nTuesday, 12th. In the P.M. had the wind at South-East and East, with\r\nwhich we steer'd along shore West and West-South-West. At 6 Cape\r\nLaguillas* (* L'Agulhas.) bore West, distance 3 Leagues. At 8, the wind\r\nbeing then at South, we tack'd and stood off, being about 2 Leagues from\r\nthe Cape, which bore about West-North-West. In this Situation had 33\r\nfathoms water; the Wind continued between South-West and South all night,\r\nin times very Squally, with rain. At 2 a.m. tacked to the Westward until\r\nnear 8, when we again stood off Cape Laguillas, North-West, distance 2 or\r\n3 Leagues. At 9 the weather clear'd up, and the wind fix'd at South by\r\nWest. We tack'd, and stood to the Westward. At Noon Cape Laguillas bore\r\nNorth-East by North, distant 4 Leagues. The land of this Cape is very low\r\nand sandy next the Sea; inland it is of a moderate height. Latitude 34\r\ndegrees 50 minutes South, Longitude 339 degrees 23 minutes West, or 20\r\ndegrees 37 minutes East, deduced from Yesterday's Observations. Wind\r\nEast-South-East Southerly; course South 69 degrees 30 minutes West;\r\ndistance 37 miles; Latitude 34 degrees 58 minutes South; longitude 339\r\ndegrees 30 minutes per Observation, 329 degrees 17 minutes per Reckoning.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 13th. In the P.M., having the wind at South, we steer'd along\r\nshore West by South 1/2 South until 3 o'clock, when, finding this course\r\ncarried us off from the land, we steer'd West by North; at 6 o'clock Cape\r\nLaguillas, or the high land over it, bore East by North 12 Leagues\r\ndistance, and the westermost land in sight North-West 1/2 West. We\r\ncontinued a West by North course, with the wind at South-East until day\r\nlight in the Morning, when we haul'd in North-West and North-West by\r\nNorth; at 8 the Cape of Good Hope North-West by North, and at 10 we were\r\nabreast of it, and distance off about 1 League or little more. We passed\r\nclose without a rock, on which the Sea broke very high; it lies about a\r\nLeague right out to Sea from the Cape. After passing the Cape we kept\r\nalong shore at the distance of about 1 League off, having a fresh Gale at\r\nSouth-East; at noon the Cape bore South-East, distance 4 Leagues.\r\nLatitude observed 34 degrees 15 minutes South, Longitude in, by our\r\nreckoning, corrected by the last observation, 341 degrees 7 minutes West,\r\nor 18 degrees 53 minutes East from Greenwich, by which the Cape lies in\r\n34 degrees 25 minutes South Latitude, and 19 degrees 1 minute East\r\nLongitude from Greenwich, which nearly agrees with the observations made\r\nat the Cape Town by Messrs. Mason and Dixon in 1761; a proof that our\r\nobservations have been well made, and that as such they may always be\r\ndepended upon to a surprizing degree of accuracey. If we had had no such\r\nguide we should have found an error of 10 degrees 13 minutes of\r\nLongitude, or perhaps more to the East, such an effect the current must\r\nhave had upon the ship.\r\n\r\nThursday, 14th. Winds at South-East, a fresh Gale, but as we approached\r\nthe Lyons Tail or West point, Table Bay, we had flurries of wind from all\r\nPoints of the Compass; this was occasioned by the high land, for clear of\r\nit the wind was still at South-East, and bbow'd so strong out of the Bay\r\nthat we could not work the Ship in; we were therefore obliged to Anchor a\r\ngood way without all the Ships at Anchor in the Road, in the whole 16\r\nSail, viz., 8 Dutch, 3 Danes, 4 French, a Frigate, and 3 Store Ships, and\r\none English East Indiamen, who saluted us with 11 Guns; we returned 9.\r\nThe Gale continued, which obliged us to lay fast all the morning.\r\n\r\nFriday, 15th. Strong Gales at South-East all the Afternoon and most part\r\nof the Night, though in the Evening it fell a little moderate, which gave\r\nthe Indiaman's Boat an opportunity to come on board us, with a Complement\r\nof a Basket of Fruit, etc,; she was the Admiral Pocock, Captain Riddell,\r\nhomeward bound from Bombay. In the morning we got under sail, and stood\r\ninto the Road, having variable light airs mostly from the Sea. A Dutch\r\nboat from the Shore came on board, in which were the Master Attendant and\r\nsome other Gentlemen; the former directed us to a proper birth, where\r\nabout 10 o'clock we anchored in 7 fathoms water, a Ouzey bottom; the Lyon\r\nTail, or West point of the Bay, bore West-North-West, and the Castle\r\nSouth-West, distance 1 1/2 miles. I now sent a Petty Officer on shore to\r\nknow if they would return our Salute, but before he return'd we Saluted,\r\nwhich was immediately return'd with the same number of Guns; after this I\r\nwaited myself upon the Governour, who was pleased to tell me that I\r\nshould have everything I wanted that the place afforded. My first care\r\nwas to provide a proper place ashore for the reception of the Sick, for\r\nwhich purpose I order'd the Surgeon to look out for a House where they\r\ncould be lodged and dieted. This he soon found, and agreed with the\r\npeople of the house for 2 shillings a day per man; which I found was the\r\ncustomary Price and method of proceeding. I afterwards gave the Surgeon\r\nan order to superintend the whole.\r\n\r\n[Remarks on Dysentery.]\r\n\r\nFew remarks have hapned since we left Java Head that can be of much use\r\nto the Navigator, or any other Person, into whose hand this Journal may\r\nfall; such, however, as have occur'd I shall now insert. After our\r\nleaving Java head we were 11 days before we got the General South-East\r\nTrade wind, in which time we did not advance above 5 degrees to the South\r\nand 3 degrees to the West, having all the time Variable light Airs of\r\nWind, interrupted by frequent Calms, the weather all the time hot and\r\nsultry, and the Air unwholesome, occasioned most probably by the Vast\r\nVapours brought into these Latitudes by the Easterly Trade wind and\r\nWesterly Monsoons, both of which blow at this time of the Year in this\r\nSea. The Easterly winds prevail as far as 12 or 10 degrees South, and the\r\nWesterly winds as far as 6 or 8 degrees; between them the winds are\r\nVariable, and I believe always more or less unwholesome, but to us it was\r\nremarkable from the Fatal Consequences that attended it, for whatever\r\nmight be the cause of First bringing on the Flux among our people, this\r\nunwholesome Air had a Great share in it, and increased it to that degree\r\nthat a Man was no sooner taken with it than he look'd upon himself as\r\nDead. Such was the Despondency that reigned among the Sick at this time,\r\nnor could it be by any Means prevented, when every Man saw that Medicine,\r\nhowever skillfully Administered, had not the least effect. I shall\r\nmention what Effect only the immaginary approach of this disorder had\r\nupon one man. He had long tended upon the Sick, and injoyed a tolerable\r\ngood State of Health; one morning, coming upon Deck, he found himself a\r\nlittle griped, and immediately began to stamp with his feet, and exclaim,\r\n\"I have got the Gripes, I have got the Gripes; I shall die, I shall die!\"\r\nIn this manner he continued until he threw himself into a fit, and was\r\ncarried off the Deck, in a manner, Dead; however he soon recover'd, and\r\ndid very well.\r\n\r\nWe had no sooner got into the South-East Trade wind than we felt its\r\nhappy Effect, tho' we lost several men after, but they were such as were\r\nbrought so low and weak that there were hardly a possibility of there\r\nrecovery; and yet some of them linger'd out in a State of Suspence a\r\nmonth after, who, in all Probability, would not have lived 24 Hours\r\nbefore this Change hapned. Those that were not so far gone remained in\r\nthe same state for some time, and at last began to recover; some few,\r\nhowever, were seized with the disorder after we got into the Trade wind,\r\nbut they had it but slightly, and soon got over it. It is worth\r\nremarking, that of all those who had it in its last stage only one man\r\nlived, who is now in a fair way of recovering; and I think Mr. Banks was\r\nthe only one that was cured at the first Attack'd that had it to a great\r\ndegree, or indeed at all, before we got into the South-East Trade, for it\r\nwas before that time that his Cure was happily effected.\r\n\r\nIt is to be wished, for the good of all Seamen, and mankind in general,\r\nthat some preventative was found out against this disease, and put in\r\npractice in Climates where it is common, for it is impossible to Victual\r\nand water a Ship in those Climates but what some one article or another,\r\naccording to different Peoples opinions, must have been the means of\r\nbringing on the Flux. We were inclinable to lay it to the water we took\r\nin at Princes Island, and the Turtle we got their, on which we lived\r\nseveral days; but there seems to be no reason for this when we consider\r\nthat all the Ships from Batavia this Year suffer'd by the same disorder\r\nas much as we have done, and many of them arrived at this place in a far\r\nworse State; and yet not one of the Ships took any water in at Princes\r\nIsland. The same may be said of the Harcourt Indiaman, Captain Paul, who\r\nsail'd from Batavia soon after our arrival, directly for the Coast of\r\nSumatra; we afterwards heard that she, in a very short time, lost by\r\nSickness above 20 men; indeed, this seem to have been a year of General\r\nSickness over most parts of India, the Ships from Bengal and Madrass\r\nbring Melancholly Accounts of the Havock made there by the united force\r\nof Sickness and famine.\r\n\r\nSome few days after we left Java we saw, for 3 or 4 evenings succeeding\r\none another, boobies fly about the ship. Now, as these birds are known to\r\nroost every night on land they seem'd to indicate that some Island was in\r\nour neighbourhood; probably it might be the Island Selam, which Island I\r\nfind differently laid down in different Charts, both in Name and\r\nSituation.\r\n\r\nThe variation of the Compass off the West Coast of Java is about 3\r\ndegrees West, which Variation continues, without any sencible difference\r\nin the Common Track of Ships, to the Longitude of 288 degrees West,\r\nLatitude 22 degrees 0 minutes South. After this it begins to increase\r\napace, in so much that in the Longitude of 295 degrees, Latitude 23\r\ndegrees, the Variation was 10 degrees 20 minutes West; in 7 degrees more\r\nof Longitude and one of Latitude it increased 2 degrees; in the same\r\nspace farther to the West it increased 5 degrees; in the Latitude of 28\r\ndegrees and Longitude 314 degrees it was 24 degrees 20 minutes; in the\r\nLatitude 29 degrees and Longitude 317 degrees it was 26 degrees 10\r\nminutes, and continued to be much the same for the space of 10 degrees\r\nfarther to the West; but in the Latitude of 34 degrees, Longitude 333\r\ndegrees we observed it twice to be 28 1/4 degrees West; but this was the\r\ngreatest Variation we observed, for in the Latitude of 35 1/2 degrees,\r\nLongitude 337 degrees, it was 24 degrees, and continued decreasing, so\r\nthat of Cape Laguillas it was 22 degrees 30 minutes and in Table Bay it\r\nwas 20 degrees 30 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have observed of the Current it doth not appear that they are\r\nat all considerable until you draw near the Meridian of Madagascar, for\r\nafter we had made 52 degrees of Longitude from Java head we found, by\r\nobservation, our Error in Longitude was only 2 degrees, and it was the\r\nsame when we had made only 19 degrees. This Error might be owing partly\r\nto a Current setting to the Westward, or, what I thought most likely,\r\nthat we did not make sufficient allowance for the set of the Sea before\r\nwhen we run, and, lastly, the assum'd Longitude of Java head might be\r\nwrong. If any Error lays there it Arises from the imperfection of the\r\nCharts I made use of in reducing the Longitude from Batavia to the above\r\nmentioned Head, for it cannot be doubted but the Longitude of Batavia is\r\nwell Determined. After we had passed the Longitude of 307 degrees we\r\nbegan to find the Effects of the Westerly Currents, for in 3 days our\r\nError in Longitude was 1 degree 5 minutes; its Velocity kept increasing\r\nas we got to the Westward, in so much that for 5 days successively, after\r\nwe had made the land, we were drove to the South-West or South-West by\r\nWest by the Currents not less than 20 Leagues a day; and this continued\r\nuntil we were within 60 or 70 Leagues of the Cape, where we found the\r\nCurrent to set sometimes one way and sometimes another, but mostly to the\r\nWestward.\r\n\r\nAfter the Boobies above mentioned left us we saw no more birds till we\r\ngot nearly abreast of Madagascar, where, in the Latitude of 27 3/4\r\ndegrees, we saw an Albatross. After that time we saw more of these birds\r\nevery day, and in greater numbers, together with several other sorts; one\r\nsort about as big as a Duck, of a very Dark brown Colour, with a\r\nyellowish bill. The number of these birds increased upon us as we\r\napproached the Shore. As soon as we got into Soundings we saw Gannets,\r\nwhich we continued to see as long as we were on the Bank, which stretches\r\noff Laguillas 40 Leagues, and Extends along shore to the Eastward from\r\nCape False, according to some charts, 160 Leagues; the Extent of this\r\nBank is not well known, however, it is useful in directing Shipping when\r\nto haul in to make the land.\r\n\r\n[At Anchor. Table Bay.]\r\n\r\nSaturday, 16th. Variable light Airs all this day. Moor'd the Ship and\r\nStruck Yards and Topmast, and in the morning got all the Sick (28) ashore\r\nto Quarters provided for them, and got off fresh meat and Greens for the\r\nPeople on board.\r\n\r\nSunday, 17th. In the A.M. sail'd for England the Admiral Pocock, Captain\r\nRiddle, by whom I sent Letters to the Admiralty and Royal Society. About\r\nnoon came on a hard, dry Gale from the South-East.\r\n\r\nMonday, 18th. In the P.M. anchored in the offing an English Ship, which\r\nproved to be the Houghton Indiaman from Bengal. In the A.M. it fell\r\nmoderate, and we began to water the Ship.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 19th. Variable Gentle breezes. All this day employ'd repairing\r\nSails, Rigging, Watering, etc.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 20th. In the P.M. Sail'd the Houghton Indiaman, who saluted us\r\nwith 11 Guns, which Complement we returned; this Ship, during her stay in\r\nIndia, lost by sickness between 30 and 40 men, and had at this time a\r\ngood many down with the Scurvey. Other Ships suffer'd in the same\r\nproportion. Thus we find that Ships which have been little more than 12\r\nmonths from England have suffer'd as much or more by Sickness than we\r\nhave done, who have been out near 3 Times as long. Yet their sufferings\r\nwill hardly, if att all, be mentioned or known in England; when, on the\r\nother hand, those of the Endeavour, because the Voyage is uncommon, will\r\nvery probable be mentioned in every News Paper, and, what is not\r\nunlikely, with many Additional hardships we never Experienced; for such\r\nare the disposition of men in general in these Voyages that they are\r\nseldom content with the Hardships and Dangers which will naturally occur,\r\nbut they must add others which hardly ever had existence but in their\r\nimaginations by magnifying the most Trifling accidents and circumstances\r\nto the greatest Hardships and unsurmountable dangers without the imediate\r\ninterposition of Providence, as if the whole merit of the Voyage\r\nconsisted in the Dangers and Hardships they underwent, or that real ones\r\ndid not hapen often enough to give the mind sufficient anxiety. Thus\r\nPosterity are taught to look upon these Voyages as hazardous to the\r\nhighest degree.\r\n\r\nThursday, 21st. Fine Pleasant Weather. Employ'd getting on board water,\r\noverhauling the rigging, and repairing Sails. Sail'd for Batavia a Dutch\r\nShip.\r\n\r\nFriday, 22nd, Saturday, 23rd, Sunday, 24th, Monday, 25th, Tuesday, 26th.\r\nMostly Fine pleasant weather. On the 23rd compleated our water, after\r\nwhich I gave as many of the People leave to go on shore to refresh\r\nthemselves as could be spared at one time.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 27th. Winds variable and clear. Pleasant weather. Sailed for\r\nHolland 4 Sail Dutch Ships.\r\n\r\nThursday, 28th, Friday, 29th. Ditto weather. Employ'd fixing new Topmast\r\nand Backstays, repairing Sails, etc.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 30th. In the P.M. anchor'd here the Duke of Gloucester, English\r\nEast India Ship from China. In the Evening a prodigious hard gale of wind\r\ncame on at South-East, which continued till about 3 o'clock in the\r\nMorning. During the Gales the Table Mountains and Adjacent Hills were\r\ncap'd with Extraordinary while Clouds; the remainder of the Day light\r\nAirs and pleasant weather.\r\n\r\nSunday, 31st. Clear pleasant weather all this day. In the Morning we got\r\non board a whole Ox, which we cut up and salted. I had eat ashore some of\r\nas good and Fat Beef as ever I eat in my life, and was told that I might\r\nhave as good to salt; but in this I was very much disappointed. The one I\r\ngot was thin and Lean, yet well taisted; it weighed 408 pounds.\r\n\r\n[April 1771.]\r\n\r\nMonday, April 1st. In the P.M. I observed a dark, dence haze like a Fog\r\nbank in the South-East Horizon, and which clouds began to gather over the\r\nTable Mountain; certain signs of an approaching gale from the same\r\nQuarter, which about 4 o'clock began to blow with great voialance, and\r\ncontinued more or less so the Remainder of these 24 Hours, the Table\r\nMountain cap'd with White Clouds all the time. The weather dry and clear.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 2nd. First part fresh Gales at South-East, the remainder little\r\nwind and calms. In the P.M. sail'd for England the Duke of Gloucester\r\nIndiaman, who Saluted us at his departure. In the A.M. anchored here 2\r\nDutch Ships from Batavia, and a third at Anchor under Penguin Island in\r\ndistress. Put on shore some Sick People.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 3rd. Fine, pleasant weather. Some people on shore on Liberty\r\nto refresh; the rest Employ'd repairing Sails and overhauling the\r\nRigging.\r\n\r\nThursday, 4th. Ditto Weather. Employ'd Painting the Ship and paying her\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nFriday, 5th. Var'ble light winds. Sail'd for Holland 3 Dutch Ships.\r\nEmploy'd as above, and getting on board Provisions, etc.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 6th. Gentle breezes, with some rain in the Night.\r\n\r\nSunday, 7th. Gentle breezes, and fine, pleasant weather; a Signal for\r\nsome Ships being in the offing.\r\n\r\nMonday, 8th. Gentle Breezes from the Westward. In the Night Anchor'd here\r\nthe Europa, an English East Indiaman from Bengal, and in the Morning she\r\nsaluted us with 11 Guns, which Complement we return'd.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 9th. Little wind at South-West, with Foggy, hazey weather.\r\nEmploy'd making ready for Sea.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 10th. Gentle breezes at South-South-East and fair weather.\r\nTook on board 11 of our people from Sick Quarters.\r\n\r\nThursday, 11th. Ditto weather. Employ'd getting on board various Articles\r\nof Provisions from the Shore.\r\n\r\nFriday, 12th. Wind at South-West, fair weather. Set up the Topmast\r\nrigging, and bent the Sails.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 13th. Fresh breezes at South-West, and Cloudy, hazey weather,\r\nin the night Anchor'd here a Dutch Ship from Holland; she sail'd about 3\r\nmonths ago in company with 2 more. The news brought by this Ship is that\r\na War is dayley expected between England and Spain; Signals out for 4 or\r\n5 Sail more being in the Offing, one of which is said to be a ship from\r\nEngland; took leave of the Gouvernour, intending to Sail to-morrow.\r\n\r\nSunday, 14th. Wind Westerly, gentle breezes. In the P.M. got all the Sick\r\non board, many of whom are yet in a very bad state of health; 3 died\r\nhere, but this loss was made up by the opportunity we had of compleating\r\nour full complement. In the morning unmoor'd and got ready for Sailing.\r\n\r\nMonday, 15th. None of the Ships in the Offing are yet arrived. Desirous\r\nas we must be of hearing news from England, I detemmin'd not to wait the\r\narrival of these Ships, but took the advantage of a breeze of wind from\r\nthe West-South-West; weigh'd and stood out of the Bay, saluted with 13\r\nGuns, which Complement was return'd both by the Castle and Dutch\r\nCommodore. The Europa Saluted us as we passed her, which we return'd.\r\nThis Ship was to have sail'd with or before us, but not liking the\r\nopportunity she lay fast. At 5 in the Evening anchor'd under Penguin or\r\nRobin Island in 10 fathoms water, the Island extending from\r\nWest-North-West to South-South-West, distant 1 1/2 or 2 miles.\r\n\r\nIn the Morning saw a Ship standing into Table Bay, under English Colours,\r\nwhich we took to be an Indiaman; at Noon Latitude observed 33 degrees 49\r\nminutes South; Cape Town South 20 degrees East, distant 7 miles. As we\r\ncould not Sail in the Morning for want of wind, I sent a Boat to the\r\nIsland for a few Trifling Articles we had forgot to take in at the Cape,\r\nbut the people on shore would not permit her to land, so that she\r\nreturn'd as she went, and I gave myself no further Trouble at it. Mr.\r\nBanks, who was in the Boat, was of opinion that it was owing to a mistake\r\nmade respecting the rank of the Officer commanding the Boat; be this as\r\nit may, it seems probable that the Dutch do not admit of Strangers\r\nlanding upon this Island least they should carry off some of those people\r\nwhich, for certain crimes, they Banish here for Life, as we were told was\r\ndone by a Danish Ship a few years ago. But they might have a better\r\nreason for refusing our Boat to land, for it is not improbable but what\r\nthere might be some English Seamen upon this Island whom they had sent\r\nfrom the Cape while we lay there, well knowing that if they came in my\r\nway I should take them on board; and this, I am told, is frequently done\r\nwhen any of His Majesty's Ships are in the Bay, for it is well known that\r\nthe Dutch East India Ships are mostly mann'd by Foreigners.\r\n\r\n[Remarks on Cape of Good Hope.]\r\n\r\nThe Cape of Good Hope hath been so often discribed by Authors, and is so\r\nwell known to Europeans, that any discription I can give of it may appear\r\nunnecessary. However, I cannot help observing that most Authors,\r\nparticularly the Author of Mr. Byron's voyage, have heightened the\r\npicture to a very great degree above what it will bear; so that a\r\nStranger is at once struck with surprise and disappointment, for no\r\nCountry we have seen this voyage affords so barren a prospect as this,\r\nand not only so in appearance, but in reality.\r\n\r\nThe land over the Cape which constitutes the Peninsula form'd by Table\r\nBay on the North, and False Bay on the South, consists of high barren\r\nMountains; behind these to the East, or what may be called the Isthmus,\r\nis a vast extensive plane, not one thousand part of which either is or\r\ncan be cultivated. The Soil consists mostly of a light kind of Sea sand,\r\nproducing hardly anything but heath; every inch of Ground that will bear\r\nCultivation is taken up in Small Plantations, consisting of Vineyards,\r\nOrchards, Kitchen Gardens, etc. Hardly any 2 lay together, but are\r\ndispers'd from one another at some Distance. If we may judge from\r\ncircumstances, the Interior Parts of this Country is not more fertile;\r\nthat is, the fertile land bears a very small proportion to the whole. We\r\nwere told that they have settlements 28 days' journey inland, which is\r\ncomputed at 900 English Miles, and thus far they bring Provisions to the\r\nCape by land. It is also said that the Dutch Farmers are so dispers'd\r\nabout the country that some have no neighbours within 4 or 5 days'\r\nJourneys of them. Admitting these to be facts, and it will at once appear\r\nthat the Country in General cannot be very fertile, for it would be\r\nabsurd to suppose that they would raise provisions at such an immence\r\ndistance, where the trouble and expence of bringing them to Market must\r\nincrease, in proportion, could it be done nearer. The Dutch assign\r\nanother reason for being obliged to extend their Scattered Settlements so\r\nfar in land; which is, they never disturb the Original native, but always\r\nleave them in peaceable possession of whatever lands they may have\r\nappropriated to their own use, which in some places is pretty Extensive,\r\nand that probably none of the worst, by which good Policy the new\r\nSettlers very seldom if ever meet with any Disturbance from the Natives;\r\non the contrary, many of them become their Servants, and mix among them,\r\nand are useful members to Society.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many disadvantages this Country labours under, such\r\nis the industry, economy, and good management of the Dutch that not only\r\nthe necessary, but all the Luxuries, of Life are raised here in as great\r\nabundance, and are sold as cheap, if not cheaper, then in any part of\r\nEurope, some few Articles excepted. Naval Stores, however, do not want\r\nfor price any more here than they do at Batavia; these are only sold by\r\nthe company, who have a certain fix'd exorbitant Price, from which they\r\nnever deviate.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Cape Town are in General well bred and Extreamly\r\nCivil and Polite to all Strangers; indeed, it is their Interest so to do,\r\nfor the whole Town may be considered as one great Inn fitted up for the\r\nreception of all Comers and goers. Upon the whole, there is perhaps not a\r\nplace in the known World that can Equal this in Affording refreshments of\r\nall kinds to Shipping. The Bay is Capacious, pretty safe, and Commodious;\r\nit lies open to the North-West winds, which winds, we are told, very\r\nseldom blow very Strong,* (* In the winter months these winds are very\r\nstrong, and make the anchorage in Table Bay anything but safe.) but\r\nsometimes sends in a Great Sea, for which reason Ships moor North-East\r\nand South-West, and in such a manner as to have an Open Hawse with\r\nNorth-West winds. The South-East winds blow frequently with great\r\nViolence; but as this is right out of the Bay it is attended with no\r\ndanger. Near the Town is a wharfe built of wood, run out a proper\r\nDistance into the Sea for the Conveniency of landing and Shipping off\r\ngoods. To this wharfe water is convey'd in pipes and by means of Cocks.\r\nSeveral Boats may fill water at one and the same time. The Company keeps\r\nseveral large Boats or Hoys to carry goods, provisions, water, etc., to\r\nand from Shipping, as well Strangers as their own. Fuel is one of the\r\nScarcest articles they have, and is brought a long way out of the\r\nCountry, and Consists of Roots of Trees, Shrubs, etc. Except a few\r\nEnglish Oaks which they have planted, this Country is wholly destitute of\r\nwood, except at too great a distance to be brought to the Cape.* (* Since\r\nCook's day large plantations have been made in the vicinity of Capetown.)\r\nIn the Article Timber, Boards, etc., they are chiefly supply'd from\r\nBatavia.\r\n\r\n3 of the winter months, viz., from the middle of May to the middle of\r\nAugust, the Dutch do not allow any of their Ships to lay in Table Bay,\r\nbut oblige them to go into False Bay, where there is a very safe\r\nHarbour,* (* Simon's Bay, now the naval station, where there is a\r\ndockyard.) and every other Conveniency both for their own Shipping and\r\nStrangers, and where every produce of the Country can be had as cheap as\r\nat the Cape Town. The Dutch, I am told, never Deviate from this custom of\r\nsending their ships to False Bay at this Season of the Year,\r\nnotwithstanding there had not a Gale of wind hapned for many years that\r\nwould have put them in the least Danger in Table Bay.\r\n\r\nTable Bay is defended by a Square Fort, situated on the East side of the\r\nTown, close to the Sea beach, together with several other out works and\r\nBatterys along the Shore of the Bay on each side of the Town. They are so\r\nsituated as to be cannonaded by Shipping, and are in a manner defenceless\r\nagainst a superior land force. The Garrison at present consists of 800\r\nregulars, besides Militia of the Country, which comprehend every man able\r\nto bear Arms. They can, by means of Signals, alarm the whole Country in a\r\nvery short time, and then every man is immediately to repair to the Cape\r\nTown. The French at Mauritius are supply'd with large Quantitys of\r\nProvisions from the Cape, viz., Salted Beef, Biscuit, Flour, and wine.\r\nWhile we lay in the Bay 2 Store Ships belonging to the King, of the\r\nBurthen of 50 or 60 Gun Ships, and a Snow, sail'd for that Island Loaded\r\nwith Provisions, besides a large (King's) Frigate we left in the Bay\r\ntaking in her Cargo. The Provisions contracted for this Year by the\r\nFrench were Salt Beef, 500,000 pounds; Flour, 400,000 pounds; Biscuit,\r\n400,000 pounds; and Wine, 1,200 Leagers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. CAPE OF GOOD HOPE TO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n[April 1771.]\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, 16th. At 2 o'clock in the P.M. saw a large Ship behind the\r\nIsland, under French Colours, standing into Table Bay; at 3 weigh'd with\r\na Light breeze at South-East, and put to Sea; at 4 departed this Life Mr.\r\nRobert Molineux Master, a young man of good parts, but had unfortunately\r\ngiven himself up to Extravagancy and intemperance, which brought on\r\ndisorders that put a Period to his Life. At 6 we had the Table Mountain\r\nand the Penguin Island in one bearing South-South-East, distant from the\r\nlatter about 4 or 5 Leagues; had it calm most part of the night. In the\r\nmorning a light breeze sprung up Southerly, with which we steer'd\r\nNorth-West; at noon we were by Observation in Latitude 33 degrees 30\r\nminutes South. The Table Mountain bore South 54 degrees East, distant 14\r\nLeagues. N.B. The Table Mountain lies directly over the Cape Town, from\r\nwhich last I take my departure; it lies in the Latitude of 33 degrees 56\r\nminutes South, and Longitude 341 degrees 37 minutes West from Greenwich.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 17th.

At St. Helena.]\r\n\r\nWednesday, May 1st. Fresh Trade and Pleasant weather. At 6 A.M. saw the\r\nIsland of St. Helena bearing West, distant 8 or 9 Leagues. At Noon\r\nAnchor'd in the Road, before James's Fort, in 24 fathoms water. Found\r\nriding here His Majesty's Ship Portland and Swallow* (* This was not the\r\nsame Swallow that preceded Cook in circumnavigation. She had been broken\r\nup.) Sloop, and 12 Sail of Indiaman. At our first seeing the Fleet in\r\nthis Road we took it for granted that it was a War; but in this we were\r\nsoon agreeably deceived. The Europa Indiaman Anchor'd here a little\r\nbefore us; she sail'd from the Cape 2 days after us, and brings an\r\naccount the French Ship we saw standing into Table Bay was a French Man\r\nof War, of 64 Guns, bound to India, and that there were 2 more on their\r\nPassage. Wind South-East. At noon at Anchor in St. Helena Road.\r\n\r\nThursday, 2nd. Clear, Pleasant weather. In the P.M. moor'd with the Kedge\r\nAnchor, and in the A.M. received some few Officers' stores from the\r\nPortland. Wind Ditto. At noon at Anchor in St. Helena Road.\r\n\r\nFriday, 3rd. Clear, Pleasant weather. Employ'd repairing Sails,\r\noverhauling the Rigging, etc. Wind South-East. At noon at Anchor in St.\r\nHelena Road.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 4th. Little wind and pleasant weather. At 6 A.M. the Portland\r\nmade the Signal to unmoor, and at Noon to Weigh, at which time the Ships\r\nbegan to get under Sail. Wind Ditto. At noon at Anchor in St. Helena\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nSunday, 5th. Gentle breezes and Clear weather. At 1 P.M. weigh'd, and\r\nstood out of the Road in company with the Portland and 12 Sail of\r\nIndiamen. At 6 o'clock James Fort, St. Helena, bore East 1/2 South,\r\ndistant 3 Leagues. In the A.M. found the Variation to be 13 degrees 10\r\nminutes West. Wind East by South; course North 50 degrees 30 minutes\r\nWest; distance 71 miles; latitude 15 degrees 5 minutes South, longitude 6\r\ndegrees 46 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 6th. Moderate breezes and Cloudy weather. Sailing in Company with\r\nthe Fleet.

At 6 in the A.M. saw the Island of Ascention bearing\r\nNorth-North-West, distant 7 Leagues. Made the Signal to speak with the\r\nPortland, and soon after Captain Elliott himself came on board, to whom I\r\ndeliver'd a Letter for the Admiralty, and a Box containing the Ship's\r\nCommon Log Books, and some of the Officers' Journals, etc. I did this\r\nbecause it seem'd probable that the Portland would get home before us, as\r\nwe sail much heavier than any of the Fleet.* (* The Portland and the\r\nIndia fleet got home three days before the Endeavour.) At Noon the Island\r\nof Ascention bore East by South, distant 4 or 5 Leagues. By our\r\nObservations it lies in the Latitude of 7 degrees 54 minutes South, and\r\nLongitude of 14 degrees 18 minutes West. A North-West by North course by\r\nCompass, or North-West a little Westerly by the Globe from St. Helena,\r\nwill bring you directly to this Island. Wind Ditto; course North-West;\r\ndistance 120 miles; latitude 7 degrees 51 minutes South, longitude 14\r\ndegrees 32 minutes West.\r\n\r\nFriday, 11th. A steady Trade wind and pleasant Weather.

Hoisted a Boat out, and sent on board the Houghton for the Surgeon,\r\nMr. Carret, in order to look at Mr. Hicks, who is so far gone in a\r\nConsumption that his Life is dispair'd of. Observation at Noon 16 Miles\r\nto the Northward of the Log. Wind South-East to South by East; course\r\nNorth 20 degrees West; distance 98 miles; latitude 4 degrees 32 minutes\r\nNorth, longitude 21 degrees 58 minutes West.\r\n\r\n[With India Fleet.

Little wind, with some heavy showers of rain. At 2 p.m.\r\nhad some Observations of the Sun and Moon, which gave the Longitude 24\r\ndegrees 50 minutes West, 2 degrees 28 minutes West of Account. In the\r\nmorning it was Calm, and the Ships, being near one another, several of\r\nthem had their Boats out to tow. We Observed the Portland to carry out a\r\nlong Warp. I, being desirous to see the Machine they made use of, we\r\nhoisted out a Boat, and Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and myself went on board\r\nher, where we was show'd it. it was made of Canvas, in every respect like\r\nan Umbrello; its Circumference, if extended to a Circle, was 24 feet,\r\ntho' this was a Small one of the Sort; yet Captain Elliot told me that it\r\nwould hold as much as 150 Men could haul. I was so well satisfied of the\r\nUtility of this Machine that I would not have delayed a moment in having\r\none Made had not our Forge been render'd Useless by the loss of some of\r\nits parts. Winds Variable; course North 31 degrees West; distance 35\r\nmiles; latitude 6 degrees 8 minutes North, longitude 25 degrees 8 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nWednesday, 22nd. Variable, unsettled weather, with rain. About 9 o'clock\r\nin the A.M. the Portland shorten'd Sail for the Sternmost Ships to come\r\nup. As we imagin'd, this gave us an Opportunity to get a Head of the\r\nFleet, after which we made such sail as was necessary to keep in Company.\r\nWind Variable; course North-North-West 3/4 West; distance 58 miles;\r\nlatitude 6 degrees 58 minutes North, longitude 25 degrees 38 minutes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThursday, 23rd.

First part Moderate breezes, and hazey, with rain; the\r\nlatter, fresh breezes and fair. At 3 p.m., finding the Fleet to come fast\r\nup with us, we made all the Sail we could. Soon after it became hazey,\r\nand we lost sight of them until near 6, when it clear'd up a little, and\r\nwe saw 3 Sail abreast of us, bearing East about 2 or 3 Miles' Distance;\r\nby this we saw that they not only kept a better wind, but out sail'd us\r\nupon a wind. It became again hazey, and we lost Sight of them, and\r\nnotwithstanding we keept close upon a wind all night, with as much Sail\r\nout as we could bear, there was not one Sail in sight in the Morning.\r\nWind North-East and North-North-East; course North 54 degrees West;\r\ndistance 92 miles; latitude 8 degrees 42 minutes North, 27 degrees 18\r\nminutes West.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 25th.

A Steady Trade and Cloudy Weather. About 1 o'Clock P.M.\r\ndeparted this Life Lieutenant Hicks, and in the Evening his body was\r\ncommitted to the Sea with the usual ceremonys. He died of a Consumption\r\nwhich he was not free from when we sail'd from England, so that it may be\r\ntruly said that he hath been dying ever since, tho' he held out tolerable\r\nwell until we got to Batavia. Wind North-East by North; course North 46\r\ndegrees West; distance 92 miles; latitude 20 degrees 47 minutes North,\r\nlongitude 29 degrees 35 minutes West.\r\n\r\nMonday, 27th.

At 2 p.m. found by observation\r\nthe same Error in our Longitude as Yesterday, which I have now corrected.\r\nThe Longitude of this day is that resulting from Observation. At 10 A.M.\r\nsaw a Sail a head, which we soon came up with, and sent a Boat on board.\r\nShe was a Schooner from Rhoad Island out upon the Whale fishery. From her\r\nwe learnt that all was peace in Europe, and that the America Disputes\r\nwere made up; to confirm this the Master said that the Coat on his back\r\nwas made in old England. Soon after leaving this Vessel we spoke another\r\nfrom Boston, and saw a third, all out on the same account. Wind South to\r\nSouth-West; course North 73 degrees East; distance 127 miles; latitude 40\r\ndegrees 9 minutes North, longitude 36 degrees 44 minutes West.\r\n\r\nThursday, 20th.

In the Morning the Carpenter\r\nreported the Maintopmast to be Sprung in the Cap, which we supposed\r\nhapned in the P.M., when both the Weather Backstays broke. Our Rigging\r\nand Sails are now so bad that something or another is giving way every\r\nday.

She had been 3 days from Scilly, and\r\nreckoned herself in the Longitude of about 10 minutes West, which was\r\nabout 40 minutes to the Westward of what we found ourselves to-day by\r\nObservation. We learnt from this Vessel that no account had been received\r\nin England from us, and that Wagers were held that we were lost. It seems\r\nhighly improbable that the Letters sent by the Dutch Ships from Batavia\r\nshould not come to hand, as it is now 5 months since these Ships sail'd\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope. Wind North-North-East and North-West; course\r\nNorth 50 degrees East; distance 49 miles; latitude 46 degrees 16 minutes\r\nNorth, longitude 9 degrees 39 minutes West per Account, 9 degrees 29\r\nminutes per Observation.\r\n\r\nMonday, 8th.

At 2 in the P.M.\r\nsaw the Lizardland, and at 6 o'clock the lighthouse bore North-West,\r\ndistant 5 Leagues, we being at this time, by my reckoning, in the\r\nLongitude of 5 degrees 30 minutes West; soon after 2 Ships under their\r\nTopsails between us and the land, which we took for Men of War. At 7\r\no'clock in the morning the Start Point bore North-West by North, distant\r\n3 Leagues, and at Noon we reckon'd ourselves about 5 Leagues short of\r\nPortland. This Forenoon a small cutter built vessel came under our Stern,\r\nand inquir'd after the India Fleet, which, they said, they were cruizing\r\nfor and had not seen.\r\n\r\nFriday, 12th. Winds at South-West, a fresh Gale, with which we run\r\nbriskly up Channel. At 1/2 past 3 p.m. passed the Bill of Portland, and\r\nat 7 Peverell Point; at 6 a.m. passed Beachy head at the distance of 4 or\r\n5 miles; at 10 Dungeness, at the distance of 2 miles, and at Noon we were\r\nabreast of Dover.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 13th. At 3 o'clock in the P.M. anchor'd in the Downs, and soon\r\nafter I landed in order to repair to London.\r\n\r\n(Signed) JAMs COOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTCRIPT.\r\n\r\nI HAVE made mention in Book 1st,* (* The Journal was written in thin\r\nbooks, afterwards bound together in England. The page given here is of\r\nthis published copy.) page 76, of 2 Spanish Ships touching at Georges\r\nIsland some months before our Arrival there. Upon our arrival at Batavia\r\nwe were inform'd that 2 French Ships, commanded by the Sieur de\r\nBougainville, had put in there about 2 years before us in their way home\r\nfrom the South Seas. We were told many Circumstances relating to the 2\r\nShips, all tending to prove beyond a doubt that they were the same 2 as\r\nwere at George's Island as above mentioned, which we then conjectur'd to\r\nbe Spaniards, being lead into that mistake by the Spanish Iron, etc., we\r\nsaw among the Natives, and by Toobouratomita pitching upon the Colours of\r\nthat Nation for those they wore, in which he might very easily be\r\nmistaken; but as to the Iron, etc., there might be no mistake, for we\r\nwere told that either one or both of these Ships had put into the River\r\nde la Plata, where they disposed of all their European goods brought for\r\nthat purpose, and purchased others to Trade with the Islanders in the\r\nSouth Sea; and I think we were told that they also touched upon the\r\nSpanish Main in the South Sea. As a proof of their having been trading\r\nwith the Spaniards, Bougainville's Ship had on board a great Quantity of\r\nSpanish Dollars at the time she arrived at and left Batavia, some days\r\nafter our arrival at the Cape of Good Hope. I was told by some French\r\nOfficers, lately come from the Island Mauritius, that Orette, the Native\r\nof George's Island which Bougainville brought away with him, was now at\r\nthe Maritius, and that they were going to fit out a Ship to carry him to\r\nhis Native country, where they intend to make a Settlement; 100 Troops\r\nfor that purpose were to go out in the same Ship. This account is\r\nconfirmed by a French Gentleman we have on board, who has very lately\r\nbeen at the Maritius.* (* This intention was never carried out.) As I\r\nhave no reason to doubt the truth of this account, it leads me to\r\nconsider the rout that this Ship must take, which I think can be no other\r\nthan that of Tasmans as far as the Coast of New Zeland; and if she fall\r\nin with that Coast to the Southward of Cape Farewell will very probably\r\nput into Admiralty Bay, or Queen Charlotte's sound, as Tasman's track\r\nwill in some measure point out to her one or the other of these places. I\r\nthink it is not likely she will venture through the Strait, even suppose\r\nshe discovers it, but will follow Tasman's Track to the North Cape, where\r\nno doubt she will leave him, and follow the direction of the Coast to the\r\nSouth-East, as it will not be out of her way; by which means she will\r\nfall in with the most fertile part of that Country, and as they cannot\r\nknow anything of the Endeavour's voyage, they will not hesitate a moment\r\nto declare themselves the first discoverers. Indeed, I cannot see how\r\nthey can think otherwise, unless the Natives inform them to the contrary,\r\nwhich they may not choose to understand. The French Officers before spoke\r\nof would not allow that George's Island was first discover'd by the\r\nDolphin, though no doubt Bougainville did; but it was not for the\r\nInterest of his Country, nor perhaps his own, to own it. Thus this\r\nIsland, though of little value, may prove a Bone of Contention between\r\nthe 2 Nations, especially if the French make a Settlement upon it, and\r\nthe Dolphin's voyage, and this of ours, published by Authority to fix the\r\nprior right of discovery beyond disputes.\r\n\r\nNow I am upon the Subject of discoveries, I hope it will not be taken\r\namiss if I give it as my opinion that the most feasable method of making\r\nfurther discoveries in the South Sea is to enter it by the way of New\r\nZeland, first touching and refreshing at the Cape of Good Hope; from\r\nthence proceed to the Southward of New Holland for Queen Charlotte's\r\nSound, where again refresh Wood and water, taking care to be ready to\r\nleave that place by the latter end of September, or beginning of October\r\nat farthest, when you would have the whole Summer before you, and after\r\ngetting through the Strait, might, with the prevailing Westerly Winds,\r\nrun to the Eastward in as high a Latitude as you please, and if you meet\r\nwith no lands would have time enough to get round Cape Horne before the\r\nSummer was too far spent; but if after meeting with no Continent, and you\r\nhad other objects in view, then haul to the Northward, and after visiting\r\nsome of the Islands already discovered, after which proceed with the\r\ntrade wind back to the Westward in search of those before mentioned--thus\r\nthe discoveries in the South Sea would be compleat.* (* This programme\r\nCook carried out in his second voyage in the most complete manner\r\npossible.)\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nAdmiralty, Letters to, 357, 379.\r\n\r\nAgulhas:\r\nCape, 375.\r\nCurrent, 373.\r\n\r\nAlbatrosses, 46, 47, 128.\r\n\r\nAnchors, Loss of, 276, 327.\r\n\r\nAnchor-stocks eaten by worms, 86.\r\n\r\nArru Islands, 336.\r\n\r\nAscension Island, 387.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA, EAST COAST OF:\r\nAnimals, 318.\r\nAppearance of, 252, 265, 267, 272, 294, 317.\r\nBedford, Cape, 292.\r\nBirds, 318.\r\nBooby Island, 314.\r\nBotany Bay, 242 to 248.\r\nBustard Bay, 258, 260.\r\nCanoes, 243, 321.\r\nCapricorn, Cape, 260.\r\nCleveland Bay, 270.\r\nCook's Passage, 301.\r\nCornwall, Cape, 313.\r\nDamage to ship, 280, 281, 284.\r\nDanger Point, 253.\r\nDanger, Ships in, 253, 254, 262, 263, 267, 274, 278, 279, 303, 328.\r\nDangerous navigation through the reefs, 306 to 310.\r\n  Description of, 317.\r\nDromedary, Mount and Point, 239.\r\nEndeavour Reef, 274, 276.\r\nEndeavour River, 279.\r\n  Sail from, 292.\r\n  Description of, 293.\r\nEndeavour Strait, 313.\r\n  Description of, 314.\r\nExploration, Remarks on, 305.\r\nFirst attempts at landing, 242.\r\nFish, 318.\r\nFlattery, Cape, 297.\r\nFruits, 318.\r\nGlass houses, 254.\r\nGloucester, Cape, 269.\r\nGrafton, Cape, 273.\r\nGrenville, Cape, 307.\r\nHicks Point, 237.\r\nHillsborough, Cape, 267.\r\nHistorical notes, 325.\r\nHope Islands, 277.\r\nHouses, 321.\r\nHowe, Cape, 238.\r\nJackson Port, 249.\r\nJervis Bay, 241.\r\nKangaroo, 280, 281, 287, 291, 294.\r\nLanguage, 322.\r\nLizard island, 298.\r\nLookout Point, 298.\r\nMagnetic Island, 271.\r\nMoreton Bay, 254.\r\nNatives, 239, 242, 244, 245, 248, 272, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 311, 312,\r\n319, 320, 323.\r\nNew South Wales, name bestowed, 312.\r\nPalmerston, Cape, 267.\r\nPigeon House, 239.\r\nPossession Island, 311.\r\nProvidential Channel, 304.\r\nRays (fish), 247, 291, 295.\r\nRockingham Bay, 272.\r\nSandy Cape, 256.\r\nShip aground, 274 to 276, 279.\r\nShip beached for repair, 280.\r\nSighted, 237.\r\nSmoky Cape, 251.\r\nStephens Port, 250.\r\nThirsty Sound, 264.\r\nTides, Observations on, 267, 268, 312, 324.\r\nTimber, 318.\r\nTorres Straits, Doubts of existence of, 301, 302, 306, 314, 335.\r\nTownshend, Cape, 263.\r\nTribulation, Cape, 274.\r\nUpstart, Cape, 270.\r\nWeapons, 320.\r\nWeymouth, Cape, 306.\r\nWhitsunday Passage, 269.\r\nYork, Cape, 310.\r\n\r\nBanks, Mr., 2, 19, 38, 61, 63, 65, 72, 75, 76, 79, 81, 82, 87, 88, 111,\r\n114, 115, 128, 130, 140, 165, 167, 184, 186, 200, 217, 225, 242, 245,\r\n247, 259, 285, 288, 298, 311, 329, 332, 362, 377, 382.\r\n\r\nBatavia, 353 to 364:\r\nDescription of, 363.\r\nSickly climate of, 359, 362, 364, 372.\r\n\r\nBoats, Preservation of, 74.\r\n\r\nBolabola:\r\nDescription of, 117.\r\nPassed, 113.\r\n\r\nBoobies, 257, 314, 336, 378.\r\n\r\nBoot-topping, 19.\r\n\r\nBougainville, 314:\r\nHis visit to Tahiti, 72, 76, 101, 314, 395.\r\n\r\nBow island, 56.\r\n\r\nBuchan, Mr., Artist, Death of, 64.\r\n\r\nCanoes:\r\nAustralian, 243, 321.\r\nNew Zealand, 221, 222.\r\nSociety Islands, 118.\r\nTahiti, 97.\r\nVoyages in, 119, 121.\r\n\r\nCape Colony, Remarks on, 382.\r\n\r\nCape Pigeons.
