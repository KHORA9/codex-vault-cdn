Ils reduisent a chercher la celebrite ceux qui\r\nse seraient contentes des affections: eh bien! il faut l'atteindre. Ces\r\nessais ambitieux ne porteront point remede aux peines de l'ame; mais ils\r\nhonoreront la vie. La consacrer a l'espoir toujours trompe du bonheur,\r\nc'est la rendre encore plus infortunee. Il vaut mieux reunir tous ses\r\nefforts pour descendre avec quelque noblesse, avec quelque reputation,\r\nla route qui conduit de la jeunesse a la mort.\r\n\r\n                    MADAME DE STAEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR TO THE READER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese little sketches (they can pretend to no higher title,) are\r\nsubmitted to the public with a feeling of timidity almost painful.\r\n\r\nThey are absolutely without any other pretension than that of\r\nexhibiting, in a small compass and under one point of view, many\r\nanecdotes of biography and criticism, and many beautiful poetical\r\nportraits, scattered through a variety of works, and all tending to\r\nillustrate a subject in itself full of interest,--the influence which\r\nthe beauty and virtue of women have exercised over the characters and\r\nwritings of men of genius. But little praise or reputation attends the\r\nmere compiler, but the pleasure of the task has compensated its\r\ndifficulty;--\"song, beauty, youth, love, virtue, joy,\" these \"flowers of\r\nParadise,\" whose growth is not of earth, were all around me; I had but\r\nto gather them from the intermingling weeds and briars, and to bind them\r\ninto one sparkling wreath, consecrated to the glory of women and the\r\ngallantry of men.\r\n\r\nThe design which unfolded itself before me, as these little sketches\r\nextended gradually from a few memoranda into volumes, is not completed;\r\nmuch has been omitted, much suppressed. If I have paused midway in my\r\ntask, it is not for want of materials, which offer themselves in almost\r\nexhaustless profusion--nor from want of interest in the subject--the\r\nmost delightful in which the imagination ever revelled! but because I\r\ndesponded over my own power to do it justice. I know, I feel that it\r\nrequired more extensive knowledge of languages, more matured judgment,\r\nmore critical power, more eloquence;--only Madame de Stael could have\r\nfulfilled my conception of the style in which it ought to have been\r\ntreated. It was enthusiasm, not presumption, which induced me to attempt\r\nit. I have touched on matters, on which there are a variety of tastes\r\nand opinions, and lightly passed over questions on which there are\r\nvolumes of grave \"historic doubts;\" but I have ventured on no\r\ndiscussion, still less on any decision. I have been satisfied merely to\r\nquote my authorities; and where these exhibited many opposing facts and\r\nopinions, it seemed to me that there was far more propriety and much\r\nless egotism in simply expressing, in the first person, what I thought\r\nand felt, than in asserting absolutely that a thing _is so_, or _is said\r\nto be so_. Every one has a right to have an opinion, and deliver it with\r\nmodesty; but no one has a right to clothe such opinions in general\r\nassertions, and in terms which seem to insinuate that they are or ought\r\nto be universal. I know I am open to criticism and contradiction on a\r\nthousand points; but I have adhered strictly to what appeared to me the\r\ntruth, and examined conscientiously all the sources of information that\r\nwere open to me.\r\n\r\nThe history of this little book, were it worth revealing, would be the\r\nhistory, in miniature, of most human undertakings: it was begun with\r\nenthusiasm; it has been interrupted by intervals of illness, idleness,\r\nor more serious cares; it has been pursued through difficulties so\r\ngreat, that they would perhaps excuse its many deficiencies; and now I\r\nsee its conclusion with a languor almost approaching to despair;--at\r\nleast with a feeling which, while it renders me doubly sensitive to\r\ncriticism, and apprehensive of failure, has rendered me almost\r\nindifferent to success, and careless of praise.\r\n\r\nI owe four beautiful translations from the Italian (which are noticed in\r\ntheir proper places,) to the kindness of a living poet, whose justly\r\ncelebrated name, were I allowed to mention it, would be subject of pride\r\nto myself, and double the value of this little book. I have no other\r\nassistance of any kind to acknowledge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWill it be thought unfeminine or obtrusive, if I add yet a few words?\r\n\r\nI think it due to truth and to myself to seize this opportunity of\r\nsaying, that a little book published three years ago, and now perhaps\r\nforgotten, was not written for publication, nor would ever have been\r\nprinted but for accidental circumstances.\r\n\r\nThat the title under which it appeared was not given by the writer, but\r\nthe publisher, who at the time knew nothing of the author.\r\n\r\nAnd that several false dates, and unimportant circumstances and\r\ncharacters were interpolated, to conceal, if possible, the real purport\r\nand origin of the work. Thus the intention was not to create an\r\nillusion, by giving to fiction the appearance of truth, but, in fact, to\r\ngive to truth the air of fiction. I was not _then_ prepared for all that\r\na woman must meet and endure, who once suffers herself to be betrayed\r\ninto authorship. She may repent at leisure, like a condemned spirit; but\r\nshe has passed that barrier from which there is no return.\r\n\r\nC'est assez,--I will not add a word more, lest it should be said that I\r\nhave only disclaimed the title of the _Ennuyee_, to assume that of the\r\n_Ennuyeuse_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nOF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  Page\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nA POET'S LOVE                                                        1\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nLOVES OF THE CLASSIC POETS                                           7\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE LOVES OF THE TROUBADOURS                                        14\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTHE LOVES OF THE TROUBADOURS (continued)                            34\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nGUIDO CAVALCANTI AND MANDETTA.--CINO DA PISTOJA AND SELVAGGIA       55\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nLAURA                                                               64\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nLAURA AND PETRARCH (continued)                                      85\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nDANTE AND BEATRICE PORTINARI                                       105\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nDANTE AND BEATRICE (continued)                                     125\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nCHAUCER AND PHILIPPA PICARD.--KING JAMES AND LADY JANE BEAUFORT    133\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nLORENZO DE' MEDICI AND LUCRETIA DONATI                             161\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE FAIR GERALDINE                                                 185\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nARIOSTO, GINEVRA, AND ALESSANDRA STROZZI                           198\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nSPENSER'S ROSALIND.

It is not enough that in his imagination he has\r\ndeified her--that he has consecrated his faculties to her honour--that\r\nhe has burned his heart in incense upon the altar of her perfections:\r\nthe divinity thus decked out in richest and loveliest hues, he places on\r\nhigh, and calls upon all ages and all nations to bow down before her,\r\nand all ages and all nations obey! worshipping the beauty thus enshrined\r\nin imperishable verse, when others, perhaps as fair, and not less\r\nworthy, have gone down, unsung, \"to dust and an endless darkness.\" How\r\nmany women who would otherwise have stolen through the shades of\r\ndomestic life, their charms, virtues, and affections buried with them,\r\nhave become objects of eternal interest and admiration, because their\r\nmemory is linked with the brightest monuments of human genius? While\r\nmany a high-born dame, who once moved, goddess-like, upon the earth, and\r\nbestowed kingdoms with her hand, lives a mere name in some musty\r\nchronicle. Though her love was sought by princes, though with her dower\r\nshe might have enriched an emperor,--what availed it?\r\n\r\n    \"She had no poet--and she died!\"\r\n\r\nAnd how have women repaid this gift of immortality? O believe it, when\r\nthe garland was such as woman is proud to wear, she amply and deeply\r\nrewarded him who placed it on her brow. If in return for being made\r\nillustrious, she made her lover happy,--if for glory she gave a heart,\r\nwas it not a rich equivalent? and if not--if the lover was unsuccessful,\r\nstill the poet had his reward. Whence came the generous feelings, the\r\nhigh imaginations, the glorious fancies, the heavenward inspirations,\r\nwhich raised him above the herd of vulgar men--but from the ennobling\r\ninfluence of her he loved? Through _her_, the world opened upon him with\r\na diviner beauty, and all nature became in his sight but a transcript of\r\nthe charms of his mistress. He saw her eyes in the stars of heaven, her\r\nlips in the half-blown rose. The perfume of the opening flowers was but\r\nher breath, that \"wafted sweetness round about the world:\" the lily was\r\n\"a sweet thief\" that had stolen its purity from her breast. The violet\r\nwas dipped in the azure of her veins; the aurorean dews, \"dropt from the\r\nopening eyelids of the morn,\" were not so pure as her tears; the last\r\nrose-tint of the dying day was not so bright or so delicate as her\r\ncheek. Her's was the freshness and the bloom of the Spring; she consumed\r\nhim to languor as the Summer sun; she was kind as the bounteous Autumn,\r\nor she froze him with her wintry disdain. There was nothing in the\r\nwonders, the splendours, or the treasures of the created universe,--in\r\nheaven or in earth,--in the seasons or their change, that did not borrow\r\nfrom her some charm, some glory beyond its own. Was it not just that the\r\nbeauty she dispensed should be consecrated to her adornment, and that\r\nthe inspiration she bestowed should be repaid to her in fame?\r\n\r\n    For what of thee thy poet doth invent,\r\n    He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.\r\n    He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\r\n    From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,\r\n    But found it in thy cheek; he can afford\r\n    No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.\r\n\r\n       _Then thank him not for that which he doth say,\r\n       Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay!_\r\n\r\n                     SHAKSPEARE'S SONNETS.\r\n\r\nThe theory, then, which I wish to illustrate, as far as my limited\r\npowers permit, is this: that where a woman has been exalted above the\r\nrest of her sex by the talents of a lover, and consigned to enduring\r\nfame and perpetuity of praise, the passion was real, and was merited;\r\nthat no deep or lasting interest was ever founded in fancy or in\r\nfiction; that truth, in short, is the basis of all excellence in amatory\r\npoetry, as in every thing else; for where truth is, there is good of\r\nsome sort, and where there is truth and good, there must be beauty,\r\nthere must be durability of fame. Truth is the golden chain which links\r\nthe terrestrial with the celestial, which sets the seal of heaven on the\r\nthings of this earth, and stamps them to immortality. Poets have risen\r\nup and been the mere fashion of a day, and have set up idols which have\r\nbeen the idols of a day: if the worship be out of date and the idols\r\ncast down, it is because these adorers wanted sincerity of purpose and\r\nfeeling; their raptures were feigned; their incense was bought or\r\nadulterate. In the brain or in the fancy, one beauty may eclipse\r\nanother--one coquette may drive out another, and tricked off in airy\r\nverse, they float away unregarded like morning vapours, which the beam\r\nof genius has tinged with a transient brightness: but let the heart once\r\nbe touched, and it is not only wakened but inspired; the lover kindled\r\ninto the poet, presents to her he loves, his cup of ambrosial praise:\r\nshe tastes--and the woman is transmuted into a divinity. When the\r\nGrecian sculptor carved out his deities in marble, and left us wondrous\r\nand god-like shapes, impersonations of ideal grace unapproachable by\r\nmodern skill, was it through mere mechanical superiority? No;--it was\r\nthe spirit of faith within which shadowed to his imagination what he\r\nwould represent. In the same manner, no woman has ever been truly,\r\nlastingly deified in poetry, but in the spirit of truth and of love!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLOVES OF THE CLASSIC POETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sufficiently an antiquarian or scholar, to trace the muses\r\n\"upward to their spring,\" neither is there occasion to seek our first\r\nexamples of poetical loves in the days of fables and of demi-gods; or in\r\nthose pastoral ages when shepherds were kings and poets: the loves of\r\nOrpheus and Eurydice are a little too shadowy, and those of the royal\r\nSolomon rather too mixed and too mystical for our purpose.--To descend\r\nthen at once to the _classical_ ages of antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed, that as far as women are concerned, we have not much\r\nreason to regard them with reverence. The fragments of the amatory\r\npoetry of the Greeks, which have been preserved to our times, show too\r\nplainly in what light we were then regarded; and graceful and exquisite\r\nas many of them are, they bear about them the taint of degraded morals\r\nand manners, and are utterly destitute of that exalted sentiment of\r\nrespect and tenderness for woman, either individually or as a sex, which\r\nalone can give them value in our eyes.\r\n\r\nI must leave it then to learned commentators to explore and elucidate\r\nthe loves of Sappho and Anacreon. To us unlearned women, they shine out\r\nthrough the long lapse of ages, bright _names_, and little else; a kind\r\nof half-real,--half-ideal impersonations of love and song; the one\r\nenveloped in \"a fair luminous cloud,\" the other \"veiled in shadowing\r\nroses;\" and thus veiled and thus shadowed, by all accounts, they had\r\nbetter remain.\r\n\r\nThe same remark, with the same reservation, applies to the Latin poets.\r\nThey wrote beautiful verses, admirable for their harmony, elegance and\r\nperspicuity of expression; and are studied as models of style in a\r\nlanguage, the knowledge of which, as far as these poets are concerned,\r\nwere best confined to the other sex. They lived in a corrupted age, and\r\ntheir pages are deeply stained with its licentiousness; they inspire no\r\nsympathy for their love, no interest, no respect for the objects of it.\r\nHow, indeed, should that be possible, when their mistresses, even\r\naccording to the lover's painting, were all either perfectly insipid, or\r\nutterly abandoned and odious?[1] Ovid, he who has revealed to mortal\r\nears \"all the soft scandal of the laughing sky,\" and whose gallantry has\r\nbecome proverbial, represents himself as so incensed by the public and\r\nshameless infidelities of his Corinna, that he treats her with the\r\nunmanly brutality of some street ruffian;--in plain language, he beats\r\nher. They are then reconciled, and again there are quarrels, coarse\r\nreproaches, and mutual blows. At length the lady, as might be expected\r\nfrom such tuition, becoming more and more abandoned, this delicate and\r\npoetical lover requests, as a last favour, that she will, for the\r\nfuture, take some trouble to deceive him more effectually; and the fair\r\none, can she do less? kindly consents!\r\n\r\nCynthia, the mistress of Propertius, gets tipsey, overturns the\r\nsupper-table, and throws the cups at her lover's head; he is delighted\r\nwith her _playfulness_: she leaves him to follow the camp with a\r\nsoldier; he weeps and laments: she returns to him again, and he is\r\nenchanted with her amiable condescension. Her excesses are such, that he\r\nis reduced to blush for her and for himself; and he confesses that he is\r\nbecome, for her sake, the laughing-stock of all Rome. Cynthia is the\r\nonly one of these classical loves who seems to have possessed any mental\r\naccomplishments. The poet praises, incidentally, her talents for music\r\nand poetry; but not as if they added to her charms or enhanced her value\r\nin his estimation. The Lesbia[2] of Catullus, whose eyes were red with\r\nweeping the loss of her favourite sparrow, crowned a life of the most\r\nflagitious excesses by poisoning her husband. Of the various ladies\r\ncelebrated by Horace and Tibullus, it would really be difficult to\r\ndiscover which was most worthless, venal, and profligate. These were the\r\nrefined loves of the classic poets!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe passion they celebrated never seems to have inspired one ennobling\r\nor generous sentiment, nor to have lifted them for one moment above the\r\ngrossest selfishness. They had no scruple in exhibiting their mistresses\r\nto our eyes, as doubtless they appeared in their own, degraded by every\r\nvice, and in every sense contemptible; beings, not only beyond the pale\r\nof our sympathy, but of our toleration. Throughout their works, virtue\r\nappears a mere jest: Love stript of his divinity, even by those who\r\nfirst deified him, is what we disdain to call by that name; _sentiment_,\r\nas we now understand the word,--that is, the union of fervent love with\r\nreverence and delicacy towards its object,--a thing unknown and unheard\r\nof,--and all is \"of the earth, earthy.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is for women I write; the fair, pure-hearted, delicate-minded, and\r\nunclassical reader will recollect that I do not presume to speak of\r\nthese poets critically, being neither critic nor scholar; but merely\r\nwith a reference to my subject, and with a reference to my sex. As\r\nmonuments of the language and literature of a great and polished people,\r\nrich with a thousand beauties of thought and style, doubtless they have\r\ntheir value and their merit: but as monuments also of a state of morals\r\ninconceivably gross and corrupt; of the condition of women degraded by\r\ntheir own vices, the vices and tyranny of the other sex, and the\r\nprevalence of the Epicurean philosophy, the tendency of which, (however\r\ndisguised by rhetoric,) was ever to lower the tone of the mind;\r\nconsidered in this point of view, they might as well have all burned\r\ntogether in that vast bonfire of love-poetry which the Doctors of the\r\nChurch raised at Constantinople:--what a flame it must have made![3]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] I need scarcely observe, that the following sketch of the lyrical\r\npoets of Rome is abridged from the analysis of their works, in\r\nGinguene's Histoire Litteraire, vol. 3.\r\n\r\n[2] Clodia, the wife of Quintus Metellus Celer.\r\n\r\n[3] \"J'ai oui dire dans mon enfance a Demetrius Chalcondyle, homme tres\r\ninstruit de tout ce qui regarde la Grece, qui les Pretres avaient eu\r\nassez d'influence sur les Empereurs de Constantinople, pour les engager\r\na bruler les ouvrages de plusieurs anciens poetes Grecs, et en\r\nparticulier de ceux qui parlaient des amours, &c. * * * Ces pretres,\r\nsans doute, montrerent une malveillance honteuse envers les anciens\r\npoetes; mais ils donnerent une grande preuve d'integrite, de probite, et\r\nde religion.\"--ALCYONIUS.\r\n\r\nThis sentiment is put into the mouth of Leo X. at a time when the mania\r\nof classical learning was at its height.--See Roscoe, (Leo X.) and\r\nGinguene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE LOVES OF THE TROUBADOURS.\r\n\r\n    Gente, che d'amor givan ragionando.--PETRARCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe irruptions of the northern nations, among whom our sex was far\r\nbetter appreciated than among the polished Greeks and Romans; the rise\r\nof Christianity, and the institution of chivalry, by changing the moral\r\ncondition of women, gave also a totally different character to the\r\nhomage addressed to them. It was in the ages called gothic and\r\nbarbarous,--in that era of high feelings and fierce passions,--of love,\r\nwar, and wild adventure, that the sex began to take their true station\r\nin society. From the midst of ignorance, superstition, and ferocity,\r\nsprung up that enthusiasm, that exaggeration of sentiment, that\r\nserious, passionate, and imaginative adoration of women, which has\r\nsince, indeed, degenerated into mere gallantry, but was the very\r\nfountain of all that is most elevated and elegant in modern poetry, and\r\nmost graceful and refined in modern manners.\r\n\r\nThe amatory poetry of Provence had the same source with the national\r\npoetry of Spain; both were derived from the Arabians. To them we trace\r\nnot only the use of rhyme, and the various forms of stanzas, employed by\r\nthe early lyric poets, but by a strange revolution, it was from the\r\nEast, where women are now held in seclusion, as mere soulless slaves of\r\nthe passions and caprices of their masters, that the sentimental\r\ndevotion paid to our sex in the chivalrous ages was derived.[4] The\r\npoetry of the Troubadours kept alive and enhanced the tone of feeling on\r\nwhich it was founded; it was cause and effect re-acting on each other;\r\nand though their songs exist only in the collections of the antiquarian,\r\nand the very language in which they wrote has passed away, and may be\r\naccounted _dead_,--so is not the spirit they left behind: as the\r\nfounders of a new school of amatory poetry, we are under obligations to\r\ntheir memory, which throw a strong interest around their personal\r\nadventures, and the women they celebrated.\r\n\r\nThe tenderness of feeling and delicacy of expression in some of these\r\nold Provencal poets, are the more touching, when we recollect that the\r\nwriters were sometimes kings and princes, and often knights and\r\nwarriors, famed for their hardihood and exploits. William, Count of\r\nPoitou, our Richard the First, two Kings of Arragon, a King of Sicily,\r\nthe Dauphin of Auvergne, the Count de Foix, and a Prince of Orange, were\r\nprofessors of the \"gaye science.\" Thibault,[5] Count of Provence and\r\nKing of Navarre, was another of these royal and chivalrous Troubadours,\r\nand his _lais_ and his virelais were generally devoted to the praises of\r\nBlanche of Castile, the mother of Louis the Ninth--the same Blanche whom\r\nShakspeare has introduced into King John, and decked out in panegyric\r\nfar transcending all that her favoured poet and lover could have offered\r\nat her feet.[6]\r\n\r\nThibault did, however, surpass all his contemporaries in refinement of\r\nstyle: he usually concludes his _chansons_ with an _envoi_, or address,\r\nto the Virgin, worded with such equivocal ingenuity, that it is equally\r\napplicable to the Queen of Heaven, or the queen of his earthly\r\nthoughts,--\"La Blanche couronnee.\" There is much simplicity and elegance\r\nin the following little song, in which the French has been modernised.\r\n\r\n    \"Las! si j'avais pouvoir d'oublier\r\n      Sa beaute,--son bien dire,\r\n    Et son tres doux regarder\r\n      Finirait mon martyre!\r\n\r\n    Mais las! mon coeur je n'en puis oter;\r\n    Et grand affolage\r\n    M'est d'esperer;\r\n    Mais tel servage\r\n    Donne courage\r\n    A tout endurer.\r\n\r\n    Et puis comment oublier\r\n      Sa beaute, son bien dire,\r\n    Et son tres doux regarder?\r\n      Mieux aime mon martyre!\"\r\n\r\nPrincesses and ladies of rank entered the lists of poesy, and\r\nvanquished, on almost every occasion, the Troubadours of the other sex.\r\nFor instance, that Countess of Champagne, who presided with such eclat\r\nin one of the courts of love; Beatrice, Countess of Provence, the mother\r\nof four queens, among whom was Berengaria of England; Clara d'Anduse,\r\none of whose songs is translated by Sismondi; a certain Dame\r\nCastellosa, who in a pathetic remonstrance to some ungrateful lover,\r\nassures him that if he forsakes her for another, and leaves her to die,\r\nhe will commit a heinous sin before the face of God and man; that\r\ncharming Comtesse de Die, of whom more presently, and others\r\ninnumerable, \"tout hommes que femmes, la pluspart gentilshommes et\r\nSeigneurs de Places, amoureux des Roynes, Imperatrices, Duchesses,\r\nMarquises, Comtesses, et gentils-femmes; desquelles les maris\r\ns'estimaient grandement heureux quand nos poetes leurs addressaient\r\nquelque chant nouveau en notre langue Provencal.\" The said poets being\r\nrewarded by these debonnaire husbands with rich dresses, horses, armour,\r\nand gold;[7] and by the ladies with praise, thanks, courteous words, and\r\nsweet smiles, and very often, \"altra cosa piu cara.\" The biography of\r\nthese Troubadours generally commences with the same phrase--Such a one\r\nwas \"gentilhomme et chevalier,\" and was \"pris d'amour\" for such a lady,\r\nalways named, who was the wife of such a lord, and in whose honour and\r\npraise he composed \"maintes belles et doctes chansons.\" In these\r\n\"chansons,\"--for all the amatory poetry of those times was sung to\r\nmusic,--we have love and romantic adventure oddly enough mixed up with\r\npiety and devotion, such as were the mode in an age when religion ruled\r\nthe imagination and opinions of men, without in any degree restraining\r\nthe passions, or influencing the conduct. One Troubadour tells us, that\r\nwhen he beholds the face of his mistress, he crosses himself with\r\ndelight and gratitude; another pathetically entreats a priest to\r\ndispense him from his vows of love to a certain lady, whom he loved no\r\nlonger; the lady being the wife of another, one would imagine that the\r\ndispensation should rather have been required in the first instance.\r\nArnaldo de Daniel, unable to soften the obdurate heart of his mistress,\r\nperforms penance, and celebrates six (or as some say, a thousand) masses\r\na day, \"en priant Dieu de pouvoir acquerir la grace de sa dame,\" and\r\nburns lamps before the Virgin, and consecrates tapers for the same\r\npurpose: the lady with whom he is thus piously in love, was Cyberna, the\r\nwife of Guillaume de Bouille. This was something like the incantations\r\nand sacrifices of the classic poets, who familiarly mixed up their\r\nmythology with their amours; but in a spirit as different as the\r\nallegorical cupid of these chivalrous poets is from the winged and\r\nwanton deity of the Greeks and Romans. Pierre Vidal sees a vision of\r\nLove, whom he describes as a young knight, fair and fresh as the day,\r\ncrowned with a wreath of flowers instead of a helmet; and mounted on a\r\npalfrey as white as snow, with a saddle of jasper, and spurs of\r\nchalcedony; his squires and attendants are \"_Mercy_, _Pudeur_, and\r\n_Loyaute_.\" _Sir Cupid_ on horseback, with his saddle and his spurs,\r\nattended by Gentleness, Modesty, and Good Faith, is a novel\r\ndivinity.--Thus, among the Greeks, Love was attended by the Graces, and\r\namong the Troubadours by the Virtues. In the same spirit of allegory,\r\nbut touched with a more classic elegance, we have Petrarch's Cupid,\r\ndriving his fiery car in triumph, followed by a shadowy host of captives\r\nto his power,--the heroes who had confessed and the poets who had sung\r\nhis might.\r\n\r\n    Vidi un vittorioso e sommo duce,\r\n    Pur com' un di color ch' in Campidoglio\r\n    Trionfal carro a gran gloria conduce.\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    Quattro destrier via piu che neve bianchi:\r\n    Sopr' un carro di foco un garzon crudo\r\n    Con arco in mano, e con saeette a' fianchi.\r\n\r\nAnd yet more finished is Spenser's \"Masque of Cupid,\" in the third book\r\nof the Fairy Queen, where Love, as in the antique gem, is mounted on a\r\nlion, preceded by minstrels carolling\r\n\r\n    A lay of love's delight with sweet concent,\r\n\r\nattended by Fancy, Desire, Hope, Fear, and Doubt; and followed by Care,\r\nRepentance, Shame, Strife, Sorrow, &c.--The vivid colours in which these\r\nimaginary personages are depicted, the image of the God \"uprearing\r\nhimself,\" and looking round with disdain on the troop of victims and\r\nslaves who surround him, the rattling of his darts, as he shakes them in\r\ndefiance and in triumph, and \"claps on high his coloured wings twain,\"\r\nforms altogether a most finished and gorgeous picture; such as Rubens\r\nshould have painted, as far as his pencil, rainbow-dipt, could have\r\nreflected the animated pageant to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of passion and boundless devotion to the fair sex,\r\nwhich the Troubadours sang in their lays, they not unfrequently\r\nillustrated by their actions; and while the knowledge of the first is\r\nconfined to a few antiquarians, the latter still survive in the history\r\nand the traditions of their province. One of these (Guillaume de la\r\nTour) having lost the object of his love, underwent, during a whole\r\nyear, the most cruel and unheard-of penances, in the hope that heaven\r\nmight be won to perform a miracle in his favour, and restore her to his\r\narms; at length he died broken-hearted on her tomb.[8] Another,[9]\r\nbeloved by a certain princess, in some unfortunate moment breaks his vow\r\nof fidelity, and unable to appease the indignation of his mistress, he\r\nretires to a forest, builds himself a cabin of boughs, and turns hermit,\r\nhaving first made a solemn vow that he will never leave his solitude\r\ntill he is received into favour by his offended love. Being one of the\r\nmost celebrated and popular Troubadours of his province, all the knights\r\nand the ladies sympathise with his misfortunes: they find themselves\r\nterribly _ennuyes_ in the absence of the poet who was accustomed to\r\nvaunt their charms and their deeds of prowess; and at the end of two\r\nyears they send a deputation, entreating him to return,--but in vain:\r\nthey then address themselves to the lady, and humbly solicit the pardon\r\nof the offender, whose disgrace in her sight, has thrown a whole\r\nprovince into mourning. The princess at length relents, but upon\r\nconditions which appear in these unromantic times equally extraordinary\r\nand difficult to fulfil. She requires that a hundred brave knights, and\r\na hundred fair dames, pledged in love to each other, (s'aimant d'amour)\r\nshould appear before her on their knees, and with joined hands\r\nsupplicate for mercy: the conditions are fulfilled: the fifty pair of\r\nlovers are found to go through the ceremony, and the Troubadour receives\r\nhis pardon.[10]\r\n\r\nThe story of Peyre de Ruer, \"gentilhomme et Troubadour,\" might be termed\r\na satirical romance, did we not know that it is a plain fact, related\r\nwith perfect simplicity. He devotes himself to a lady of the noble\r\nItalian family of Carraccioli, and in her praise he composes, as usual,\r\n\"maintes belles et doctes chansons:\"--but the lady seems to have had a\r\ntaste for magnificence and pleasure; and the poet, in order to find\r\nfavour in her eyes, expends his patrimony in rich apparel, banquets, and\r\n_joustes_ in her honour. The lady, however, continues inexorable; and\r\nPeyre de Ruer takes the habit of a pilgrim and wanders about the\r\ncountry. He arrives in the holy week at a certain church, and desires of\r\nthe cure permission to preach to his congregation of penitents:--he\r\nascends the pulpit, and recites with infinite fervour and grace one of\r\nhis own chansons d'amour,--for, says the chronicle, \"_autre chose ne\r\nscavait_,\" \"he knew nothing better.\" The people mistaking it for an\r\ninvocation to the Virgin Mary or the Saints, are deeply affected and\r\nedified; eyes are seen to weep that never wept before; the most\r\nimpenitent hearts are suddenly softened: he concludes with an\r\nexhortation in the same strain--and then descending from the pulpit,\r\nplaces himself at the door, and holding out his hat for the customary\r\nalms, his delighted congregation fill it to overflowing with pieces of\r\nsilver. Peyre de Ruer forthwith casts off his pilgrim's gown, and in a\r\nnew and splendid dress, and with a new song in his hand, he presents\r\nhimself before the ladye of his love, who charmed by his gay attire not\r\nless than by his return, receives him most graciously, and bestows on\r\nhim \"maintes caresses.\"\r\n\r\nI must observe that the biographer of this Peyre de Ruer, himself a\r\nchurchman, does not appear in the least scandalised or surprised at\r\nthis very novel mode of recruiting his finances and obtaining the favour\r\nof the lady; but gives us fairly to understand, that after such a proof\r\nof _loyaute_ he should have thought it quite contrary to all rule if she\r\nhad still rejected the addresses of this _gentil Troubadour_.\r\n\r\nJauffred (or Geffrey) de Rudel is yet more famous, and his story will\r\nstrikingly illustrate the manners of those times. Rudel was the\r\nfavourite minstrel of Geffrey Plantagenet de Bretagne, the elder brother\r\nof our Richard Coeur de Lion, and like the royal Richard, a patron of\r\nmusic and poetry. During the residence of Rudel at the court of England,\r\nwhere he resided in great honour and splendour, caressed for his talents\r\nand loved for the gentleness of his manners, he heard continually the\r\npraises of a certain Countess of Tripoli; famed throughout Europe for\r\nher munificent hospitality to the poor Crusaders. The pilgrims and\r\nsoldiers of the Cross, who were returning wayworn, sick and disabled,\r\nfrom the burning plains of Asia, were relieved and entertained by this\r\ndevout and benevolent Countess; and they repaid her generosity, with all\r\nthe enthusiasm of gratitude, by spreading her fame throughout\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nThese reports of her beauty and her beneficence, constantly repeated,\r\nfired the susceptible fancy of Rudel: without having seen her, he fell\r\npassionately in love with her, and unable to bear any longer the\r\ntorments of absence, he undertook a pilgrimage to visit this unknown\r\nlady of his love, in company with Bertrand d'Allamanon, another\r\ncelebrated Troubadour of those days. He quitted the English court in\r\nspite of the entreaties and expostulations of Prince Geffrey\r\nPlantagenet, and sailed for the Levant. But so it chanced, that falling\r\ngrievously sick on the voyage, he lived only till his vessel reached the\r\nshores of Tripoli. The Countess being told that a celebrated poet had\r\njust arrived in her harbour, who was dying for her love, immediately\r\nhastened on board, and taking his hand, entreated him to live for her\r\nsake. Rudel, already speechless, and almost in the agonies of death,\r\nrevived for a moment at this unexpected grace; he was just able to\r\nexpress, by a last effort, the excess of his gratitude and love, and\r\nexpired in her arms: thereupon the Countess wept bitterly, and vowed\r\nherself to a life of penance for the loss she had caused to the\r\nworld.[11] She commanded that the last song which Rudel had composed in\r\nher honour, should be transcribed in letters of gold, and carried it\r\nalways in her bosom; and his remains were inclosed in a magnificent\r\nmausoleum of porphyry, with an Arabic inscription, commemorating his\r\ngenius and his love for her.\r\n\r\nIt is in allusion to this well-known story, that Petrarch has introduced\r\nRudel into the Trionfo d'Amore.\r\n\r\n    Gianfre Rudel ch' uso la vela e 'l remo,\r\n    A cercar la suo morte.\r\n\r\nThe song which the minstrel composed when he fell sick on this romantic\r\nexpedition, and found his strength begin to fail, and which the Countess\r\nwore, folded within her vest, to the end of her life, is extant, and has\r\nbeen translated into most of the languages of Europe; of these\r\ntranslations, Sismondi's is the best, preserving the original and\r\ncurious arrangement of the rhymes, as well as the piety, naivete, and\r\ntenderness of the sentiment.\r\n\r\n    Irrite, dolent partirai\r\n    Si ne vois cet amour de loin,\r\n    Et ne sais quand je le verrai\r\n    Car sont par trop nos terres loin.\r\n    Dieu, qui toutes choses as fait\r\n    Et formas cet amour si loin,\r\n    Donne force a mon coeur, car ai\r\n    L'espoir de voir m'amour au loin.\r\n    Ah, Seigneur, tenez pour bien vrai\r\n    L'amour qu'ai pour elle de loin.\r\n    Car pour un bien que j'en aurai\r\n    J'ai mille maux, tant je suis loin.\r\n    Ja d'autr'amour ne jouirai\r\n    Sinon de cet amour de loin--\r\n    Qu'une plus belle je n'en scais\r\n    En lieu qui soit ni pres ni loin!\r\n\r\nMrs. Piozzi and others have paraphrased this little song, but in a\r\nspirit so different from the antique simplicity of the original, that I\r\nshall venture to give a version, which has at least the merit of being\r\nas faithful as the different idioms of the two languages will allow; I\r\nam afraid, however, that it will not appear worthy of the honour which\r\nthe Countess conferred on it.\r\n\r\n    \"Grieved and troubled shall I die,\r\n      If I meet not my love afar;\r\n    Alas! I know not that I e'er\r\n      Shall see her--for she dwells afar.\r\n    O God! that didst all things create,\r\n      And formed my sweet love now afar;\r\n    Strengthen my heart, that I may hope\r\n      To behold her face, who is afar.\r\n    O Lord! believe how very true\r\n      Is my love for her, alas! afar,\r\n    Tho' for each joy a thousand pains\r\n      I bear, because I am so far.\r\n    Another love I'll never have,\r\n      Save only she who is afar,\r\n    For fairer one I never knew\r\n      In places near, nor yet afar.\"\r\n\r\nBertrand d'Allamanon, whom I have mentioned as the companion of Rudel on\r\nhis romantic expedition, has left us a little ballad, remarkable for the\r\nextreme refinement of the sentiment, which is quite a la Petrarque: he\r\ngives it the fantastic title of a _demi chanson_, for a very fantastic\r\nreason: it is thus translated in Millot. (vol. i. 390).\r\n\r\n\"On veut savoir pourquoi je fais une _demi chanson_? c'est parceque je\r\nn'ai qu'un demi sujet de chanter. Il n'y a d'amour que de ma part; la\r\ndame que j'aime ne veut pas m'aimer! mais au defaut des _oui_ qu'elle me\r\nrefuse, je prendrai les _non_ qu'elle me prodigue:--_esperer aupres\r\nd'elle vaut mieux que jouir avec tout autre!_\"\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the sentiment of Petrarch:\r\n\r\n    Pur mi consola, che morir per lei\r\n    Meglio e che gioir d'altra--\r\n\r\nBut it is one of those thoughts which spring in the heart, and might\r\noften be repeated without once being borrowed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Sismondi--Litterature du Midi.\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n    Thibault fut Roi galant et valoureux,\r\n      Ses hauts faits et son rang n'ont rien fait pour sa gloire;\r\n    Mais il fut chansonnier--et ses couplets heureux,\r\n      Nous ont conserve sa memoire.\r\n\r\n                     ANTHOLOGIE DE MONET.\r\n\r\n[6]\r\n    If lusty Love should go in quest of beauty,\r\n    Where should he find it fairer than in Blanche?\r\n    If zealous Love should go in search of virtue,\r\n    Where should he find it purer than in Blanche?\r\n    If Love, ambitious, sought a match of birth,\r\n    Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanche?\r\n\r\n[7] La plus honorable recompence qu'on pouvait faire aux dits poetes,\r\netait qu'on leur fournissait de draps, chevaux, armure, et argent.\r\n\r\n[8] Millot, vol. ii. p. 148.\r\n\r\n[9] Richard de Barbesieu.\r\n\r\n[10] Millot, vol. iii. p. 86.--Ginguene, vol. i. p. 280.\r\n\r\n[11] \"Depuis ne fut jamais veue faire bonne chere,\" says the old\r\nchronicle.--I am tempted to add the description of the first and last\r\ninterview of the Countess and her lover in the exquisite old French, of\r\nwhich the antique simplicity and naivete are untranslateable.\r\n\r\n\"En cet estat fut conduit au port de Trypolly, et la arrive, son\r\ncompagnon feist (_fit_) entendre a la Comtesse la venue du Pelerin\r\nmalade.

As a petty feudal sovereign, he was, partly by\r\nthe events of the age, more by his own fierce and headlong passions,\r\nplunged in continual wars. Nature however had made him a poet of the\r\nfirst order. In these days he would have been another Lord Byron; but he\r\nlived in a terrible and convulsed state of society, and it was only in\r\nthe intervals snatched from his usual pursuits,--that is, from burning\r\nthe castles, and ravaging the lands of his neighbours, and stirring up\r\nrebellion, discord, and bloodshed all around him,--that he composed a\r\nvast number of _lays_, _sirventes_, and _chansons_; some breathing the\r\nmost martial, and even merciless spirit; others devoted to the praise\r\nand honour of his love, or rather loves, as full of submissive\r\ntenderness and chivalrous gallantry.\r\n\r\nHe first celebrated Elinor Plantagenet, the sister of his friend and\r\nbrother in arms and song, Richard Coeur de Lion; and we are expressly\r\ntold that Richard was proud of the poetical homage rendered to the\r\ncharms of his sister by this knightly Troubadour, and that the Princess\r\nwas far from being insensible to his admiration. Only one of the many\r\nsongs addressed to Elinor has been preserved; from which we gather, that\r\nit was composed by Bertrand in the field, at a time when his army was\r\nthreatened with famine, and the poet himself was suffering from the\r\npangs of hunger. Elinor married the Duke of Saxony, and Bertrand chose\r\nfor his next love the beautiful Maenz de Montagnac, daughter of the\r\nViscount of Turenne, and wife of Talleyrand de Perigord. The lady\r\naccepted his service, and acknowledged him as her Knight; but evil\r\ntongues having attempted to sow dissension between the lovers, Bertrand\r\naddressed to her a song, in which he defends himself from the imputation\r\nof inconstancy, in a style altogether characteristic and original. The\r\nwarrior poet, borrowing from the objects of his daily cares, ambition\r\nand pleasures, phrases to illustrate and enhance the expression of his\r\nlove, wishes \"that he may lose his favourite hawk in her first flight;\r\nthat a falcon may stoop and bear her off, as she sits upon his wrist,\r\nand tear her in his sight, if the sound of his lady's voice be not\r\ndearer to him than all the gifts of love from another.\"--\"That he may\r\nstumble with his shield about his neck; that his helmet may gall his\r\nbrow; that his bridle may be too long, his stirrups too short; that he\r\nmay be forced to ride a hard trotting horse, and find his groom drunk\r\nwhen he arrives at his gate, if there be a word of truth in the\r\naccusations of his enemies:--that he may not have a _denier_ to stake at\r\nthe gaming-table, and that the dice may never more be favourable to\r\nhim, if ever he had swerved from his faith:--that he may look on like a\r\ndastard, and see his lady wooed and won by another;--that the winds may\r\nfail him at sea;--that in the battle he may be the first to fly, if he\r\nwho has slandered him does not lie in his throat,\" &c. and so on through\r\nseven or eight stanzas.\r\n\r\nBertrand de Born exercised in his time a fatal influence on the counsels\r\nand politics of England. A close and ardent friendship existed between\r\nhim and young Henry Plantagenet, the eldest son of our Henry the Second;\r\nand the family dissensions which distracted the English Court, and the\r\nunnatural rebellion of Henry and Richard against their father, were his\r\nwork. It happened some time after the death of Prince Henry, that the\r\nKing of England besieged Bertrand de Born in one of his castles: the\r\nresistance was long and obstinate, but at length the warlike Troubadour\r\nwas taken prisoner and brought before the King, so justly incensed\r\nagainst him, and from whom he had certainly no mercy to expect. The\r\nheart of Henry was still bleeding with the wounds inflicted by his\r\nungrateful children, and he saw before him, and in his power, the\r\nprimary cause of their misdeeds and his own bitter sufferings. Bertrand\r\nwas on the point of being led out to death, when by a single word he\r\nreminded the King of his lost son, and the tender friendship which had\r\nexisted between them.[12] The chord was struck which never ceased to\r\nvibrate in the parental heart of Henry; bursting into tears, he turned\r\naside, and commanded Bertrand and his followers to be immediately set at\r\nliberty: he even restored to Bertrand his castle and his lands, \"_in the\r\nname of his dead son_.\" It is such traits as these, occurring at every\r\npage, which lend to the chronicles of this stormy period an interest\r\noverpowering the horror they would otherwise excite: for then all the\r\nbest, as well as the worst of human passions were called into play. In\r\nthis tempestuous commingling of all the jarring elements of society, we\r\nhave those strange approximations of the most opposite\r\nsentiments,--implacable revenge and sublime forgiveness;--gross\r\nlicentiousness and delicate tenderness;--barbarism and\r\nrefinement;--treachery and fidelity--which remind one of that\r\nheterogeneous mass tossed up by a stormy ocean; heaps of pearls,\r\nunvalued gems, wedges of gold, mingled with dead men's bones, and all\r\nthe slimy, loathsome, and monstrous productions of the deep, which\r\nduring a calm remain together concealed and unknown in its unfathomed\r\nabysses.\r\n\r\nTo return from this long similitude to Bertrand de Born: he concluded\r\nhis stormy career in a manner very characteristic of the times; for he\r\nturned monk, and died in the odour of sanctity. But neither his late\r\ndevotion, nor his warlike heroism, nor his poetic fame, could rescue him\r\nfrom the severe justice of Dante, who has visited his crimes and his\r\nviolence with so terrible a judgment, that we forget, while we thrill\r\nwith horror, that the crimes were real, the penance only imaginary.\r\nDante, in one of the circles of the Inferno, meets Bertrand de Born\r\ncarrying his severed head, _lantern wise_, in his hand;--the phantom\r\nlifts it up by the hair, and the ghastly lips unclose to confess the\r\ncause and the justice of this horrible and unheard-of penance.\r\n\r\n      ----Or vedi la pena molesta\r\n    Tu che spirando vai veggendo i morti;\r\n    Vedi s'alcuna e grande come questa.\r\n      E perche tu di me novella porti,\r\n    Sappi ch' i' son Bertram dal Bornio, quelli\r\n    Che diedi al Re giovane i ma' conforti.\r\n      I' feci 'l padre e 'l figlio in se ribelli:\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n      Perch'io partii cosi giunte persone,\r\n    Partito porto il mio cerebro, lasso!\r\n    Dal suo principio ch 'e 'n questo troncone.\r\n      Cosi s'osserva in me lo contrappasso.[13]\r\n\r\n                Now behold\r\n    This grievous torment, thou, who breathing goest\r\n    To spy the dead: behold, if any else\r\n    Be terrible as this,--and that on earth\r\n    Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I\r\n    Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John\r\n    The counsel mischievous. Father and son\r\n    I set at mutual war:----\r\n    Spurring them on maliciously to strife.\r\n    For parting those so closely knit, my brain\r\n    Parted, alas! I carry from its source\r\n    That in this trunk inhabits. Thus the law\r\n    Of retribution fiercely works in me.[14]\r\n\r\nPierre Vidal, whose description of love I have quoted before, was one of\r\nthe most extraordinary characters of his time, a kind of poetical Don\r\nQuixotte:--his brain was turned with love, poetry, and vanity: he\r\nbelieved himself the beloved of all the fair, the mirror of knighthood,\r\nand the prince of Troubadours. Yet in the midst of all his\r\nextravagances, he possessed exquisite skill in his art, and was not\r\nsurpassed by any of the poets of those days, for the harmony, delicacy,\r\nand tenderness of his amatory effusions. He chose for his first love\r\nthe beautiful wife of the Vicomte de Marseilles: the lady, unlike some\r\nof the Princesses of her time, distinguished between the poet and the\r\nman, and as he presumed too far on the encouragement bestowed on him in\r\nthe former capacity, he was banished: he then followed Richard the First\r\nto the crusade. The verses he addressed to the lady from the Island of\r\nCyprus are still preserved. The folly of Vidal, or rather the\r\nderangement of his imagination, subjected him to some of those\r\nmystifications which remind us of Don Quixote and Sancho, in the court\r\nof the laughter-loving Duchess. For instance, Richard and his followers\r\namused themselves at Cyprus, by marrying Vidal to a beautiful Greek girl\r\nof no immaculate reputation, whom they introduced to him as the niece of\r\nthe Greek Emperor. Vidal, in right of his wife, immediately took the\r\ntitle of Emperor, assumed the purple, ordered a throne to be carried\r\nbefore him, and played the most fantastic antics of authority. Nor was\r\nthis the greatest of his extravagances: on his return to Provence, he\r\nchose for the second object of his amorous and poetical devotion, a\r\nlady whose name happened to be Louve de Penautier: in her honour he\r\nassumed the name of _Loup_, and farther to merit the good graces of his\r\n\"_Dame_,\" and to do honour to the name he had adopted, he dressed\r\nhimself in the hide of a wolf, and caused himself to be hunted in good\r\nearnest by a pack of dogs: he was brought back exhausted and half dead\r\nto the feet of his mistress, who appears to have been more moved to\r\nmerriment than to love by this new and ridiculous exploit.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, the Troubadours had seldom reason to complain of\r\nthe cruelty of the ladies to whom they devoted their service and their\r\nsongs. The most virtuous and illustrious women thought themselves\r\njustified in repaying, with smiles and favours, the poetical adoration\r\nof their lovers; and this lasted until the profession of Troubadour was\r\ndishonoured by the indiscretions, follies, and vices of those who\r\nassumed it. Thus Peyrols, a famous Provencal poet, who was distinguished\r\nin the court of the Dauphin d'Auvergne, fell passionately in love with\r\nthe sister of that Prince, (the Baronne de Mercoeur) and the Dauphin,\r\n(himself a Troubadour) proud of the genius of his minstrel and of the\r\npoetical devotion paid to his sister, desired her to bestow on her lover\r\nall the encouragement and favour which was consistent with her dignity.\r\nThe lady, however, either misunderstood her instructions, or found it\r\ntoo difficult to obey them: the seducing talents and tender verses of\r\nthis _gentil Troubadour_ prevailed over her dignity:--Peyrols was\r\nbeloved; but he was not sufficiently discreet. The sudden change in the\r\ntone and style of his songs betrayed him, and he was banished. A great\r\nnumber of his verses, celebrating the Dame de Mercoeur, are preserved\r\nby St. Palaye, and translated by Millot.\r\n\r\nBernard de Ventadour was beloved by Elinor de Guienne, afterwards the\r\nwife of our Henry the Second, and the mother of Richard the First:--I\r\nhave before observed the poetical penchants of all Elinor's children,\r\nwhich they seem to have inherited from their mother.\r\n\r\nSordello of Mantua, whose name is familiar to all the readers of Dante,\r\nas occurring in one of the finest passages of his great poem,[15] was an\r\nItalian, but like all the best poets of his day, wrote in the Provencal\r\ntongue: he is said to have carried off the sister of that modern\r\nPhalaris, the tyrant Ezzelino of Padua. There is a very elegant ballad\r\n(ballata) by Sordello, translated in Millot's collection; it is properly\r\na kind of rondeau, the first line being repeated at the end of every\r\nstanza; \"Helas! a quoi me servent mes yeux?\"--\"Alas! wherefore have I\r\neyes?\"--It describes the pleasures of the Spring, which are to him as\r\nnothing, in the absence of the only object on which his eyes can dwell\r\nwith delight. The arrangement of the rhymes in this pastoral song is\r\nsingularly elegant and musical.\r\n\r\nLastly, as illustrating the history of the amatory poetry of this age, I\r\nextract from Nostradamus[16] the story of the young Countess de Die; she\r\nloved and was beloved by the Chevalier d'Adhemar: (ancestor I presume to\r\nthat Chevalier d'Adhemar who figures in the letters of Madame de\r\nSevigne.) It was not in this case the lover who celebrated the charms of\r\nhis mistress, but the lady, who, being an illustrious female Troubadour,\r\n\"docte en poesie,\" celebrated the exploits and magnanimity of her lover.\r\nThe Chevalier, proud of such a distinction, caused the verses of his\r\nmistress to be beautifully copied, and always carried them in his bosom;\r\nand whenever he was in the company of knights and ladies, he enchanted\r\nthem by singing a couplet in his own praise out of his lady's book. The\r\npublicity thus given to their love, was quite in the spirit of the\r\ntimes, and does not appear to have injured the reputation of the\r\nCountess for immaculate virtue,[17] which Adhemar would probably have\r\ndefended with lance and spear, against any slanderous tongue which had\r\ndared to defame her.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this romantic story is melancholy. Adhemar heard a\r\nfalse report, that the Countess, whose purity and constancy he had so\r\nproudly maintained, had cast away her smiles on a rival: he fell sick\r\nwith grief and bitterness of heart: the Countess, being informed of his\r\nstate, set out, accompanied by her _mother_, and a long train of knights\r\nand ladies, to visit and comfort him with assurances of her fidelity;\r\nbut when she appeared at his bed-side, and drew the curtain, it was\r\nalready too late: Adhemar expired in her arms. The Countess took the\r\nveil in the convent of St. Honore, and died the same year _of grief_,\r\nsays the chronicle;--and to conclude the tragedy characteristically, the\r\nmother of the young Countess buried her in the same grave with her\r\nlover, and raised a superb monument to the memory of both. The Countess\r\nde Die was one of the ten ladies who formed the _Court of Love_, held at\r\nPierrefeu, (about 1194) and in which Estifanie de Baux presided.\r\n\r\nThese Courts of Love, and the scenes they gave rise to, were certainly\r\nopen to ridicule; the \"belles et subtiles questions d'amour\" which were\r\nthere solemnly discussed, and decided by ladies of rank, were often\r\nabsurd, and the decisions something worse: still the fanciful influence\r\nthey gave to women on these subjects, and the gallantry they introduced\r\ninto the intercourse between the sexes, had a tendency to soften the\r\nmanners, to refine the language, and to tinge the sentiments and\r\npassions with a kind of philosophical mysticism. But these gay and\r\ngallant Courts of Love, the Provencal Troubadours, their lays, which for\r\ntwo centuries had been the delight of all ranks of people, and had\r\nspread music, love, and poetry through the land;--their language, which\r\nhad been the chosen dialect of gallantry in every court of Europe,--were\r\nat once swept from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the Provencal literature began when Provence was raised to\r\nan independent Fief, under Count Berenger I. about the year 1100; it\r\nlasted two entire centuries, and ended when that fine and fertile\r\ncountry became the scene of the horrible crusade against the Albigenses;\r\nwhen the Inquisition sent forth its exterminating fiends to scatter\r\nhorror and devastation through the land, and the wars and rapacity of\r\nCharles of Anjou, its new possessor, almost depopulated the country. The\r\nlanguage which had once celebrated deeds of love and heroism, now sang\r\nonly of desolation and despair. The Troubadours, in a strain worthy of\r\ntheir gentle and noble calling, generally advocated the part of the\r\nAlbigenses, and the oppressed of whatever faith; and in many provinces,\r\nin Lombardy especially, their language was interdicted, lest it might\r\nintroduce heretical or rebellious principles; gradually it fell into\r\ndisuse, and at length into total oblivion. The Troubadours, no longer\r\nwelcomed in castle or in hall, where once\r\n\r\n    They poured to lords and ladies gay,\r\n    The unpremeditated lay,\r\n\r\nwere degraded to wandering minstrels and itinerant jugglers. An attempt\r\nwas made, about a century later, (1324) by the institution of the\r\nFloral Games at Thoulouse, to keep alive this high strain of poetical\r\ngallantry. They were formerly celebrated with great splendour, and a\r\nshadow of this institution is, I believe, still kept up, but it has\r\ndegenerated into a mere school of affectation. The original race of the\r\nTroubadours was extinct long before Clemence d'Isaure and her golden\r\nviolet were thought of.\r\n\r\nI cannot quit the subject of the Troubadours without one or two\r\nconcluding observations. To these rude bards we owe some new notions of\r\npoetical justice, which never seem to have occurred to Horace or\r\nLonginus, and are certainly more magnanimous, as well as more true to\r\nmoral feeling, than those which prevailed among the polished Greeks and\r\nRomans. For instance, the generous Hector and the constant Troilus are\r\ninvariably exalted above the subtle Ulysses and the savage Achilles.\r\nTheseus, Jason, and AEneas, instead of being represented as classical\r\nheroes and pious favourites of the gods, are denounced as recreant\r\nknights and false traitors to love and beauty. In the estimation of\r\nthese chivalrous bards, a woman's tears outweighed the exploits of\r\ndemi-gods; all the glory of Theseus is forgotten in sympathy for\r\nAriadne; and AEneas, in the old ballads and romances, is not, after all\r\nhis perfidy, dismissed to happiness and victory, but is plagued by the\r\nfiends, haunted by poor Dido's \"grimly ghost,\" and, finally, doomed to\r\nperish miserably.[18] Nor does Jason fare better at their hands; in all\r\nthe old poets he is consigned to just execration. In Dante, we have a\r\nmagnificent and a terrible picture of him, doomed to one of the lowest\r\ncircles of hell, amid a herd of vile seducers, who betrayed the trusting\r\nfaith, or bartered the charms of women. Demons scourge him up and down,\r\nwithout mercy or respite, in vengeance for the wrongs of Hypsipyle and\r\nMedea.\r\n\r\n    Guarda quel grande che viene\r\n    E per dolor, non par lagrima spanda;\r\n    Quanto aspetto reale ancor ritiene!\r\n    Quelli e Giasone--\r\n\r\n    --Con segni e con parole ornate\r\n      Isifile inganno----\r\n    Tal colpa a tal martiro lui condanna,\r\n      Ed anche di MEDEA si fa vendetta.\r\n\r\n                     INFERNO, C. 18.\r\n\r\n    \"Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,\r\n    And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear;\r\n    How yet the regal aspect he retains!\r\n    'Tis Jason--\r\n    --He who with tokens and fair witching words\r\n    Hypsipyle beguil'd--\r\n    Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain;\r\n    Here too Medea's injuries are aveng'd!\"--\r\n\r\n                     CAREY.\r\n\r\nAnd Chaucer, in relating the same story, begins with a burst of generous\r\nindignation:\r\n\r\n    Thou root[19] of false lovers, Duke Jason,\r\n    Thou slayer, devourer, and confusion\r\n    Of gentil women, gentil creatures!\r\n\r\nThe story of his double perfidy is told and commented on in the same\r\nchivalrous feeling: and the old poet concludes with characteristic\r\ntenderness and simplicity--\r\n\r\n    This was the mede of loving, and guerdon\r\n    That Medea received of Duke Jason,\r\n    Right for her truth and for her kindnesse,\r\n    That loved him better than herself I guesse!\r\n    And lefte her father and her heritage:\r\n    And of Jason this is the vassalage\r\n    That in his dayes was never none yfound\r\n    So false a lover going on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is in the same beautiful spirit of reverence to the best virtues of\r\nour sex, that Alcestis, the wife of Admetus, who sacrificed her life to\r\nprolong that of her husband, is honoured above all other heroines of\r\nclassical story. She has even been elevated into a kind of presiding\r\ndivinity,--a second Venus, with nobler attributes,--and in her new\r\nexistence is feigned to be the consort and companion of Love himself.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the poetry of the middle ages, was the worship\r\npaid to the daisy, (la Marguerite) as symbolical of all that is lovely\r\nin women. Why so lowly a flower should take precedence of the queenly\r\nlily and the sumptuous rose, is not very clear; but it seems to have\r\noriginated with one of the old Provencal poets, whose mistress bore the\r\nname of Marguerite; and afterwards it became a fashion and a kind of\r\npoetical mythology.[20]\r\n\r\nThus in the \"Flower and the Leafe\" of Chaucer, the ladies and knights of\r\nthe flower approach singing a chorus in honour of the Daisy, of which\r\nthe burthen is, \"si douce est la Marguerite.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Le Roi lui demande, \"S'il a perdu raison?\" il lui repond, \"Helas,\r\noui! c'est depuis la mort du Prince Henri, votre fils!\"\r\n\r\n[13] Inferno, c. xxviii.\r\n\r\n[14] Carey's translation of Dante.

She required, also, of her\r\nlover, to write and to publish in verse the history of their love; and\r\nshe preserved, at the same time, in the eyes of her husband and of the\r\nworld, the character of a virtuous Princess.--_See Foscolo_--_Essays on\r\nPetrarch._\r\n\r\n[18] Percy's Reliques.\r\n\r\n[19] _Root_, i. e. example or beginner.\r\n\r\n[20] See the notes to Chaucer, the works of Froissart, and Memoires sur\r\nles Troubadours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGUIDO CAVALCANTI AND MANDETTA,\r\n\r\nCINO DA PISTOJA AND SELVAGGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmatory poetry was transmitted from the Provencals to the Italians and\r\nSicilians, among whom the language of the Troubadours had long been\r\ncultivated, and their songs imitated, but in style yet more affected and\r\n_recherche_. Few of the Italian poets who preceded Dante, are\r\ninteresting even in a mere literary point of view: of these only one or\r\ntwo have shed a reflected splendour round the object of their adoration.\r\nGuido Cavalcanti, the Florentine, was the early and favourite friend of\r\nDante: being engaged in the factions of his native city, he was forced\r\non some emergency to quit it; and to escape the vengeance of the\r\nprevailing party, he undertook a pilgrimage to Sant Jago. Passing\r\nthrough Tolosa, he fell in love with a beautiful Spanish girl, whom he\r\nhas celebrated under the name of _Mandetta_:\r\n\r\n    In un boschetto trovai pastorella\r\n    Piu che la stella bella al mio parere,\r\n    Capegli avea biondetti e ricciutelli.\r\n\r\nSome of his songs and ballads have considerable grace and nature; but\r\nthey were considered by himself as mere trifles. His grand work on which\r\nhis fame long rested, is a \"Canzone sopra l'Amore,\" in which the subject\r\nis so profoundly and so philosophically treated, that seven voluminous\r\ncommentaries in Latin and Italian have not yet enabled the world to\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nThe following Sonnet is deservedly celebrated for the consummate beauty\r\nof the picture it resents, and will give a fair idea of the platonic\r\nextravagance of the time.\r\n\r\n    Chi e questa che vien ch' ogni uom la mira!\r\n      Che fa tremar di caritate l' a're?\r\n      E mena seco amor, si che parlare\r\n      Null' uom ne puote; ma ciascun sospira?\r\n    Ahi dio! che sembra quando gli occhi gira!\r\n      Dicalo Amor, ch'io nol saprei contare;\r\n      Cotanto d' umilta donna mi pare\r\n      Che ciascun' altra inver di lei chiam' ira.\r\n    Non si porria contar la sua piacenza;\r\n      Che a lei s'inchina ogni gentil virtute,\r\n      E la beltate per sua Dea la mostra.\r\n    Non e si alta gia la mente nostra\r\n      E non s'e posta in noi tanta salute\r\n      Che propriamente n' abbian conoscenza!\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERAL TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n     \"Who is this, on whom all men gaze as she approacheth!--who\r\n     causeth the very air to tremble around her with\r\n     tenderness?--who leadeth Love by her side--in whose presence\r\n     men are dumb; and can only sigh? Ah! Heaven! what power in\r\n     every glance of those eyes! Love alone can tell; for I have\r\n     neither words nor skill! She alone is the Lady of\r\n     gentleness--beside her, all others seem ungracious and\r\n     unkind. Who can describe her sweetness, her loveliness? to\r\n     her every virtue bows, and beauty points to her as her own\r\n     divinity. The mind of man cannot soar so high, nor is it\r\n     sufficiently purified by divine grace to understand and\r\n     appreciate all her perfections!\"\r\n\r\nThe vagueness of this portrait is a part of its beauty:--it is like a\r\nlovely dream--and probably never had any existence, but in the fancy of\r\nthe Poet.\r\n\r\nCino da Pistoia enjoyed the double reputation of being the greatest\r\ndoctor and teacher of the civil law, and most famous poet of his time.\r\nHe was also remarkable for his personal accomplishments and his love of\r\npleasure. There is a sonnet which Dante addressed to Cino, reproaching\r\nhim with being inconstant and volatile in love.[21] Apparently, this was\r\nafter the death of the beautiful Ricciarda dei Selvaggi; or, as he calls\r\nher, his Selvaggia: she was of a noble family of Pistoia, her father\r\nhaving been gonfaliere, and leader of the faction of the Bianchi; and\r\nshe was also celebrated for her poetical talents. It appears from a\r\nlittle madrigal of hers, which has been preserved, that though she\r\ntenderly returned the affection of her lover, it was without the\r\nknowledge of her haughty family. It is not distinguished for poetic\r\npower, but has at least the charm of perfect frankness and simplicity,\r\nand a kind of _abandon_ that is quite bewitching.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MESSER CINO DA PISTOJA.\r\n\r\n    Gentil mio sir, lo parlare amoroso\r\n      Di voi si in allegranza mi mantene,\r\n      Che dirvel non poria, ben lo sacciate;\r\n        Perche del mio amor sete giojoso,\r\n      Di cio grand' allegria e gio' mi vene,\r\n      Ed altro mai non haggio in volontate,\r\n      Fuor del vostro piacere;\r\n      Tutt' hora fate la vostra voglienza:\r\n      Haggiate previdenza\r\n      Voi, di celar la nostra desienza.\r\n\r\n    \"My gentle love and lord! those tender words\r\n    Of thine so fill my conscious heart with joy,\r\n    --I cannot speak it--but thou know'st it well;\r\n    Wherefore do thou rejoice in that deep love\r\n    I bear thee, knowing that I have no thought\r\n    But to fulfil thy will and crown thy wish:\r\n    --Watch thou--and hide our mutual hope from all!\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the parents of Ricciarda were exiled from Pistoia, by the\r\nfaction of the Neri. They took refuge from their enemies in a little\r\nfortress among the Appenines, whither Cino followed them, and was\r\nreceived as a comforter amid their distresses. Probably the days passed\r\nin this dreary abode, among the wild and solitary hills, when he\r\nassisted Ricciarda in her household duties, and in aiding and consoling\r\nher parents, were among the happiest of his life; but the winter came,\r\nand with it many privations and many hardships. Their mountain retreat\r\nwas ill calculated to defend them against the fury of the elements:\r\nRicciarda drooped under the pressure of misery and want, and her parents\r\nand her lover watched the gradual extinction of life--saw the rose-hue\r\nfade from her cheek, and the light from her eye, till she melted from\r\ntheir arms into death; then they buried her with tears, in a nook among\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nMany years afterwards, when Cino had reached the height of his fame, and\r\nhad been crowned with wealth and honours by his native city, he had\r\noccasion to cross the Appenines on an embassy, and causing his suite to\r\ntravel by another road, he made a pilgrimage alone to the tomb of his\r\nlost Selvaggia. This incident gave rise to the most striking of all his\r\ncompositions, which with great pathos and sweetness describes his\r\nfeelings, when he flung himself down on her humble grave, to weep over\r\nthe recollection of their past happiness:\r\n\r\n    Io fu' in sull'alto e in sul beato monte,\r\n      Ove adorai baciando il santo sasso,\r\n      E caddi in su quella pietra, oime lasso!\r\n      Ove l' onesta pose la sua fronte;\r\n    E ch' ella chiuse d' ogni virtu il fonte\r\n      Quel giorno che di morte acerbo passo\r\n      Fece la donna dello mio cor,--lasso!--\r\n      Gia piena tutta d' adornezze conte.\r\n    Quivi chiamai a questa guisa Amore:\r\n      \"Dolce mio Dio, fa che quinci mi traggia\r\n      La morte a se, che qui giace il mio cor!\"\r\n    Ma poi che non m'intese il mio signore,\r\n      Mi disparti, pur chiamando, Selvaggia!\r\n      L'alpe passai, con voce di dolore.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance in the last stanza, \"I rose up and went on my way, and\r\npassed the mountain summits, crying aloud 'Selvaggia!' in accents of\r\ndespair,\" has a strong reality about it, and no doubt _was_ real. Her\r\ndeath took place about 1316.\r\n\r\nIn the history of Italian poetry, Selvaggia is distinguished as the\r\n\"_bel numer' una_,\"--\"the fair number one\"--of the four celebrated\r\nwomen of that century--The others were Dante's Beatrice, Petrarch's\r\nLaura, and Boccaccio's Fiammetta.\r\n\r\nEvery one who reads and admires Petrarch, will remember his beautiful\r\nSonnet on the Death of Cino, beginning \"Piangete Donne\"\r\n\r\n    Perche 'l nostro amoroso messer Cino\r\n    Novellamente s'e da noi partito.\r\n\r\nIn the venerable Cathedral at Pistoia, there is an ancient half-effaced\r\nbas-relief, representing Cino, surrounded by his disciples, to whom he\r\nis explaining the code of civil law: a little behind stands the figure\r\nof a female veiled, and in a pensive attitude, which is supposed to\r\nrepresent Ricciarda de' Selvaggi.\r\n\r\nAll these are alluded to by Petrarch in the Trionfo d'Amore.\r\n\r\n                    Ecco Selvaggia,\r\n    Ecco Cin da Pistoja; Guitton d'Arezzo;\r\n    Ecco i due Guidi che gia furo in prezzo.\r\n\r\nThe two Guidi are, Guido Guizzinello, and Guido Cavalcanti. Guitone was\r\na famous monk, who is said to have invented the present form of the\r\nsonnet: to him also is attributed the discovery of counterpoint, and the\r\npresent system of musical notation.\r\n\r\nOf Conti's mistress nothing is known, but that she had the most\r\nbeautiful hand in the world, whence the volume of poems written by her\r\nlover in her praise, is entitled, _La Bella Mano_, the fair hand. Conti\r\nlived some years later than Petrarch. I mention him merely to fill up\r\nthe list of those ancient minor poets of Italy, whose names and loves\r\nare still celebrated.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21]\r\n    Chi s' innamora, siccome voi fate\r\n    Ed ad ogni piacer si lega e scioglie\r\n    Mostra ch'amor leggermente il saetti--SON. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLAURA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some who doubt the reality of Petrarch's love, because it is\r\nexpressed in numbers; and others, refining on this doubt, profess even\r\nto question whether his Laura ever existed, except in the imagination\r\nand the poetry of her lover. The first objection could only be made by\r\nthe most prosaic of commentators--some true \"black-letter dog\"[22]--who\r\nhad dustified and mistified his faculties among old parchments. The most\r\nreal and most fervent passion that ever fell under my own knowledge, was\r\nrevealed in verse, and very exquisite verse too, and has inspired many\r\nan effusion, full of beauty, fancy, and poetry; but it has not,\r\ntherefore, been counted less sincere; and Heaven forbid it should prove\r\nless lasting than if it had been told in the homeliest prose, and had\r\nnever inspired one beautiful idea or one rapturous verse!\r\n\r\nTo study Petrarch in his own works, and in his own delightful language;\r\nto follow him line by line, through all the vicissitudes and\r\ncontradictions of passion; to listen to his self-reproaches, his\r\nterrors, his regrets, his conflicts; to dwell on his exquisite\r\ndelineations of individual character and peculiar beauty, his simple\r\ntouches of profound pathos and melancholy tenderness:--and then believe\r\nall to be mere invention,--the coinage of the brain,--a tissue of\r\nvisionary fancies, in which the heart had no share; to confound him with\r\nthe cold metaphysical rhymesters of a later age,--seems to argue not\r\nonly a strange want of judgment, but an extraordinary obtuseness of\r\nfeeling.[23]\r\n\r\nThe faults of taste of which Petrarch has been accused over and over\r\nagain, by those who seem to have studied him as Voltaire studied\r\nShakspeare,--his _concetti_--his fanciful adoration of the laurel, as\r\nthe emblem of Laura--his playing on the words _Laura_, _L'aura_, and\r\n_Lauro_, his _freezing flames_ and _burning ice_,--I abandon to critics,\r\nand let them make the best of them, as defects in what were else\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThese were the fashion of the day: a great genius may outrun his times,\r\nbut not without bearing about him some ineffaceable impressions of the\r\nmanners and character of the age in which he lived. He is too witty--\"Il\r\na trop d'esprit,\" to be sincere, say the critics,--\"he has a conceit\r\nleft him in his misery,--a miserable conceit;\" but we know--at least\r\n_I_ know--how in the very extremity of passion the soul can mock at\r\nitself--how the fancy can with a bitter and exaggerated gaiety sport\r\nwith the heart!--These are faults of composition in the writer, and\r\nadmitted to be such; but they prove nothing against the man, the poet,\r\nor the lover. The reproach of monotony, I confess I never could\r\nunderstand. It is rather matter of astonishment, how in a collection of\r\nnearly four hundred poems, all, with one or two exceptions, turning upon\r\nthe same subject and sentiment, the poet has poured forth such an\r\nendless and redundant variety both of thought and feeling--how from the\r\nwide universe, the changeful face of all beautiful nature, the treasures\r\nof antique learning, and, above all, from his own overflowing heart, he\r\nhas drawn those lovely pictures, allusions, situations, sentiments and\r\nreflections, which have, indeed, been stolen, borrowed, imitated, worn\r\nthreadbare by succeeding poets, but in him were the fresh and\r\nspontaneous effusions of profound feeling and luxuriant fancy. Schlegel\r\nvery justly observes, that the impression of monotony may arise from\r\nour considering at one view, and bound up in one volume, a long series\r\nof poems, which were written in the course of many years, at different\r\ntimes, and on different occasions. Laura herself, he avers, would\r\ncertainly have been _ennuyee_ to death with her own praises, if she had\r\nbeen obliged to read over, at one sitting, all the verses which her\r\nlover composed on her charms; and I agree with him.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the very impression of Petrarch's individual\r\ncharacter, and the circumstances of his life, on the whole mass of his\r\npoetry, are evidence of the truth of his attachment, and the reality of\r\nits object. He was by nature a poet; his love was, therefore, poetical:\r\nhe loved \"in numbers, for the numbers came.\" He was an accomplished\r\nscholar in a pedantic age,--and his love is, therefore, illustrated by\r\nsuch comparisons and turns of thought as were allied to his habitual\r\nstudies. He had a fertile and playful fancy, and his love is adorned by\r\nall the luxuriance of his imagination. He had been educated for the\r\nprofession of the Civil Law, \"per vender parole anzi mensogne,\"--to\r\nsell words and lies, as he disdainfully expressed it,--and his love is\r\nmixed up with subtile reasonings on his own hapless state. He was a\r\nphilosopher, and it is tinged with the mystic reveries of Platonism, the\r\nfavourite and fashionable philosophy of the age. He was deeply\r\nreligious, and the strain of devotional and moral feeling which mingles\r\nwith that of passion, or of grief,--his fears lest the excess of his\r\nearthly affections should interfere with his eternal salvation,--his\r\ncontinual allusions to his faith, to a future existence, and the\r\nnothingness and vanity of the world,--are not so many proofs of his\r\nprofaneness, but of his sincerity. He was suspicious, irritable, and\r\nsusceptible; subject to quick transitions of feeling; raised by a word\r\nto hope--plunged by a glance into despair; just such a finely-toned\r\ninstrument as a woman loves to play on;--and all this we have set forth\r\nin the contradictions, the self-reproaches, the little daily\r\nvicissitudes which are events and revolutions in a life of passion; a\r\nlife, which when exhibited in the rich and softening tints of poetry,\r\nhas all the power of strong interest, united to the charm of harmony and\r\nexpression; but in the reality, and in plain prose, cannot be\r\ncontemplated without a painful compassion. \"The day may perhaps come,\"\r\nsays Petrarch in one of his familiar letters,[24] \"when I shall have\r\ncalmness enough to contemplate all the misery of my soul, to examine my\r\npassion, not however, that I may continue to love her--but that I may\r\nlove thee alone, O my God! But at this day, how many obstacles have I\r\nyet to surmount, how many efforts have I yet to make! I no longer love\r\nas I did love, but still I love; I love in spite of myself--in\r\nlamentations and in tears. I will hate her--No!--I must still love her!\"\r\nSeven years afterwards he writes,--\"my love is extreme, but it is\r\nexclusive and virtuous--virtuous!--no!--this disquietude, these\r\nsuspicions, these transports, this watchfulness, this utter weariness of\r\nevery thing, are not signs of a virtuous love!\" What a picture of an\r\nimpassioned and distracted heart!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd who was this Laura, the illustrious object of a passion which has\r\nfilled the wide universe from side to side with her name and fame? What\r\nwas her station, her birth, her lineage? What were her transcendant\r\nqualities of person, heart, and mind, that she should have swayed, with\r\nsuch despotic and distracting power, one of the sovereign spirits of the\r\nage? Is it not enough that we acknowledge her to have been Petrarch's\r\nlove--as chaste as fair?\r\n\r\n    And whether coldness, pride, or virtue, dignify\r\n    A woman, so she is good, what does it signify?\r\n\r\nIn the present case, it signifies much:--we are not to be put off with a\r\nwitty or satirical couplet:--the insatiable curiosity which Laura has\r\nexcited from age to age--the volumes which have been written on the\r\nsubject--are a proof of the sincerity of her lover; for nothing but\r\ntruth could ever inspire this lasting and universal interest. But\r\nwithout diving into these dry disputations, let us take Laura's portrait\r\nfrom Petrarch himself, drawn, it will be said, by the partial hand of a\r\npoetic lover:--true; but since Laura is interesting to us from the\r\ncharms she possessed in his eyes, it were unfair to seek her portraiture\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nLaura was of high birth and station, though her life was spent in\r\nretirement and domestic cares;\r\n\r\n    In nobil sangue, vita umile e quete.\r\n\r\nHer father, Audibert de Noves, was of the _haute noblesse_ of Avignon,\r\nand died in her infancy, leaving her a dowry of 1000 gold crowns, (about\r\n10,000 pounds)--a magnificent portion for those times. She was married\r\nat the age of eighteen to Hugh de Sade, a man of rank equal to her own,\r\nand of corresponding age, but not distinguished by any advantages either\r\nof person or mind. The marriage contract is dated in January, 1325, two\r\nyears before her first meeting with Petrarch: and in it, her mother, the\r\nLady Ermessende, and brother John de Noves, stipulate to pay the dower\r\nleft by her father; and also to bestow on the bride two magnificent\r\ndresses for state occasions; one of green, embroidered with violets; the\r\nother of crimson, trimmed with feathers. In all the portraits of Laura\r\nnow extant, she is represented in one of these two dresses, and they are\r\nfrequently alluded to by Petrarch. He tells us expressly, that when he\r\nfirst met her at matins in the Church of St. Claire, she was habited in\r\na robe of green, spotted with violets.[25] Mention is also made of a\r\ncoronal of silver, with which she wreathed her hair; of her necklaces\r\nand ornaments of pearl. Diamonds are not once alluded to, because the\r\nart of cutting them had not then been invented. From all which, it\r\nappears that Laura was opulent, and moved in the first class of society.\r\nIt was customary for the women of rank, in those times, to dress with\r\nextreme simplicity on ordinary occasions, but with the most gorgeous\r\nsplendour when they appeared in public. There are some beautiful\r\ndescriptions of Laura surrounded by her young female companions,\r\ndivested of all her splendid apparel, in a simple white robe and a few\r\nflowers in her hair; but still pre-eminent over all by her superior\r\nloveliness. From the frequent allusions to her dress, and Petrarch's\r\nangry apostrophes to her mirror, because it assisted to heighten charms\r\nalready too destructive,[26] we may infer that Laura was not unmindful\r\nof the cares of the toilette.\r\n\r\nShe was in person a fair Madonna-like beauty with soft dark eyes, and a\r\nprofusion of pale golden hair parted on her brow, and falling in rich\r\ncurls over her neck. He dwells on the celestial grace of her figure and\r\nmovements, \"l' andar celeste.\"\r\n\r\n    Non era l' andar suo cosa mortale\r\n    Ma d' angelica forma.\r\n\r\nHe describes the beauty of her hand in the 166th sonnet,--\r\n\r\n    O bella man che mi distringi il core.\r\n\r\nAnd the loveliness of her mouth,--\r\n\r\n    La bella bocca angelica.\r\n\r\nThe general character of her beauty must have been pensive, soft,\r\nunobtrusive, and even somewhat languid:\r\n\r\n    L' angelica sembianza umile e piana--\r\n    L' atto mansueto, umile e tardo--\r\n\r\nthe last line is exquisitely characteristic. This extreme softness and\r\nrepose must have been far removed from insipidity; for he dwells also on\r\nthe rare and varying expression of her loveliness, \"Leggiadria singolare\r\ne pellegrina;\"--the lightning of her smile, \"Il lampeggiar dell'\r\nangelico riso;\"--and the tender magic of her voice, which was felt in\r\nthe inmost heart, \"Il cantar che nell' anima si sente.\" She had a habit\r\nof veiling her eyes with her hand, and her looks were generally bent on\r\nthe earth, \"o per umiltade o per orgoglio.\" In the portrait of Laura,\r\nwhich I saw at the Laurentian Library at Florence, the eyes have this\r\ncharacteristic downcast look. Her lover complains also of a veil, which\r\nshe was fond of wearing. Wandering in the country, one summer's day, he\r\nsees a young peasant-girl washing a veil in the running stream; he\r\nrecognises the very texture which had so often intervened between him\r\nand the heaven of Laura's beauty, and he trembles as if he had been in\r\nthe presence of Laura herself. This little incident is the subject of\r\nthe first Madrigal.\r\n\r\nHe describes her dignified humility, \"l' umilta superba;\"--her beautiful\r\nsilence, \"il bel tacere;\"--her frequent sighs, \"i sospir soavemente\r\nrotti;\"--her sweet disdain and gentle repulses, \"dolci sdegni, placide\r\nrepulse;\"--the gesture which spoke without the aid of words, \"l'atto che\r\nparla con silenzio.\" The picture, it must be confessed, is most\r\nfinished, most delicate, most beautiful;--supposing only half to be\r\ntrue, it is still beautiful. But far more flattering, and more\r\nhonourable to Laura, is her lover's confession of the influence which\r\nher charming character possessed over him; for it is certain that we owe\r\nto Laura's exquisite purity of mind and manners, the polished delicacy\r\nof the homage addressed to her. Passing over, of course, the\r\ncircumstance of her being a married woman, and therefore not a proper\r\nobject of amorous verse,--there is not in all the poetry she inspired, a\r\nline or sentiment which angels might not hear and approve. Petrarch\r\nrepresents her as expressing neither surprise nor admiration at the\r\nself-sacrifice of Lucretia, but only wondering that shame and grief had\r\nnot anticipated the dagger of the Roman matron. He describes her\r\nconversation, \"pien d'intelletti dolci ed alti,\" and her mind ever\r\nserene, though her countenance was pensive, \"in aspetto pensoso, anima\r\nlieta.\" He tells us that she had raised him above all low-thoughted\r\ncares, and purified his heart from all base desires. \"I bless the place,\r\nthe time, the hour, when I presumed to lift my eyes upon her,--I say, O\r\nmy soul, thankful shouldst thou be that hast been deemed worthy of such\r\nhigh honour--for from her spring those gentle thoughts which shall lead\r\nthee to aspire to the highest good, and to disdain all that the vulgar\r\nmind desires.\"\r\n\r\n    I' benedico il loco e 'l tempo e l'ora\r\n    Che si alti miraron gli occhi mici;\r\n    E dico: anima, assai ringraziar dei\r\n    Che fosti a tanto onor degnata allora.\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    Da lei ti vien l' amoroso pensiero\r\n    Che, mentre 'l segui all' Sommo ben t'invia\r\n    Poco prezzando quel ch' ogni uom desia.\r\n\r\nEvery generous feeling, every noble and elevated sentiment, every desire\r\nfor improvement, he refers to her, and to her only:\r\n\r\n                  S' alcun bel frutto\r\n    Nasce di me, da voi vien prima il seme.\r\n    Io per me son quasi un terreno asciutto\r\n    Colto da voi; e 'l pregio e vostro in tutto.\r\n\r\n                     CANZONE 8.\r\n\r\nHe gives us in a single line the very _beau ideal_ of a female\r\ncharacter, when he tells us that Laura united the highest intellect with\r\nthe purest heart, \"In alto intelletto un puro core.\" He dwells with\r\nrapture on her angelic modesty, which excited at once his reverence and\r\nhis despair; but he confesses that he still hopes something from the\r\npitying tenderness of her disposition.--\r\n\r\n    Non e si duro cor, che lagrimando,\r\n    Pregando, amando, talor non si smova\r\n    Ne si freddo voler, che non si scalde.\r\n\r\nThe attachment inspired by such a woman was not likely to be lessened by\r\nabsence, or removed by death itself; and it is certain that the second\r\npart of the Canzoniere of Petrarch, written after the death of Laura, is\r\nmore beautiful than the first part: in a more impassioned style, a\r\nhigher tone of feeling, with far fewer faults, both of taste and style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be said perhaps that \"the picture of such a mind as Petrarch's,\r\nenslaved and distracted by a dreaming passion, employed even in his\r\ndeclining years, in writing and polishing love verses, is a pitiable\r\nsubject of contemplation; that if he had not left us his Canzoniere, he\r\nwould probably have performed some other excelling work of genius, which\r\nwould have crowned him with equal or superior glory; and that if he had\r\nnever been the lover of Laura, he would have been no less that\r\nmaster-spirit who gave the leading impulse to the age in which he\r\nlived, by consecrating his life, his energies, all his splendid talents,\r\nto the cultivation of philosophy and the fine arts, the extension of\r\nlearning and liberty, and the general improvement of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nI doubt this, and I appeal to Petrarch himself.\r\n\r\nI believe there is no version into English of the 48th Canzone. If Lady\r\nDacre had executed it--and in the same spirit as the \"Chiare, fresche e\r\ndolce acque,\" and the \"Italia mia,\" the reader had been spared my\r\nabortive prose sketch, which will give as just an idea of the original\r\nas a hasty penciled outline of one of Titian's or Domenichino's\r\nmasterpieces would give us of all the magic colouring and effect of\r\ntheir glorious and half-breathing creations.\r\n\r\nIn this Canzone, Petrarch, in a high strain of poetic imagery, which\r\ntakes nothing from the truth or pathos of the sentiment, allegorises his\r\nown situation and feelings: he represents himself as citing the Lord of\r\nLove, \"Suo empio e dolce Signore,\" before the throne of Reason, and\r\naccusing him as the cause of all his sufferings, sorrows, errors, and\r\nmisspent time. \"Through _him_ (Love) I have endured, even from the\r\nmoment I was first beguiled into his power, such various and such\r\nexquisite pain, that my patience has at length been exhausted, and I\r\nhave abhorred my existence. I have not only forsaken the path of\r\nambition and useful exertion, but even of pleasure and of happiness: I,\r\nwho was born, if I do not deceive myself, for far higher purposes than\r\nto be a mere amorous slave! Through _him_ I have been careless of my\r\nduty to Heaven,--negligent of myself:--for the sake of one woman I\r\nforgot all else!--me miserable! What have availed me all the high and\r\nprecious gifts of Heaven, the talents, the genius which raised me above\r\nother men? My hairs are changed to grey, but still my heart changeth\r\nnot. Hath he not sent me wandering over the earth in search of repose?\r\nhath he not driven me from city to city, and through forests, and woods,\r\nand wild solitudes?[27] hath he not deprived me of peace, and of that\r\nsleep which no herbs nor chaunted spells have power to restore? Through\r\nhim, I have become a bye-word in the world, which I have filled with my\r\nlamentations, till by their repetition I have wearied myself, and\r\nperhaps all others.\"\r\n\r\nTo this long tirade, Love with indignation replies: \"Hearest thou the\r\nfalsehood of this ungrateful man? This is he who in his youth devoted\r\nhimself to the despicable traffic of words and lies, and now he blushes\r\nnot to reproach me with having raised him from obscurity, to know the\r\ndelights of an honourable and virtuous life. I gave him power to attain\r\na height of fame and virtue to which of himself he had never dared to\r\naspire. If he has obtained a name among men, to me he owes it. Let him\r\nremember the great heroes and poets of antiquity, whose evil stars\r\ncondemned them to lavish their love upon unworthy objects, whose\r\nmistresses were courtezans and slaves; while for him, I chose from the\r\nwhole world one lovely woman, so gifted by Heaven with all female\r\nexcellence, that her likeness is not to be found beneath the moon,--one\r\nwhose melodious voice and gentle accents had power to banish from his\r\nheart every vain, and dark, and vicious thought. These were the wrongs\r\nof which he complains: such is my reward for all I have done for\r\nhim,--ungrateful man! Upon my wings hath he soared upwards, till his\r\nname is placed among the greatest of the sons of song, and fair ladies\r\nand gentle knights listen with delight to his strains:--had it not been\r\nfor me, what had he become before now? Perhaps a vain flatterer, seeking\r\npreferment in a Court, confounded among the herd of vulgar men! I have\r\nso chastened, so purified his heart through the heavenly image impressed\r\nupon it, that even in his youth, and in the age of the passions, I\r\npreserved him pure in thought and in action;[28] whatever of good or\r\ngreat ever stirred within his breast, he derives from her and from me.\r\nFrom the contemplation of virtue, sweetness, and beauty, in the\r\ngracious countenance of her he loved, I led him upwards to the adoration\r\nof the first Great Cause, the fountain of all that is beautiful and\r\nexcellent;--hath he not himself confessed it? And this fair creature,\r\nwhom I gave him to be the honour, and delight, and prop of his frail\r\nlife\"--\r\n\r\nHere the sense is suddenly broken off in the middle of a line. Petrarch\r\nutters a cry of horror, and exclaims--\"Yes, you gave her to me, but you\r\nhave also taken her from me!\"\r\n\r\nLove replies with sweet austerity--\"Not I--but HE--the eternal One--who\r\nhath willed it so!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, it will be allowed, I think, that it is to Laura we owe\r\nPetrarch; and that if the recompense she bestowed on him was not exactly\r\nthat which he sought,--yet in fame, in greatness, in virtue, and in\r\nhappiness, she well and richly repaid the adoration he lavished at her\r\nfeet, and the glorious wreath of song with which he has circled her\r\nbrows!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] See Pursuits of Literature.\r\n\r\n[23] In a private letter of Petrarch to the Bishop of Lombes, occurs the\r\nfollowing passage--(the Bishop, it appears, had rallied him on the\r\nsubject of his attachment.) \"Would to God that my Laura were indeed but\r\nan imaginary person, and my passion for her but sport!--Alas! it is\r\nrather a madness!--hard would it have been, and painful, to feign so\r\nlong a time--and what extravagance to play such a farce in the world!\r\nNo! we may counterfeit the action and voice of a sick man, but not the\r\npaleness and wasted looks of the sufferer; and how often have you\r\nwitnessed both in me!\"--SADE, vol. i. p. 281.\r\n\r\n[24] Quoted by Foscolo.\r\n\r\n[25] Canz. xv. Son. 10.\r\n\r\n[26] See Son. 37, 38, &c.\r\n\r\n[27] Foscolo remarks the restless spirit which all his life drove\r\nPetrarch, like a perturbed spirit, from one residence to another.\r\n\r\n[28] Here Petrarch seems to have forgotten himself; he was not _always_\r\nimmaculate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLAURA AND PETRARCH CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch power of lively ridicule, much coarse wit,--principally French\r\nwit,--has been expended on the subject of Laura's virtue; by those, I\r\npresume, who under similar circumstances would have found such virtue\r\n\"too painful an endeavour.\"[29] Much depraved ingenuity has been\r\nexerted to twist certain lines and passages in the Canzoniere into a\r\nsense which shall blot with frailty the memory of this beautiful and\r\nfar-famed being: once believe these interpretations, and all the\r\npeculiar and graceful charm which now hangs round her intercourse with\r\nPetrarch vanishes,--the reverential delicacy of the poet's homage\r\nbecomes a mockery, and all his exalted praises of her unequalled virtue,\r\nand her invincible chastity, are turned to satire, and insult our moral\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nBut the question, I believe, is finally set at rest, and it were idle\r\nto war with epigrams. All the evidence that has been collected, external\r\nand internal, prose and poetry, critical and traditional, tends to\r\nprove, first, that Laura preserved her virtue to the last; and,\r\nsecondly, that she did not preserve it unassailed; that Petrarch, true\r\nto his sex,--a very man, (as Laura has been called a _very woman_,) used\r\nat first every art, every effort, every advantage, which his diversified\r\naccomplishments of mind and person lent him, to destroy the very virtue\r\nhe adored. He only _hints_ this in his poetry, just sufficiently to\r\nenhance the glory which he has thrown round his divinity; but he speaks\r\nmore plainly in prose.\r\n\r\n\"Untouched by my prayers, unvanquished by my arguments, unmoved by my\r\nflattery, she remained faithful to her sex's honour; she resisted her\r\nown young heart, and mine, and a thousand, thousand, thousand things,\r\nwhich must have conquered any other. She remained unshaken. A woman\r\ntaught me the duty of a man! to persuade me to keep the path of virtue,\r\nher conduct was at once an example and a reproach; and when she beheld\r\nme break through all bounds, and rush blindly to the precipice, she had\r\nthe courage to abandon me, rather than follow me.\"[30]\r\n\r\nBut whether, in this long conflict, Laura preserved her heart untouched,\r\nas well as her virtue immaculate; whether she shared the love she\r\ninspired; or whether she escaped from the captivating assiduities and\r\nintoxicating homage of her lover, \"_fancy-free_;\"--whether coldness, or\r\nprudence, or pride, or virtue, or the mere heartless love of admiration,\r\nor a mixture of all together, dictated her conduct, is at least as well\r\nworth inquiry, as the exact colour of her eyes, or the form of her nose,\r\nupon which we have pages of grave discussion. She might have been\r\n_coquette par instinct_, if not _par calcul_; she might have felt, with\r\nfeminine _tacte_, that to preserve her influence over Petrarch, it was\r\nnecessary to preserve his respect. She was evidently proud of her\r\nconquest: she had else been more or less than woman; and at every\r\nhazard, but that of self-respect, she was resolved to retain him. If\r\nPetrarch absented himself for a few days, he was generally better\r\ntreated on his return.[31] If he avoided her, then her eye followed him\r\nwith a softer expression. When he looked pale from sickness of heart and\r\nagitation of spirits, Laura would address him with a few words of\r\npitying tenderness. He thanks her in those exquisite lines, which seem\r\nto glow with all the renovation of hope,\r\n\r\n      Volgendo gli occhi al mio novo colore\r\n    Che fa di morte rimembrar le gente\r\n    Pieta vi mosse, onde benignamente\r\n    Salutando teneste in vita il core.\r\n\r\n      La frale vita ch'ancor meco alberga,\r\n    Fu de' begli occhi vostri aperto dono,\r\n    E della voce angelica soave![32]\r\n\r\nHe presumes upon this benignity, and is again dashed back with frowns.\r\nHe flies to solitude,--solitude!--Never let the proud and torn heart,\r\nwrung with the sense of injury, and sick with unrequited passion, seek\r\nthat worst resource against pain, for there grief grows by contemplation\r\nof itself, and every feeling is sharpened by collision. Petrarch sought\r\nto \"mitigate the fever of his heart\" amid the shades of Vaucluse, a spot\r\nso gloomy and so solitary, that his very servants forsook him; and\r\nVaucluse, its fountains, its forests, and its hanging cliffs, reflected\r\nonly the image of Laura.\r\n\r\n      L'acque parlan d'amore, e l'aura, e i rami\r\n    E gli augeletti, e i pesci e i fiori e l'erba;\r\n      Tutti insieme pregando ch' io sempr'ami![33]\r\n\r\nHe is driven again to her feet by his own insupportable thoughts--and in\r\nterror of himself;--\r\n\r\n    Tal paura ho di ritrovarmi solo!\r\n\r\nHe endeavours to maintain in her presence that self-constraint she had\r\nenjoined. He assumes a cold and calm deportment, and Laura, as she\r\npasses him, whispers in a tone of gentle reproach, \"Petrarch! are you so\r\nsoon weary of loving me?\" (ten or eleven years of adoration were, in\r\ntruth, nothing--_to signify_!) At length, he resolved to leave Laura and\r\nAvignon for ever; and instead of plunging into solitude, to seek the\r\nwiser resource of travel and society. He announced this intention to\r\nLaura, and bade her a long farewell; either through surprise, or grief,\r\nor the fear of losing her glorious captive, she turned exceedingly pale,\r\na cloud overspread her beautiful countenance, and she fixed her eyes on\r\nthe ground. This was to her lover an intoxicating moment; in the\r\nexultation of sudden delight, he interpreted these symptoms of\r\nrelenting, this \"vago impallidir,\" too favourably to himself. \"She bent\r\nthose gentle eyes upon the earth, which in their sweet silence said,--to\r\nme at least they seemed to say,--'who takes my faithful friend so far\r\nfrom me?'\"\r\n\r\n      Chinava a terra il bel guardo gentile,\r\n    E tacendo dicea, com' a me parve--\r\n      \"Chi m'allontana il mio fedele amico?\"\r\n\r\nOn his return to Avignon, a few months afterwards, Laura received him\r\nwith evident pleasure; but he is not, therefore, more _avance_; all this\r\nwas probably the refined coquetterie of a woman of calm passions; but\r\nnot heartless, not really indifferent to the devotion she inspired, nor\r\nungrateful for it.\r\n\r\nPetrarch has himself left us a most minute and interesting description\r\nof the whole course of Laura's conduct towards him, which by a beautiful\r\nfigure of poetry he has placed in her own mouth. The passage occurs in\r\nthe TRIONFO DI MORTE, beginning, \"La notte che segui l'orribil caso.\"\r\n\r\nThe apparition of Laura descending on the morning dew, bright as the\r\nopening dawn, and crowned with Oriental gems,\r\n\r\n    Di gemme orientali incoronata,\r\n\r\nappears before her lover, and addresses him with compassionate\r\ntenderness. After a short dialogue, full of poetic beauty and noble\r\nthoughts,[34] Petrarch conjures her, in the name of heaven and of truth,\r\nto tell him whether the pity she sometimes expressed for him was allied\r\nto love? for that the sweetness she mingled with her disdain and\r\nreserve--the soft looks with which she tempered her anger, had left him\r\nfor long years in doubt of her real sentiments, still doating, still\r\nsuspecting, still hoping without end:\r\n\r\n    Creovvi amor pensier mai nella testa,\r\n    D' aver pieta del mio lungo martire\r\n    Non lasciando vostr' alta impresa onesta?\r\n\r\n    Che vostri dolci sdegni e le dolc' ire--\r\n    Le dolci paci ne' begli occhi scritte--\r\n    Tenner molt' anni in dubbio il mio desire.\r\n\r\nShe replies evasively, with a smile and a sigh, that her heart was ever\r\nwith him, but that to preserve her own fair fame, and the virtue of\r\nboth, it was necessary to assume the guise of severity and disdain. She\r\ndescribes the arts with which she kept alive his passion, now checking\r\nhis presumption with the most frigid reserve, and when she saw him\r\ndrooping, as a man ready to die, \"all fancy-sick and pale of cheer,\"\r\ngently restoring him with soft looks and kind words:\r\n\r\n    \"Salvando la tua vita e'l nostro onore.\"\r\n\r\nShe confesses the delight she felt in being beloved, and the pride she\r\ntook in being sung by so great a poet. She reminds him of one particular\r\noccasion, when seated by her side, and they were left alone, he sang to\r\nhis lute a song composed to her praise, beginning, \"Dir piu non osa il\r\nnostro amore;\" and she asks him whether he did not perceive that the\r\nveil had then nearly fallen from her heart?[35]\r\n\r\nShe laments, in some exquisite lines, that she had not the happiness to\r\nbe born in Italy, the native country of her lover, and yet allows that\r\nthe land must needs be fair in which she first won his affection.\r\n\r\n    Duolmi ancor veramente, ch'io non nacqui\r\n    Almen piu presso al tuo fiorito nido!--\r\n    Ma assai fu bel paeese ov'io ti piacqui.\r\n\r\nIn another passage we have a sentiment evidently taken from nature, and\r\nexquisitely graceful and feminine. \"You,\" says Laura, \"proclaimed to all\r\nmen the passion you felt for me: you called aloud for pity: you kept not\r\nthe tender secret for me alone, but took a pride and a pleasure in\r\npublishing it forth to the world; thus constraining me, by all a woman's\r\nfear and modesty, to be silent.\"--\"But not less is the pain because we\r\nconceal it in the depths of the heart, nor the greater because we lament\r\naloud: fiction and poetry can add nothing to truth, nor yet take from\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n      Tu eri di merce chiamar gia roco\r\n    Quand'io tacea; perche vergogna e tema\r\n    Facean molto desir, parer si poco;\r\n    Non e minor il duol perch' altri 'l prema,\r\n    Ne maggior per andarsi lamentando:\r\n    Per fizion non cresce il ver, ne scema.\r\n\r\nPetrarch, then all trembling and in tears, exclaims, \"that could he but\r\nbelieve he had been dear to her eyes as to her heart, he were\r\nsufficiently recompensed for all his sufferings;\" and she replies, \"that\r\nwill I never reveal!\" ('_quello mi taccio._') By this coquettish and\r\ncharacteristic answer, we are still left in the dark. Such was the\r\nsacred respect in which Petrarch held her he so loved, that though he\r\nevidently wishes to believe--perhaps _did_ believe, that he had touched\r\nher heart, he would not presume to insinuate what Laura had never\r\navowed. The whole scene, though less polished in the versification than\r\nsome of his sonnets, is written throughout with all the flow and fervour\r\nof real feeling. It received the poet's last corrections twenty-six\r\nyears after Laura's death, and but a few weeks previous to his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen at Milan, I was taken, as a matter of course, to visit the\r\nAmbrosian library. At the time I was ill in health, dejected and\r\nindifferent; and I only remember being led in passive resignation from\r\nroom to room, and called upon to admire a vast variety of objects, at\r\nthe moment when I was pining for rest; when to look, think, speak, or\r\nmove, was pain,--when to sit motionless and gaze out upon the sunshine,\r\nseemed to me the only supreme blessedness. In such moments as these, we\r\ncan have sympathies with nature, but not with old books and antiquities.\r\nI have a most confused recollection both of the locality and the\r\ncontents of this famous collection; but there were two objects which\r\nroused me from this sullen stupor, and indelibly impressed my\r\nimagination and my memory; and one of these was the celebrated copy of\r\nVirgil, which had been the favourite companion and constant study of\r\nPetrarch, containing that memorandum of the death of Laura, in his own\r\nhandwriting, which, after much expenditure of paper, and argument, and\r\ncritical abuse, is at length admitted to be genuine. I knew little of\r\nthe controversy this famous inscription had occasioned in Italy,--though\r\nI was aware that its authenticity had been disputed: but as a homely\r\nproverb saith, _seeing is believing_; to look upon the handwriting with\r\nmy own eyes, would have made assurance double sure, if in that moment I\r\nneeded such assurance. I do not remember reasoning or doubting on the\r\nsubject;--but gushing up like the waters of an intermitting fountain,\r\nthere was a sudden flow of feeling and memory came over my heart:--I\r\nstood for some moments silently contemplating the name of LAURA, in the\r\npale, half-effaced characters traced by the hand of her lover; that name\r\nwith which his genius and his love have filled the earth: confused\r\nthoughts of the mingling of vanity and glory,--of the \"poco polvere che\r\nnulla sente,\" and the immortality of deified beauty, were crowded in my\r\nmind. When all were gone, I turned back, and gave the guide a small\r\ngratuity to be allowed to do homage to the name of Laura, by pressing my\r\nlips upon it. The reader smiles at this sentimental enthusiasm; so would\r\nI, if time had not taught me to respect, as well as regret, what it has\r\ntaken from me, and never can restore.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum has often been quoted; but this account of the love of\r\nPetrarch would not be complete were it omitted here. It runs literally\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"Laura, illustrious by her own virtues, and long celebrated by my\r\nverses, I beheld for the first time, in my early youth, on the 6th of\r\nApril, 1327, about the first hour of the day, in the church of Saint\r\nClaire in Avignon: and in the same city, in the same month of April, the\r\nsame day and hour, in the year 1348, this light of my life was withdrawn\r\nfrom the world while I was at Verona, ignorant, alas! of what had\r\nbefallen me. The terrible intelligence was conveyed in a letter from\r\nLouis, and reached me at Parma the 19th of May, early in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"Her chaste and beautiful remains were deposited the same day after\r\nvespers, in the Church of the Fratri Minori (Cordeliers). Her spirit, as\r\nSeneca said of Scipio Africanus,[36] has returned, doubtless, to that\r\nheaven whence it came.\r\n\r\n\"To preserve the memory of this afflicting loss, it is with a bitter\r\npleasure I record it here, in this book which is ever before my eyes,\r\nthat nothing in this world may hereafter delight me: and that the chief\r\ntie which bound me to life being broken, I may, by frequently looking on\r\nthese words, and thinking on this transitory existence, be prepared to\r\nquit this earthly Babylon, which, with the help of the divine grace, and\r\nthe constant and manly recollection of those fruitless desires, and vain\r\nhopes, and sad vicissitudes which have so long agitated me, will be an\r\neasy task.\"\r\n\r\nLaura died of the plague, which then desolated Avignon, and terminated\r\nthe life of the sufferer on the third day. The moment she was seized\r\nwith the fatal symptoms, she dictated her will; and notwithstanding the\r\npestilential nature of her disorder, she was surrounded to the last by\r\nher numerous relations and friends, who braved death rather than forsake\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer tomb was discovered and opened in 1533, in the presence of Francis\r\nthe First, whose celebrated stanzas on the occasion are well known.\r\n\r\nOf the fame, which even in her lifetime, the love and poetical adoration\r\nof Petrarch had thrown round his Laura, a curious instance is given\r\nwhich will characterise the manners of the age. When Charles of\r\nLuxemburgh (afterwards Emperor) was at Avignon, a grand fete was given,\r\nin his honour, at which all the noblesse were present. He desired that\r\nPetrarch's Laura should be pointed out to him; and when she was\r\nintroduced, he made a sign with his hand that the other ladies present\r\nshould fall back; then going up to Laura, and for a moment contemplating\r\nher with interest, he kissed her respectfully on the forehead and on the\r\neyelids. Petrarch alludes to this incident in the 201st sonnet, the last\r\nline of which shows that this royal salutation was considered singular.\r\n\r\n    \"M'empia d'invidia l'atto dolce e strano.\"\r\n\r\nPetrarch survived her twenty-six years, dying in 1374. He was found\r\nlifeless one morning in his study, his hand resting on a book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inferences I draw from this rapid sketch are, first, that Laura was\r\nvirtuous, but not insensible;--for had she been facile, she would not\r\nhave preserved her lover's respect; had she been a heartless trifler,\r\nshe could not have retained his love, nor deserved his undying regrets:\r\nand secondly, that if Petrarch had not attached himself fervently to\r\nthis beautiful and pure-hearted woman, he would have employed his\r\nsplendid talents like other men of his time. He might then have left us\r\ntheological treatises and Latin epics, which the worms would have eaten;\r\nhe might have risen high in the church or state; have become a bold,\r\nintriguing priest; a politic archbishop,--a cardinal,--a pope;--most\r\nworthless and empty titles all, compared with that by which he has\r\ndescended to us, as Petrarch, the poet and the lover of Laura![37]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Madame Deshoulieres speaks \"avec connaissance de fait,\" and even\r\npoints out the very spot in which Laura, \"de l'amoureux Petrarque\r\nadoucit le martyre.\"--Another French lady, who piqued herself on being a\r\ndescendant of the family of Laura, was extremely affronted and\r\nscandalised when the Chevalier Ramsay asserted that Petrarch's passion\r\nwas purely poetical and platonic, and regarded it heresy to suppose that\r\nLaura could have been \"_ungrateful_,\"--such was her idea of feminine\r\n_gratitude_!--(Spence's Anecdotes.) Then comes another French woman,\r\nwith the most anti-poetical soul that God ever placed within the form of\r\na woman--\"Le fade personage que votre Petrarque! que sa Laure etait\r\nsotte et precieuse! que la Cour d'Amour etait fastidieuse!\" &c. exclaims\r\nthe acute, amusing, profligate, heartless Madame du Deffand. It must be\r\nallowed that Petrarch and Laura would have been extremely _desplaces_ in\r\nthe Court of the Regent,--the only _Court of Love_ with which Madame du\r\nDeffand was acquainted, and which assuredly was not _fastidieuse_.\r\n\r\n[30] From the Dialogues with St. Augustin, as quoted in the \"Pieces\r\nJustificatives,\" and by Ginguene (Hist. Litt. vol. iii. notes.) These\r\nimaginary dialogues are a series of Confessions not intended for\r\npublication by Petrarch, but now printed with his prose works.\r\n\r\n[31] Sonnet 39.\r\n\r\n[32] Ballata 5.\r\n\r\n[33] Petrarch withdrew to Vaucluse in 1337, and spent three years in\r\nentire solitude. He commenced his journey to Rome in 1341, about\r\nfourteen years after his first interview with Laura.\r\n\r\n[34] Petrarch asks her whether it was \"pain to die?\" she replies in\r\nthose fine lines which have been quoted a thousand times:\r\n\r\n    La Morte e fin d' una prigion oscura\r\n    Agli animi gentili; agli altri e noia,\r\n    Ch' hanno posto nel fango ogni lor cura.\r\n\r\n[35]\r\n    Ma non si ruppe almen ogni vel quando\r\n    Sola i tuoi detti, te presente accolsi\r\n    \"_Dir piu non osa il nostro amor_,\" cantando.\r\n\r\n(The song here alluded to is not preserved in Petrarch's works, and the\r\nexpression \"_il nostro amore_,\" is very remarkable.)\r\n\r\n[36] This sounds at first pedantic; but it must be remembered that at\r\nthis very time Petrarch was studying Seneca, and writing a Latin poem on\r\nthe history of Scipio: thus the ideas were fresh in his mind.\r\n\r\n[37] The hypothesis I have assumed relative to Laura's character, her\r\nmarried state, and the authenticity of the MS. note in the Virgil, have\r\nnot been lightly adopted, but from deep conviction and patient\r\nexamination: but this is not the place to set arguments and authorities\r\nin array--Ginguene and Gibbon against Lord Byron and Fraser Tytler. I am\r\nsurprised at the ground Lord Byron has taken on the question. As for his\r\ncharacteristic sneer on the assertion of M. de Bastie, who had said\r\ntruly and beautifully--\"qu'il n'y a que la vertu seule qui soit capable\r\nde faire des impressions que la mort n'efface pas,\" I disdain, in my\r\nfeminine character, to reply to it; I will therefore borrow the\r\neloquence of a more powerful pen:--\"The love of a man like Petrarch,\r\nwould have been less in character, if it had been less ideal. For the\r\npurposes of inspiration, a single interview was quite sufficient. The\r\nsmile which sank into his heart the first time he ever beheld Laura,\r\nplayed round her lips ever after: the look with which her eyes first met\r\nhis, never passed away. The image of his mistress still haunted his\r\nmind, and was recalled by every object in nature. Even death could not\r\ndissolve the fine illusion; for that which exists in the imagination is\r\nalone imperishable. As our feelings become more ideal, the impression of\r\nthe moment indeed becomes less violent; but the effect is more general\r\nand permanent. The blow is felt only by reflection; it is the rebound\r\nthat is fatal. We are not here standing up for this kind of Platonic\r\nattachment, but only endeavouring to explain the way in which the\r\npassions very commonly operate in minds accustomed to draw their\r\nstrongest interests from constant contemplation.\"--_Edinburgh Review._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nON THE LOVE OF DANTE FOR BEATRICE PORTINARI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad I taken chronology into due consideration, Dante ought to have\r\npreceded Petrarch, having been born some forty years before him,--but I\r\nforgot it. \"Truth,\" says Wordsworth, \"has her pleasure-grounds,\r\n\r\n                  Her haunts of ease\r\n    And easy contemplation;--gay parterres\r\n    And labyrinthine walks; her sunny glades\r\n    And shady groves for recreation framed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd such a haunted pleasure-ground of beautiful recollections, would I\r\nwish my subject to be to myself and to my readers; where we shall be\r\npriviledged to wander at will; to pause or turn back; to deviate to\r\nthis side or to that, as memory may prompt, or imagination lead, or\r\nillustration require.\r\n\r\nDante and his Beatrice are best exhibited in contrast to Petrarch and\r\nLaura. Petrarch was in his youth an amiable and accomplished courtier,\r\nwhose ambition was to cultivate the arts, and please the fair. Dante\r\nearly plunged into the factions which distracted his native city, was of\r\na stern commanding temper, mingling study with action. Petrarch loved\r\nwith all the vivacity of his temper; he took a pleasure in publishing,\r\nin exaggerating, in embellishing his passion in the eyes of the world.\r\nDante, capable of strong and enthusiastic tenderness, and early\r\nconcentrating all the affections of his heart on one object, sought no\r\nsympathy; and solemnly tells us of himself,--in contradistinction to\r\nthose poets of his time who wrote of love from fashion or fancy, not\r\nfrom feeling,--that he wrote as love inspired, and as his heart\r\ndictated.\r\n\r\n          \"Io mi son un che, quando\r\n    Amore spira, noto, ed in quel modo\r\n    Ch'ei detta dentro, vo significando.\"\r\n\r\n                        PURGATORIO, c. 24.\r\n\r\nA coquette would have triumphed in such a captive as Petrarch; and in\r\ntruth, Laura seems to have \"sounded him from the top to the bottom of\r\nhis compass:\"--a tender and impassioned woman would repose on such a\r\nheart as Dante's, even as his Beatrice did. Petrarch had a gay and\r\ncaptivating exterior; his complexion was fair, with sparkling blue eyes\r\nand a ready smile. He is very amusing on the subject of his own\r\ncoxcombry, and tells us how cautiously he used to turn the corner of a\r\nstreet, lest the wind should disorder the elaborate curls of his fine\r\nhair! Dante, too, was in his youth eminently handsome, but in a style of\r\nbeauty which was characteristic of his mind: his eyes, were large and\r\nintensely black, his nose aquiline, his complexion of a dark olive, his\r\nhair and beard very much curled, his step slow and measured, and the\r\nhabitual expression of his countenance grave, with a tinge of melancholy\r\nabstraction. When Petrarch walked along the streets of Avignon, the\r\nwomen smiled, and said, \"there goes the lover of Laura!\" The impression\r\nwhich Dante left on those who beheld him, was far different. In allusion\r\nto his own personal appearance, he used to relate an incident that once\r\noccurred to him. When years of persecution and exile had added to the\r\nnatural sternness of his countenance, the deep lines left by grief, and\r\nthe brooding spirit of vengeance, he happened to be at Verona, where\r\nsince the publication of the Inferno, he was well known. Passing one day\r\nby a portico, where several women were seated, one of them whispered,\r\nwith a look of awe,--\"Do you see that man? that is he who goes down to\r\nhell whenever he pleases, and brings us back tidings of the sinners\r\nbelow!\" \"Ay, indeed!\" replied her companion,--\"very likely; see how his\r\nface is scarred with fire and brimstone, and blackened with smoke, and\r\nhow his hair and beard have been singed and curled in the flames!\"\r\n\r\nDante had not, however, this forbidding appearance when he won the young\r\nheart of Beatrice Portinari. They first met at a banquet given by her\r\nfather, Folco de' Portinari, when Dante was only nine years old, and\r\nBeatrice a year younger. His childish attachment, as he tells us\r\nhimself, commenced from that hour; it became a passion, which increased\r\nwith his years, and did not perish even with its object.\r\n\r\nBeatrice has not fared better at the hands of commentators than Laura.\r\nLaura, with her golden hair scattered to the winds, \"i capei d'oro al\r\naura sporsi,\" her soft smiles, and her angel-like deportment, was to be\r\nRepentance; and the more majestic Beatrice, in whose eyes dwelt love,\r\n\r\n    E spiriti d'amore infiammati,\r\n\r\nwas sublimated into _Theology_: with how much reason we shall examine.\r\n\r\nIn one of his canzoni, called il Ritratto, (the Portrait) Dante has left\r\nus a most minute and finished picture of his Beatrice, \"which,\" says Mr.\r\nCarey, \"might well supply a painter with a far more exalted idea of\r\nfemale beauty, than he could form to himself from the celebrated Ode of\r\nAnacreon, on a similar subject.\" From this canzone and some lines\r\nscattered through his sonnets, I shall sketch the person and character\r\nof Beatrice. She was not in form like the slender, fragile-looking\r\nLaura, but on a larger scale of loveliness, tall and of a commanding\r\nfigure;[38]--graceful in her gait as a peacock, upright as a crane,\r\n\r\n    Soava a guisa va di un bel pavone,\r\n    Diritta sopra se, come una grua.\r\n\r\nHer hair was fair and curling,\r\n\r\n    \"Capegli crespi e biondi,\"\r\n\r\nbut not _golden_,--an epithet I do not find once applied to it: she had\r\nan ample forehead, \"spaciosa fronte,\" a mouth that when it smiled\r\nsurpassed all things in sweetness; so that her Poet would give the\r\nuniverse to hear it pronounce a kind \"yes.\"\r\n\r\n    Mira che quando ride\r\n    Passa ben di dolcezza ogni altra cosa.\r\n    Cosi di quella bocca il pensier mio\r\n    Mi sprona, perche io\r\n    Non ho nel mondo cosa che non desse\r\n    A tal ch'un si, con buon voler dicesse.\r\n\r\nHer neck was white and slender, springing gracefully from the bust--\r\n\r\n    Poi guarda la sua svelta e bianca gola\r\n    Commessa ben dalle spalle e dal petto.\r\n\r\nA small, round, dimpled chin,\r\n\r\n    Mento tondo, fesso e piccioletto:\r\n\r\nand thereupon the Poet breaks out into a rapture, any thing but\r\ntheological,\r\n\r\n                      Il bel diletto\r\n    Aver quel collo fra le braccia stretto\r\n    E far in quella gola un picciol segno!\r\n\r\nHer arms were beautiful and round; her hand soft, white, and polished;\r\n\r\n    La bianca mano morbida e pulita:\r\n\r\nher fingers slender, and decorated with jewelled rings as became her\r\nbirth; fair she was as a pearl;\r\n\r\n    Con un color angelica di perla:\r\n\r\ngraceful and lovely to look upon, but disdainful where it was becoming:\r\n\r\n    Graziosa a vederla,\r\n    E disdegnosa dove si conviene.\r\n\r\nAnd as a corollary to these traits, I will quote the eleventh Sonnet as\r\na more general picture of female loveliness, heightened by some tender\r\ntouches of mental and moral beauty, such as never seem to have occurred\r\nto the debased imaginations of the classic poets:\r\n\r\n      Negli occhi porta la mia Donna Amore;\r\n    Perche si fa gentil ciocch' ella mira:\r\n    Ov' ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira;\r\n    E cui saluta, fa tremar lo core,\r\n      Sicche bassando 'l viso tutto smuore,\r\n    Ed ogni suo difetto allor sospira;\r\n    Fugge dinanzi a lei superbia ed ira.\r\n    Ajutatemi, donne, a farle onore!\r\n      Ogni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile\r\n    Nasce nel core a chi parlar la sente;\r\n    Onde e laudato chi prima la vide.\r\n      Quel ch' ella par, quando un poco sorride\r\n    No si puo dicer, ne tenera mente;\r\n    Si e nuovo miracolo e gentile.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n     \"Love is throned in the eyes of my Beatrice! they ennoble\r\n     every thing she looks upon! As she passes, men turn and\r\n     gaze; and whomsoever she salutes, his heart trembles within\r\n     him; he bows his head, the colour forsakes his cheek, and he\r\n     sighs for his own unworthiness. Pride and anger fly before\r\n     her! Assist me, ladies, to do her honour! All sweet thoughts\r\n     of humble love and good-will spring in the hearts of those\r\n     who hear her speak, so that it is a blessedness first to\r\n     behold her, and when she faintly and softly smiles--ah! then\r\n     it passes all fancy, all expression, so wondrous is the\r\n     miracle, and so gracious!\"\r\n\r\nThe love of Dante for his Beatrice partook of the purity, tenderness,\r\nand elevated character of her who inspired it, and was also stamped with\r\nthat stern and melancholy abstraction, that disposition to mysticism,\r\nwhich were such strong features in the character of her lover. He does\r\nnot break out into fond and effeminate complaints, he does not sigh to\r\nthe winds, nor swell the fountain with his tears; his love does not,\r\nlike Petrarch's, alternately freeze and burn him, nor is it \"un dolce\r\namaro,\" \"a bitter sweet,\" with which his fancy can sport in good set\r\nterms. No; it shakes his whole being like an earthquake; it beats in\r\nevery pulse and artery; it has dwelt in his heart till it has become a\r\npart of his life, or rather his life itself.[39] Though we are not told\r\nso expressly, it is impossible to doubt, on a consideration of all those\r\npassages and poems which relate to Beatrice, that his love was approved\r\nand returned, and that his character was understood and appreciated by a\r\nwoman too generous, too noble-minded, to make him the sport of her\r\nvanity. He complains, indeed, _poetically_, of her disdain, for which he\r\nexcuses himself in another poem: \"We know that the heavens shine on in\r\neternal serenity, and that it is only our imperfect vision, and the\r\nrising vapours of the earth, that make the ever-beaming stars appear\r\nclouded at times to our eye.\" He expresses no fear of a rival in her\r\naffections; but the native jealousy as well as delicacy of his temper\r\nappears in those passages in which he addresses the eulogium of Beatrice\r\nto the Florentine ladies and her young companions.[40] Those of his own\r\nsex, as he assures us, were not worthy to listen to her praises; or must\r\nperforce have become enamoured of this picture of female excellence, the\r\nfear of which made a coward of him--\r\n\r\n    Ma trattero del suo stato gentile\r\n    Donne e donzelle amorose, con vui;\r\n    Che non e cosa da parlarne altrui.\r\n\r\nAmong the young companions of Beatrice, Dante particularly distinguishes\r\none, who appears to have been her chosen friend, and who, on account of\r\nher singular and blooming beauty, was called, at Florence, Primavera,\r\n(the Spring.) Her real name was Giovanna. Dante frequently names them\r\ntogether, and in particular in that exquisitely fanciful sonnet to his\r\nfriend Guido Cavalcanti; where he addresses them by those familiar and\r\nendearing diminutives, so peculiarly Italian--\r\n\r\n    E Monna Vanna e Monna Bice poi.[41]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the 7th and 8th Sonnets of the Vita Nuova, that in the\r\nearly part of their intercourse, Beatrice, indulging her girlish\r\nvivacity, smiled to see her lover utterly discountenanced in her\r\npresence, and pointed out her triumph to her companions. This offence\r\nseems to have deeply affected the proud, susceptible mind of Dante: it\r\nwas under the influence of some such morose feeling, probably on this\r\nvery occasion, that his dark passions burst forth in the bitter lines\r\nbeginning,\r\n\r\n    Io maledico il di ch' io vidi imprima\r\n    La luce de' vostri occhi traditori.\r\n\r\n\"I curse the day in which I first beheld the splendour of those traitor\r\neyes,\" &c. This angry sonnet forms a fine characteristic contrast with\r\nthat eloquent and impassioned effusion of Petrarch, in which he\r\nmultiplies blessings on the day, the hour, the minute, the season, and\r\nthe spot, in which he first beheld Laura--\r\n\r\n    Benedetto sia l' giorno, e 'l mese, e l' anno, &c.\r\n\r\nThis fit of indignation was, however, short-lived. Every tender emotion\r\nof Dante's feeling heart seems to have been called forth when Beatrice\r\nlost her excellent father. Folco Portinari died in 1289; and the\r\ndescription we have of the inconsolable grief of Beatrice and the\r\nsympathy of her young companions,--so poetically, so delicately touched\r\nby her lover,--impress us with a high idea both of her filial tenderness\r\nand the general amiability of her disposition, which rendered her thus\r\nbeloved. In the 12th and 13th Sonnets, we have, perhaps, one of the most\r\nbeautiful groups ever presented in poetry. Dante meets a company of\r\nyoung Florentine ladies, who were returning from paying Beatrice a visit\r\nof condolence on the death of her father. Their altered and dejected\r\nlooks, their downcast eyes, and cheeks \"colourless as marble,\" make his\r\nheart tremble within him; he asks after Beatrice--\"_our_ gentle lady,\"\r\nas he tenderly expresses it: the young girls raise their downcast eyes,\r\nand regard him with surprise. \"Art thou he,\" they exclaim, \"who hast so\r\noften sung to us the praises of our Beatrice? the voice, indeed, is his;\r\nbut, oh! how changed the aspect! Thou weepest!--why shouldest _thou_\r\nweep?--thou hast not seen _her_ tears;--leave _us_ to weep and return to\r\nour home, refusing comfort; for we, indeed, have heard her speak, and\r\nseen her dissolved in grief; so changed is her lovely face by sorrow,\r\nthat to look upon her is enough to make one die at her feet for\r\npity.\"[42]\r\n\r\nIt should seem that the extreme affliction of Beatrice for the loss of\r\nher father, acting on a delicate constitution, hastened her own end, for\r\nshe died within a few months afterwards, in her 24th year. In the \"Vita\r\nNuova\" there is a fragment of a canzone, which breaks off at the end of\r\nthe first strophe; and annexed to it is the following affecting note,\r\noriginally in the handwriting of Dante.\r\n\r\n\"I was engaged in the composition of this Canzone, and had completed\r\nonly the above stanza, when it pleased the God of justice to call unto\r\nhimself this gentlest of human beings; that she might be glorified\r\nunder the auspices of that blessed Queen, the Virgin Maria, whose name\r\nwas ever held in especial reverence by my sainted Beatrice.\"\r\n\r\nBoccaccio, who knew Dante personally, tells us, that on the death of\r\nBeatrice, he was so changed by affliction that his best friends could\r\nscarcely recognise him. He scarcely eat or slept; he would not speak; he\r\nneglected his person, until he became \"una cosa selvatica a vedere,\" _a\r\nsavage thing to the eye_: to borrow his own strong expression, he seems\r\nto have been \"grief-stung to madness.\" To the first Canzone, written\r\nafter the death of Beatrice, Dante has prefixed a note, in which he\r\ntells us, that after he had long wept in silence the loss of her he\r\nloved, he thought to give utterance to his sorrow in words; and to\r\ncompose a Canzone, in which he should write, (weeping as he wrote,) of\r\nthe virtues of her who through much anguish had bowed his soul to the\r\nearth. \"Then,\" he says, \"I thus began:--gli occhi dolenti,\"--which are\r\nthe first words of this Canzone. It is addressed, like the others, to\r\nher female companions, whom alone he thought worthy to listen to her\r\npraises, and whose gentle hearts could alone sympathise in his grief.\r\n\r\n      Non vo parlare altrui\r\n    Se non a cor gentil, che 'n donna sia!\r\n\r\nOne stanza of this Canzone is unequalled, I think, for a simplicity at\r\nonce tender and sublime. The sentiment, or rather the meaning, in homely\r\nEnglish phrase, would run thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Ascended is our Beatrice to the highest Heaven, to those realms where\r\nangels dwell in peace; and you, her fair companions, and Love and me,\r\nshe has left, alas! behind. It was not the frost of winter that chilled\r\nher, nor was it the heat of summer that withered her; it was the power\r\nof her virtue, her humility, and her truth, that ascending into Heaven\r\nmoved the ETERNAL FATHER to call her to himself, seeing that this\r\nmiserable life was not worthy of any thing so fair, so excellent!\"\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the death of Beatrice, Dante tells us that he was\r\nsitting alone, thinking upon her, and tracing, as he meditated, the\r\nfigure of an angel on his tablets.[43] Can any one doubt that this\r\nlittle incident, so natural and so affecting,--his thinking on his lost\r\nBeatrice, and by association sketching the figure of an angel, while his\r\nmind dwelt upon her removal to a brighter and better world,--must have\r\nbeen real? It gave rise to the 18th Sonnet of the Vita Nuova, which he\r\ncalls \"Il doloroso annovale,\" (the mournful anniversary.)\r\n\r\nAnother little circumstance, not less affecting, he has beautifully\r\ncommemorated in two Sonnets which follow the one last mentioned. They\r\nare addressed to some kind and gentle creature, who from a window beheld\r\nDante abandon himself, with fearful vehemence, to the agony of his\r\nfeelings, when he believed no human eye was on him. \"She turned pale,\"\r\nhe says, \"with compassion; her eyes filled with tears, as if she had\r\nloved me: then did I remember my noble-hearted Beatrice, for even thus\r\nshe often looked upon me,\" &c. And he confesses that the grateful, yet\r\nmournful pleasure with which he met the pitying look of this fair being,\r\nexcited remorse in his heart, that he should be able to derive pleasure\r\nfrom anything.\r\n\r\nDante concludes the collection of his _Rime_, (his miscellaneous poems\r\non the subject of his early love) with this remarkable note:--\r\n\r\n\"I beheld a marvellous vision, which has caused me to cease from writing\r\nin praise of my blessed Beatrice, until I can celebrate her more\r\nworthily; which that I may do, I devote my whole soul to study, as _she_\r\nknoweth well; in so much, that if it please the Great Disposer of all\r\nthings to prolong my life for a few years upon this earth, I hope\r\nhereafter to sing of my Beatrice what never yet was said or sung of\r\nwoman.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd in this transport of enthusiasm, Dante conceived the idea of his\r\ngreat poem, of which Beatrice was destined to be the heroine. It was to\r\nno Muse, called by fancy from her fabled heights, and feigned at the\r\npoet's will; it was not to ambition of fame, nor literary leisure\r\nseeking a vent for overflowing thoughts; nor to the wish to aggrandise\r\nhimself, or to flatter the pride of a patron;--but to the inspiration of\r\na young, beautiful, and noble-minded woman, we owe one of the grandest\r\nefforts of human genius. And never did it enter into the imagination of\r\nany lover, before or since, to raise so mighty, so vast, so enduring, so\r\nglorious a monument to the worth and charms of a mistress. Other poets\r\nwere satisfied if they conferred on the object of their love an\r\nimmortality on earth: Dante was not content till he had placed _his_ on\r\na throne in the Empyreum, above choirs of angels, in presence of the\r\nvery fountain of glory; her brow wreathed with eternal beams, and\r\nclothed with the ineffable splendours of beatitude;--an apotheosis,\r\ncompared to which, all others are earthly and poor indeed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] \"Membra formosi et grandi.\"\r\n\r\n[39] It borrows even the solemn language of Sacred Writ to express its\r\nintensity:\r\n\r\n    Nelle man vostre, o dolce donna mia!\r\n    Raccomando lo spirito che muore.\r\n\r\n                     SON. 34.\r\n\r\n[40] I refer particularly to that sublime Canzone addressed to the\r\nladies of Florence, and beginning\r\n\r\n    \"Donne ch' avete intelletto d' amore.\"\r\n\r\n[41] Monna Vanna, for _Madonna Giovanna_; and Monna Bice, _Madonna\r\nBeatrice_.\r\n\r\nThis famous sonnet has been translated by Hayley and by Shelley. I\r\nsubjoin the version of the latter, as truer to the spirit of the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nTHE WISH.--TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI.\r\n\r\n    Guido! I would that Lapo, thou, and I,\r\n      Led by some strong enchantment, might ascend\r\n    A magic ship, whose charmed sails should fly\r\n      With winds at will, where'er our thoughts might wend:\r\n    And that no change, nor any evil chance\r\n      Should mar our joyous voyage; but it might be\r\n    That even satiety should still enhance\r\n      Between our hearts their strict community,\r\n    And that the bounteous wizard there would place\r\n      Vanna and Bice, and thy gentle love,\r\n    Companions of our wanderings, and would grace\r\n      With passionate talk, wherever we might rove\r\n    Our time!--and each were as content and free\r\n    As I believe that thou and I should be!\r\n\r\n[42] Sonnetto 13 (Poesie della Vita Nuova.)\r\n\r\n[43] Vita Nuova, p. 268.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDANTE AND BEATRICE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the two first parts of the Divina Commedia, (Hell and\r\nPurgatory,) Beatrice is merely announced to the reader--she does not\r\nappear in person; for what should the sinless and sanctified spirit of\r\nBeatrice do in those abodes of eternal anguish and expiatory torment?\r\nHer appearance, however, in due time and place, is prepared and shadowed\r\nforth in many beautiful allusions: for instance, it is she, who\r\ndescending from the empyreal height, sends Virgil to be the deliverer of\r\nDante in the mysterious forest, and his guide through the abysses of\r\ntorment.\r\n\r\n    Io son Beatrice che ti faccio andare;\r\n    Vegno di loco ove tornar disio:\r\n    Amor mi mosse che mi fa parlare.\r\n\r\n                  INFERNO, c. 2.\r\n\r\n    \"I who now bid thee on this errand forth\r\n    Am Beatrice; from a place I come\r\n    Revisited with joy; love brought me thence,\r\n    Who prompts my speech.\"\r\n\r\n                    CAREY'S TRANS.\r\n\r\nAnd she is _indicated_, as it were, several times in the course of the\r\npoem, in a manner which prepares us for the sublimity with which she is\r\nat length introduced, in all the majesty of a superior nature, all the\r\ndreamy splendour of an ideal presence, and all the melancholy charm of a\r\nbeloved and lamented reality. When Dante has left the confines of\r\nPurgatory, a wondrous chariot approaches from afar, surrounded by a\r\nflight of angelic beings, and veiled in a cloud of flowers (\"un nuvola\r\ndi fiori,\" is the beautiful expression.)--A female form is at length\r\napparent in the midst of this angelic pomp, seated in the car, and\r\n\"robed in hues of living flame:\" she is veiled: he cannot discern her\r\nfeatures, but there moves a hidden virtue from her,\r\n\r\n                At whose touch\r\n    The power of ancient love was strong within him.\r\n\r\nHe recognises the influence which even in his childish days had smote\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n        Che gia m'avea trafitto\r\n    Prima ch' io fuor della puerizia fosse;\r\n\r\nand his failing heart and quivering frame confess the thrilling presence\r\nof his Beatrice--\r\n\r\n    Conosco i segni dell'antica fiamma!\r\n\r\nThe whole passage is as beautifully wrought as it is feelingly and truly\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nBeatrice,--no longer the soft, frail, and feminine being he had known\r\nand loved upon earth, but an admonishing spirit,--rises up in her\r\nchariot,\r\n\r\n              And with a mien\r\n    Of that stern majesty which doth surround\r\n    A mother's presence to her awe-struck child,\r\n    She looked--a flavour of such bitterness\r\n    Was mingled with her pity!\r\n\r\n                     CAREY'S TRANS.\r\n\r\nDante then puts into her mouth the most severe yet eloquent accusation\r\nagainst himself: while he stands weeping by, bowed down by shame and\r\nanguish. She accuses him before the listening angels for his neglected\r\ntime, his wasted talents, his forgetfulness of her, when she was no\r\nlonger upon earth to lead him with the light of her \"youthful eyes,\"\r\n(gli occhi giovinetti.)\r\n\r\n          Soon as I had changed\r\n    My mortal for immortal, then he left me,\r\n    And gave himself to others; when from flesh\r\n    To spirit I had risen, and increase\r\n    Of beauty and of virtue circled me,\r\n    I was less dear to him and valued less!\r\n\r\n                  PURGATORY, C. 30.--CAREY'S TRANS.\r\n\r\nThis praise of herself and stern upbraiding of her lover, would sound\r\nharsh from woman's lips, but have a solemnity, and even a sublimity, as\r\nuttered by a disembodied and angelic being. When Dante, weeping, falters\r\nout a faint excuse--\r\n\r\n                Thy fair looks withdrawn,\r\n    Things present with deceitful pleasures turned\r\n    My steps aside,--\r\n\r\nshe answers by reproaching him with his inconstancy to her memory:--\r\n\r\n                  Never didst thou spy\r\n    In art or nature aught so passing sweet\r\n    As were the limbs that in their beauteous frame\r\n    Enclosed me, and are scattered now in dust.\r\n    If sweetest thing thus failed thee with my death,\r\n    What afterward of mortal should thy wish\r\n    Have tempted?\r\n\r\n                     PURGATORY, c. 31.\r\n\r\nAnd she rebukes him, for that he could stoop from the memory of her love\r\nto be the thrall of a _slight girl_. This last expression is supposed to\r\nallude either to Dante's unfortunate marriage with Gemma Donati,[44] or\r\nto the attachment he formed during his exile for a beautiful Lucchese\r\nnamed Gentucca, the subject of several of his poems. But,\r\nnotwithstanding all this severity of censure, Dante, gazing on his\r\ndivine monitress, is so rapt by her loveliness, his eyes so eager to\r\nrecompence themselves for \"their ten years' thirst,\" (Beatrice had been\r\ndead ten years) that not being yet freed from the stain of his earthly\r\nnature, he is warned not to gaze \"too fixedly\" on her charms. After a\r\nfarther probation, Beatrice introduces him into the various spheres\r\nwhich compose the celestial paradise; and thenceforward she certainly\r\nassumes the characteristics of an allegorical being. The true\r\ndistinction seems this, that Dante has not represented Divine Wisdom\r\nunder the name and form of Beatrice, but the more to exalt his Beatrice,\r\nhe has clothed her in the attributes of Divine Wisdom.\r\n\r\nShe at length ascends with him into the Heaven of Heavens, to the source\r\nof eternal and uncreated light, without shadow and without bound; and\r\nwhen Dante looks round for her, he finds she has quitted his side, and\r\nhas taken her place throned among the supremely blessed, \"as far above\r\nhim as the region of thunder is above the centre of the sea:\" he gazes\r\nup at her in a rapture of love and devotion, and in a sublime apostrophe\r\ninvokes her still to continue her favour towards him. She looks down\r\nupon him from her effulgent height, smiles on him with celestial\r\nsweetness, and then fixing her eyes on the eternal fountain of glory, is\r\nabsorbed in ecstasy. Here we leave her: the poet had touched the limits\r\nof permitted thought; the seraph wings of imagination, borne upwards by\r\nthe inspiration of deep love, could no higher soar,--the audacity of\r\ngenius could dare no farther!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDante died at Ravenna in 1321, and was sumptuously interred at the cost\r\nof Guido da Polenta, the father of that unfortunate Francesca di Rimini,\r\nwhose story he has so exquisitely told in the fifth canto of the\r\nInferno. He left several sons and an only daughter, whom he had named\r\nBeatrice, in remembrance of his early love: she became a nun at Ravenna.\r\n\r\nNow where, in the name of all truth and all feeling, were the heads, or\r\nrather the hearts, of those commentators, who could see nothing in the\r\nBeatrice thus beautifully pourtrayed, thus tenderly lamented, and thus\r\nsublimely commemorated, but a mere allegorical personage, the creation\r\nof a poet's fancy? Nothing can come of nothing; and it was no unreal or\r\nimaginary being who turned the course of Dante's ardent passions and\r\nactive spirit, and burning enthusiasm, into one sweeping torrent of love\r\nand poetry, and gave to Italy and to the world the Divina Commedia!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] This marriage was one of policy, and negociated by the friends of\r\nDante and of Gemma Donati: her temper was violent and harsh, and their\r\ndomestic peace was, probably, not increased by Dante's obstinate regret\r\nfor his first love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCHAUCER AND PHILIPPA PICARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Italy, England,--who has ever trod in her footsteps, and at length\r\noutstript her in the race of intellect,--was the next to produce a great\r\nand prevailing genius in poetry, a master-spirit, whom no change of\r\ncustoms, manners, or language, can render wholly obsolete; and who was\r\ndestined, like the rest of his tribe, to bow before the influence of\r\nwoman, to toil in her praise, and soar by her inspiration.\r\n\r\nSeven years after the death of Dante, Chaucer was born, and he was\r\ntwenty-four years younger than Petrarch, whom he met at Padua in 1373;\r\nthis meeting between the two great poets was memorable in itself, and\r\nyet more interesting for having first introduced into the English\r\nlanguage that beautiful monument to the virtue of women,--the story of\r\nGriselda.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio had lately sent to his friend the MS. of the Decamerone, of\r\nwhich it is the concluding tale: the tender fancy of Petrarch, refined\r\nby a forty years' attachment to a gentle and elegant female, passed over\r\nwhat was vicious and blameable, or only recommended by the wit and the\r\nstyle, and fixed with delight on the tale of Griselda; so beautiful in\r\nitself, and so honourable to the sex whom he had poetically deified in\r\nthe person of one lovely woman. He amused his leisure hours in\r\ntranslating it into Latin, and having finished his version, he placed it\r\nin the hands of a citizen of Padua, and desired him to read it aloud.\r\nHis friend accordingly began; but as he proceeded, the overpowering\r\npathos of the story so affected him, that he was obliged to stop; he\r\nbegan again, but was unable to proceed; the gathering tears blinded\r\nhim, and choked his voice, and he threw down the manuscript. This\r\nincident, which Petrarch himself relates in a letter to Boccaccio,\r\noccurred about the period when Chaucer passed from Genoa to Padua to\r\nvisit the poet and lover of Laura--\r\n\r\n    Quel grande, alla cui fama angusto e il mondo.\r\n\r\nPetrarch must have regarded the English poet with that wondering,\r\nenthusiastic admiration with which we should now hail a Milton or a\r\nShakspeare sprung from Otaheite or Nova Zembla; and his heart and soul\r\nbeing naturally occupied by his latest work, he repeated the experiment\r\nhe had before tried on his Paduan friend. The impression which the\r\nGriselda produced upon the vivid, susceptible imagination of Chaucer,\r\nmay be judged from his own beautiful version of it in the Canterbury\r\nTales; where the barbarity and improbability of the incidents are so\r\nredeemed by the pervading truth and purity and tenderness of the\r\nsentiment, that I suppose it never was perused for the first time\r\nwithout tears. Chaucer, as if proud of his interview with Petrarch, and\r\nanxious to publish it, is careful to tell us that he did not derive the\r\nstory from Boccaccio, but that it was\r\n\r\n    Learned at Padua of a worthy clerk,\r\n    As proved by his wordes and his work;\r\n    Francis Petrark, the Laureat Poete;\r\n\r\nwhich is also proved by internal evidence.\r\n\r\nChaucer so far resembled Petrarch, that, like him, he was at once poet,\r\nscholar, courtier, statesman, philosopher, and man of the world; but\r\nconsidered merely as poets, they were the very antipodes of each other.\r\nThe genius of Dante has been compared to a Gothic cathedral, vast and\r\nlofty, and dark and irregular. In the same spirit, Petrarch may be\r\nlikened to a classical and elegant Greek temple, rising aloft in its\r\nfair and faultless proportions, and compacted of the purest Parian\r\nmarble; while Chaucer is like the far-spreading and picturesque palace\r\nof the Alhambra, with its hundred chambers, all variously decorated,\r\nand rich with barbaric pomp and gold: he is famed rather as the animated\r\npainter of character, and manners, and external nature, than the poet of\r\nlove and sentiment; and yet no writer, Shakspeare always excepted, (and\r\nperhaps Spenser) contains so many beautiful and tender passages relating\r\nto, or inspired by, women. He lived, it is true, in rude times, times\r\nstrangely deficient in good taste and decorum; but when all the\r\ninstitutions of chivalry, under the most chivalrous of our kings and\r\nprinces,[45] were at their height in England. As a poet, Chaucer was\r\nenlisted into the service of three of the most illustrious, most\r\nbeautiful, and most accomplished women of that age--Philippa, the\r\nhigh-hearted and generous Queen of Edward the Third; the Lady Blanche of\r\nLancaster, first wife of John of Gaunt; and the lovely Anne of Bohemia,\r\nthe Queen of Richard the Second;[46] for whom, and at whose command, he\r\nwrote his \"Legende of Gode Women,\" as some amends for the scandal he had\r\nspoken of us in other places. The Countess of Essex, the Countess of\r\nPembroke, and that beautiful Lady Salisbury, the ancestress of the\r\nMontagu family, whose famous mischance gave rise to the Order of the\r\nGarter, were also among Chaucer's patronesses. But the most\r\ndistinguished of all, and the favourite subject of his poetry, was the\r\nDuchess Blanche. The manner in which he has contrived to celebrate his\r\nown loves and individual feelings with those of Blanche and her royal\r\nsuitor, has given additional interest to both, and has enabled his\r\ncommentators to fix with tolerable certainty the name and rank of the\r\nobject of his love, as well as the date and circumstances of his\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest of Chaucer's poems, \"The COURT OF LOVE,\" he describes\r\nhimself as enamoured of a fair mistress, whom in the style of the time,\r\nhe calls Rosial, and himself Philogenet: the lady is described as\r\n\"sprung of noble race and high,\" with \"angel visage,\" \"golden hair,\" and\r\neyes orient and bright, with figure \"sharply slender,\"\r\n\r\n    So that from the head unto the foot all is sweet womanhead,\r\n\r\nand arrayed in a vest of green, with her tresses braided with silk and\r\ngold. She treats him at first with disdain, and the Poet swoons away at\r\nher feet: satisfied by this convincing proof of his sincerity, she is\r\ninduced to accept his homage, and becomes his \"liege ladye,\" and the\r\nsovereign of his thoughts. In this poem, which is extremely wild, and\r\nhas come down to us in an imperfect state, Chaucer quaintly admonishes\r\nall lovers, that an absolute faith in the perfection of their\r\nmistresses, and obedience to her slightest caprice, are among the first\r\nof duties; that they must in all cases believe their ladye faultless;\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n    In every thing she doth but as she should.\r\n    Construe the best, believe no tales new,\r\n    For many a lie is told that seem'th full true;\r\n    But think that she, so bounteous and so fair,\r\n    Could not be false; imagine this alway.\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    And tho' thou seest a fault right at thine eye,\r\n    Excuse it quick, and glose it prettily.[47]\r\n\r\nNor are they to presume on their own worthiness, nor to imagine it\r\npossible they can earn\r\n\r\n    By right, her mercie, nor of equity,\r\n    But of her grace and womanly pitye.[47]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no authority for supposing that at the time this poem\r\nwas written, Chaucer really aspired to the hand of any lady of superior\r\nbirth, or was very seriously in love; he was then about nineteen, and\r\nhad probably selected some fair one, according to the custom of his age,\r\nto be his \"fancy's queen,\" and in the same spirit of poetical\r\ngallantry, he writes to do her honour; he says himself,\r\n\r\n    My intent and all my busie care\r\n    Is for to write this treatise as I can,\r\n    Unto my ladye, stable, true, and sure;\r\n    Faithful and kind sith firste that she began\r\n    Me to accept in service as her man;\r\n    To her be all the pleasures of this book,\r\n    That, when her like, she may it rede and look.[48]\r\n\r\nMixed up with all this gallantry and refinement are some passages\r\ninconceivably absurd and gross; but such were those times,--at once rude\r\nand magnificent--an odd mixture of cloth of frieze and cloth of gold!\r\n\r\nThe \"Parliament of Birds,\" entitled in many editions, the \"_Assembly of\r\nFowls_,\" celebrates allegorically the courtship of John of Gaunt and\r\nBlanche of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nBlanche, as the greatest heiress of England, with a duchy for her\r\nportion, could not fail to be surrounded by pretenders to her hand; but,\r\nafter a year of probation, she decided in favour of John of Gaunt, who\r\nthus became Duke of Lancaster in right of his bride. This youthful and\r\nprincely pair were then about nineteen.\r\n\r\nThe \"Parliament of Birds\" being written in 1358, when Blanche had\r\npostponed her choice for a year, has fixed the date of Chaucer's\r\nattachment to the lady he afterwards married; for, here he describes\r\nhimself as one who had not yet felt the full power of love--\r\n\r\n    For albeit that I know not love indeed,\r\n    Ne wot how that he quitteth folks their hire,\r\n    Yet happeth me full oft in books to read\r\n    Of his miracles.----\r\n\r\nBut the time was come when the poet, now in his thirty-second year, was\r\ndestined to feel, that a strong attachment for a deserving object--for\r\none who will not be obtained unsought, \"was no sport,\" as he expresses\r\nit, but\r\n\r\n    Smart and sorrow, and great heavinesse.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of trial which Lady Blanche had inflicted on her\r\nlover, it was Chaucer's fate to fall in love in sad earnest.--The object\r\nof this passion, too beautifully and unaffectedly described not to be\r\ngenuine, was Philippa Picard de Rouet, the daughter of a knight of\r\nHainault, and a favourite attendant of Queen Philippa. Her elder sister\r\nCatherine, was at the same time maid of honour to the Duchess Blanche.\r\nBoth these sisters were distinguished at Court for their beauty and\r\naccomplishments, and were the friends and companions of the Princesses\r\nthey served: and both are singularly interesting from their connection,\r\npolitical and poetical, with English history and literature.\r\n\r\nPhilippa Picard is one of the principal personages in the poem entitled\r\n\"Chaucer's Dream,\" which is a kind of epithalamium celebrating the\r\nmarriage of John of Gaunt with the Lady Blanche, which took place at\r\nReading, May 19, 1359. It is a wild, fanciful vision of fairy-land and\r\nenchantments, of which I cannot attempt to give an analysis. In the\r\nopening lines, written about twelve months after the \"Parliament of\r\nBirds,\" we find Chaucer in deep love according to all its forms. He is\r\nlying awake,\r\n\r\n    About such hour as lovers weep\r\n    And cry after their lady's grace,\r\n\r\nthinking on his mistress--all her goodness and all her sweetness, and\r\nmarvelling how heaven had formed her so exceeding fair,\r\n\r\n              And in so litel space\r\n    Made such a body and such a face;\r\n    So great beauty, and such features,\r\n    More than be in other creatures!\r\n\r\nHe falls into a dream as usual, and in the conclusion fancies himself\r\npresent at the splendid festivities which took place at the marriage of\r\nhis patron. The ladye of his affection is described as the beloved\r\nfriend and companion of the bride. She is sent to grace the marriage\r\nceremony with her presence; and Chaucer seizes the occasion to plead his\r\nsuit for love and mercy. Then the Prince, the Queen, and all the rest of\r\nthe Court, unite in conjuring the lady to have pity on his pain, and\r\nrecompence his truth; she smiles, and with a pretty hesitation at last\r\nconsents.\r\n\r\n    Sith his will and yours are one,\r\n    Contrary in me shall be none.\r\n\r\nThey are married: the ladies and the knights wish them\r\n\r\n         ----Heart's pleasance,\r\n    In joy and health continuance!\r\n\r\nThe minstrels strike up,--the multitude send forth a shout; and in the\r\nmidst of these joyous and triumphant sounds, and in the troubled\r\nexultation of his own heart, the sleeper bounds from his couch,--\r\n\r\n    Wening to have been at the feast,\r\n\r\nand wakes to find it all a dream. He looks around for the gorgeous\r\nmarriage-feast, and instead of the throng of knights and ladies gay, he\r\nsees nothing but the figures staring at him from the tapestry.\r\n\r\n    On the walls old portraiture\r\n    Of horsemen, of hawks and hounds,\r\n    And hurt deer all full of wounds;\r\n    Some like torn, some hurt with shot;\r\n    And as my dream was, _that_ was not![49]\r\n\r\nHe is plunged in grief to find himself thus reft of all his visionary\r\njoys, and prays to sleep again, and dream thus for aye, or at least \"a\r\nthousand years and ten.\"\r\n\r\n    Lo, here my bliss!--lo, here my pain!\r\n    Which to my ladye I complain,\r\n    And grace and mercy of her requere,\r\n    To end my woe and all my fear;\r\n    And me accept for her service--\r\n    That of my dream, the substance\r\n    Might turnen, once, to cognisance.[50]\r\n\r\nAnd the whole concludes with a very tender \"envoi,\" expressly addressed\r\nto Philippa, although the poem was written in honour of his patrons, the\r\nDuke and Duchess. It has been well observed, that nothing can be more\r\ndelicate and ingenious than the manner in which Chaucer has complimented\r\nhis mistress, and ventured to shadow forth his own hopes and desires;\r\nconfessing, at the same time, that they were built on air and ended in a\r\ndream: it may be added, that nothing can be more picturesque and\r\nbeautiful, and vigorous, than some of the descriptive parts of this\r\npoem.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that Philippa was absolutely deaf to the\r\nsuit, or insensible to the fame and talents of her poet-lover. The delay\r\nwhich took place was from a cause honourable to her character and her\r\nheart; it arose from the declining health of her royal mistress, to whom\r\nshe was most strongly and gratefully attached, and whose noble qualities\r\ndeserved all her affection. It appears, from a comparison of dates, that\r\nChaucer endured a suspense of more than nine years, during which he was\r\na constant and fervent suitor for his ladye's grace. In this interval he\r\ntranslated the Romaunt of the Rose, the most famous poetical work of the\r\nmiddle ages. He addressed it to his mistress; and it is remarkable that\r\na very elaborate and cynical satire on women, which occurs in the\r\noriginal French, is entirely omitted by Chaucer in his version; perhaps\r\nbecause it would have been a profanation to her who then ruled his\r\nheart: on other occasions he showed no such forbearance.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1369, Chaucer lost his amiable patroness, the Duchess\r\nBlanche; she died in her thirtieth year; he lamented her death in a long\r\npoem, entitled the \"Booke of the Duchesse.\" The truth of the story, the\r\nvirtues, the charms, and the youth of the Princess, the grief of her\r\nhusband, and the simplicity and beauty of many passages, render this one\r\nof the most interesting and striking of all Chaucer's works.\r\n\r\nThe description of Blanche, in the \"Booke of the Duchesse,\" shows how\r\ntrifling is the difference between a perfect female character in the\r\nthirteenth century, and what would now be considered as such. It is a\r\nvery lively and animated picture. Her golden hair and laughing eyes; her\r\nskill in dancing, and her sweet carolling; her \"goodly and friendly\r\nspeech;\" her debonair looks; her gaiety, that was still \"so womanly;\"\r\nher indifference to general admiration; her countenance, \"that was so\r\nsimple and so benigne,\" contrasted with her high-spirited modesty and\r\nconsciousness of lofty birth,\r\n\r\n    No living wight might do her shame,\r\n    _She loved so well her own name_;\r\n\r\nher disdain of that coquetterie which holds men \"in balance,\"\r\n\r\n    By half-word or by countenance;\r\n\r\nher wit, \"without malice, and ever set upon gladnesse;\" and her\r\ngoodness, which the Poet, with a nice discrimination of female virtue,\r\ndistinguishes from mere ignorance of evil--for though in all her actions\r\nwas perfect innocence, he adds,\r\n\r\n    I say not that she had no knowing\r\n    What harm was; for, else, she\r\n    Had known no good--so thinketh me;\r\n\r\nare all beautifully and happily set forth, and are charms so appropriate\r\nto woman, as _woman_, that no change of fashion or lapse of ages can\r\nalter their effect. Time\r\n\r\n    \"Can draw no lines there with his antique pen.\"\r\n\r\nBut afterwards follows a trait peculiarly characteristic of the women of\r\nthat chivalrous period. She was not, says Chaucer, one of those ladies\r\nwho send their lovers off\r\n\r\n                  To Walachie,\r\n    To Prussia, and to Tartary,\r\n    To Alexandria, ne Turkie;\r\n\r\nand on other bootless errands, by way of displaying their power.\r\n\r\n    She used no such _knacks small_.\r\n\r\nThat is, she was superior to such frivolous tricks.\r\n\r\nJohn of Gaunt, who is the principal speaker and chief mourner in the\r\npoem, gives a history of his courtship, and tells with what mixture of\r\nfear and awe, he then \"right young,\" approached the lovely heiress of\r\nLancaster: but bethinking him that Heaven could never have formed in any\r\ncreature so great beauty and bounty \"withouten mercie,\"--in that hope he\r\nmakes his confession of love; and he goes on to tell us, with exquisite\r\n_naivete_,--\r\n\r\n    I wot not well how I began,\r\n    Full evil rehearse it, I can:\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    For many a word I overskipt\r\n    In telling my tale--for pure fear,\r\n    Lest that my words misconstrued were.\r\n    Softly, and quaking for pure dred,\r\n    And shame,--\r\n    Full oft I wax'd both pale and red;\r\n    I durst not once look her on,\r\n    For wit, manner, and all was gone;\r\n    I said, \"Mercie, sweet!\"--and no more.\r\n\r\nThen his anguish at her first rejection, and his rapture when, at last,\r\nhe wins from his ladye\r\n\r\n    The noble gift of her mercie;\r\n\r\nhis domestic happiness--his loss, and his regrets, are all told with the\r\nsame truth, simplicity, and profound feeling. For such passages and such\r\npictures as these, Chaucer will still be read, triumphant as the poet of\r\nnature, over the rust and dust of ages, and all the difficulties of\r\nantique style and obsolete spelling; which last, however, though\r\nrepulsive, is only a difficulty to the eye, and easily overcome.\r\n\r\nTo return to Chaucer's own love.--In the opening lines of the \"Booke of\r\nthe Duchesse,\" he describes himself as wasted with his \"eight years'\r\nsicknesse,\" alluding to his long courtship of the coy Philippa:\r\n\r\n    I have great wonder, by this light,\r\n    How that I live!--for day nor night\r\n    I may not sleepen well-nigh nought:\r\n    I have so many an idle thought\r\n    Purely for the default of sleep;\r\n    That, by my troth, I take no keep\r\n    Of nothing--how it com'th or go'th,\r\n    To me is nothing liefe or lothe;[51]\r\n    All is equal good to me,\r\n    Joy or sorrow--whereso it be;\r\n    For I have feeling in no thing,\r\n    But am, as 'twere, a mazed[52] thing,\r\n    All day in point to fall adown\r\n    For sorrowful imagination, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the same year with the Duchess died the good Queen of Edward the\r\nThird; and Philippa Picard being thus sadly released from her attendance\r\non her mistress, a few months afterwards married Chaucer, then in his\r\nforty-second year.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of her good service, Philippa had a pension for her life;\r\nand I regret that little more is known concerning her: but it should\r\nseem that she was a good and tender wife, and that long years of wedded\r\nlife did not weaken her husband's attachment for her; for she\r\naccompanied Chaucer when he was exiled, about fifteen years after his\r\nmarriage, though every motive of prudence and selfishness, on both\r\nsides, would then have induced a separation.[53] Neither was the poet\r\nlikely to be easily satisfied on the score of conjugal obedience; he was\r\nrather _exigeant_ and despotic, if we may trust his own description of a\r\nperfect wife. The chivalrous and poetical lover was the slave of his\r\nmistress; but once married, it is all _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n    She saith not once _nay_, when he saith _yea_\r\n    \"Do this,\" saith he, \"all ready, Sir,\" saith she!\r\n\r\nThe precise date of Philippa's death is not known, but it took place\r\nsome years before that of her husband. Their residence at the time of\r\ntheir marriage, was a small stone building, near the entrance of\r\nWoodstock Park; it had been given to Chaucer by Edward the Third;\r\nafterwards they resided principally at Donnington Castle, that fine and\r\nstriking ruin, which must be remembered by all who have travelled the\r\nNewberry road. In the domain attached to this castle were three oaks of\r\nremarkable size and beauty, to which Chaucer gave the names of the\r\nQueen's oak, the King's oak, and Chaucer's oak; these venerable trees\r\nwere felled in Evelyn's time, and are commemorated in his Sylva, as\r\namong the noblest of their species.\r\n\r\nPhilippa's eldest son, Thomas Chaucer, had a daughter, Alice, who became\r\nthe wife of William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, the famous favourite of\r\nMargaret of Anjou. The grandson of Alice Chaucer, by the Duke of\r\nSuffolk, John Earl of Lincoln, was declared heir to the crown by Richard\r\nthe Third;[54] and had the issue of the battle of Bosworth been\r\ndifferent, would undoubtedly have ascended the throne of England;--as it\r\nwas, the lineage of Chaucer was extinguished on a scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Catherine Picard de Rouet, the sister of Chaucer's wife, was\r\nstill more remarkable,--she was destined to be the mother of a line of\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nShe had been _domicella_, or maid of honour to the Duchess Blanche,\r\nafter whose death, the infant children of the Princess were committed to\r\nher care.[55] In this situation she won the heart of their father, the\r\nDuke of Lancaster, who on the death of his second wife, Constance of\r\nCastile, married Catherine, and his children by her were solemnly\r\nlegitimatized. The conduct of Catherine, except in one instance, had\r\nbeen irreproachable: her humility, her prudence, and her various\r\naccomplishments, not only reconciled the royal family and the people to\r\nher marriage, but added lustre to her rank: and when Richard the Second\r\nmarried Isabella of France, the young Queen, then only nine years old,\r\nwas placed under the especial care and tuition of the Duchess of\r\nLancaster.\r\n\r\nOne of the grand-daughters of Catherine, Lady Jane Beaufort, had the\r\nsingular fortune of becoming at once the inspiration and the love of a\r\ngreat poet, the queen of an accomplished monarch, and the common\r\nancestress of all the sovereigns of England since the days of\r\nElizabeth.[56]\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, was the influence of woman on a poetic temperament more\r\nbeautifully illustrated, than in the story of James the First of\r\nScotland, and Lady Jane Beaufort. It has been so elegantly told by\r\nWashington Irving in the Sketch-Book, that it is only necessary to refer\r\nto it.--James, while a prisoner, was confined in Windsor Castle, and\r\nimmediately under his window there was a fair garden, in which the Lady\r\nJane was accustomed to walk with her attendants, distinguished above\r\nthem all by her beauty and dignity, even more than by her state and the\r\nrichness of her attire. The young monarch beheld her accidentally, his\r\nimagination was fired, his heart captivated, and from that moment his\r\nprison was no longer a dungeon, but a palace of light and love. As he\r\nwas the best poet and musician of his time, he composed songs in her\r\npraise, set them to music, and sang them to his lute. He also wrote the\r\nhistory of his love, with all its circumstances, in a long poem[57]\r\nstill extant; and though the language be now obsolete, it is described,\r\nby those who have studied it, as not only full of beauties both of\r\nsentiment and expression, but unpolluted by a single thought or allusion\r\nwhich the most refined age, or the most fastidious delicacy, could\r\nreject;--a singular distinction, when we consider that James's only\r\nmodels must have been Gower and Chaucer, to whom no such praise is due:\r\nwe must rather suppose that he was no imitator, but that he owed his\r\ninspiration to modest and queenly beauty, and to the genuine tenderness\r\nof his own heart. His description of the fair apparition who came to\r\nbless his solitary hours, is so minute and peculiar, that it must have\r\nbeen drawn from the life:--the net of pearls, in which her light tresses\r\nwere gathered up; the chain of fine-wrought gold about her neck; the\r\nheart-shaped ruby suspended from it, which glowed on her snowy bosom\r\nlike a spark of fire; her white vest looped up to facilitate her\r\nmovements; her graceful damsels who followed at a respectful distance;\r\nand her little dog gambolling round her with its collar of silver\r\nbells,--these, and other picturesque circumstances, were all noted in\r\nthe lover's memory, and have been recorded by the poet's verse. And he\r\nsums up her perfections thus:\r\n\r\n    In her was youth, beauty, and numble port,\r\n      Bountee, richesse, and womanly feature.\r\n    God better knows than my pen can report,\r\n      Wisdom, largesse,[58] estate,[59] and cunning[60] sure:\r\n    In every point so guided her measure,\r\n    In word, in deed, in shape, in countenance,\r\n    That nature could no more her child advance.\r\n\r\nThe account of his own feelings as she disappears from his charmed\r\ngaze,--his lingering at the window of his tower, till Phoebus\r\n\r\n    Had bid farewell to every leaf and flower,--\r\n\r\nthen resting his head pensively on the cold stone, and the vision which\r\nsteals upon his half-waking, half-dreaming fancy, and shadows forth the\r\nhappy issue of his love,--are all conceived in the most lively manner.\r\nIt is judged from internal evidence, that this poem must have been\r\nfinished after his marriage, since he intimates that he is blessed in\r\nthe possession of her he loved, and that the fair vision of his solitary\r\ndungeon is realised.\r\n\r\nWhen the King of Scots was released, he wooed and won openly, and as a\r\nmonarch, the woman he had adored in secret. The marriage was solemnized\r\nin 1423, and he carried Lady Jane to Scotland where she was crowned soon\r\nafter his bride and queen.\r\n\r\nHow well she merited, and how deeply she repaid the love of her devoted\r\nand all-accomplished husband, is told in history. When James was\r\nsurprised and murdered by some of his factious barons, his queen threw\r\nherself between him and the daggers of the assassins, received many of\r\nthe wounds aimed at his heart, nor could they complete their purpose\r\ntill they had dragged her by force from his arms. She deserved to be a\r\npoet's queen and love! These are the souls, the deeds which inspire\r\npoetry,--or rather which are themselves poetry, its principle and its\r\nessence. It was on this occasion that Catherine Douglas, one of the\r\nqueen's attendants, thrust her arm into the stanchion of the door to\r\nserve the purpose of a bolt, and held it there till the savage\r\nassailants forced their way by shattering the frail defence. What times\r\nwere those!--alas! the love of women, and the barbarity of men!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] Edward III. and the Black Prince.\r\n\r\n[46] She was popularly distinguished as the \"_good_ Queen Anne,\" and as\r\ndear to her husband as to her people. Richard, who with many and fatal\r\nfaults, really possessed sensibility and strong domestic affections with\r\nwhich Shakspeare has so finely pourtrayed him, was passionately devoted\r\nto his amiable wife. She died young, at the Palace of Sheen; and when\r\nRichard afterwards visited the scene of his loss, he solemnly cursed it\r\nin his anguish, and commanded it to be razed to the ground, which was\r\ndone. One of our kings afterwards rebuilt it.

It may be\r\nso:--yet was it the fault of Lorenzo, if his collateral posterity\r\nafterwards became the oppressors of that State of which he was the\r\nfather and the saviour? And since in this world some must command and\r\nsome obey, what power is so legitimate as that derived from the\r\ninfluence of superior virtue and talent? from the employ of riches\r\nobtained by honourable industry, and expended with princely munificence,\r\nand subscribed to by the will and the affections of the people?\r\n\r\nBut I forget:--these are questions foreign to our subject. Politics I\r\nnever could understand in my life, and history I have forgotten,--or\r\nwould wish to forget,--perplexed by its conflicting evidence, and\r\nshocked by its interminable tissue of horrors. Let others then scale the\r\nheight while we gather flowers at the foot; let others explore the mazes\r\nof the forest; ours be rather\r\n\r\n    The gay parterre, the chequered shade,\r\n    The morning bower, the evening colonnade,\r\n    Those soft recesses of uneasy minds,\r\n\r\nwhence the din of doleful war, the rumour of cruelty and suffering, and\r\nall the \"fitful stir unprofitable\" of the world are shut out, and only\r\nthe beautiful and good, or the graceful and the gay, are admitted. There\r\nhave been pens enough, Heaven knows, to chronicle the wrongs, the\r\ncrimes, the sorrows of our sex: why should I add an echo to that voice,\r\nwhich from the beginning has cried aloud in the wilderness of this\r\nworld, upon women betrayed, and betraying in self-defence? A nobler and\r\nmore grateful task be mine, to show them how much of what is most fair,\r\nmost excellent, most sublime among the productions of human genius, has\r\nbeen owing to their influence, direct or indirect; and call up the\r\nspirits of the dead,--those who from their silent urns still rule the\r\npulses of our hearts--to bear witness to this truth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, Lorenzo the MAGNIFICENT, the statesman, and the chief\r\nof a great republic, who finds a place in these pages,--but Lorenzo the\r\nlover and the poet, round whose memory hover a thousand bright\r\nrecollections connected with the revival of arts and literature, and the\r\ngolden age of Italy. Let politicians say what they will, there is a\r\nspell of harmony, there is music in his very name! how softly the\r\nvowelled syllables drop from the lips--LORENZO DE' MEDICI!--it even\r\nlooks elegant when written. Yes, there is something in the mere sound of\r\na name. I remember once taking up a book, and a very celebrated book,\r\nin which, after turning over some of the pages with pleasure, I came to\r\n_Peter_ and _Laurence Medecis_,--I shut it hastily, as I would have\r\ncovered my ears to protect them from a sudden discord in music.\r\n\r\nBetween Petrarch and Lorenzo de' Medici, there occurs not a single great\r\nname in Italian poetry. The century seemed to lie fallow, as if\r\npreparing for the great birth of various genius which distinguished the\r\nsucceeding age. The sciences and the classics were chiefly studied, and\r\nphilosophy and Greek seemed to have banished love and poetry.\r\n\r\nIn such a state of things, it is rather surprising to find in Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici the common case reversed; for by his own confession, it\r\nappears that it was not love which made him a poet, but poetry which\r\nmade him a lover.\r\n\r\nGiuliano, the brother of Lorenzo,--he who was afterwards assassinated by\r\nthe Pazzi, and was so beloved at Florence for his amiable character and\r\npersonal accomplishments, had been seized with a passion for a lady\r\nnamed Simonetta, who was esteemed the most beautiful woman in Florence,\r\nand is scarcely ever mentioned but with the epithet, \"La bella\r\nSimonetta.\"--She died in the bloom of early youth, and all the wit and\r\neloquence of her native city were called forth in condolences addressed\r\nto Giuliano, or elegies to her memory, in prose and verse, Latin, Greek,\r\nand Italian. Among the rest, Lorenzo, who had already made several\r\nattempts in Italian poetry, pressed forward to celebrate the love and\r\nthe loss of his amiable brother:--in his zeal to do justice to so dear a\r\nsubject, he worked himself up into a fit of amorous and poetical\r\nenthusiasm which soon found a real and living beauty for its object. But\r\nto give this romantic tale its proper effect, it must be related in\r\nLorenzo's own words. He has left us a most circumstantial and elegant as\r\nwell as interesting and fanciful account of the birth and progress of\r\nhis poetic passion, and I extract it at length from Mr. Roscoe's\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\n\"A young lady of great personal attractions happened to die at Florence;\r\nand as she had been very generally admired and beloved, so her death\r\nwas as generally lamented. Nor was this to be much wondered at; for,\r\nindependent of her beauty, her manners were so engaging, that almost\r\nevery person who had any acquaintance with her flattered himself that he\r\nhad obtained the chief place in her affections.\" (In other words, this\r\nbeautiful Simonetta was an exquisite coquette.)\r\n\r\n\"This fatal event excited the extreme regret of her admirers; and as she\r\nwas carried to the place of burial, with her face uncovered, those who\r\nhad known her when living, pressed for a last look at the object of\r\ntheir adoration, and accompanied her funeral with their tears.\r\n\r\n\"On this occasion, all the eloquence, and all the wit of Florence were\r\nexerted in paying due honours to her memory, both in prose and verse.\r\nAmongst the rest, I also composed a few sonnets; and in order to give\r\nthem greater effect, I endeavoured to convince myself, that I too had\r\nbeen deprived of the object of my love, and to excite in my own mind all\r\nthose passions that might enable me to move the affections of\r\nothers.--Under the influence of this delusion, I began to think how\r\nsevere was the fate of those by whom she had been beloved; and from\r\nthence was led to consider, whether there was any other lady in this\r\ncity deserving of such honour and praise, and to imagine the happiness\r\nthat must be experienced by any one, whose good fortune could procure\r\nhim such a subject for his pen. I accordingly sought for some time\r\nwithout having the satisfaction of finding any one, who in my judgment\r\nwas deserving of a sincere and constant attachment. But when I had\r\nnearly resigned all expectations of success, chance threw in my way that\r\nwhich had been denied to my most diligent inquiry; as if the God of Love\r\nhad selected this hopeless period, to give me a more decisive proof of\r\nhis power.--A public festival was held in Florence, to which all that\r\nwas noble and beautiful in the city resorted. To this I was brought by\r\nsome of my companions (I suppose as my destiny led) against my will, for\r\nI had for some time past avoided such exhibitions; or if at times I\r\nattended them, it proceeded rather from a compliance with custom, than\r\nfrom any pleasure I experienced in them. Among the ladies there\r\nassembled, I saw one of such sweet and attractive manners, that while I\r\nregarded her, I could not help saying, 'If this person were possessed of\r\nthe delicacy, the understanding, the accomplishments of her who is\r\nlately dead--most certainly she excels her in the charms of her\r\nperson.--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Resigning myself to my passion, I endeavoured to discover, if possible,\r\nhow far her manners and her conversation agreed with her appearance; and\r\nhere I found such an assemblage of extraordinary endowments, that it was\r\ndifficult to say whether she excelled more in person or in mind. Her\r\nbeauty was, as I have before mentioned, astonishing. She was of a just\r\nand proper height. Her complexion extremely fair, but not\r\npale,--blooming but not ruddy. Her countenance was serious, without\r\nbeing severe,--mild and pleasant without levity or vulgarity. Her eyes\r\nwere lively, without any indication of pride or conceit. Her whole\r\nshape was so finely proportioned, that amongst other women she appeared\r\nwith superior dignity, yet free from the least degree of formality or\r\naffectation. In walking, in dancing, or in other exercises which display\r\nthe person, every motion was elegant and appropriate. Her sentiments\r\nwere always just and striking, and have furnished materials for some of\r\nmy sonnets; she always spoke at the proper time, and always to the\r\npurpose, so that nothing could be added, nothing taken away. Though her\r\nremarks were often keen and pointed, yet they were so tempered as not to\r\ngive offence. Her understanding was superior to her sex, but without the\r\nappearance of arrogance or presumption; and she avoided an error too\r\ncommon among women, who, when they think themselves sensible, become for\r\nthe most part insupportable.[61] To recount all her excellencies would\r\nfar exceed my present limits, and I shall therefore conclude with\r\naffirming, that there was nothing which could be desired in a beautiful\r\nand an accomplished woman, which was not in her most abundantly found.\r\nBy these qualities I was so captivated, that not a power or faculty of\r\nmy body or mind remained any longer at liberty, and I could not help\r\nconsidering the lady who had died, as the star of Venus, which at the\r\napproach of the sun is totally overpowered and extinguished.\"\r\n\r\nThe real name of this beautiful and accomplished creature, Lorenzo was\r\ntoo discreet to reveal; but from contemporary authors, we learn that she\r\nwas Lucretia Donati--a noble lady, distinguished at Florence for her\r\nvirtue and beauty, and of the same illustrious family which had given a\r\nwife to Dante.\r\n\r\nWhen Lorenzo undertook to fall in love thus poetically, he was only\r\ntwenty: the experiment was perilous; and it is not wonderful that this\r\nimaginary passion had at first in his ardent and susceptible mind all\r\nthe effects of a real one: he neglected society--abandoned himself to\r\nmusing and solitude--affected the rural shades, and gave up his time,\r\nand devoted all his powers, to celebrate, in the richest colouring of\r\npoetry, her whom he had selected to be the mistress of his heart, or\r\nrather the presiding goddess of his fancy.\r\n\r\nThe result is exactly what may be imagined, and a proof of the theory on\r\nwhich I insist, that \"nothing but what arises from the heart goes to the\r\nheart, and that the verse which never quickened a pulse in the bosom of\r\nthe poet, never awakened a throb in that of his reader.\" If I were\r\nrequired to express in one word the distinguishing character of\r\nLorenzo's amatory poems, I should say _grace_: they are full of refined\r\nsentiment, elegant simplicity, the most exquisite little touches of\r\ndescription, and illustrations, drawn either from external nature, or\r\nfrom the refined mysteries of platonism; but there is a want of passion,\r\nof power, and of pathos; there is no genuine emotion; no overflow of the\r\nheart, bursting with its own intense feeling; no voice that cries aloud\r\nfor our sympathy, and echoes to our inmost bosom. What true lover ever\r\nthought of apologising for having given his time to celebrate the object\r\nof his love?\r\n\r\n\"Persecuted as I have been from my youth,\" says Lorenzo, \"some\r\nindulgence may perhaps be allowed me for having sought consolation in\r\nthese pursuits.\"--And again, in allusion to his political\r\nsituation,--\"It is not to be wondered at if I endeavoured to alleviate\r\nmy anxiety by turning to more agreeable subjects of meditation; and in\r\ncelebrating the charms of my mistress, sought a temporary refuge from my\r\ncares.\"--Thus Lorenzo tells us that it was not in obedience to the\r\ndictates of his own overflowing heart, nor yet to celebrate the charms\r\nof his mistress, and win her favour, that he wrote in her praise, but to\r\namuse himself and distract his mind from those cares and anxieties into\r\nwhich he was so early plunged. It has followed as a natural consequence,\r\nthat elegant as are the amatory effusions of Lorenzo, they are less\r\ncelebrated, less popular, than his descriptive and moral poems. His\r\nAmbra, La Nencia, and his songs for the carnival, have all in their\r\nrespective style a higher stamp of excellence and originality than his\r\nlove poetry. His forte seems to have been lively description,\r\nphilosophical illustration, and brilliant and sportive fancy, combined\r\nwith a classic taste and polished versification. Some of those sonnets,\r\nwhich, though addressed to Madonna Lucretia, turn chiefly on some\r\nbeautiful thought or description, are finished like gems; as that on\r\nSolitude--\r\n\r\n    Cerchi chi vuol le pompe e gli alti onori;\r\n\r\nand that well known and charming one, \"Sopra Violetti,\"\r\n\r\n    Non di verdi giardin, ornati e colti, &c.\r\n\r\nboth of which have been happily translated by Roscoe; and to these may\r\nbe added the address to Cytherea--\r\n\r\n    Lascia l' isola tua tanta diletta!\r\n    Lascia il tuo regno delicato e bello\r\n    Ciprigna Dea! &c.\r\n\r\nThere is another, not so well known, distinguished by its peculiar fancy\r\nand elegance--\r\n\r\n    Spesso mi torna a mente, anzi gia mai, &c.\r\n\r\nIn this he recalls to mind the time and the place, and even the vesture\r\nin which his gentle lady first appeared to him--\r\n\r\n    Quanto vaga, gentil, leggiadra, e pia\r\n    Non si puo dir, ne imaginar assai;\r\n\r\nand he beautifully adds,\r\n\r\n    Quale sopra i nevosi, ed alti monti\r\n    Apollo spande il suo bel lume adorno,\r\n    Tal' i crin suoi sopra la bianca gonna!\r\n    Il tempo e 'l luogo non convien ch' io conti,\r\n    Che dov' e si bel sole e sempre giorno;\r\n    E Paradiso, ov' e si bella Donna!\r\n\r\n\"As over the snowy summits of the high mountains Apollo sheds his golden\r\nbeams, so flowed her golden tresses over her white vest.--But for the\r\n_time_ and the _place_, is it necessary that I should note them? Where\r\nshines so fair a sun, can it be other than day? Where dwells so\r\nexcellent a beauty, can it be other than Paradise?\"\r\n\r\nIt happened in the midst of Lorenzo's visions of love and poetry, that\r\nhe was called upon to give his hand to a wife chosen by his father for\r\npolitical reasons. His inclinations were not consulted, as is plain\r\nfrom the blunt amusing manner in which he has noted it down in his\r\nmemoranda. \"I, Lorenzo, took to wife Donna Clarice Orsini,--or rather\r\nshe was given to me, (ovvero mi fu data) on such a day.\" Yet a union\r\nthus inauspiciously contracted, was rendered, by the affectionate\r\ndisposition of Lorenzo, and the amiable qualities of his wife, rather\r\nhappy than otherwise; it is true, we have no poetical compliments\r\naddressed by Lorenzo to Donna Clarice, but there is extant a little\r\nbillet written to her a few months after their marriage, from the tone\r\nof which it is fair to suppose, that Lorenzo had exchanged his poetic\r\nflame for a real attachment to an amiable woman.[62]\r\n\r\nThere is a very beautiful and elegant passage in the beginning of\r\nLorenzo's commentary on his own poems, in which he enlarges on the\r\ntheory of love. \"The conditions (he says) which appear necessarily to\r\nbelong to a true, exalted, and worthy love, are two. First,--_to love\r\nbut one_: secondly,--_to love that one always_. Not many lovers have\r\nhearts so generous as to be capable of fulfilling these two conditions;\r\nand exceedingly few women display sufficient attractions to withhold men\r\nfrom the violation of them; yet without these there is no true love.\"\r\nAnd afterwards, enumerating those charms of person and mind which\r\ninspire affection, he adds, \"and yet these estimable qualities are not\r\nenough, unless the lover possess sensibility of heart to discern them,\r\nand elevation and generosity of soul to appreciate them.\"\r\n\r\nThis in the original is very elegantly expressed, and the sentiment is\r\nas true as it is exalted and graceful; but that Lorenzo was not always\r\nthus philosophically refined, that he could descend from these\r\nPlatonics to be impassioned and in earnest, and that when touched to the\r\nheart, he could pour forth the language of the heart, we have a single\r\ninstance, which it is impossible to allude to without feeling some\r\nemotion of curiosity, which can never now be gratified.\r\n\r\nWe find among Lorenzo's poems, written later in life than those\r\naddressed to Lucretia Donati, one entitled simply \"An Elegy;\" the style\r\nis different from that of his earlier poetry, and has more of the\r\nterseness and energy of Dante than the sweetness and flow of Petrarch.\r\nIt begins\r\n\r\n    \"Vinto dagli amorosi, empi martiri.\"\r\n\r\n\"Subdued by the fierce pangs of my love, a thousand times have I taken\r\nup the pen, to tell thee, O gentle lady mine, all the sighs of my sick\r\nheart. Then fearing thy displeasure, I have, on a second thought, flung\r\nit from me. * * * Yet must I speak, for if words were wanting, my pallid\r\ncheek would betray my suffering.\"\r\n\r\nHe then tells her that he does not seek her dishonour, but only her kind\r\nthoughts, and that he may find a place within her gentle heart.\r\n\r\n    Perche non cerco alcun tuo disonore,\r\n    Ma sol la grazia tua, e che piaci\r\n    Che'l mio albergo sia dentro al tuo core!\r\n\r\nHe wishes that he might be once permitted to twine his fingers in her\r\nfair hair; to gaze into her eyes;--but he complains that she will not\r\neven meet his look,--that she resolutely turns her eyes another way at\r\nhis approach.--\"But do with me what thou wilt: while I live upon this\r\nearth, still I must love thee, since it so pleaseth Heaven--I swear it!\r\nand my hand writes it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Come then! oh come, while yet thy gracious looks may avail me, for\r\ndelay is death to one who loves likes me! Would I could send with this\r\nscroll all the torture of heart, the tears and sighs, the gesture and\r\nthe look, that should accompany it!\"\r\n\r\n    Ma s' egli avvien, che soletti ambo insieme,\r\n    Posso il braccio tenerti al collo avvolto,\r\n    Vedrai come d'amore alto arde e geme,\r\n    Vedrai cader dal mio pallido volto,\r\n    Nel tuo candido sen lagrime tante.\r\n\r\n(I leave these lines untranslated for the benefit of the Italian\r\nreader). After a few more stanzas, we have this very unequivocal\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n\"O would to Heaven, lady, that marriage had made us one! ah, why didst\r\nthou not come into this world a little sooner?--or I a little later? Yet\r\nwhy these vain thoughts? since I am doomed to see thee the bride of\r\nanother, and am myself fettered in these marriage bonds!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Thou knowest, Madonna, that these sighs, these burning words, are not\r\nfeigned; for even as Love dictates does my hand write.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"My life and death are with thee;--grant me but a few words, and I am\r\ncontent to live;--if not, let me die! and let my poor remains be laid in\r\nsome forlorn and sequestered spot. Let none whisper the cause of my\r\ndeath, lest it should grieve thee! enough if some kind hand engrave upon\r\nmy tomb,--'_He perished through too much love and too much cruelty._'\"\r\n\r\nI have given, literally, the leading sentiments of this little poem, but\r\nhave left untranslated many of the stanzas. There are one or two\r\nconcetti; but as Ginguene truly observes on a different occasion, \"Dans\r\nles poetes Italiens, souvent la passion est vraie, meme quand\r\nl'expression ne l'est pas.\"\r\n\r\nThe style is so natural, the transitions so abrupt, the expressions so\r\nenergetic, and there are so few of those descriptive ornaments which are\r\nplentifully scattered through Lorenzo's other poems, that I should\r\npronounce it the real effusion of a heart, touched,--and deeply touched.\r\nIt is to be regretted that we know nothing of the name or real character\r\nof an object who, deserving or not, could call forth such strong lines\r\nas these; and in the plenitude of his power and fame, and in the midst\r\nof his great and serious avocations, deeply, though secretly, tyrannise\r\nover the peace of Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nHe is accused,--I regret that I must allude to it,--of considerable\r\nlicence of manners with regard to women;--a reproach from which Roscoe\r\nhas fairly vindicated him. United, at the age of twenty-one, to a woman\r\nhe had never seen; residing in a dissipated capital, surrounded by\r\ntemptation, and from disposition peculiarly sensible to the influence of\r\nwomen, it is not matter of astonishment if Lorenzo's conjugal faith was\r\nnot preserved immaculate,--if he occasionally became the thrall of\r\nbeauty, and--(since he was not likely to be caught by vulgar\r\ncharms,)--if he sighed, _par hazard_, for one who was not to be tempted\r\nby power or gold: such a one as his Elegy indicates. Two points are\r\ncertain,--that his uniform respect and kindness to his wife Clarice,\r\nleft her no reason to complain; while his discretion was such, that\r\nthough historians have hazarded a general accusation against him in this\r\none particular, there exists not in any contemporary writer one\r\nscandalous anecdote of his private life, nor the name of any woman to\r\nwhom he was attached, except that of his poetical love, Lucretia Donati.\r\n\r\nLorenzo de' Medici was not handsome in face, nor graceful in form; but\r\nhe was captivating in his manners, and excelled in all manly exercises.\r\nThe engraving prefixed to Roscoe's life of him, does not do justice to\r\nhis countenance. I remember the original picture in the gallery of\r\nFlorence, on which I have looked day after day for many minutes\r\ntogether, with an interest that can only be felt on the very spot where\r\nthe memory of Lorenzo is \"wherever we look, wherever we move.\" In spite\r\nof the stoop in the shoulders, the unbecoming dress, and the harsh\r\nfeatures, I was struck by the grand simplicity of the head, and the\r\nmingled expression of acuteness, benevolence, and earnest thought in the\r\ncountenance; the imagination filled with the splendid character of the\r\nman, might possibly have perceived more than the eye,--but such was my\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nLorenzo died in his forty-fourth year, in 1492. He is not interred in\r\nthat celebrated chapel of his family, rich with the sublimest\r\nproductions of Michael Angelo's chisel: he lies at the opposite side of\r\nthe church, in a magnificent sarcophagus of bronze, which contains also\r\nthe ashes of his murdered brother, Giuliano.--Among the recollections,\r\nsweet and bitter, which I brought from Florence, is the remembrance of a\r\nday when retiring, from the glare of an Italian noontide, I stood in the\r\nchurch of San Lorenzo, sketching the tomb of Lorenzo and Giuliano de'\r\nMedici. The spot whence I viewed it was so obscure, that I could scarce\r\nsee the lines traced by my pencil; but immediately behind the\r\nsarcophagus, there flowed from above a stream of strong light, relieving\r\nwith added effect the dark outline of the sculptured ornaments. Through\r\nthe grating which formed the background, I could see the figures of\r\nshaven monks and stoled priests gliding to and fro, like apparitions;\r\nand while I thought more,--O much more,--of the still and cold repose\r\nwhich wrapped the dead, than of their high deeds and far-spread fame,\r\nthe plaintive music of a distant choir, chanting the _Via crucis_,\r\nfloated through the pillared aisles, receding or approaching as the\r\nsingers changed their station; swelling, sinking, and at length dying\r\naway on the ear.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] Lorenzo tells us in the original, that the ladies who rendered\r\nthemselves thus insupportable, were called (_vulgarly_)\r\n_Saccenti_:--query--_vulgarly, Blue-stockings_?\r\n\r\n[62] Lorenzo de' Medici to his wife Clarice:--\r\n\r\n\"I arrived here in safety, and am in good health: this, I believe, will\r\nplease thee better than any thing else, except my return, at least so I\r\njudge from my own desire to be once more with thee. Associate as much as\r\npossible with my father and sisters. I shall make all possible speed to\r\nreturn to thee, for it appears a thousand years till I see thee again.\r\nPray to God for me--if thou want any thing from this place write in\r\ntime. From Milan, 22d July, 1469. THY LORENZO.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FAIR GERALDINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the second Grand Duke of Tuscany, of Lorenzo's family,\r\n(Cosmo I.) Florence, it is said, beheld a novel and extraordinary\r\nspectacle: a young traveller, from a court and a country which the\r\nItalians of that day seemed to regard much as we now do the\r\nEsquimaux,[63] combining the learning of the scholar and the amiable\r\nbearing of the courtier, with all the rash bravery of youthful romance,\r\nastonished the inhabitants of that queenly city, first, by rivalling her\r\npolished nobles in the splendour of his state, and gallantry of his\r\nmanners, and next, by boldly proclaiming that his \"lady love\" was\r\nsuperior to all that Italy could vaunt of beauty, that she was \"oltre le\r\nbelle, bella,\" fair beyond the fairest,--and maintaining his boast in a\r\nsolemn tourney held in her honour, to the overthrow of all his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nThis was our English Surrey; one of the earliest and most elegant of our\r\namatory poets, and the lover of the Fair Geraldine.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the fame of the Earl of Surrey does not rest\r\nmerely on title, and that if the fair Geraldine had never existed, he\r\nwould still have lived in history as an accomplished scholar, soldier,\r\ncourtier, and been lamented as the noble victim of a suspicious tyrant.\r\nBut if some fair object of romantic gallantry had not given the impulse\r\nto his genius, and excited him to try his powers in a style of which no\r\nmodels yet existed in his native language,[64]--it may be doubted\r\nwhether his name would have descended to us with all those poetical and\r\nchivalrous associations which give a charm and an interest to his\r\nmemory, far beyond that of a mere historical character. As for the\r\nfair-haired, blue-eyed Geraldine, the mistress of his fancy and\r\naffections, and the subject of his verse, her identity long lay\r\n_entombed_, as it were, in a poetical name; but Surrey had loved her,\r\nhad maintained her beauty at the point of his lance--had made her\r\n\"famous by his pen, and glorious by his sword.\" This was more than\r\nenough to excite the interest and the inquiries of posterity, and lo!\r\nantiquaries and commentators fell to work, archives were searched,\r\ngenealogies were traced, and at length the substance of this beautiful\r\npoetical shadow was detected: she was proved to have been the Lady\r\nElizabeth Fitzgerald, afterwards the wife of a certain Earl of Lincoln,\r\nof whom little is known--but that he married the woman Surrey had loved.\r\n\r\nSurrey has ingeniously contrived to compress, within the compass of a\r\nsonnet, some of the most interesting particulars of the personal and\r\nfamily history of his mistress. The Fitzgeralds derive their origin\r\nfrom the Geraldi of Tuscany,--hence\r\n\r\n    From Tuscan came my ladye's worthy race,\r\n    Fair Florence was sometime their ancient seat.\r\n\r\nShe was born and nurtured in Ireland--\r\n\r\n    Fostered she was with milk of Irish breast.\r\n\r\nHer father was the Earl of Kildare, her mother allied to the blood\r\nroyal.\r\n\r\n    Her sire an Earl, her dame of Prince's blood.\r\n\r\nShe was brought up (through motives of compassion, after the misfortunes\r\nof her family,) at Hunsdon, with the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth,\r\nwhere Surrey, who frequently visited them in company with the young Duke\r\nof Richmond,[65] first beheld her.\r\n\r\n    Hunsdon did first present her to mine eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was then extremely young, not above fourteen or fifteen, as it\r\nappears from comparative dates; and Surrey says very clearly,\r\n\r\n    She wanted years to understand\r\n    The grief that he did feel.\r\n\r\nBut even then her budding charms made him confess as he beautifully\r\nexpresses it--\r\n\r\n    How soon a look can print a thought\r\n      That never may remove!\r\n\r\nIt was during the festivals held at Hampton Court, whither she\r\naccompanied the Princesses, that her conquest was completed; and Surrey\r\nbeing afterwards confined at Windsor,[66] was deprived of her society.\r\n\r\n    Bright is her hue, and Geraldine she hight;\r\n    Hampton me taught to wish her first for mine,\r\n    Windsor, alas! doth chase me from her sight.\r\n\r\nHampton Court was the scene of their frequent interviews. Surrey\r\nmentions a certain recessed or bow window, in which, retired apart from\r\nthe gay throng around them, they held \"converse sweet.\" Here she gave\r\nhim, as it seems, some encouragement; too proud of such a distinguished\r\nsuitor to let him escape. He in the same moment confesses himself a very\r\nslave, and betrays an indignant consciousness of the arts by which she\r\nkeeps him entangled in her chain.\r\n\r\n    In silence tho' I keep to such secrets myself,\r\n    Yet do I see how she sometime, doth yield a look by stealth;\r\n    As tho' it seemed, I wis,--\"I will not lose thee so!\"\r\n    When in her heart so sweet a thought did never truly grow.\r\n\r\nHe accuses her expressly of a love of general admiration, and of giving\r\nher countenance and favour to unworthy rivals. In \"The Warning to a\r\nLover how he is abused by his Love,\" he thus addresses himself as the\r\ndeceived lover:--\r\n\r\n    Where thou hast loved so long, with heart and all thy power,\r\n    I see thee fed with feigned words, &c.\r\n    I see her pleasant cheer in chiefest of thy suit:\r\n    When thou art gone, I see him come who gathers up the fruit;\r\n    And eke in thy respect, I see the base degree\r\n    Of him to whom she gives the heart, that promised was to thee![67]\r\n\r\nThe fair Geraldine must have been a practised coquette to have sat for a\r\npicture so finished and so strongly marked: yet before we blame her for\r\nthis disdainful trifling, it should be remembered that Lord Surrey, at\r\nthe time he was wooing her with \"musicke vows,\" was either married or\r\ncontracted to another,[68]--a circumstance quite in keeping with the\r\nfashionable system of Platonic gallantry introduced from Italy--\r\n\r\n    O Plato! Plato! you have been the cause, &c.\r\n\r\nand so forth. I forbear to continue the apostrophe.\r\n\r\nAccording to the old tradition, repeated by all Surrey's biographers, he\r\nvisited on his travels the famous necromancer Cornelius Agrippa, who in\r\na magic mirror revealed to him the fair figure of his Geraldine, lying\r\ndishevelled on a couch, and, by the light of a taper, reading one of his\r\ntenderest sonnets.\r\n\r\n    Fair all the pageant, but how passing fair\r\n      The slender form that lay on couch of Ind!\r\n    O'er her white bosom strayed her hazel hair,\r\n      Pale her dear cheek, as if for love she pined.\r\n    All in her night-robe loose, she lay reclined,\r\n      And pensive read from tablet eburnine,\r\n    Some strain that seemed her inmost soul to find;--\r\n      That favoured strain was Surrey's raptured line,\r\n    That fair and lovely form, the Lady Geraldine![69]\r\n\r\nThis beautiful incident is too celebrated, too touching, not to be one\r\nof the articles of our poetical faith. It was believed by Surrey's\r\ncontemporaries, and in the age immediately following was gravely related\r\nby a grave historian. It shows at least the celebrity which his poetry,\r\nunequalled at that time, had given to his love, and the object of it. In\r\nfact, when divested of the antique spelling, which, at the first glance,\r\nrevolts by the impression it gives of difficulty and obscurity, some of\r\nthe lyrics of Surrey have not since been surpassed either in elegance of\r\nsentiment, or flowing grace of expression:--for example--\r\n\r\n    A Praise of his Love, wherein he reproveth them that compare\r\n    their Ladies with his.\r\n\r\n    Give place ye lovers here before,\r\n    That spent your boastes and braggs in vain,\r\n    My ladye's beauty passeth more\r\n    The best of yours, I dare well sayne,\r\n    Then doth the sun the candle light,\r\n    Or brightest day the darkest night.\r\n    And thereto hath a truth as just,\r\n    As had Penelope the fair:\r\n    For what she sayeth you may it trust.\r\n      As it by writing sealed were;\r\n    And virtues hath she many moe,\r\n    Than I with pen have skill to show.\r\n\r\nThe following sonnet is rather a specimen of versification than of\r\nsentiment: the subject is borrowed from Petrarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPLAINT, BY NIGHT, OF A LOVER NOT BELOVED.\r\n\r\n    Alas! so all things now do hold their peace,\r\n      Heaven and earth disturbed in no thing;\r\n    The beasts, the air, the birds their song do cease,\r\n      And the night's car the stars about doth bring:\r\n    Calm is the sea, the waves work less and less:\r\n      So am not I, whom love, alas! doth wring,\r\n    Bringing before my face the great increase\r\n      Of my desires, whereas I weep and sing,\r\n    In joy and woe, as in a doubtful case.\r\n      For my sweet thoughts, some time do pleasure bring;\r\n    But by and by, the cause of my disease,\r\n      Gives me a pang, that inwardly doth sting,\r\n    When that I think, what grief it is again\r\n      To live, and lack the thing should rid my pain.\r\n\r\nGeraldine was so beautiful as to authorise the raptures of her poetical\r\nlover. Even in her later years, when as Countess of Lincoln, she\r\nattended on Queen Elizabeth, she retained so much of her excelling\r\nloveliness, that the adoration paid to her in youth, was not wondered\r\nat; and her celebrity as Surrey's early love, is alluded to by\r\ncotemporary writers.[70] There can be no doubt that she was an\r\naccomplished woman: the learned education the Princesses received at\r\nHunsdon, (in the advantages of which she participated,) is well known.\r\nHer father, Lord Kildare, was a man of vigorous intellect and uncommon\r\nattainments for the age in which he lived. He was the eighth Earl of his\r\nnoble family, and being engaged in the disturbances of Ireland, then a\r\nscene of eternal dissension and bloodshed between the native princes and\r\nthe lords of the English pale, he fell under the displeasure of Henry\r\nthe Eighth: his eldest son, and his five brothers, who had been seized\r\nas hostages, were executed on the same day at Tyburn, and the \"stout old\r\nEarl,\" as he is called in history, died broken-hearted in the Tower.\r\nThe mother of Geraldine is rendered interesting to us by a little family\r\ntrait, related by one of our old Chroniclers.[71] Lord Kildare, he tells\r\nus, \"was so well affected to his wife, as he would not at anie time buy\r\na suite of apparel for himself, but he would suite her with the same\r\nstuffe; the which gentlenesse she recompensed with equal kindnesse; for\r\nafter that he, the said Earle, deceased in the Tower, she did not onely\r\nlive a chaste and honourable widow, but also nightly, before she went to\r\nbed, she would resorte to his picture, and there, with a solemn _conge_,\r\nshe would bid her Lorde good nighte.\"\r\n\r\nThis Countess of Kildare was Lady Elizabeth Grey, granddaughter of that\r\nfamous Lady Elizabeth Grey, whose virtue made her the queen of Edward\r\nthe Fourth. Thus the fair Geraldine was cousin to the young princes who\r\nwere smothered in the Tower, and may truly be said to have been of\r\n\"Prince's blood.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the general tone of Surrey's poems does not\r\ngive us a favourable idea of the fair Geraldine's manners and character.\r\nShe was variable, coquetish, and fond of admiration;--on this point I\r\nhave offered some apology for her. She is accused also of marrying\r\ntwice, from _mercenary_ motives, and thus forfeiting the attachment of\r\nher noble and poetical lover.[72] This is unfair, I think; there is no\r\n_proof_ that Geraldine married solely from _mercenary_ motives. Surrey\r\nwas himself married, and both the men to whom she was successively\r\nunited,[73] were eminent in their day for high personal qualities,\r\nthough in comparison with Surrey, they have been reduced to hide their\r\ndiminished heads in peerages and genealogies.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Surrey was beheaded in 1547. The fair Geraldine was living\r\nforty years afterwards: she survived for a short time her second\r\nhusband, Lord Lincoln; and with him lies buried under a sumptuous tomb\r\nat Windsor: she left no descendants. Her youngest brother, Edward\r\nFitzgerald, was the lineal ancestor of the present Duke of Leinster.\r\n\r\nThe only original portrait of the fair Geraldine, now extant, is in the\r\ngallery of the Duke of Bedford, at Woburn; and I am told that it is\r\nsufficiently beautiful to justify Surrey's admiration.[74]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] \"Those bears of English--those barbarous islanders,\" are common\r\nphrases in the Italian writers of that age.\r\n\r\n[64] Surrey introduced the sonnet, and the use of blank verse into our\r\nliterature. It is a curious fact, that the earliest blank verse extant\r\nwas written by Saint Francis.\r\n\r\n[65] Natural brother of the princesses: he was the son of Henry VIII. by\r\nLady Talbot.\r\n\r\n[66] He was imprisoned for eating meat in Lent.\r\n\r\n[67] Lady Frances Vere.\r\n\r\n[68] Surrey's Works: Nott's Edit. 4to.\r\n\r\n[69] Lay of the Last Minstrel.\r\n\r\n[70] Queen Elizabeth's Progresses, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[71] Holinshed.\r\n\r\n[72] See Nott's edition of Surrey's Works.\r\n\r\n[73] She was the second wife of Sir Anthony Browne, and the third wife\r\nof the Earl of Lincoln, ancestor to the Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n[74] Those who are curious about historic proofs, may consult Anecdotes\r\nof the family of Howard, Memoirs and works of Henry Howard Earl of\r\nSurrey, edited by Dr. Nott, Park's Royal and Noble Authors, and Collins'\r\nPeerage, by Brydges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nGINEVRA, AND ALESSANDRA STROZZI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the sagacity of Horace Walpole was tracking the identity of the\r\nfair Geraldine, through the mazes of poetry and probability,--through\r\nparchments, through peerages, through papers, and through patents, he\r\nmust now and then have been annoyed by the provoking discretion of her\r\nchivalrous adorer, which had led him such a chase. But of all the\r\ndiscreet lovers that ever baffled commentators or biographers, commend\r\nme to Ariosto! though one of the last from whom discretion might have\r\nbeen expected on such a subject. He is known to have been particularly\r\nsusceptible to the power of beauty; passionate in his attachments; and\r\nthough pensive and abstracted in his general habits, almost irresistibly\r\ncaptivating in his intercourse with women. Yet such was his fine\r\nchivalrous feeling for the honour of those who, won by his rare\r\nqualities, yielded it to his keeping--\"such his marvellous secrecy and\r\nmodesty,\" say his Italian biographers, that although the public gaze was\r\nfixed upon him in his lifetime, and although, since his death, the\r\nminutest circumstances relative to him have been subjects of as much\r\ncuriosity and research in Italy, as Shakspeare among us; yet a few\r\nscattered notices are all that can be brought together to illustrate his\r\ncharming lyrics.\r\n\r\nThis mystery was not in Ariosto the effect of chance or affectation; it\r\narose from a principle of conduct faithfully adhered to from youth to\r\nage; in behalf of which, and the many beautiful passages expressive of\r\ndevotion and reverential tenderness towards our sex, scattered through\r\nhis great poem, we will endeavour, (though at some little sacrifice of\r\nthe pride and delicacy of women,) to pardon him, for having treated us\r\nmost wickedly, on sundry other occasions. As an emblem of the reserve he\r\nhad imposed on himself, a little bronze Cupid, with his finger on his\r\nlip, in token of silence, ornamented his inkstand, which is still\r\npreserved at Ferrara.\r\n\r\nOf Ariosto's amatory poems, so full of spirit, grace, and a sort of\r\nearnest triumphant tenderness, it is impossible to doubt that the\r\nobjects were real. The earliest of his serious attachments, was to a\r\nyoung girl of the Florentine family of the Lapi, but residing at Mantua,\r\nor in its vicinity. Her name was Ginevra,--a name he has tenderly\r\ncommemorated in the Orlando Furioso, by giving it to one of his most\r\ncharming and interesting heroines,--Ginevra di Scozia. He has also,\r\nafter Petrarch's fashion, _played_ upon this name in one or two of his\r\nsonnets; _Ginevro_ signifying a juniper-tree:\r\n\r\n    Non voglio (e Febo e Bacco mi perdoni)\r\n    Che lor frondi mi mostrino poeta,\r\n    Ma che un _Ginevro_ sia che mi coroni!\r\n\r\n     \"I wish not, (may Bacchus and Phoebus pardon me!) either\r\n     the laurel or the ivy to crown my brows; let my wreath be\r\n     rather of the thorny juniper!\"\r\n\r\nHis love for Ginevra (which was fondly returned,) began in very early\r\nyouth; their first interview occurred at a _Festa di Ballo_,--a\r\nfete-champetre, where Ginevra excelled all her young companions in the\r\ndance, as much as she surpassed them in her blooming beauty. He alludes\r\nto stolen interviews, in a grove of laurels, and on the banks of the\r\nMincio: and on the whole, confesses that he had no reason to complain of\r\ncruelty from the fair Ginevra.[75] This attachment lasted long; for,\r\nfour years after their first meeting, Ariosto addresses her in a most\r\nimpassioned strain, and vows that she was then \"dearer to him than his\r\nown soul, and fairer than ever in his eyes.\" She seems to have left that\r\npermanent impression on his memory and fancy, that shade of tender\r\nregret with which a man of strong sensibility and ardent imagination\r\nalways recurs to the first love of his youth, even when the passion\r\nitself is past. He says himself, when revisiting Mantua many years\r\nafterwards, that the scene revived all his former tenderness--\r\n\r\n    Quel foco ch' io pensai che fosse estinto,\r\n    Dal tempo, dagli affanni, ed il star lunge\r\n    Signor pur arde.----\r\n\r\nI cannot discover what became of Ginevra ultimately: her fate was a\r\ncommon one: she was loved by a celebrated man, was forsaken, and in\r\nexchange for happiness and for love, she has enjoyed for some time a\r\nshadowy renown. Her name was usually connected with that of Ariosto,\r\ntill the researches of later biographers discovered the object of that\r\nmore celebrated, more serious, and more lasting passion which inspired\r\nAriosto's finest lyrics, which was subsequently sealed by a private\r\nmarriage, and ended only with the poet's life. In this instance, the\r\nmodesty of the lady and the discretion of Ariosto have proved in vain,\r\nfor the name of _Alessandra Strozzi_ is now so inseparably linked with\r\nthat of her poet, that Beatrice is not more identified with Dante, nor\r\nLaura with Petrarch; though their names be more popular, and their fame\r\nmore widely spread.\r\n\r\n    Minor di grido, ma del vanto altera,\r\n    (E cio le basta) che suo saggio amante\r\n    Fu'l grande che canto l'armi e gli amori--\r\n    Vedi Alessandra![76]\r\n\r\nAlessandra Strozzi was the daughter of Filippo Benucci, and the widow of\r\nTito Strozzi, a noble Florentine and famous Latin poet. At the period of\r\nher first acquaintance with Ariosto, she must have been about\r\nsix-and-twenty, and a beautiful woman, on a very magnificent scale.\r\nThough I cannot find that she was distinguished for talents, or any\r\nparticular taste for literature, she seems to have possessed higher and\r\nmore loveable qualities, which won Ariosto's admiration and secured his\r\nrespect to the last.\r\n\r\nIt was on his return from Rome in 1515, that Ariosto visited Florence,\r\nintending merely to witness the grand festival which was then celebrated\r\nin honour of St. John the Baptist, and lasted several days. With what\r\nanimation, what graphic power, he has described in one of his canzoni,\r\nthe scene and occasion in which he first beheld his mistress! The\r\nmagnificence of Florence left, he says, few traces on his memory: he\r\ncould only recollect that in all that fair city, he saw nothing so fair\r\nas herself.\r\n\r\n        Sol mi resta immortale\r\n    Memoria, ch'io non vidi in tutta quella\r\n    Bella citta, di voi, cosa piu bella.\r\n\r\nHe had arrived just in time to be present at a fete, to which both were\r\ninvited, and which Alessandra, notwithstanding her recent widowhood,\r\ncondescended to adorn with her presence, \"da preghi vinta\"--conquered by\r\nthe entreaties of her friends. The whole scene is set forth like some of\r\nthe living and moving pictures which glow before us in the Orlando.\r\n\r\n    Porte, finestre, vie, templi, teatri,\r\n    Vidi pieni di Donne,\r\n    A giochi, a pompe, a sacrifici intenti.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Alessandra in her festal attire, and all her matronly\r\nloveliness, looks forth, as it were, from this gorgeous frame, like one\r\nof Titian's breathing, full-blown beauties. Her dress is minutely\r\ndescribed: it was black, embroidered over with wreaths of vine-leaves\r\nand bunches of grapes, in purple and gold; her fair luxuriant hair,\r\ngathered in a net behind and parted in front, fell down on either side\r\nof her face, in long curls which touched her shoulders.\r\n\r\n    In aurei nodi, il biondo e spesso crine\r\n    In rara e sottil rete, avea raccolto;\r\n      Soave ombra di drieto\r\n    Rendea al collo, e dinanzi alle confine\r\n      Delle guance divine;\r\n    E discendea fin a l' avorio bianco\r\n      Del destro omero, e manco;\r\n    Con queste reti, insidiosi amori\r\n      Preser quel giorno, piu de mille cori!\r\n\r\n    \"In golden braids, her fair\r\n    And richly flowing hair\r\n    Was gather'd in a subtle net behind,--\r\n    (A subtle net and rare!)\r\n    And cast sweet shadows there\r\n    Over her neck, whilst parted ringlets, twined\r\n    In beauty, from her forehead fell away,\r\n    And hung adown her cheek where roses lay,\r\n    Touching the ivory pale, (how pale and white!)\r\n    Of both her rounded shoulders, left and right.\r\n    O crafty Loves! no more ye need your darts;\r\n    For well ye know, how many thousand hearts,\r\n      (Willing captives on that day,)\r\n      In those golden meshes lay!\"[77]\r\n\r\nOn her brow, just where her hair is parted, she wears a sprig of laurel,\r\nwondrously wrought in gems and gold;\r\n\r\n                  Quel gemmato\r\n    Alloro, tra la serena fronte e l' calle assunto.\r\n\r\nAfter a rapturous, but general description of the lady's surpassing\r\nbeauty, this animated and admirable canzone concludes with the fine\r\ncomparison of himself to the wild falcon, tamed at length to a master's\r\nhand and voice:--\r\n\r\n    La libertade apprezza,\r\n    Fin che perduta ancor non l' ha il falcone;\r\n    Preso che sia, depone\r\n    Del gire errando si l' antica voglia,\r\n    Che sempre che si scioglia,\r\n    Al suo Signor a render con veloci\r\n    Ali s' andra, dove udira le voci!\r\n\r\nAriosto, thus enamoured, forgot the flight of time; instead of remaining\r\nat Florence a few days, his stay was prolonged to six months; and as he\r\nresided in the house of his friend Vespucci, who was the brother-in-law\r\nof Alessandra, he had daily opportunities of seeing her, without in any\r\nway compromising her matronly dignity. On a certain occasion he finds\r\nher employed at her embroidery. She is working a robe, with wreaths of\r\nlilies and amaranthes; these emblems of purity and love suggest, of\r\ncourse, the obvious compliments, but in a spirit that places the whole\r\nscene before us: Alessandra, gracefully bending at her embroidery-frame,\r\nand listening, with veiled lids and suspended needle, to the tender\r\nhomage of Ariosto, who repeats, as he hangs over her,--\r\n\r\n    Non senza causa il giglio e l' amaranto,\r\n    L' uno di fede, e l' altro fior d' amore, &c.\r\n\r\nEven the pattern from which she is working, the silk, the gold, the\r\nlawn, made happy by her touch, are sanctified, are envied,--\r\n\r\n    Avventuroso man! beato ingegno!\r\n    Beata seta! beatissimo oro!\r\n    Ben nato lino! inclito bel lavoro,\r\n    Da chi vuol la mia dea prender disegno,\r\n    Per far a vostro esempio un vestir degno,\r\n    Che copra avorio, e perle ed un tesoro![78]\r\n\r\nAnd he adds, \"Ah, that she would rather take pattern after me, and\r\nimitate the constant love I bear her!\"\r\n\r\nAlessandra must have excelled in needle-work, for we find frequent\r\nmention of her favorite occupation; and it is even alluded to in the\r\nOrlando, where describing the wound of Zerbino, Ariosto uses a\r\ncomparison rather too fanciful for the occasion.\r\n\r\n    Cosi talora un bel purpureo nastro\r\n    Ho veduto partir tela d'argento,\r\n    Da quel bianca man piu ch'alabastro\r\n    Da cui partire il cor spesso mi sento.\r\n\r\n    And so, I sometimes have been wont to view\r\n    A hand more white than alabaster, part\r\n    The silver cloth, with ribbons red of hue,\r\n    A hand I often feel divide my heart.[79]\r\n\r\nAmong the personal charms of Alessandra, the most striking was the\r\nbeauty and luxuriance of her hair. In the days of Ariosto, fair hair,\r\nwith a golden tinge, was so much admired that it became a fashion; we\r\nare even informed that the Venetian women had invented a dye, or\r\nextract, by which they discharged the natural colour of their tresses,\r\nand gave them this admired hue. Almost all Titian's and Giorgione's\r\nbeauties have fair hair; the \"richissima capellatura bionda\" of\r\nAlessandra, was a principal charm in the eyes of her lover, but it was\r\none she was destined to lose prematurely; during a dangerous illness,\r\nsome rash and luckless physician ordered all her beautiful tresses to be\r\ncut off. The remedy, it seems, was equally unnecessary and unfortunate;\r\nbut here was a fine theme for an indignant lover! and Ariosto has,\r\naccordingly, lavished on it some of his most graceful and poetical\r\nideas. Of the three elegant sonnets[80] in which he has commemorated the\r\nincident, it is difficult to decide which is the finest--the last,\r\nperhaps, is the most spirited: the poet bursts at once into his subject,\r\nas in a transport of grief and rage.\r\n\r\n\"When I think, as I do, a thousand, thousand times a-day, upon those\r\ngolden tresses, which neither wisdom nor necessity, but hasty folly,\r\ntore, alas! from that fair head, I am enraged,--my cheek burns with\r\nanger,--even tears gush forth, bathing my face and bosom;--I could die\r\nto be revenged on the impious stupidity of that rash hand! O Love, if\r\nsuch wrong goes unpunished, thine be the reproach! Remember how Bacchus\r\navenged on the Thracian King,[81] the clusters torn from his sacred\r\nvines: wilt thou, who art greater far than he, do less? Wilt thou suffer\r\nthe loveliest and dearest of thy possessions to be audaciously ravished,\r\nand yet bear it in silence?\"[82]\r\n\r\nThis is powerful enough to be in downright earnest: and unsoftened by\r\nthe flowing harmony of the verse and rhyme, appears even harsh, both in\r\nsentiment and expression: but the poetry and spirit being inherent, have\r\nnot, I trust, quite escaped in the _transfusion_. When Ariosto, after a\r\nlong absence, revisits the scene in which he first beheld the lady of\r\nhis thoughts, he addresses those \"marble halls, and lofty and stately\r\nroofs,\r\n\r\n    \"Marmoree logge, alti e superbi tetti,\"\r\n\r\nin a strain which leaves the issue of his suit something less than\r\ndoubtful:--\r\n\r\n\"Well do ye remember, ye scenes, when I left ye a captive sick at\r\nheart, and pierced with Love's sweet pain: but ye know not perhaps how\r\nsweetly I died, and was restored again to life: how my gentlest Lady,\r\nseeing that my soul had forsaken me, sent me hers in return to dwell\r\nwith me for ever!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Ben vi sovvien, che di qui andai captivo,\r\n    Trafitto il cor! ma non sapete forse\r\n    Com' io morissi, e poi tornassi in vita.\r\n\r\n    E che madonna, tosto che s' accorse\r\n    Esser l' anima in lei da me fuggita,\r\n    La sua mi diede, e ch' or con questa vivo!\"\r\n\r\nThe exact date of Ariosto's marriage cannot be ascertained, but the\r\nmarriage itself is proved beyond a doubt:[83] it must have taken place\r\nabout 1522. The reasons which induced Ariosto to involve in doubt and\r\nmystery his union with this admirable woman, can only be\r\nconjectured,[84] their intercourse was so carefully concealed, and the\r\ndiscretion and modesty of Alessandra so remarkable, that no suspicion of\r\nthe ties which bound them to each other, existed during the life of the\r\npoet; nor did the slightest imputation ever sully the fair fame of her\r\nhe loved.\r\n\r\nIt were endless to point out the various beauties of Ariosto's\r\nlyrics,--beauties which, as they spring from feeling, are _felt_. We\r\nhave few sonnets in a dolorous strain, few complaints of cruelty; and\r\neven these seem inspired, not by the habitual coldness of Alessandra,\r\nbut by some occasional repulses which he confesses to have deserved.\r\n\r\n    Per poco consiglio, e troppo ardire.\r\n\r\nBut we have, in their place, all the glow of sensibility, the sparkling\r\nof hope, the grateful rapture of returned affection, and that power of\r\nimagery, by which, with one vivid stroke, he turns his emotions into\r\npictures: these predominate throughout. As an instance of the latter,\r\nthere is the apostrophe to Hope, \"now bounding and leaping along, now\r\ncreeping with coward steps and slow:\"\r\n\r\n    O speranza! che ancor dietro si mena\r\n    Quando a gran salti, e quando a passi lenti!\r\n\r\nIn one of his madrigals, he says, with an elegance which is perhaps a\r\nlittle quaint, \"my wishes soar so high, that my hopes shrink back, and\r\ndare not follow them.\" In the same spirit, when he is blest with the\r\npresence of his love, grief is not only banished, but \"flies with the\r\nrapidity of a falcon before the wind,\"\r\n\r\n    Vola, com' un falcone che ha seco il vento!\r\n\r\nMerely to compare his mistress to a rose, would have been common-place.\r\nShe is a rose \"unfolding her _paradise_ of leaves,\"--a charming\r\nexpression, which has been adopted, I think, by one of our living poets.\r\nMingled with the most rapturous praise of Alessandra's triumphant\r\nbeauty, we have constantly the most delightful impression of her\r\ntenderness, her frank and courteous bearing, and the gladness which her\r\npresence diffuses through his heart, which, after the sentimental\r\nlamentations of former poets, are really a relief.\r\n\r\nI can understand the self-congratulation, the secret enjoyment, with\r\nwhich Ariosto dwelt on the praises of Alessandra, celebrated her charms,\r\nand exulted in her love, while her name remained an impenetrable secret,\r\n\r\n    Nor pass'd his lips in holy silence seal'd!\r\n\r\nBut when once he had introduced her into the Orlando, he must have had a\r\nvery modest idea of his own future renown, not to have anticipated the\r\nconsequences. A famous passage in the 42d canto, is now universally\r\nadmitted to be a description of Alessandra.[85] She is very strikingly\r\nintroduced, and yet with the usual characteristic mystery; so that while\r\nnothing is omitted that can excite interest and curiosity, every means\r\nare taken to baffle and disappoint both. Rinaldo, while travelling in\r\nItaly, arrives at a splendid palace on the banks of the Po. It is\r\nminutely described, with all the prodigal magnificence of the Arabian\r\nNights', and all the taste of an architect; and among other riches, is\r\nadorned with the statues of the most celebrated women of that age, all\r\nof whom are named at length; but among them stands the effigy of one so\r\npreeminent in majesty, and beauty, and intellect, that though she is\r\npartly veiled, and habited in modest black, (alluding to her recent\r\nwidowhood,) though she wears neither jewels nor chains of gold, she\r\neclipses all the beauties around her, as the evening star outshines all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n    Che sotto puro velo, in nera gonna\r\n    Senza oro e gemme, in un vestire schietto,\r\n    Fra le piu adorne non parea men bella\r\n    Che sia tra l'altre la ciprigna stella![86]\r\n\r\nAt her side stands the image of one, who in humble strains had dared to\r\ncelebrate her virtues and her beauty (meaning himself). \"But,\" adds the\r\npoet modestly, \"I know not why he alone should be placed there, nor what\r\nhe had done to be so honoured; of all the rest, the names were\r\nsculptured beneath; but of these two, the names remained unknown.\"--No,\r\nnot so! for those whom Love and Fame have joined together, who shall\r\nhenceforth sunder?\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Furioso was completed and published shortly after Ariosto's\r\nvisit to Florence; and this passage must have been written apparently\r\nnot only before his marriage with Alessandra, but before he was even\r\nsecure of her affection; perhaps he read it aloud to her, and while his\r\nstolen looks and faltering voice betrayed the true object of this most\r\nbeautiful and refined homage, she must have felt the delicacy which had\r\nsuppressed her name. In such a moment, how little could she have heeded\r\nor thought of the voice of future fame, while the accents of her lover\r\nthrilled through her heart!\r\n\r\nAlessandra removed from Florence to Ferrara, about 1519, and inhabited\r\nthe Casa Strozzi, in the street of Santa Maria in Vado. The residence\r\nof Ariosto was in the Via Mirasole, at some distance. Both houses are\r\nstill standing. She died in 1552, having survived the poet about\r\nnineteen years; and she was buried in the church of San Rocco at\r\nFerrara.\r\n\r\nShe bore no children to Ariosto; and her son, by her first marriage\r\n(Count Guido Strozzi), died before her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAriosto left two sons, whom he tenderly loved, and had educated with\r\nextreme care. The eldest, Virginio, was the son of a beautiful\r\nContadinella, whose name was Orsolina; the mother of the youngest,\r\nGiovanbattista, was also a girl of inferior rank; her name was Maria.\r\nNeither are once mentioned or alluded to by Ariosto; but the mischievous\r\nindustry of the poet's commentators has immortalized their names and\r\ntheir frailty.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75]\r\n    ----Non ebbe unqua pastore\r\n    Di me piu lieto, o piu felice amore!\r\n\r\nSee the canzone to Ginevra, quoted by Baruffaldi.

We\r\nare told that the letters which form this word being \"well ordered,\"\r\n(that is, _transposed_) comprehend her real name; but it has hitherto\r\nescaped the penetration of his biographers. Two of his friends were\r\nentrusted with the secret, and they, with a discretion more to be\r\nregretted than blamed, have kept it. One of these, who speaks from\r\npersonal knowledge, tells us, in a note on the Eclogues, that she was\r\nthe daughter of a widow; that she was a gentlewoman, and one \"that for\r\nher rare and singular gifts of person and mind, Spenser need not have\r\nbeen ashamed to love.\" We can believe this of a poet, whose delicate\r\nperception of female worth breathes in almost every page of his works;\r\nbut after having, as he hoped, made some progress in her heart, a rival\r\nstept in, whom Spenser accuses expressly of having supplanted him by\r\ntreacherous arts;[87] and on this obscure and nameless wight, Rosalind\r\nbestowed the hand which had been coveted,--the charms which had been\r\nsung by Spenser! He suffered long and deeply, wounded both in his pride\r\nand in his love: but her beauty and virtue had made a stronger\r\nimpression than her cruelty; and her lover, with a generous tenderness,\r\nnot only pardoned, but found excuses for her disdain.\r\n\r\n                      \"I have often heard,\r\n    Fair Rosalind of divers foully blam'd,\r\n      For being to that swain too cruel hard;\r\n    But who can tell what cause had that fair maid\r\n      To use him so, that loved her so well?\r\n    Or who with blame can justly her upbraid,\r\n      For loving not; for who can love compel?\r\n    And (sooth to say) it is full handy thing\r\n      Rashly to censure creatures so divine;\r\n    For demi-gods they be; and first did spring\r\n      From heaven, though graft in frailness feminine.\"[88]\r\n\r\nThe exquisite sentiment of these lines is worthy of him who sung of\r\n\"heavenly Una and her milk-white lamb.\"\r\n\r\nTo the memory of Rosalind,--to the long felt influence of this first\r\npassion, and to the melancholy shade which his early disappointment cast\r\nover a mind naturally cheerful, we owe some of the most tender and\r\nbeautiful passages scattered through his later poems:--for instance--the\r\nbitter sense of recollected suffering, seems to have suggested that fine\r\ndescription of a lover's life, which may almost rank as a _pendant_ to\r\nthe miseries of the courtier, so well known and often quoted.\r\n\r\n    Full little know'st thou that hast not tied, &c.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in the \"Hymn to Love.\"\r\n\r\n    The gnawing envy, the heart-fretting fear,\r\n    The vain surmises, the distrustful shows,\r\n    The false reports that flying tales do bear,\r\n    The doubts, the dangers, the delays, the woes,\r\n    The feigned friends, the unassured foes,\r\n    With thousands more than any tongue can tell--\r\n    Do make a lover's life, a wretch's hell!\r\n\r\nAnd again in the Fairey Queen:--\r\n\r\n    What equal torment to the grief of mind.\r\n      And pining anguish, hid in gentle heart,\r\n    That inly foods itself with thoughts unkind,\r\n    And nourisheth its own consuming smart;\r\n    And will to none its malady impart!\r\n\r\nThe effects produced in a noble and gentle spirit, by virtuous love for\r\nan exalted object, are not less elegantly described in another stanza of\r\nthe Hymn to Love; and must have been read with rapture in that\r\nchivalrous age. The last line is particularly beautiful.\r\n\r\n    Then forth he casts in his unquiet thought,\r\n    What he may do, her favour to obtain;\r\n    What brave exploit, what peril hardly wrought,\r\n    What puissant conquest, what adventurous pain,\r\n    May please her best, and grace unto him gain;\r\n    He dreads no danger, nor misfortune fears,--\r\n    His faith, his fortune, in his breast he bears!\r\n\r\nAnd in what a fine spirit of poetry, as well as feeling, is that\r\ndescription of the power of true beauty, which forms part of his second\r\nHymn! It is indeed imitated from the refined Platonics of the Italian\r\nschool, which then prevailed in the court, the camp, the grove, and is a\r\nlittle diffuse in style, a little redundant; but how rich in poetry, and\r\nin the most luxuriant and graceful imagery!\r\n\r\n    How vainly then do idle wits invent,\r\n    That beauty is nought else but mixture made\r\n    Of colours fair, and goodly temperament\r\n    Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade\r\n    And pass away, like to a summer's shade;\r\n    Or that it is but comely composition\r\n    Of parts well measured, with meet disposition!\r\n\r\n    Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,\r\n    That it can pierce through th' eyes into the heart,\r\n    And therein stir such rage and restless stowre,\r\n    As nought but death can stint his dolor's smart?\r\n    Or can proportion of the outward part\r\n    Move such affection in the inward mind,\r\n    That it can rob both sense, and reason blind?\r\n\r\n    Why do not then the blossoms of the field,\r\n    Which are array'd with much more orient hue,\r\n    And to the sense most dainty odours yield,\r\n    Work like impression in the looker's view?\r\n    Or why do not fair pictures like power show,\r\n    In which oft-times we Nature see of Art\r\n    Excell'd, in perfect limming every part?\r\n\r\n    But ah! believe me, there is more than so,\r\n    That works such wonders in the minds of men,\r\n    I, that have often prov'd, too well it know.\r\n    And who so list the like essaies to ken,\r\n    Shall find by trial, and confess it then,\r\n    That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,\r\n    An outward show of things that only seem.\r\n\r\n    For that same goodly hue of white and red,\r\n    With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,\r\n    And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread\r\n    Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away,\r\n    To that they were, even to corrupted clay:--\r\n    That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright\r\n    Shall turn to dust, and lose their goodly light.\r\n\r\n    But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray\r\n    That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,\r\n    Shall never be extinguished nor decay;\r\n    But, when the vital spirits do expire,\r\n    Unto her native planet shall retire;\r\n    For it is heavenly born and cannot die,\r\n    Being a parcel of the purest sky!\r\n\r\nAt a late period of Spenser's life, the remembrance of this cruel piece\r\nof excellence,--his Rosalind, was effaced by a second and a happier\r\nlove. His sonnets are addressed to a beautiful Irish girl, the daughter\r\nof a rich merchant of Cork. She it was who healed the wound inflicted by\r\ndisdain and levity, and taught him the truth he has expressed in one\r\ncharming line--\r\n\r\n    Sweet is that love alone, that comes with willingnesse!\r\n\r\nHer name was Elizabeth, and her family (as Spenser tells us himself,)\r\nobscure; but, in spite of her plebeian origin, the lady seems to have\r\nbeen a very peremptory and Juno-like beauty. Spenser continually dwells\r\nupon her pride of sex, and has placed it before us in many charming\r\nturns of thought, now deprecating it as a fault, but oftener celebrating\r\nit as a virtue. For instance,--\r\n\r\n    Rudely thou wrongest my dear heart's desire,\r\n    In finding fault with her too portly pride:\r\n    The thing which I do most in her admire,\r\n    Is of the world unworthy most envied;\r\n    For in those lofty looks is close implied,\r\n    Scorn of base things, disdain of foul dishonour;\r\n    Threatening rash eyes which gaze on her so wide,\r\n    That loosely they ne dare to look upon her.\r\n    Such pride is praise; such portliness is honour.[89]\r\n\r\nAnd again, in the thirteenth sonnet,--\r\n\r\n    In that proud port, which her so goodly graceth,\r\n    Whiles her fair face she rears up to the sky,\r\n    And to the ground, her eyelids low embaseth,\r\n    Most goodly temperature ye may descry;\r\n    Mild humblesse, mixt with awful majesty!\r\n\r\nThis picture of the deportment erect with conscious dignity, and the\r\neyelids veiled with feminine modesty, is very beautiful. We have the\r\nfigure of his Elizabeth before us in all her maidenly dignity and proud\r\nhumility. The next is a softened repetition of the same characteristic\r\nportrait:\r\n\r\n    Was it the work of Nature or of Art,\r\n    Which temper'd so the features of her face,\r\n    That pride and meekness, mixt by equal part,\r\n    Do both appear to adorn her beauty's grace![90]\r\n\r\nHe rebukes her with a charming mixture of reproof and flattery, in the\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n    Fair Proud! now tell me, why should fair be proud? &c.\r\n\r\nThis imperious and high-souled beauty at length gives some sign of\r\nrelenting; and pursuing the train of thought and feeling through the\r\nlatter part of the collection, we can trace the vicissitudes of the\r\nlady's temper, and how the lover sped in his wooing. First, she grants a\r\nsmile, and it is hailed with rapture--\r\n\r\n    Sweet smile! the daughter of the Queen of Love,\r\n    Expressing all thy mother's powerful art,\r\n    With which she wont to temper angry Jove,\r\n    When all the gods he threats with thundering dart:\r\n    Sweet is thy virtue, as thyself sweet art!\r\n    For, when on me thou shinedst late in sadness,\r\n    A melting pleasance ran through every part,\r\n    And me revived with heart-robbing gladness![91]\r\n\r\nThe effect of a first relenting and affectionate smile, from a being of\r\nthis character, must, in truth, have been irresistible. He tells us how\r\nlovely she appeared in his eyes,--how surpassing fair:\r\n\r\n    When that the cloud of pride which oft doth dark\r\n    Her goodly light, with smiles she drives away!\r\n\r\nHe finds her one day embroidering in silk a bee and a spider,\r\n\r\n                        Woven all about,\r\n    With woodbynd flowers and fragrant eglantine,\r\n\r\nand he playfully compares himself to a spider, and her to the bee, whom,\r\nafter long and weary watching, he has at length caught in his snare.\r\nThis pretty incident is the subject of the 71st Sonnet. The rapture of\r\ngrateful affection is more eloquent in the Sonnet beginning\r\n\r\n    Joy of my life! full oft for loving you\r\n    I bless my lot, that was so lucky placed, &c.\r\n\r\nWhen he is allowed to hope, the pride which had before checked and\r\nchilled him, seems to change its character. He feels all the exultation\r\nof being beloved of one, not easily gained, and \"assured unto herself.\"\r\n\r\n    Thrice happy she that is so well assured\r\n    Unto herself, and settled so in heart, &c.[92]\r\n\r\nAfter a courtship of about three years, he sues for the possession of\r\nthe fair hand to which he had so long aspired; promising her (and not\r\nvainly,) all the immortality his verse could bestow,--\r\n\r\n    Even this verse, vowed to eternity,\r\n    Shall be of her immortal monument,\r\n    And tell her praise to all posterity!\r\n\r\nThe fair Elizabeth at length confesses herself won; but expresses some\r\nfears at the idea of relinquishing her maiden freedom. His reply is,\r\nperhaps, the most beautiful of all the Sonnets. It has all the\r\ntenderness, elegance, and fancy, which distinguish Spenser in his\r\nhappiest moments of inspiration.\r\n\r\n    The doubt which ye misdeem, fair love, is vain,\r\n      That fondly fear to lose your liberty;\r\n    When, losing one, two liberties ye gain,\r\n      And make him bound that bondage erst did fly.\r\n    Sweet be the bands, the which true love doth tye\r\n      Without constraint, or dread of any ill:\r\n    The gentle bird feels no captivity\r\n      Within her cage; but sings, and feeds her fill:\r\n    There pride dare not approach, nor discord spill\r\n      The league 'twixt them, that loyal love hath bound:\r\n    But simple Truth, and mutual Good-will,\r\n      Seeks, with sweet peace, to salve each other's wound:\r\n    There Faith doth fearless dwell is brazen tower,\r\n    And spotless Pleasure builds her sacred bower.[93]\r\n\r\nThe _Amoretti_, as Spenser has fancifully entitled his Sonnets, are\r\ncertainly tinctured with a good deal of the verbiage and pedantry of the\r\ntimes; but I think I have shown that they contain passages of earnest\r\nfeeling, as well as high poetic beauty. Spenser married his Elizabeth,\r\nabout the year 1593, and he has crowned his amatory effusions with a\r\nmost impassioned and triumphant epithalamion on his own nuptials, which\r\nhe concludes with a prophecy, that it shall stand a perpetual monument\r\nof his happiness, and thus it has been. The passage in which he\r\ndescribes his youthful bride, is perhaps one of the most beautiful and\r\nvivid _pictures_ in the whole compass of English poetry.\r\n\r\n    Behold, while she before the altar stands,\r\n    Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks,\r\n    And blesses her with his two happy hands.\r\n    How the red roses flush up in her cheeks.\r\n    And the pure snow, with goodly vermeil stain,\r\n    Like crimson died in grain!\r\n    That even the angels, which continually\r\n    About the sacred altar do remain,\r\n    Forget their service, and about her fly,\r\n    Oft peeping in her face, which seems more fair,\r\n    The more they on it stare.\r\n    But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,\r\n    Are governed with a goodly modesty\r\n    That suffers not a look to glance away,\r\n    Which may let in a little thought unsound.\r\n    Why blush ye, love! to give to me your hand\r\n    The pledge of all our band!\r\n      Sing! ye sweet angels! Hallelujah sing!\r\n    That all the woods may answer, and their echoes ring!\r\n\r\nAnd the rapturous apostrophe to the evening star is in a fine strain of\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n    Late, though it be, at last I see it gloom,\r\n    And the bright evening star, with golden crest,\r\n    Appear out of the west!\r\n    Fair child of beauty! glorious lamp of love!\r\n    That all the host of heaven in ranks dost lead,\r\n    And guidest lovers through the night's sad dread,\r\n    How cheerfully thou lookest from above,\r\n    And seem'st lo laugh atween thy twinkling light!\r\n\r\nAs Ariosto has contrived to introduce his personal feelings, and the\r\nmemory of his love, into the Orlando Furioso, so Spenser has enshrined\r\n_his_ in the Fairy Queen; but he has not, I think, succeeded so well in\r\nthe _manner_ of celebrating the woman he delighted to honour. Ariosto\r\nhas the advantage over the English poet, in delicacy and propriety of\r\nfeeling as well as power. Spenser's picture of the swelling eminence,\r\nthe lawn, the clustering trees, the cascade--\r\n\r\n    Whose silver waves did softly tumble down,\r\n\r\nhaunted by nymphs and fairies; the bevy of beauties who dance in a\r\ncircle round the lady of his love, while he himself, in his character of\r\nColin Clout, sits aloof piping on his oaten reed, remind us of one of\r\nClaude's landscapes: and the difference between the pastoral luxuriance\r\nof this diffuse description, and the stately magnificence of Ariosto's,\r\nis very characteristic of the two poets. Were I to choose, however, I\r\nwould rather have been the object of Ariosto's compliment than of\r\nSpenser's. The passage in the Fairy Queen occurs in the 10th canto of\r\nthe Legend of Sir Calidore; and all his commentators are agreed that the\r\nallusion is to his Elizabeth, and not to Rosalind.\r\n\r\nBoth are mentioned in \"Colin Clout's come home again.\" Rosalind, and her\r\ndisdainful rejection of the poet's love, are alluded to near the end, in\r\nsome lines already quoted; but a very beautiful passage, near the\r\ncommencement of the poem, clearly alludes to Elizabeth, under whose\r\nthrall he was at the time it was written.\r\n\r\n    Ah! far be it, (quoth Colin Clout,) fro me,\r\n    That I, of gentle maids, should ill deserve,\r\n    For that myself I do profess to be\r\n    Vassal to one, whom all my days I serve;\r\n    The beam of Beauty, sparkled from above,\r\n    The flower of virtue and pure chastitie;\r\n    The blossom of sweet joy and perfect love;\r\n    The pearl of peerless grace and modesty!\r\n    To her, my thoughts I daily dedicate;\r\n    To her, my heart I nightly martyrise;\r\n    To her, my love I lowly do prostrate;\r\n    To her, my life I wholly sacrifice:\r\n    My thought, my heart, my life, my love, is she! &c.\r\n\r\nSpenser married his Elizabeth about the year 1593. He resided at this\r\ntime at the Castle of Kilcolman, in the south of Ireland, a portion of\r\nthe forfeited domains of the Earl of Desmond having been assigned to\r\nhim: but the adherents of that unhappy chief saw in Spenser only an\r\ninvader of their rights,--a stranger living on their inheritance, while\r\nthey were cast out to starvation or banishment. He and his family dwelt\r\nin continual fears and disturbance from the distracted state of the\r\ncountry; and at length, about two years after his marriage, he was\r\nattacked in his castle by the native Irish. He and his wife escaped with\r\ndifficulty, and one of their children perished in the flames. After this\r\ncatastrophe they came to England, and Spenser died in 1598, about five\r\nyears after his marriage with Elizabeth. The short period of their\r\nunion, though disturbed by misfortunes, losses, and worldly cares, was\r\nnever clouded by domestic disquiet. This haughty beauty,\r\n\r\n    Whose lofty countenance seemed to scorn\r\n    Base thing, and think how she to heaven might climb,\r\n\r\nbecame the tenderest and most faithful of wives. How long she survived\r\nher husband is not known; but though scarce past the bloom of youth at\r\nthe period of her loss, we have no account of her marrying again.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] Eclogue 6.\r\n\r\n[88] Colin Clout.\r\n\r\n[89] Sonnet 5.\r\n\r\n[90] Sonnet 21.\r\n\r\n[91] Sonnet 39.\r\n\r\n[92] Sonnet 39.\r\n\r\n[93] Sonnet 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nON THE LOVE OF SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nShakspeare--I approach the subject with reverence, and even with\r\nfear,--is the only poet I am acquainted with and able to appreciate, who\r\nappears to have been really heaven-inspired: the workings of his\r\nwondrous and all-embracing mind were directed by a higher influence than\r\never was exercised by woman, even in the plenitude of her power and her\r\ncharms. Shakspeare's genius waited not on Love and Beauty, but Love and\r\nBeauty ministered to _him_; he perceived like a spirit; he was created,\r\nto create; his own individuality is lost in the splendour, the reality,\r\nand the variety of his own conceptions. When I think what those are, I\r\nfeel how needless, how vain it were to swell the universal voice with\r\none so weak as mine. Who would care for it that knows and feels\r\nShakspeare? Who would listen to it that does not, if there be such?\r\n\r\nIt is not Shakspeare as a great power bearing a great name,--but\r\nShakspeare in his less divine and less known character,--as a lover and\r\na man, who finds a place here. The only writings he has left, through\r\nwhich we can trace any thing of his personal feelings and affections,\r\nare his Sonnets. Every one who reads them, who has tenderness or taste,\r\nwill echo Wordsworth's denunciation against the \"flippant insensibility\"\r\nof some of his commentators, who talked of an Act of Parliament not\r\nbeing strong enough to compel their perusal, and will agree in his\r\nopinion, that they are full of the most exquisite feelings, most\r\nfelicitously expressed; but as to the object to whom they were\r\naddressed, a difference of opinion prevails. From a reference, however,\r\nto all that is known of Shakspeare's life and fortunes, compared with\r\nthe internal presumptive evidence contained in the Sonnets, it appears\r\nthat some of them are addressed to his amiable friend, Lord Southampton;\r\nand others, I think, are addressed in Southampton's name, to that\r\nbeautiful Elizabeth Vernon, to whom the Earl was so long and ardently\r\nattached.[94] The Queen, who did not encourage matrimony among her\r\ncourtiers, absolutely refused her consent to their union. She treated\r\nhim as she did Raleigh in the affair of Elizabeth Throckmorton; and\r\nSouthampton, after four years of impatient submission and still\r\nincreasing love, as tenderly returned by his mistress, married without\r\nthe Queen's knowledge, lost her favour for ever, and had nearly lost his\r\nhead.[95]\r\n\r\nThat Lord Southampton is the subject of the first fifty-five Sonnets is\r\nsufficiently clear; and some of these are perfectly beautiful,--as the\r\n30th, 32d, 41st, 54th. There are others scattered through the rest of\r\nthe volume, on the same subject; but there are many which admit of no\r\nsuch interpretation, and are without doubt inspired by the real object\r\nof a real passion, of whom nothing can be discovered, but that she was\r\ndark-eyed[96] and dark-haired,[96] that she excelled in music;[97] and\r\nthat she was one of a class of females who do not always, in losing all\r\nright to our respect, lose also their claim to the admiration of the sex\r\nwho wronged them, or the compassion of the gentler part of their own,\r\nwho have rejected them. This is so clear from various passages, that\r\nunhappily there can be no doubt of it.[98] He has flung over her,\r\ndesignedly it should seem, a veil of immortal texture and fadeless hues,\r\n\"branched and embroidered like the painted Spring,\" but almost\r\nimpenetrable even to our imagination. There are few allusions to her\r\npersonal beauty, which can in any way individualise her, but bursts of\r\ndeep and passionate feeling, and eloquent reproach, and contending\r\nemotions, which show, that if she could awaken as much love and impart\r\nas much happiness as woman ever inspired or bestowed, he endured on her\r\naccount all the pangs of agony, and shame, and jealousy;--that our\r\nShakspeare,--he who, in the omnipotence of genius, wielded the two\r\nworlds of reality and imagination in either hand, who was in conception\r\nand in act scarce less than a GOD, was in passion and suffering not more\r\nthan MAN.\r\n\r\nInstead of any elaborate description of her person, we have, in the only\r\nsonnet which sets forth her charms, the rich materials of a picture,\r\nrather than the picture itself.\r\n\r\n      The forward violet thus did I chide:\r\n    Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\r\n      If not from my Love's breath? The purple pride\r\n    Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells,\r\n      In my Love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.\r\n    The lily I condemned for thy hand,\r\n      And buds of marjoram had stolen thy hair:\r\n    The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\r\n      One blushing shame, another white despair:\r\n    A third, nor red nor white, had stolen of both,\r\n      And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;\r\n    But for his theft, in pride of all his growth\r\n      A vengeful canker eat him up to death.\r\n    More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,\r\n    But sweet, or colour, it had stolen from thee.\r\n\r\nHe intimates that he found a rival in one of his own most intimate\r\nfriends, who was also a poet.[99] He laments her absence in this\r\nexquisite strain;--\r\n\r\n    How like a winter hath my absence been\r\n    From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\r\n    What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,\r\n    What old December's bareness everywhere!\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    For Summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\r\n    And thou away, the very birds are mute!\r\n\r\nHe dwells with complacency on her supposed truth and tenderness, her\r\nbounty, like Juliet's, \"boundless as the sea, her love as deep.\"\r\n\r\n    Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\r\n    Still constant in a wondrous excellence.\r\n\r\nThen, as if conscious upon how unstable a foundation he had built his\r\nlove, he expresses his fear lest he should be betrayed, yet remain\r\nunconscious of the wrong.\r\n\r\n    For there can live no hatred in thine eye,\r\n      Therefore in that I cannot know thy change!\r\n    In many looks, the false heart's history\r\n      Is writ in moods and frowns, and wrinkles strange.\r\n    But heaven in thy creation did decree,\r\n      That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell.\r\n\r\nHe bitterly reproaches her with her levity and falsehood, and himself\r\nthat he can be thus unworthily enslaved,--\r\n\r\n    What potions have I drunk of Syren tears, &c.\r\n\r\nThen, with lover-like inconsistency, excuses her,--\r\n\r\n    As on the finger of a throned queen\r\n      The basest jewel will be well esteemed:\r\n    So are those errors that in thee are seen\r\n      To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.\r\n\r\nAnd the following are powerfully and painfully expressive:--\r\n\r\n    How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,\r\n      Which, like the canker in a fragrant rose,\r\n    Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\r\n      Oh, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!\r\n\r\n    And what a mansion have those vices got,\r\n      Which for their habitation chose out thee,\r\n    Where Beauty's veil doth cover every blot,\r\n      And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!\r\n\r\n\"Who taught thee,\" he says in another sonnet,\r\n\r\n      --to make me love thee more\r\n    The more I hear, and see just cause for hate?\r\n\r\nHe who wrote these and similar passages was certainly under the full and\r\nirresistible influence of female fascination. But who it was that thus\r\nruled the universal heart and mighty spirit of our Shakspeare, we know\r\nnot. She stands beside him a veiled and a nameless phantom. Neither dare\r\nwe call in Fancy to penetrate that veil; for who would presume to trace\r\neven the faintest outline of such a being as Shakspeare could have\r\nloved?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI think it doubtful to whom were addressed those exquisite lines,\r\n\r\n    Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now! &c.[100]\r\n\r\nbut probably to this very person.\r\n\r\nThe Sonnets in which he alludes to his profession as an actor; where he\r\nspeaks of the brand, \"which vulgar scandal stamped upon his brow,\" and\r\nof having made himself \"a motley to men's view,\"[101] are undoubtedly\r\naddressed to Lord Southampton.\r\n\r\n    O, for my sake, do you with fortune chide\r\n      The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\r\n    That did not better for my life provide,\r\n      Than publick means, which public manners breeds;\r\n    Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,\r\n      And almost thence my nature is subdu'd\r\n    To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.\r\n      Pity me then, and wish I were renew'd.\r\n\r\nThe last I shall remark, perhaps the finest of all, and breathing the\r\nvery soul of profound tenderness and melancholy feeling, must, I think,\r\nhave been addressed to a female.\r\n\r\n    No longer mourn for me when I am dead,\r\n      Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell\r\n    Give warning to the world that I am fled\r\n      From this vile earth, with vilest worms to dwell:\r\n    Nay, if you read this line, remember not\r\n      The hand that writ it; for I love you so\r\n    That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\r\n      If thinking on me then should make you woe.\r\n    O if (I say) you look upon this verse,\r\n      When I perhaps compounded am with clay,\r\n    Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;\r\n      But let your love even with my life decay:\r\n    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,\r\n      And mock you with me after I am gone.\r\n\r\nThe period assigned to the composition of these Sonnets, and the\r\nattachment which inspired them, is the time when Shakspeare was living a\r\nwild and irregular life, between the court and the theatre, after his\r\nflight from Stratford. He had previously married, at the age of\r\nseventeen, Judith Hathaway, who was eight or ten years older than\r\nhimself: he returned to his native town, after having sounded all depths\r\nof life, of nature, of passion, and ended his days as the respected\r\nfather of a family, in calm, unostentatious privacy.\r\n\r\nOne thing I will confess:--It is natural to feel an intense and\r\ninsatiable curiosity relative to great men, a curiosity and interest for\r\nwhich nothing can be too minute, too personal.--And yet when I had\r\nransacked all that had ever been written, discovered, or surmised,\r\nrelative to Shakspeare's private life, for the purpose of throwing some\r\nlight upon his Sonnets, I felt no gratification, no thankfulness to\r\nthose whose industry had raked up the very few particulars which can be\r\nknown. It is too much, and it is not enough: it disappoints us in one\r\npoint of view--it is superfluous in another: what need to surround with\r\ncommon-place, trivial associations, registers of wills and genealogies,\r\nand I know not what,--the mighty spirit who in dying left behind him not\r\nmerely a name and fame, but a perpetual being, a presence and a power,\r\nidentified with our nature, diffused through all time, and ruling the\r\nheart and the fancy with an uncontrollable and universal sway!\r\n\r\nI rejoice that the name of no one woman is popularly identified with\r\nthat of Shakspeare. He belongs to us all!--the creator of Desdemona, and\r\nJuliet, and Ophelia, and Imogen, and Viola, and Constance, and Cornelia,\r\nand Rosalind, and Portia, was not the poet of one woman, but the POET OF\r\nWOMANKIND.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[94] She was the grandmother of Lady Russell.\r\n\r\n[95] Elizabeth Vernon was first cousin to Essex. \"Was it treason?\" asks\r\nEssex indignantly, in one of his eloquent letters; \"Was it treason in my\r\nLord of Southampton to marry my poor kinswoman, that neither long\r\nimprisonment, nor any punishment besides that hath been usual in such\r\ncases can satisfy or appease?\"\r\n\r\n[96] Sonnets 127, 130\r\n\r\n[97] Sonnet 128.\r\n\r\n[98] See \"Douce's Illustrations of Shakspeare.\"\r\n\r\n[99] Sonnets 80, 83.\r\n\r\n[100] Sonnet 172.\r\n\r\n[101] Sonnets 110, 111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSYDNEY'S STELLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the very name of Sir Philip Sydney,--the generous, gallant,\r\nall-accomplished Sydney,--the roused fancy wakes, as at the sound of a\r\nsilver trumpet, to all the gay and splendid associations of chivalry and\r\nromance. He was in the court of Elizabeth, what Surrey had been in that\r\nof her father, Henry the Eighth; and like his prototype. Sir Calidore in\r\nthe Fairy Queen,--\r\n\r\n    Every look and word that he did say\r\n    Was like enchantment, that through both the ears\r\n    And both the eyes, did steal the heart away.\r\n\r\nAnd as Surrey had his Fair Geraldine, Sydney had his STELLA.\r\n\r\nSimplicity was not the fashion of Elizabeth's age in any particular: the\r\nconversation and the poetry addressed by her stately romantic courtiers\r\nto her and her maids of honour, were like the dresses they wore,--stiff\r\nwith jewels and standing on end with embroidery, gorgeous of hue and\r\nfantastic in form; but with many a brilliant gem of exceeding price,\r\nscattered up and down, where one would scarce think to find them; losing\r\nsomething of their effect by being misplaced, but none of their inherent\r\nbeauty and value. The poetry of Sir Philip Sydney was extravagantly\r\nadmired in his own time, and it has since been less read than it\r\ndeserves. It contains much of the pedantic quaintness, the laboured\r\nornament, the cumbrous phraseology, which was the taste, the language of\r\nthe day: but he had elegance of mind and tenderness of feeling; above\r\nall, he was in earnest, and accordingly, there are beautiful and\r\nbrilliant things scattered through both his poetry and prose. If his\r\n\"Phoenix-Stella\" be less popularly celebrated than the Fair\r\nGeraldine,--her name less intimate with our fancy,--it is not because\r\nher poet lacked skill to immortalize her in superlatives: it is the\r\nrecollection of the mournful fate and darkened fame of that beautiful\r\nbut ill-starred woman, contrasted with the brilliant career and spotless\r\nglory of her lover, which strikes the imagination with a painful\r\ncontrast, and makes us reluctant to dwell on her memory.\r\n\r\nThe Stella of Sydney's poetry, and the Philoclea of his Arcadia, was the\r\nLady Penelope Devereux, the elder sister of the favourite Essex. While\r\nyet in her childhood, she was the destined bride of Sydney, and for\r\nseveral years they were considered as almost engaged to each other: it\r\nwas natural, therefore, at this time, that he should be accustomed to\r\nregard her with tenderness and unreproved admiration, and should gratify\r\nboth by making her the object of his poetical raptures. She was also\r\nless openly, but even more ardently, loved by young Charles Blount,\r\nafterwards Lord Mountjoy, who seems to have disputed with Sydney the\r\nfirst place in her heart.\r\n\r\nShe is described as a woman of exquisite beauty, on a grand and splendid\r\nscale; dark sparkling eyes; pale brown hair; a rich vivid complexion; a\r\nregal brow and a noble figure. Sydney tells us that she was at first\r\n\"most fair, most cold;\"--and the beautiful sonnet,\r\n\r\n    \"With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb'st the sky![102]\r\n    How silently, and with how wan a face!\"\r\n\r\nrefers to his earlier feelings. He describes a tilting-match, held in\r\npresence of the Queen and Court, in which he came off victor--\r\n\r\n    Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance,\r\n    Guided so well, that I obtained the prize, &c.[103]\r\n\r\n\"Stella looked on,\" he says, \"and from her fair eyes sent forth the\r\nencouraging glance that gave him victory.\" These soft and brilliant eyes\r\nare often and beautifully touched upon; and it must be remarked, never\r\nwithout an allusion to the _modesty_ of their expression.\r\n\r\n    O eyes! that do the spheres of beauty move,\r\n    Which while they make Love conquer, conquer Love.\r\n\r\nAnd on some occasion, when she turned from him bashfully, he addresses\r\nher in a most impassioned strain,--\r\n\r\n    Soul's joy! bend not those morning stars from me,\r\n    Where virtue is made strong by beauty's might,\r\n    Where love is chasteness--pain doth learn delight\r\n    And humbleness doth dwell with majesty:\r\n    Whatever may ensue, O let me be\r\n    Copartner of the riches of that sight;\r\n    Let not mine eyes be hell-driven from that light.\r\n    O look! O shine! O let me die, and see![104]\r\n\r\nAnother, \"To Sleep,\" is among the most beautiful, and I believe more\r\ngenerally known.\r\n\r\n    Lock up, fair lids! the treasure of my heart! &c.\r\n\r\nThere is also much vivacity and earnest feeling in the lines addressed\r\nto one who had lately left the presence of Stella, and of whom he\r\ninquires of her welfare. Whoever has known what it is to be separated\r\nfrom those beloved, to ask after them with anxious yet suppressed\r\nfondness, of some unsympathising acquaintance, to be alternately\r\ntantalised and _desespere_, by their vague and careless replies, will\r\nunderstand, will feel their truth and beauty. Even the quaint, petulant\r\ncommencement is true to the sentiment:\r\n\r\n    Be your words made, good Sir, of Indian ware,\r\n    That you allow me them at so small rate?\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    When I demand of Phoenix-Stella's state,\r\n    You say, forsooth, \"You left her well of late.\"\r\n    O God! think you that satisfies _my_ care?\r\n    I would know whether she do sit or walk,--\r\n    How clothed, how waited on? sighed she, or smiled?\r\n    Whereof--with whom--how often did she talk?\r\n    With what pastime, time's journey she beguiled?\r\n    If her lips deign'd to sweeten my poor name?\r\n    Say all! and all well said, still say the same!\r\n\r\nAt length, after the usual train of hopes, fears, complaints, and\r\nraptures, the lady begins to look with pity and favour on the \"ruins of\r\nher conquest;\"[105] and he exults in an acknowledged return of love,\r\nthough her heart be given conditionally,--\r\n\r\n    His only, while he virtuous courses takes.\r\n\r\nSo far Stella appears in a most amiable and captivating light, worthy\r\nthe romantic homage of her accomplished lover. But a dark shade steals,\r\nlike a mildew, over this bright picture of beauty, poetry, and love,\r\neven while we gaze upon it. The projected union between Sydney and Lady\r\nPenelope was finally broken off by their respective families, for\r\nreasons which do not appear.[106] Sir Charles Blount offered himself,\r\nand was refused, though evidently agreeable to the lady; and she was\r\nmarried by her guardians to Lord Rich, a man of talents and integrity,\r\nbut most disagreeable in person and manners, and her declared\r\naversion.[107]\r\n\r\nThis inauspicious union ended, as might have been expected, in misery\r\nand disgrace. Lady Rich bore her fate with extreme impatience. Her warm\r\naffections, her high spirit, and her strength of mind, so heroically\r\ndisplayed in behalf of her brother, served but to render her more\r\npoignantly sensible of the tyranny which had forced her into detested\r\nbonds. She could not forget,--perhaps never wished or sought to\r\nforget--that she had received the homage of the two most accomplished\r\nmen of that time,--Sydney and Blount; \"and not finding that satisfaction\r\nat home she ought to have received, she looked for it abroad where she\r\nought not to find it.\"\r\n\r\nSydney describes a secret interview which took place between himself and\r\nLady Rich shortly after her marriage. I should have observed, that\r\nSydney designates himself all through his poems by the name of\r\nAstrophel.\r\n\r\n    In a grove, most rich of shade,\r\n    Where birds wanton music made,\r\n    May, then young, his pied weeds showing,\r\n    New perfumed with flowers fresh growing.\r\n    Astrophel, with Stella sweet,\r\n    Did for mutual comfort meet;\r\n    Both within themselves opprest,\r\n    But each in the other blest;\r\n    Him great harms had taught much care,\r\n    _Her fair neck a foul yoke bear_;\r\n    But her sight his cares did banish,\r\n    In his sight her yoke did vanish, &c.\r\n\r\nHe pleads the time, the place, the season, and their divided vows; and\r\nwould have pressed his suit more warmly,\r\n\r\n    But her hand, his hands repelling,\r\n    Gave repulse--all grace excelling!\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    Then she spake! her speech was such\r\n    As not ear, but heart did touch.\r\n    \"Astrophel, (said she) my love,\r\n    Cease in these effects to prove!\r\n    Now be still!--yet still believe me,\r\n    Thy grief more than death would grieve me.\r\n    Trust me, while, I thus deny,\r\n    In myself the smart I try:\r\n    Tyrant honour doth thus use thee;\r\n    Stella's self might not refuse thee!\r\n    Therefore, dear! this no more move:\r\n    Lest, though I leave not thy love,\r\n    (Which too deep in me is framed!)\r\n    _I should blush when thou art named!_\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiment he has made her express in the last line is beautiful, and\r\ntoo feminine and appropriate not to have been taken from nature; but,\r\nunhappily, it did not always govern her conduct. How far her coquetry\r\nproceeded we do not know. Sydney, about a year afterwards, married the\r\ndaughter of Secretary Walsingham, and survived his marriage but a short\r\ntime. This theme of song, this darling of fame, and ornament of his age,\r\nperished at the battle of Zutphen, in the very summer of his glorious\r\nyouth. \"He had trod,\" as the author of the Effigies Poeticae so\r\nbeautifully expresses it, \"from his cradle to his grave, amid incense\r\nand flowers--and died in a dream of glory!\"\r\n\r\nHis death was not only such as became the soldier and Christian;--the\r\nnatural elegance and sensibility of his mind followed him even to the\r\nverge of the tomb: in his last moments, when the mortification had\r\ncommenced, and all hope was over, he called for music into his chamber,\r\nand lay listening to it with tranquil pleasure. Sydney died in his\r\nthirty-fourth year.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous poets who lamented this deep-felt loss (volumes, I\r\nbelieve, were filled with the tributes paid to his memory), was Spenser,\r\nwhom Sydney had early patronised. His elegy, however, is too laboured,\r\ntoo lengthy, too artificial, to please altogether, though containing\r\nsome lines of great beauty. It is singular, and a little\r\nincomprehensible to our modern ideas of _bienseance_ and good taste,\r\nthat in this elegy, which Spenser dedicates to Sydney's widow after her\r\nremarriage with Essex, he introduces Stella as lamenting over the body\r\nof Astrophel, tells us how she beat her fair bosom--\"the treasury of\r\njoy,\"--how she tore her lovely hair, wept out her eyes,--\r\n\r\n    And with sweet kisses suckt the parting breath\r\n    Out of his lips.\r\n\r\nAt length, through excess of grief, or the compassion of the gods, she\r\nis changed into the flower, \"by some called starlight, by others\r\npenthia.\" This might pass in those days; though, considering all the\r\ncircumstances, it is strange that, even then, it escaped ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe tears shed for Sydney, by those nearest and dearest to him, were but\r\ntoo soon dried. His widow was consoled by Essex, and his Stella, by her\r\nold lover Mountjoy, who returned from Ireland, flushed with victory and\r\nhonours, and cast himself again at her feet. Their secret intercourse\r\nremained, for several years, undiscovered. Lady Rich, who was tenderly\r\nattached to her brother, was guarded in her conduct, fearing equally the\r\nloss of his esteem, and the renewal of those hostile feelings which had\r\nalready caused one duel between Essex and Mountjoy. She had also\r\nchildren; and as all, without exception, lived to be distinguished men\r\nand virtuous women, we may give her credit for some attention to their\r\neducation,--some compunctious visitings of nature on their account.\r\n\r\nDuring her brother's imprisonment, she made the most strenuous, the most\r\npersevering efforts to save his life: she besieged Elizabeth with the\r\nrichest presents, the most eloquent letters of supplication;--she\r\nwaylaid her at the door of her chamber, till commanded to remain a\r\nprisoner in her own house;--she bribed, or otherwise won, all whom she\r\nthought could plead his cause;--and when these were of no avail, and\r\nEssex perished, she seems, in her despair, to have thrown off all\r\nrestraint--and at length, fled from the house of her husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1605 she was legally divorced from Lord Rich; and soon after married\r\nMountjoy, then Earl of Devonshire. The marriage of a divorced wife in\r\nthe lifetime of her first husband, was in those days a thing almost\r\nunprecedented in the English court, and caused the most violent outcry\r\nand scandal. Laud (the archbishop, then chaplain to the Earl of\r\nDevonshire,) incurred the censure of the Church for uniting the lovers,\r\nand ever after fasted on the anniversary of this fatal marriage. The\r\nEarl, one of the most admirable and distinguished men of that chivalrous\r\nage, who \"felt a stain as a wound,\" found it impossible to endure the\r\ninfamy brought on himself and the woman he loved: he died about a year\r\nafter: \"the griefe,\" says a contemporary, \"of this unhappie love brought\r\nhim to his end.\"[108]\r\n\r\nHis unfortunate Countess lingered but a short time after him, and died\r\nin a miserable obscurity.--Such is the history of Sydney's STELLA.\r\n\r\nThree of her sons became English earls; the eldest, Earl of Warwick; the\r\nsecond, Earl of Holland; and the third (her son by Mountjoy) Earl of\r\nNewport. The earldoms of Warwick and Holland were held by her lineal\r\ndescendants, till the death of that young Lord Warwick, whose mother\r\nmarried Addison.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[102] Sonnet 31.\r\n\r\n[103] Sonnet 41.\r\n\r\n[104] Sonnet 48.\r\n\r\n[105] Sonnet 54.\r\n\r\n[106] \"All the lords that wish well to the children of the Earl of\r\nEssex, and I suppose all the best sorte of the English lords besides,\r\ndoe expect what will become of the treaty between Mr. Philip and my lady\r\nPenelope.

Ideas they may be,--but they have neither\r\npoetry, nor passion, nor even elegance:--a circumstance not very\r\nsurprising, if it be true that he composed them merely to show his\r\ningenuity in a style which was then the prevailing fashion of his time.\r\nDrayton was never married, and little is known of his private life. He\r\nloved a lady of Coventry, to whom he promises an immortality he has not\r\nbeen able to confer.\r\n\r\n    How many paltry, foolish, painted things\r\n      That now in coaches trouble every street,\r\n    Shall be forgotten, whom no poet sings,\r\n      E'er they be well wrapp'd in their winding-sheet;\r\n\r\n    While I to thee eternity shall give,\r\n      When nothing else remaineth of these days,\r\n\r\n    _And Queens hereafter shall be glad to live\r\n      Upon the alms of thy superfluous praise;_\r\n\r\n    Virgins and matrons reading these my rhimes,\r\n      Shall be so much delighted with thy story,\r\n\r\n    That they shall grieve they liv'd not in these times,\r\n      To have seen thee, their sex's only glory:\r\n\r\n    So thou shall fly above the vulgar throng,\r\n    Still to survive in my immortal song.\r\n\r\nThere are fine nervous lines in this Sonnet: we long to hail the exalted\r\nbeauty who is announced by such a flourish of trumpets, and are\r\nproportionably disappointed to find that she has neither \"a local\r\nhabitation nor a name.\" Drayton's little song,\r\n\r\n    I prythee, love! love me no more,\r\n    Take back the heart you gave me!\r\n\r\nstands unique, in point of style, among the rest of his works, and is\r\nvery genuine and passionate. Daniel,[110] who was munificently\r\npatronized by the Lord Mountjoy, mentioned in the preceding sketch, was\r\none of the most graceful sonnetteers of that time; and he has touches of\r\ntenderness as well as fancy; for _he_ was in earnest, and the object of\r\nhis attachment was real, though disguised under the name of Delia. She\r\nresided on the banks of the river Avon, and was unmoved by the poet's\r\nstrains. Rank with her outweighed love and genius. Daniel says of his\r\nSonnets--\r\n\r\n    Though the error of my youth in them appear,\r\n    Suffice they show I lived, and loved thee dear.\r\n\r\nThe lines\r\n\r\n    Restore thy tresses to the golden ore,\r\n    Yield Citherea's son those arcs of love,\r\n\r\nare luxuriantly elegant, and quite Italian in the flow and imagery. Her\r\nmodesty is prettily set forth in another Sonnet--\r\n\r\n    A modest maid, deck'd with a blush of honour,\r\n      Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love,\r\n    The wonder of all eyes that look upon her,\r\n      Sacred on earth, designed a Saint above!\r\n\r\nAfter a long series of sonnets, elaborately plaintive, he interrupts\r\nhimself with a little touch of truth and nature, which is quite\r\nrefreshing;\r\n\r\n    I must not grieve my love! whose eyes should read\r\n      Lines of delight, whereon her youth might smile;\r\n    The flowers have time before they come to seed,\r\n      And she is young, and now must sport the while.\r\n    And sport, sweet maid! in season of these years,\r\n      And learn to gather flow'rs before they wither;\r\n    And where the sweetest blossom first appears,\r\n      Let Love and Youth conduct thy pleasures thither.\r\n\r\nIf the lady could have been won by poetical flattery, she must have\r\nyielded. At length, unable to bear her obduracy, and condemned to see\r\nanother preferred before him, Daniel resolved to travel; and he wrote,\r\non this occasion, the most feeling of all his Sonnets.\r\n\r\n    And whither, poor forsaken! wilt thou go?\r\n\r\nDaniel remained abroad several years, and returning, cured of his\r\nattachment, he married Giustina Florio, of a family of Waldenses, who\r\nhad fled from the frightful persecutions carried on in the Italian Alps\r\nagainst that miserable people. With her, he appears to have been\r\nsufficiently happy to forget the pain of his former repulse, and enjoy,\r\nwithout one regretful pang, the fame it had given him as a poet.\r\n\r\nDrummond, of Hawthornden,[111] is yet more celebrated, and with reason.\r\nHe has elegance, and sweetness, and tenderness; but not the pathos or\r\nthe passion we might have expected from the circumstances of his\r\nattachment, which was as real and deep, as it was mournful in its issue.\r\nHe loved a beautiful girl of the noble family of Cunningham, who is the\r\nLesbia of his poetry. After a fervent courtship, he succeeded in\r\nsecuring her affections; but she died, \"in the fresh April of her\r\nyears,\" and when their marriage-day had been fixed. Drummond has left us\r\na most charming picture of his mistress; of her modesty, her retiring\r\nsweetness, her accomplishments, and her tenderness for him.\r\n\r\n    O sacred blush, empurpling cheeks, pure skies\r\n      With crimson wings, which spread thee like the morn;\r\n    O bashful look, sent from those shining eyes;\r\n      O tongue in which most luscious nectar lies,\r\n    That can at once both bless and make forlorn;\r\n      Dear coral lip, which beauty beautifies,\r\n    That trembling stood before her words were born;\r\n      And you her words--words! no, but golden chains,\r\n    Which did enslave my ears, ensnare my soul;\r\n      Wise image of her mind,--mind that contains\r\n    A power, all power of senses to controul;\r\n      So sweetly you from love dissuade do me,\r\n      That I love more, if more my love can be.\r\n\r\nThe quaint iteration of the same word through this Sonnet has not an ill\r\neffect. The lady was in a more relenting mood when he wrote the Sonnet\r\non her lips, \"those fruits of Paradise,\"--\r\n\r\n    I die, dear life! unless to me be given\r\n      As many kisses as the Spring hath flowers,\r\n      Or there be silver drops in Iris' showers,\r\n    Or stars there be in all-embracing heaven;\r\n      And if displeased ye of the match remain,\r\n      Ye shall have leave to take them back again!\r\n\r\nHe mentions a handkerchief, which, in the days of their first\r\ntenderness, she had embroidered for him, unknowing that it was destined\r\nto be steeped in tears for her loss!--In fact, the grief of Drummond on\r\nthis deprivation was so overwhelming, that he sunk at first into a total\r\ndespondency and inactivity, from which he was with difficulty roused. He\r\nleft the scene of his happiness, and his regrets--\r\n\r\n    Are these the flowery banks? is this the mead\r\n     Where she was wont to pass the pleasant hours?\r\n    Is this the goodly elm did us o'erspread,\r\n     Whose tender rind, cut forth in curious flowers\r\n    By that white hand, contains those flames of ours?\r\n     Is this the murmuring spring, us music made?\r\n     Deflourish'd mead, where is your heavenly hue?\r\n\r\nHe travelled for eight years, seeking, in change of place and scene,\r\nsome solace for his wounded peace. There was a kind of constancy even in\r\nDrummond's inconstancy; for meeting many years afterwards with an\r\namiable girl, who bore the most striking resemblance to his lost\r\nmistress, he loved her for that very resemblance, and married her. Her\r\nname was Margaret Logan. I am not aware that there are any verses\r\naddressed to her.\r\n\r\nDrummond has been called the Scottish Petrarch: he tells us himself,\r\nthat \"he was the first in this Isle who did celebrate a dead\r\nmistress,\"--and his resemblance to Petrarch, in elegance and sentiment,\r\nhas often been observed: he resembles him, it is true--but it is as a\r\nprofessed and palpable imitator resembles the object of his imitation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn glancing back at the age of Elizabeth,--so adorned by masculine\r\ntalent, in arts, in letters, and in arms,--we are at first surprised to\r\nfind so few distinguished women. It seems remarkable that a golden epoch\r\nin our literature, to which she gave her name \"the Elizabethan age,\"--a\r\ncourt in which a female ruled,--a period fruitful in great poets, should\r\nhave produced only one or two women who are interesting from their\r\npoetical celebrity. Of these, Alice Spenser, Countess of Derby, and Mary\r\nSydney, Countess of Pembroke, (the sister of Sir Philip Sydney) are the\r\nmost remarkable; the first has enjoyed the double distinction of being\r\ncelebrated by Spenser in her youth, and by Milton in her age,--almost\r\ntoo much honour for one woman, though she had been a muse, and a grace,\r\nand a cardinal virtue, moulded in one. Lady Pembroke has been celebrated\r\nby Spenser and by Ben Jonson, and was, in every respect, a most\r\naccomplished woman. To these might be added other names, which might\r\nhave shone aloft like stars, and \"shed some influence on this lower\r\nworld:\" if the age had not produced two women, so elevated in station,\r\nand so every way illustrious by accidental or personal qualities, that\r\neach, in her respective sphere, extinguished all the lesser orbs around\r\nher. It would have been difficult for any female to seize on the\r\nattention, or claim either an historical or poetical interest, in the\r\nage of Queen Elizabeth and Mary Stuart.\r\n\r\nIn her own court, Elizabeth was not satisfied to preside. She could as\r\nill endure a competitor in celebrity or charms, as in power. She\r\narrogated to herself all the incense around her; and, in point of\r\nadulation, she was like the daughter of the horse-leech, whose cry was,\r\n\"give! give!\" Her insatiate vanity would have been ludicrous, if it had\r\nnot produced such atrocious consequences. This was the predominant\r\nweakness of her character, which neutralized her talents, and was\r\npampered, till in its excess it became a madness and a vice. This\r\nprecipitated the fate of her lovely rival, Mary Queen of Scots. This\r\nelevated the profligate Leicester to the pinnacle of favour, and kept\r\nhim there, sullied as he was by every baseness and every crime;[112]\r\nthis hurried Essex to the block; banished Southampton; and sent Raleigh\r\nand Elizabeth Throckmorton to the Tower. Did one of her attendants, more\r\nbeautiful than the rest, attract the notice or homage of any of the gay\r\ncavaliers around her,--was an attachment whispered, a marriage\r\nprojected,--it was enough to throw the whole court into consternation.\r\n\"Her Majesty, the Queen, was in a passion;\" and, then, heaven help the\r\noffenders! It was the spirit of Harry the Eighth let loose again. Yet\r\nsuch is the reflected glory she derives from the Sydneys and the\r\nRaleighs, the Walsinghams and Cecils, the Shakspeares and Spensers of\r\nher time, that we can scarce look beyond it, to stigmatise the hard\r\nunfeminine egotism of her character.\r\n\r\nThere was something extremely poetical in her situation, as a maiden\r\nqueen, raised from a prison to a throne, exposed to unceasing danger\r\nfrom without and treason from within, and supported through all by her\r\nown extraordinary talents, and by the devotion of the chivalrous,\r\ngallant courtiers and captains, who paid to her, as their queen and\r\nmistress, a homage and obedience they would scarce have paid to a\r\nsovereign of their own sex. All this display of talent and heroism, and\r\nchivalrous gallantry, has a fine gorgeous effect to the\r\nimagination;--but for the woman herself,--as a woman, with her pedantry,\r\nand her absurd affectation; her masculine temper and coarse insolence;\r\nher sharp, shrewish, cat-like face, and her pretension to beauty, it is\r\nimpossible to conceive any thing more anti-poetical.\r\n\r\n    Yet had she praises in all plenteousness\r\n    Pour'd upon her, like showers of Castalie.[113]\r\n\r\nShe was a favourite theme of the poets of the time, and by right divine\r\nof her sceptre and her sex, an object of glorious flattery, not always\r\nfeigned, even where it was false.\r\n\r\nShe is the Gloriana of Spenser's Fairy Queen,--she is the \"Cynthia, the\r\nladye of the sea,\"--she is the \"Fair Vestal throned in the West,\" of\r\nShakspeare--\r\n\r\n    That very time I saw, (but thou couldst not,)\r\n    Flying between the cold moon and the earth,\r\n    Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took\r\n    At a fair Vestal, throned by the West,\r\n    And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,\r\n    As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;\r\n    But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft\r\n    Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon;\r\n    And the imperial vot'ress passed on\r\n    In maiden meditation, fancy free.\r\n\r\nAnd the previous allusion to Mary of Scotland, as the \"Sea Maid on the\r\nDolphin's back,\"\r\n\r\n    Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,\r\n    That the rude sea grew civil at her song,\r\n\r\nis not less exquisite.\r\n\r\nIt would, in truth, have been easier for Mary to have calmed the rude\r\nsea than her ruder and wilder subjects. These two queens, so strangely\r\nmisplaced, seem as if, by some sport of destiny, each had dropt into the\r\nsphere designed for the other. Mary should have reigned over the\r\nSydneys, the Essexes, the Mountjoys;--and with her smiles, and sweet\r\nwords; and generous gifts, have inspired and rewarded the poets around\r\nher. Elizabeth should have been transferred to Scotland, where she might\r\nhave bandied frowns and hard names with John Knox, cut off the heads of\r\nrebellious barons, and boxed the ears of ill-bred courtiers.\r\n\r\nThis is no place to settle disputed points of history, nor, if it were,\r\nshould I presume to throw an opinion in to one scale or the other; but\r\ntake the two queens as women merely, and with a reference to apparent\r\ncircumstances, I would rather have been Mary than Elizabeth; I would\r\nrather have been Mary, with all her faults, frailties, and\r\nmisfortunes,--all her power of engaging hearts,--betrayed by her own\r\nsoft nature, and the vile or fierce passions of the men around her, to\r\ndie on a scaffold, with the meekness of a saint and the courage of a\r\nheroine, with those at her side who would willingly have bled for\r\nher,--than I would have been that heartless flirt, Elizabeth, surrounded\r\nby the oriental servility, the lip and knee homage of her splendid\r\ncourt; to die at last on her palace-floor, like a crushed wasp--sick of\r\nher own very selfishness--torpid, sullen, and despairing,--without one\r\nfriend near her, without one heart in the wide world attached to her by\r\naffection or gratitude.\r\n\r\nThere is more true and earnest feeling in some little verses written by\r\nRonsard on the unhappy Queen of Scots, than in all the elegant,\r\nfanciful, but extravagant flattery of Elizabeth's poets. After just\r\nmentioning the English Queen, whom he dispatches in a single line,--\r\n\r\n    Je vis leur belle reine, honnete et vertueuse;\r\n\r\nhe thus dwells on the charms of Mary:--\r\n\r\n    Je vis des Ecossais la Reine sage et belle,\r\n    Qui de corps et d'esprits ressemble une immortelle;\r\n    J'approchai de ses yeux, mais bien de deux soleils,\r\n    Deux soleils de beaute, qui n'ont point leurs pareils.\r\n    Je les vis larmoyer d'une claire rosee,\r\n    Je vis d'un clair crystal sa paupiere arrosee,\r\n    Se souvenant de France, et du sceptre laisse,\r\n    Et de son premier feu, comme un songe passe!\r\n\r\nAnd when Mary was a prisoner, he dedicated to her a whole book of poems,\r\nin which he celebrates her with a warmth, the more delightful that it\r\nwas disinterested. He thanks her for selecting his poems, to amuse her\r\nsolitary hours, and adds feelingly,--\r\n\r\n    Car, je ne veux en ce monde choisir\r\n    Plus grand honneur que vous donner plaisir!\r\n\r\nMary did not leave her courteous poet unrewarded. She contrived, though\r\na prisoner, to send him a casket containing two thousand crowns, and a\r\nvase, on which was represented Mount Parnassus, and a flying Pegasus,\r\nwith this inscription:--\r\n\r\n    A Ronsard, l'Apollon de la source des Muses.\r\n\r\nNo one understood better than Mary the value of a compliment from a\r\nbeauty, and a queen; had she bestowed more precious favours with equal\r\neffect and discrimination, her memory had escaped some disparagement.\r\nRonsard, we are told, was sufficiently a poet, to value the inscription\r\non his vase more than the gold in the casket.\r\n\r\nApropos to Ronsard: the history of his loves is so whimsical and so\r\ntruly French, that it must claim a place here.\r\n\r\nYet now I am upon French ground, I may as well take the giant's advice,\r\nand \"begin at the beginning.\"[114] It seems at first view unaccountable\r\nthat France, which has produced so many remarkable women, should scarce\r\nexhibit one poetical heroine of great or popular interest, since its\r\nlanguage and literature assumed their present form; not one who has been\r\nrendered illustrious or dear to us by the praises of a poet lover. The\r\ncelebrity of celebrated French women is, in truth, very anti-poetical.\r\nThe memory of the kiss which Marguerite d'Ecosse[115] gave to Alain\r\nChartier, has long survived the verses he wrote in her praise. Clement\r\nMarot, the court poet of Francis the First, was the lover, or rather one\r\nof the lovers, of Diana of Poictiers (mistress to the Dauphin,\r\nafterwards Henry the Second). She was confessedly the most beautiful and\r\nthe most abandoned woman of her time. Marot could hardly have expected\r\nto find her a paragon of constancy; yet he laments her fickleness, as if\r\nit had touched his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIANE.\r\n\r\n    Puisque de vous je n'ai autre visage,\r\n        Je m'en vais rendre hermite en un desert,\r\n        Pour prier Dieu, si un autre vous sert,\r\n    Qu'autant que moi en votre honneur soit sage.\r\n\r\n    Adieu, Amour! adieu, gentil corsage!\r\n       Adieu ce teint! adieu ces friands yeux!\r\n    Je n'ai pas eu de vous grand avantage,--\r\n       Un moins aimant aura peut-etre mieux.\r\n\r\nIn a _liaison_ of mere vanity and profligacy, the transition from love\r\n(if love it be) to hatred and malignity, is not uncommon--as Spenser\r\nsays so beautifully,\r\n\r\n          Such love might never long endure,\r\n    However gay and goodly be the style,\r\n    That doth ill cause or evil end enure:\r\n    For Virtue is the band that bindeth hearts most sure!\r\n\r\nFrom being the lady's _lover_, Marot became her satirist; instead of\r\n_chansons_ in praise of her beauty, he circulated the most biting and\r\ninsufferable epigrams on her person and character. We are told by one,\r\nwho, I presume, speaks _avec connaissance de fait_, that a woman's\r\nrevenge\r\n\r\n    Is like the tiger's spring,\r\n    Deadly and quick, and crushing.\r\n\r\nDiana was a libelled beauty, all powerful and unprincipled. Marot, in\r\nsome moment of gaiety and overflowing confidence, had confessed to her\r\nthat he had eaten meat on a \"jour maigre:\" he had better in those days\r\nhave committed all the seven deadly sins; and when the lady revealed his\r\nunlucky confession, and denounced him as a heretic, he was immediately\r\nimprisoned. Instead, however, of being depressed by his situation, or\r\nmoved to make any concessions, he published from his prison a most\r\nludicrous lampoon on his _ci-devant_ mistress, of which the burthen was,\r\n\"Prenez le, il a mange le lard!\" He afterwards made his escape, and took\r\nrefuge in the court of Renee, Duchess of Ferrara; and though\r\nsubsequently recalled to France, he continued to pursue Diana with the\r\nmost bitter satire, became a second time a fugitive, partly on her\r\naccount, and died in exile and poverty.[116]\r\n\r\nMarot has been called the French Chaucer. He resembles the English poet\r\nin liveliness of fancy, picturesque imagery, simplicity of expression,\r\nand satirical humour; but he has these merits in a far less degree; and\r\nin variety of genius, pathos and power, is immeasurably his inferior.\r\n\r\nRonsard, to whom I at length return, was the successor of Marot. In his\r\ntime the Italian sonnetteers, as Petrarch, Bembo, Sanazzaro, were the\r\nprevailing models, and classical pedantry the prevailing taste. Ronsard,\r\nhaving filled his mind with Greek and learning, determined to be a\r\npoet, and looked about for a mistress to be the object of his songs:\r\nfor a poet without a mistress was then an unheard-of anomaly. He fixed\r\nupon a beautiful woman of Blois, named Cassandre, whose Greek\r\nappellative, it is said, was her principal attraction in his fancy. To\r\nher he addressed about two hundred and twenty sonnets, in a style so\r\nlofty and pedantic, stuffed with such hard names and philosophical\r\nallusions, that the fair Cassandra must have been as wise as her\r\nnamesake, the daughter of Priam, to have comprehended her own praises.\r\n\r\nRonsard's next love was more interesting. Her name was Marie: she was\r\nbeautiful and kind: the poet really loved her; and consequently, we find\r\nhim occasionally descending from his heights of affectation and\r\nscholarship, to the language of truth, nature and tenderness. Marie died\r\nyoung; and among Ronsard's most admired poems are two or three little\r\npieces written after her death. As his works are not commonly met with,\r\nI give one as a specimen of his style:--\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITAPHE DE MARIE.\r\n\r\n    Ci reposent les os de la belle Marie,\r\n    Qui me fit pour un jour quitter mon Vendomois,[117]\r\n    Qui m'echauffa le sang au plus verd de mes mois;\r\n    Qui fut toute mon tout, mon bien, et mon envie.\r\n\r\n    En sa tombe repose honneur et courtoisie,\r\n    Et la jeune beaute qu'en l'ame je sentois,\r\n    Et le flambeau d'Amour, ses traits et son carquois,\r\n    Et ensemble mon coeur, mes pensees et ma vie.\r\n\r\n    Tu es, belle Angevine,[117] un bel astre des cieux;\r\n    Les anges, tous ravis, se paissent de tes yeux,\r\n    La terre te regrette, O beaute sans seconde!\r\n\r\n    Maintenant tu es vive, et je suis mort d'ennui,\r\n    Malheureux qui se fie en l'attente d'autrui;\r\n    Trois amis m'ont trompe,--toi, l'amour, et le monde.\r\n\r\nRonsard had by this time acquired a reputation which eclipsed that of\r\nall his contemporaries. He was caressed and patronised by Charles the\r\nNinth (of hateful memory), who, like Nero, exhibited the revolting\r\ncombination of a taste for poetry and the fine arts, with the most\r\nsanguinary and depraved dispositions. Ronsard, having lost his Marie,\r\nwas commanded by Catherine de' Medicis to select a mistress from among\r\nthe ladies of her court, to be the future object of his tuneful homage.\r\nHe politely left her Majesty to choose for him, prepared to fall in love\r\nduly at the royal behest; and Catherine pointed out Helene de Surgeres,\r\none of her maids of honour, as worthy to be the second Laura of a second\r\nPetrarch. The docile poet, with zealous obedience, warbled the praises\r\nof Helene for the rest of his life. He also consecrated to her a\r\nfountain near his chateau in the Vendomois, which has popularly\r\npreserved her name and fame. It is still known as the \"Fontaine\r\nd'Helene.\"\r\n\r\nHelene was more witty than beautiful, and, though vain of the celebrity\r\nshe had acquired in the verses of Ronsard, she either disliked him in\r\nthe character of a lover, or was one of those lofty ladies\r\n\r\n    Who hate to have their dignity profaned\r\n    With any relish of an earthly thought.[118]\r\n\r\nShe desired the Cardinal du Perron would request Ronsard (in her name)\r\nto prefix an epistle to the odes and sonnets addressed to her, assuring\r\nthe world that this poetical love had been purely Platonic. \"Madam,\"\r\nsaid the Cardinal, \"you had better give him leave to prefix your\r\npicture.\"[119]\r\n\r\nI presume my fair and gentle readers (I shall have none, I am sure, who\r\nare not one or the other, or both,) are as tired as myself of all this\r\naffectation, and glad to turn from it to the interest of passion and\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n\"There is not,\" says Cowley, \"so great a lie to be found in any poet, as\r\nthe vulgar conceit of men, that lying is essential to good poetry.\" On\r\nthe contrary, where there is not truth, there is nothing--\r\n\r\n    Rien n' est beau que le vrai,--le vrai seul est aimable!\r\n\r\nWhile the Italian school of amatory verse was flourishing in France,\r\nSpain, and England, almost to the extinction of originality in this\r\nstyle, the brightest light of Italian poesy had arisen, and was shining\r\nwith a troubled splendour over that land of song. How swiftly at the\r\nthought does imagination shoot, \"like a glancing star,\" over the wide\r\nexpanse of sea and land, and through a long interval of sad and varied\r\nyears! I am again standing within the porch of the church of San\r\nOnofrio, looking down upon the little slab in its dark corner, which\r\ncovers the bones of TASSO.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] Died 1631\r\n\r\n[110] Died in 1619.\r\n\r\n[111] Died 1649.\r\n\r\n[112] Leicester's influence over Elizabeth appeared so unaccountable,\r\nthat it was ascribed to magic, and to her evil stars.\r\n\r\n[113] Spenser's Daphnaida.\r\n\r\n[114]\r\n    Belier, mon ami!

When one of her\r\nattendants spoke of hope and life, the Queen, turning from her with an\r\nexpression of deep disgust, exclaimed with a last effort, \"Fi de la vie!\r\nne m'en parlez plus!\"--and expired.\r\n\r\n[116] At Althorp, the seat of Lord Spenser, there is a most curious\r\npicture of Diana of Poictiers, once in the Crawford collection: it is a\r\nsmall half-length; the features are fair and regular; the hair is\r\nelaborately dressed with a profusion of jewels; but there is no drapery\r\nwhatever, except a curtain behind: round the head is the legend from the\r\nforty-second Psalm,--\"Comme le cerf braie apres le decours des eaues,\r\nainsi brait mon ame apres toi, O Dieu!\" which is certainly a most\r\nextraordinary and profane application. In the days of Diana of\r\nPoictiers, Marot had composed a version of the Psalms, then very\r\npopular. It was the fashion to sing them to dance and song tunes; and\r\nthe courtiers and beauties had each their favourite psalm, which served\r\nas a kind of _devise_. This may explain the very singular inscription on\r\nthis very singular picture.\r\n\r\n[117] Ronsard was a native of the Vendomois, and Marie, of Anjou.\r\n\r\n[118] Ben Jonson.\r\n\r\n[119] V.

The idea, true or false,\r\nthat she it was who broke the heart and frenzied the brain of Tasso, has\r\nglorified her to future ages; has given her a fame, something like that\r\nof the Greek of old, who bequeathed his name to immortality, by firing\r\nthe grandest temple of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe question of Tasso's attachment to the Princess Leonora, is, I\r\nbelieve, set at rest by the acute researches and judicious reasoning of\r\nM. Ginguene, and those who have followed in his steps. A body of\r\ncircumstantial evidence has been collected, which would not only satisfy\r\na court of love--but a court of law, with a Lord Chancellor, to boot,\r\n\"_perpending_\" at the head of it. That which was once regarded as a\r\nromance, which we wished to believe, if we _could_, is now an\r\nestablished fact, which we cannot disbelieve if we would.\r\n\r\nNo poet perhaps ever owed so much to female influence as Tasso, or wrote\r\nso much under the intoxicating inspiration of love and beauty. He paid\r\nmost dearly for such inspiration; and yet not _too_ dearly. The high\r\ntone of sentiment, the tenderness, and the delicacy which pervade all\r\nhis poems, which prevail even in his most voluptuous descriptions, and\r\nwhich give him such a decided superiority over Ariosto, cannot be owing\r\nto any change of manners or increase of refinement produced by the lapse\r\nof a few years. It may be traced to the tender influence of two elegant\r\nwomen. He for many years read the cantos of the Gerusalemme, as he\r\ncomposed them, to the Princesses Lucretia and Leonora, both of whom he\r\nadmired--one of whom he adored.\r\n\r\n_Au reste_--the kiss, which he is said to have imprinted on the lips of\r\nLeonora in a transport of frenzy, as well as the idea that she was the\r\nprimary cause of his insanity, and of his seven years' imprisonment at\r\nSt. Anne's, rest on no authority worthy of credit; yet it is not less\r\ncertain that she was the object of his secret and fervent admiration,\r\nand that this hopeless passion conspired, with many other causes, to\r\nfever his irritable temperament and unsettle his imagination, beyond\r\nthat \"fine madness,\" which we are told _ought_ \"to possess the poet's\r\nbrain.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Tasso first visited Ferrara, in 1565, he was just one-and-twenty,\r\nwith all the advantages which a fine countenance, a majestic figure,\r\n(for he was tall even among the tallest,) noble birth, and excelling\r\ntalents could bestow: he was already distinguished as the author of the\r\nRinaldo, his earliest poem, in which he had celebrated (as if\r\nprophetically,) the Princesses d'Este--and chiefly Leonora.\r\n\r\n    Lucrezia Estense, e l'altra i cui crin d'oro,\r\n    Lacci e reti saran del casto amore.[120]\r\n\r\nWhen Tasso was first introduced to her in her brother's court, Leonora\r\nwas in her thirtieth year; a disparity of age which is certainly no\r\nargument against the passion she inspired. For a young man, at his first\r\nentrance into life, to fall in love ambitiously--with a woman, for\r\ninstance, who is older than himself, or with one who is, or ought to be,\r\nunattainable--is a common occurrence. Tasso, from his boyish years, had\r\nbeen the sworn servant of beauty. He tells us, in grave prose, \"che la\r\nsua giovanezza fu tutta sotto-posta all' amorose leggi;\"[121] but he was\r\nalso refined, even to fastidiousness, in his intercourse with women. He\r\nhad formed, in his own poetical mind, the most exalted idea of what a\r\nfemale ought to be, and unfortunately, she who first realised all his\r\ndreams of perfection, was a Princess--\"there seated where he durst not\r\nsoar.\" Leonora was still eminently lovely, in that soft, artless,\r\nunobtrusive style of beauty, which is charming in itself, and in a\r\nprincess irresistible, from its contrast with the loftiness of her\r\nstation and the trappings of her rank. Her complexion was extremely\r\nfair; her features small and regular; and the form of her head\r\npeculiarly graceful, if I may judge from a fine medallion I once saw of\r\nher in Italy. Ill health, and her early acquaintance with the sorrows of\r\nher unfortunate mother, had given to her countenance a languid and\r\npensive cast, and sicklied all the natural bloom of her complexion; but\r\n\"Paleur, qui marque une ame tendre, a bien son prix:\" so Tasso thought;\r\nand this \"vago Pallore,\" which \"vanquishes the rose, and makes the dawn\r\nashamed of her blushes,\" he has frequently and beautifully celebrated;\r\nas in the pretty Madrigal--\r\n\r\n    Vita della mia Vita!\r\n    _O Rosa scolorita!_ &c.\r\n\r\nand in those graceful lines,\r\n\r\n    Languidetta belta vinceva amore, &c.\r\n\r\napplicable only to Leonora. Her eyes were blue; her mouth of peculiar\r\nbeauty, both in form and expression. In the seventh Sonnet, \"Bella e la\r\ndonna mia,\" he says it was the most lovely feature in her face; in\r\nanother, still finer,[122] he styles this exquisite mouth \"a crimson\r\nshell\"--\r\n\r\n    Purpurea conca, in cui si nutre\r\n    Candor di perle elette e pellegrine;\r\n\r\nand he concludes it with one of those disguises under which he was\r\naccustomed to conceal Leonora's name.\r\n\r\n    E di si degno cor tuo straLE ONORA.\r\n\r\nShe was negligent in her dress, and studious and retired in her habits,\r\nseldom joining in the amusements of her brother's court, then the gayest\r\nand most magnificent in Italy.[123] Her accomplished and unhappy mother,\r\nRenee of France,[124] had early instilled into her mind a love of\r\nliterature, and especially of poetry. She was passionately fond of\r\nmusic, and sang admirably. One of Tasso's most beautiful sonnets was\r\ncomposed on some occasion when her physician had forbidden her to sing.\r\nHe who had so often felt the magic of that enchanting voice, thus\r\ndescribes its power and laments his loss:--\r\n\r\n    Ahi, ben e reo destin, ch' invidia, e toglie\r\n        Almondo il suon de' vostri chiari accenti,\r\n        Onde addivien che le terrene genti\r\n        De' maggior pregi, impoverisca e spoglie.\r\n\r\n    Ch' ogni nebbia mortal, che 'l senso accoglie,\r\n         Sgombrar potea dalle piu fosche menti\r\n         L' armonia dolce, e bei pensieri ardenti\r\n         Spirar d' onore, e pure e nobil voglie.\r\n\r\n    Ma non si merta qui forse cotanto;\r\n         E basta ben che i sereni occhi, e 'l riso\r\n         N' infiammin d' un piacer celeste e santo.\r\n\r\n    Nulla fora piu bello il Paradiso,\r\n         Se 'l mondo udisse, in voi d' angelo il canto,\r\n         Siccome vede in voi d' angelo il viso.\r\n\r\n\"O cruel--O envious destiny, that hast deprived the world of those\r\ndelicious accents, that hast made earth poor in what was dearest and\r\nsweetest! No cloud ever gathered over the gloomiest mind, which the\r\nmelody of that voice could not disperse; it breathed but to inspire\r\nnoble thoughts and chaste desires.--But, no! it was more than mortals\r\ncould deserve to possess. Those soft eyes, that smile were enough to\r\ninspire a sacred and sweet delight.--Nor would Paradise any longer excel\r\nthis earth, if in your voice we heard an angel sing, as we behold an\r\nangel's beauty in your face!\"\r\n\r\nLeonora, to a sweet-toned voice, added a gift, which, unless thus\r\naccompanied, loses half its value, and almost all its charm--she spoke\r\nwell; and her eloquence was so persuasive, that we are told she had\r\npower to move her brother Alphonso, when none else could. Tasso says\r\nmost poetically,\r\n\r\n    E l'aura del parlar cortese e saggio,\r\n    Fra le rose spirar, s'udia sovente;\r\n\r\n--meaning--for to translate literally is scarce possible,--that\r\n\"eloquence played round her lips, like the zephyr breathing over roses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I (he adds), beholding a celestial beauty walk the earth, closed my\r\neyes in terror, exclaiming, O rashness! O folly! for any to dare to gaze\r\non such charms! Alas! I quickly perceived that this was my least peril.\r\nMy heart was touched through my ears; her gentle wisdom penetrated\r\ndeeper than her beauty could reach.\"\r\n\r\nWith what emotions must a young and ardent poet have listened to his own\r\npraises from a beautiful mouth, thus sweetly gifted! and it may be\r\nadded, that Leonora's eloquence, and the influence she possessed over\r\nher brother, were ever employed in behalf of the deserving and\r\nunfortunate. The good people of Ferrara had such an exalted idea of her\r\npiety and benevolence, that when an earthquake caused a terrible\r\ninnundation of the Po, and the destruction of the surrounding villages,\r\nthey attributed the safety of their city entirely to her prayers and\r\nintercession.\r\n\r\nLeonora then was not unworthy of her illustrious conquest, either in\r\nperson, heart, or mind. To be summoned daily into the presence of a\r\nPrincess thus beautiful and amiable, to read aloud his verses to her, to\r\nhear his own praises from her lips, to bask in her approving smiles, to\r\nassociate with her in her retirement, to behold her in all the graceful\r\nsimplicity of her familiar life,--was a dangerous situation for Tasso,\r\nand surely not less so for Leonora herself. That she was aware of his\r\nadmiration, and perfectly understood his sentiments, and that a\r\nmysterious intelligence existed between them, consistent with the utmost\r\nreverence on his part, and the most perfect delicacy and dignity on\r\nhers, is apparent from the meaning and tendency of innumerable passages\r\nscattered through his minor poems--too significant in their application\r\nto be mistaken. Though that application be not avowed, and even\r\ndisguised--the very disguise, when once detected, points to the object.\r\nLeonora knew, as well as her lover, that a Princess \"was no love-mate\r\nfor a bard.\" She knew far better than her lover, until _he_ too had been\r\ntaught by wretched experience, the haughty and implacable temper of her\r\nbrother Alphonso, who never was known to brook an injury or forgive an\r\noffender. She must have remembered too well the twelve years'\r\nimprisonment and the narrow escape from death, of her unfortunate mother\r\nfor a less cause. She was of a timid and reserved nature, increased by\r\nthe extreme delicacy of her constitution. Her hand had frequently been\r\nsought by princes and nobles, whom she had uniformly rejected, at the\r\nrisk of displeasing her brother; and the eyes of a jealous court were\r\nupon her. Tasso, on the other hand, was imprudent, hot-headed, fearless,\r\nardently attached. For both their sakes, it was necessary for Leonora to\r\nbe guarded and reserved, unless she would have made herself the fable of\r\nall Italy. And in what glowing verse has Tasso described all the\r\ndelicious pain of such a situation! now proud of his fetters, now\r\nexecrating them in despair. In allusion to his ambitious passion, he is\r\nPhaeton, Icarus, Tantalus, Ixion.\r\n\r\n    Se d' Icaro leggesti c di Fetonte, &c.\r\n\r\nBut though presumption flung to ruin Icarus and Phaeton, did not the\r\npower of love bring even Dian down \"from her amazing height?\"\r\n\r\n                       E che non puote\r\n    Amor, che con catena il ciel unisce?\r\n    Egli gia trae delle celeste rote\r\n    Di terrana belta Diana accesa,\r\n    E d'Ida il bel Fanciul[125] al' ciel rapisce.\r\n\r\nThis at least is _clearly_ significant, however poetical the allusions;\r\nbut what a world of passion and of meaning breathes through the Sonnet\r\nwhich he has entitled \"The constrained Silence,\" (\"_Il Silenzio\r\nImposto._\")\r\n\r\n\"She is content that I should love her; yet, O what hard restraint of\r\ngalling silence has she imposed!\"\r\n\r\n    Vuol che l' ami costei; ma duro freno\r\n    Mi pone ancor d' aspro silenzio; or quale\r\n    Avro da lei, se non conosce il male\r\n    O medecina, o refrigerio almeno?\r\n\r\n    ....*....*....*....*\r\n\r\n    Tacer ben posso, e tacero! ch' io toglia\r\n    Sangue alle piaghe, e luce al vivo foco\r\n    Non brami gia; questa e impossibil voglia\r\n    Troppo spinse pungenti a dentro i colpi,\r\n    E troppo ardore accolse in picciol loco:\r\n    S' apparira, natura, e se n' incolpi.[126]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can, I will keep silence; but to command that the wound shall\r\nnot bleed nor the fire burn, is to command impossibility. Too, too deep\r\nhath the blow been struck; too ardently glows the flame; and if\r\nbetrayed, the fault is in nature--not in me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, what can be more exquisitely tender, more beautiful in its\r\nfervent simplicity of expression, than the effusion which follows? How\r\nmiserably does an inadequate prose translation halt after the glowing\r\npoetry, the rhythmical music, the \"linked sweetness\" of the original!\r\n\r\n    Io non cedo in amar, Donna gentile\r\n         A' chi mostra di fuor l' interno affetto;\r\n         Perche 'l mio si nasconda in mezzo 'l petto,\r\n         Ne co' fior s' apra del mio nuovo Aprile,\r\n    Co' vaghi sguardi, e col sembiante umile,\r\n        Co' detti sparsi in variando aspetto\r\n        Altri si veggia al vostro amor soggetto,\r\n        E co' sospiri, e con leggiadro stile.\r\n\r\n    E quando gela il cielo, e quando infiamma,\r\n        E quando parte il sole, e quando riede,\r\n        Vi segua; come il can selvaggia damma.\r\n\r\n    Ch' io se nel cor vi cerco, altri noi vede,\r\n        E sol mi vanto di nascosa fiamma,\r\n        E sol mi glorio di secreta fede.[127]\r\n\r\n\"I yield not in love, O gentlest lady! to those who dare to show their\r\nlove more openly, though I conceal it within the centre of my heart, nor\r\nsuffer it to spread forth, like the other flowers of my spring. Let\r\nothers boast themselves subjects of love for your sake, and slaves of\r\nyour beauty, with admiring looks, with humble aspect, with sighs, with\r\neloquent words, with lofty verse! whether the winter freeze or the\r\nsummer burn,--at set of sun, and when he laughs again in heaven, let\r\nthem still pursue you, as dogs the shy and timid deer. But I--O, I seek\r\nyou in my own heart, where none else behold you! My hidden love be my\r\nonly boast: my secret faith, my only glory!\"\r\n\r\nWithout multiplying quotations, which would extend this sketch from\r\npages into volumes, it is sufficient to trace through Tasso's verses the\r\nlittle incidents which varied this romantic intercourse. The frequent\r\nindisposition of Leonora, her absence when she went to visit her\r\nbrother, the Cardinal d'Este, at Tivoli, form the subjects of several\r\nbeautiful little poems; as the Sonnets\r\n\r\n    Dianzi al vostro languir, &c.\r\n\r\n    Donna! poiche fortuna empia mi nega\r\n    Seguirvi, &c.\r\n\r\n    Al nobil colle, ove in antichi marmi\r\n    Di Greco mano opre famose ammira\r\n    Vaga LEONORA il mio pensier mi gira.\r\n\r\nHere he names her expressly; while in the little lament--\r\n\r\n    Lunge da voi, ben mio!\r\n    Non ho vita ne core! e non son io\r\n    Non sono, oime! non sono\r\n    Quel ch' altra volta fui, ma un Ombra mesta,\r\n    Un lagrimevol suono, &c.\r\n\r\n--the tone is too passionate to allow of it. He finds her looking up one\r\nnight at the stars; it is sufficient to inspire that beautiful little\r\nsong,\r\n\r\n    Mentre, mia stella, miri\r\n    I bei celesti giri,\r\n    Il cielo esser vorrei,\r\n    Perche negli occhi mici\r\n    Fiso tu rivolgessi\r\n    Le tue dolci faville;\r\n    Io vagheggiar potessi\r\n    Mille bellezze tue, con luci mille![128]\r\n\r\nHe relates, in another little madrigal, that standing alone with her in\r\na balcony, he chanced, perhaps in the eagerness of conversation, to\r\nextend his arm on hers. He asks pardon for the freedom, and she replies\r\nwith sweetness, \"You offended not by placing your arm there, but by\r\nwithdrawing it.\" This little speech in a coquette would have been _sans\r\nconsequence_; from such a woman as Leonora, it spoke volumes; and her\r\nlover felt it so. He breaks forth in a rapture at the tender\r\ncondescension,\r\n\r\n    O parolette amorose, &c.\r\n\r\nThen comes a cloud, but whether of temper or jealousy, we know not. One\r\nof those luckless trifles, perhaps,\r\n\r\n                  --that move\r\n    Dissension between hearts that love.\r\n\r\nTasso accompanied Lucrezia d'Este, then Duchess of Urbino, to her villa\r\nof Castel Durante, where he remained for some time, partaking in all the\r\namusements of her gay court, without once seeing Leonora. He then wrote\r\nto her, and the letter fortunately has been preserved entire.\r\n\r\nThough guarded in expression, it is throughout in the tone of a lover\r\npiqued, and yet conscious that he has himself offended; and seeking,\r\nwith a sort of proud humility, the reconciliation on which his happiness\r\ndepends. He sends her a sonnet, which he admits is \"far unlike the\r\nelegant effusions he supposes her now in the habit of receiving.\" He\r\nbegs to assure her, that though it be in art and wit as poor as he is\r\nhimself in happiness, yet in his present pitiable condition, he could do\r\nno better; (not that he was to all appearance so very much to be\r\npitied). He adds, \"do not think, however, that in this vacancy of\r\nthought, my heart has found leisure for love. The Sonnet is merely\r\ncomposed at the request of a certain poor lover, who has for some time\r\npast quarrelled with his mistress; and now no longer able to endure his\r\nhard fortune, is obliged to yield, and sue for grace and pardon.\" \"Il\r\nquale essendo stato un pezzo in colera con la sua donna, ora non potendo\r\npiu, bisogna che si renda e che dimanda merce.\" The Sonnet enclosed in\r\nthis letter, (\"Sdegno, debil Guerrier,\") appears to me one of the least\r\npleasing in the collection; as if his genius and his feelings were both\r\nunder some benumbing influence when he wrote it.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, there was a report that Leonora was about to be united\r\nto a foreign Prince. Her hand had been demanded of her brother with the\r\nusual formalities. On this occasion Tasso wrote the fine Canzone,\r\n\r\n    Amor, tu vedi, e non hai duolo o sdegno, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Love! canst thou look on without grief or indignation, to see my gentle\r\nlady bow her fair neck to the yoke of another?\"\r\n\r\nThe expression in the 6th strophe is very unequivocal--\r\n\r\n\"Nor let my mistress, though she suffer her bosom to be invaded by a\r\nnewer flame, forget the _former_ bond.\"\r\n\r\n      Ne la mia Donna, perche scaldi il petto\r\n    Di nuovo amore, nodo _antico_ sprezzi.\r\n\r\nIn one of his Sonnets, this jealous pain is yet more strongly\r\nexpressed:--\r\n\r\n    Io sparso, ed altri miete! &c.\r\n\r\n\"I sow, another reaps! I water a lovely blossom, unworthy, alas! to tend\r\nit; and another gathers the fruit. O rage!--yet must I, through coward\r\nfear, lock my grief within my own bosom!\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis intended marriage never took place; and Tasso, relieved from his\r\nfears, and restored to the confidence of Leonora, was again\r\ncomparatively blessed. He sometimes ventured to name her openly in his\r\npoems,--as in the little Madrigal,\r\n\r\n    Cantava in riva al fiume\r\n    Tirse di LEONORA,\r\n    E rispondean le selve, e l'onde, _onora_.\r\n\r\nSometimes he disguised her name as l'Aurora, l'Aura, Onor, le\r\nonora,[129]\r\n\r\n    Dell' Onor simulacro e'l nome vostro.\r\n\r\nTo these the preceding Madrigal is a sort of _key_; or the better to\r\nconceal the true object of his adoration, he carried his apparent\r\nhomage, and often his poetical gallantry, to the feet of other fair\r\nladies. Lucretia d'Este, the elder sister of Leonora; Tarquinia Molza, a\r\nbeauty and a poetess; and Lucretia Bendidio, another most accomplished\r\nwoman, who numbered all the poets and literati of Ferrara in her train,\r\nfrequently inspired him.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Lucretia Bendidio reminds me of an incident in Tasso's\r\nearly life, which, besides being characteristic of his times and genius,\r\nis extremely _apropos_ to my present purpose and subject. In the days of\r\nhis first enthusiasm for Lucretia, when he and Guarini were rivals for\r\nher favour, he undertook to maintain, publicly, fifty _theses_, or\r\ndifficult questions, in the \"Science of Love.\" These \"Conclusion!\r\namorosi\" may be found in the third volume of the great folio edition of\r\nhis works; and some of them, it must be confessed, afforded matter for\r\nmuch amusing and edifying discussion; for instance,--\"Amore esser piu\r\nnell' amata che nell' amante,\" \"that love exists rather in the person\r\nbeloved than in the lover,\" which seems to involve a nice distinction in\r\nmetaphysics; and \"Nessuna amata essere, o poter essere ingrata,\"--\"that\r\nno woman truly beloved, is or can be ungrateful,\" which involves a\r\nmystery--and a truth. And the 48th, \"Se piu si patisca, o non ricevendo\r\nalcun premio, o ricevendo minor del desiderio,\"--\"whether in love, it be\r\nharder to receive no recompense whatever, or less than we desire,\"--a\r\nquestion so difficult to settle, and so depending on individual feeling,\r\nthat it should have been put to the vote. Others prove, that whatever\r\nwas the practice in those days, the received and philosophical theory of\r\nlove was sublime enough; for instance, the 14th, \"That the more love is\r\nregulated by reason, the more noble it is in its nature.\" (Agreed to,\r\nwith exceptions, of which Tasso himself might furnish the most\r\nprominent.) That \"compassion in our sex is never a sign of reciprocal\r\naffection, but on the contrary.\" (True, generally.) The 34th, \"That the\r\nrespect of the lover for her he loves increases the value and delight of\r\nevery favour she grants him.\" (I think this must have passed undisputed,\r\nor by acclamation.)\r\n\r\nThe 38th of these curious propositions, \"L'uomo in sua natura amar piu\r\nintentamente e stabilmente che la donna,\"--that \"men by nature love more\r\nintensely and more permanently than women,\" was opposed by Signora\r\nOrsolina Cavaletta, a woman of singular accomplishments, and who\r\ndisplayed, in defence of her sex, so much wit and talent, such various\r\nlearning, ingenuity, and eloquence, that the young disputant, perhaps\r\nplaced in a dilemma between his honour and his gallantry, came very\r\nhardly off. This singular exhibition continued for three days, and was\r\nconducted with infinite solemnity, in presence of the Court and the\r\nPrincesses; all the nobility and even the superior clergy of Ferrara\r\ncrowded to witness it; and I doubt whether any lecture at the British\r\nInstitution, on mathematics, or electricity, or geology, was ever\r\nlistened to by our fair bas-bleus with half as much interest as Tasso's\r\n\"Fifty Theses on Love\" excited in Ferrara.\r\n\r\nSeveral years after his first introduction to Leonora d'Este, and after\r\nsome of the most impassioned and least ambiguous of his verses were\r\nwritten, the Court of Ferrara was embellished by the arrival of two of\r\nthe most beautiful women in all Italy,--Leonora di Sanvitali, Countess\r\nof Scandiano, then a youthful bride, and her not less lovely\r\nmother-in-law, Barbara, Countess of Sala. The Countess of Scandiano is\r\nthe _other_ LEONORA who has puzzled all the biographers, from the open\r\ngallantry and avowed adoration with which Tasso has celebrated her; but\r\nin strains,--O how different from the sentiment, the veneration, the\r\ntenderness, and the mystery which breathe through his verses to Leonora\r\nd'Este! A third Leonora was said to exist in the person of the\r\nCountess's favourite attendant: but this is untrue. The name of\r\nLeonora's waiting-maid was Laura. Tasso has addressed several little\r\npoems to her; and there can be no doubt that she occasionally served as\r\na blind to his real attachment for her mistress. The Countess of\r\nScandiano's attendant was the fair Olympia, to whom is addressed that\r\nexquisitely graceful Canzone,\r\n\r\n    O con le Grazie elette, e con gli amori.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Ferrara's maid, the beautiful Livia d'Arco, and even her\r\ndwarf, are also immortalised in Tasso's verses, who poured forth his\r\ncourtly gallantry with an exhaustless and splendid prodigality, fitting\r\ntheir praises to his lyre, as if it had never resounded to higher\r\nthemes.\r\n\r\nAt a court festival given by the Duke Alphonso, in honour of his\r\nbeautiful and illustrious visitors, the Countess of Sala appeared with\r\nher fine hair wreathed round her head in the form of a coronet, which\r\nwith her grand style of beauty and majestic deportment, gave her the air\r\nof a Juno. The young Countess of Scandiano, on the other hand, enchanted\r\nby her Hebe-like graces, her smiles, and the unequalled beauty of a\r\npouting underlip;--nothing was talked of at Ferrara but these braided\r\ntresses and this lovely lip; the poets and the young cavaliers were\r\ndivided into parties on the occasion. Tasso has celebrated both with the\r\nsame voluptuous elegance of style in which he described his Armida. To\r\nthe Countess of Scandiano he wrote,\r\n\r\n    Quel labbro, che le rose han colorito\r\n    Molle si sporge, e tumidetto in fuore, &c.\r\n\r\nTo the Countess of Sala,\r\n\r\n    Barbara! maraviglia de' tempi nostri.\r\n\r\nBut the Countess of Scandiano was more especially the object of his\r\npublic adoration. It was a poetical passion, openly professed; and\r\nflattering, as it appears, both to the lady and to her husband, without\r\nin any degree implicating either her discretion or that of Tasso.\r\nCompare his verses to this young Countess--this _peregrina Fenice_,[130]\r\nas he fancifully styles her, who comes shining forth, not _to be\r\nconsumed_, but _to consume_,--to the profound tenderness, the intense\r\nyet mournful feeling of some of the poems composed for the Princess\r\nd'Este, about the same time; when he must have daily contrasted the rich\r\nbloom, the smiling eyes, and sparkling graces of the youthful Countess,\r\nwith the fading or faded beauty, the languid form, and pale cheek of his\r\nlong-loved Leonora. See particularly the Sonnet\r\n\r\n    Tre gran Donne vid' io, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Three illustrious ladies did I behold,--I sung them all--_one only_ I\r\nloved,\" &c. And another equally beautiful and significant,\r\n\r\n    Perche 'n giovenil volto amor mi mostri\r\n      Talor, Donna _Real_, rose e ligustri\r\n      Oblio non pone in me, de' miei trilustri\r\n      Affanni, o de miei spesi indarno inchiostri.\r\n\r\n    E 'l cor, che s' invaghi degli onor vostri\r\n      Da prima, e vostro fu poscia piu lustri\r\n      Reserba, amo in se forme piu illustri\r\n      Che perle e gemme, e bei coralli ed ostri.\r\n\r\n    Queste egli in suono di sospir si chiari\r\n    Farebbe udir, che d' amorosa face\r\n    Accenderebbe i piu gelati cori.\r\n\r\n    Ma oltre suo costume e fatto avaro\r\n      De' vostri pregi, suoi dolci tesori,\r\n      Che in se medesmo gli vagheggia e _tace_!\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n    \"Albeit in younger faces Love at times\r\n      May show me where a fresher rose is set,\r\n      Yet, _Royal_ Lady, can I not forget\r\n      My fifteen years of pain and useless rhymes.\r\n    This heart, so touch'd by all thy beauty bright,\r\n      After so many years is still thine own,\r\n      And still retaineth forms more exquisite\r\n      Than pearls, or purple gems, or coral stone.\r\n    All this my heart in soft sighs would make known,\r\n      And thus with fire the coldest bosom fill,\r\n      But that, unlike itself, that heart hath grown\r\n    So covetous of thy sweet charms, and thee,\r\n      (Its secret treasures,) that it aye doth flee\r\n      Inwards, and dwells upon them, and is still.\"[131]\r\n\r\nLastly, that most perfect Sonnet, so well known and so celebrated, that\r\nI should not insert it here, but that I am enabled to give, for the\r\nfirst time, a translation equally faithful to the sentiment and the\r\npoetry of the original.\r\n\r\n    Negli anni acerbi tuoi, purpurea rosa\r\n      Sembravi tu, ch' ai rai tepidi, all' ora\r\n      Non apre 'l sen, ma nel suo verde ancora\r\n      Verginella s' asconde, e vergognosa.\r\n\r\n    O piu tosto parei (che mortal cosa,\r\n      Non s' assomiglia a te) celeste Aurora,\r\n      Che le campagne imperla, e i monti indora,\r\n      Lucida in ciel sereno e rugiadosa.\r\n\r\n    Or la men verde eta nulla a te toglie;\r\n      Ne te, benche negletta, in manto adorno\r\n      Giovinetta belta vince, o pareggia.\r\n\r\n    Cosi piu vago e 'l fior, poiche le foglie\r\n      Spiega odorate: e 'l sol nel mezzo giorno\r\n      Vie-piu, che nel mattin, luce e fiammeggia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou, in thy unripe years, wast like the rose,\r\n      Which shrinketh from the summer dawn, afraid,\r\n      And with her green veil, like a bashful maid,\r\n    Hideth her bosom sweet, and scarcely blows:\r\n    Or rather,--(for what shape ever arose\r\n      From the dull earth like thee,) thou didst appear\r\n      Heavenly Aurora, who, when skies are clear,\r\n    Her dewy pearls o'er all the country sows.\r\n      Time stealeth nought: thy rare and careless grace\r\n    Surpasseth still the youthful bride when neatest,--\r\n      Her wealth of dress, her budding blooming face,\r\n    So is the full-blown rose for age the sweetest,\r\n      So doth the mid-day sun outshine the morn,\r\n      With rays more beautiful and brighter born!\"[132]\r\n\r\nYet all this was too little. His minor lyrics, the unlaboured and\r\nspontaneous effusions of leisure, of fancy, of sentiment, would have\r\nbeen glory enough for any other poet, and fame enough for any other\r\nwoman: but Tasso had founded his hopes of immortality on his great poem,\r\nThe Jerusalem Delivered; and it was imperfect in his eyes unless Leonora\r\nwere shrined in it. To convert the pale, gentle, elegant invalid into a\r\nheroine, seemed impossible: she was no model for his lovely amazon,\r\nClorinda; nor his exquisite sorceress, Armida; nor his love-sick\r\nErminia: for her, therefore, and to her honour, and to the eternal\r\nmemory of his love for her, he composed the episode in the second Canto,\r\nwhere we have her portrait at full length as Sophronia.\r\n\r\n    Vergine era fra lor, di gia matura\r\n      Verginita, d'alta pensieri e regi,\r\n      D'alta Belta; ma sua belta non cura,\r\n      O tanto sol quant' onesta sen fregi;\r\n      E 'l suo pregio maggior che tra le mura\r\n      D'angusta casa, asconde i suoi gran pregi:\r\n      E da' vagheggiatori ella s'invola,\r\n      Alle lodi, agli sguardi, inculta e sola.\r\n\r\n    Non sai ben dir s'adorno, o se negletta,\r\n      Se caso od arte, il bel volto compose,\r\n      Di natura, d'amor, di cieli amici,\r\n      Le negligenze sue sono artifici.\r\n\r\n    Mirata da ciascun, passa, e non mira\r\n      L'altera donna!\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n    Among them dwelt a noble maid, matured\r\n    In loveliness, of thoughts serene and high,\r\n    And loftiest beauty;--beauty which herself\r\n    Esteem'd not more than modesty might own.\r\n    Within an humble dwelling did she hide\r\n    Her peerless charms, and shunning lovers' eyes,\r\n    From flattering words and glances, lived retired.\r\n\r\n    Whether 'tis curious care, or sweet neglect,\r\n    Or chance, or art, that have array'd her thus,\r\n    One scarce can tell: for each unstudied grace\r\n    Has been the work of Nature, heaven, and love.\r\n\r\n    And thus admired by all, unheeding all,\r\n    Forth steps the noble maid.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to mistake, in this finished and exquisite portrait,\r\nthe matured beauty, the negligent attire, and love of solitude which\r\ncharacterised Leonora: the resemblance was so perfect, as to be\r\nuniversally recognised and acknowledged. But is it not, as M. Ginguene\r\nremarks, equally certain that Tasso has pourtrayed himself as Olindo?\r\n\r\n        Ei che modesto e, com' essa e bella,\r\n        Brama, assai, poco spera, nulla chiede!\r\n\r\n    He, full of modesty and truth,\r\n    Loved much, hoped little, and desired nought!\r\n\r\nHas he not in the verse\r\n\r\n    Ed o mia morte avventurosa appiena,\r\n\r\nbreathed forth all the smothered passion of his soul?--\r\n\r\n    Ed o mia morte avventurosa appiena!\r\n    Oh fortunati miei dolci martiri!\r\n    S'impetrero che giunto seno a seno\r\n    L'anima mia nella tuo bocca io spiri,\r\n    E venendo tu meco a un tempo meno\r\n    In me fuor mandi gli ultimi sospiri!\r\n\r\n    And O! how happy were my death! how blest\r\n    These tortures,--could I but the meed obtain,\r\n    That breast to breast, and lip to lip, our souls\r\n    Might flee together, and our latest sighs\r\n    Mingle in death.\r\n\r\nThis episode is critically a defect in the poem: it seems to stand\r\nalone, unconnected in any way with the main action; he acknowledged\r\nthis; but he absolutely, and obstinately, refused to alter it, or strike\r\nit out. He, who was in general amenable to criticism, even to a degree\r\nof weakness, willed that it should stand an everlasting monument of his\r\ntenderness, and of the virtues and the charms of her who inspired\r\nit:--and thus it has been.\r\n\r\nA cruel, and, as I think, a most unjust imputation rests on the memory\r\nof the Princess Leonora. She is accused of cold-heartedness, in\r\nsuffering Tasso to remain so long imprisoned, without interceding in his\r\nfavour, or even vouchsafing any reply to his affecting supplications for\r\nrelease, and for her mediation in his behalf. The excuse alledged by\r\nthose who would fain excuse her,--\"That she feared to compromise herself\r\nby any interference,\" is ten times worse than the accusation itself. But\r\nthough there exists, I suppose, no _written_ proof that Leonora pleaded\r\nthe cause of Tasso, or sought to mitigate his sufferings; neither is\r\nthere any proof of the contrary. We know little, or rather nothing, of\r\nthe private intrigues of Alphonso's palace: we have no \"memoires\r\nsecretes\" of that day; no diaries kept by prying courtiers, to enlighten\r\nus on what passed in the recesses of the royal apartments: and upon mere\r\nnegative presumption, shall we brand the character of a woman, who\r\nappears on every other occasion so blameless, so tender-hearted, and\r\nbeneficent, with the imputation of such barbarous selfishness? for the\r\nhonour of our sex, and human nature, I must believe it impossible.\r\n\r\nIn no other instance was the homage which Tasso loved to pay to\r\nhigh-born beauty repaid with ingratitude; all his life he seems to have\r\nbeen an object of affectionate interest to women. They, in his misery,\r\nstood not aloof, but ministered to him the oil and balm, which soothed\r\nhis vexed and distempered spirit. The Countesses of Sala and Scandiano\r\nnever forgot him. Lucretia Bendidio, who had married into the\r\nMarchiavelli family, sent him in his captivity all the consolation she\r\ncould bestow, or he receive. The Duchess of Urbino (Lucretia d'Este,)\r\nwas munificently kind to him. The young Princess of Mantua, she for whom\r\nhe wrote his \"Torrismondo,\" loaded him with courtesy and proofs of her\r\nregard. He was ill at the Court of Mantua, after his release from\r\nFerrara; and her exertions to procure him a copy of Euripides, which he\r\nwished to consult, (an anecdote cited somewhere, as a proof of the\r\nrarity of the book at that time,) is also a proof of the interest and\r\nattention with which she regarded him. It happened when he was at the\r\nCourt of the Duke of Urbino, that he had to undergo a surgical\r\noperation; and the sister of the Duke, the young and beautiful Lavinia\r\ndi Rovera, prepared the bandages, and applied them with her own fair and\r\nprincely hands;--a little instance of affectionate interest, which Tasso\r\nhas himself commemorated. If then we do not find Leonora publicly\r\nappearing as the benefactress of Tasso, and using her influence over her\r\nbrother in his behalf, is it not a presumption that she was implicated\r\nin his punishment? What comfort or kindness she could have granted,\r\nmust, under such circumstances, have been bestowed with infinite\r\nprecaution; and, from gratitude and discretion, as carefully concealed.\r\nWe know, that after the first year of his confinement, Tasso was removed\r\nto a less gloomy prison; and we know that Leonora died a few weeks\r\nafterwards; but what share she might have had in procuring this\r\nmitigation of his suffering, we do not know; nor how far the fate of\r\nTasso might have affected her so as to hasten her own death. If we are\r\nto argue upon probabilities, without any preponderating proof, in the\r\nname of womanhood and charity, let it be on the side of indulgence; let\r\nus not believe Leonora guilty, but upon such authority as never has\r\nbeen,--and I trust never can be produced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout two years after the completion of the Jerusalem Delivered, and\r\nfour years after the first representation of the Aminta;--when all\r\nEurope rung with the poet's fame, Tasso fled from the Court of Ferrara,\r\nin a fit of distraction. His frenzy was caused partly by religious\r\nhorrors and scruples; partly by the petty but accumulated injuries which\r\nmalignity and tyranny had heaped upon him; partly by a long-indulged and\r\nhopeless passion; and with these, other moral and physical causes\r\ncombined. He fled, to hide himself and his sorrows in the arms of his\r\nsister Cornelia. The brother and sister had not met since their childish\r\nyears; and Tasso, wild with misery, forlorn, and penniless, knew not\r\nwhat reception he was to meet with. When arrived within a league of his\r\nbirthplace, Sorrento,[133] he changed clothes with a shepherd, and in\r\nthis disguise appeared before his sister, as one sent with tidings of\r\nher brother's misfortunes. The recital, we may believe, was not coldly\r\ngiven. Cornelia, who appears to have inherited with the personal beauty,\r\nthe sensibility and strong domestic affections of her mother,\r\nPortia,[134] was so violently agitated by the eloquence of the feigned\r\nmessenger, that she fainted away; and Tasso was obliged to hasten the\r\ndenouement by discovering himself. In the same moment he was clasped in\r\nher affectionate arms, and bathed with her tears. How often, when I have\r\nstood on my balcony at Naples, have I looked towards the white buildings\r\nof Sorrento, glittering afar upon the distant promontory, and thought\r\nupon this scene! and felt, how that which is already surpassingly\r\nbeautiful to the eye, may be hallowed to the imagination by such\r\nremembrances as these!\r\n\r\nTasso resided with his sister for three years, the object of her\r\nunwearied and tender attention. It was on his return to Ferrara,\r\n(recalled, as Manso says, by the tenor of Leonora's letters[135]) that\r\nhe was imprisoned as a lunatic at St. Anne's. They show to travellers\r\nthe cell in which he was confined. Over the entrance of the gallery\r\nleading to it, is written up in large letters, \"Ingresso alla Prigione\r\ndi Torquato Tasso,\" as if to blazon, in the eye of the stranger, what is\r\nat once the renown and disgrace of that fallen city. The cell itself is\r\nsmall, dark and low. The abhorred grate,\r\n\r\n    Marring the sun-beams with its hideous shade,\r\n\r\nis a semicircular window, strongly cross-barred with iron; it looks into\r\na court-yard, so built up, if I remember rightly, that the noon-day sun\r\ncould scarce reach it. Even without the hallowed associations connected\r\nwith the spot, it would have chilled and saddened me. With them, the\r\nvery air had a suffocating weight; and the cold dark walls, and\r\nlow-bowed roof, struck a shivering awe through the blood. Upon the\r\nplaster outside the grated window, I observed several names written in\r\npencil; among the rest, those of Byron and Rogers. I must observe here,\r\nthat the \"Lament of Tasso\" is, in fact, a cento taken from Tasso's minor\r\npoems. Almost every sentiment there expressed, may be found in the\r\nItalian; but the soul of the poet has been transfused with such a\r\nglowing impulse into its new mould, it never seems to have been adapted\r\nto another; the precious metal is the same, only the impress is\r\ndifferent, and it has been stamped by a kindred and a master spirit.\r\nLord Byron says,\r\n\r\n    Yes, Leonora! it shall be our fate\r\n    To be entwined for ever; but too late!\r\n\r\nTasso had said, that his name and that of Leonora should be united and\r\nsoar to fame together.\r\n\r\n                  \"Ella a miei versi, ed io\r\n    Circondava al suo nome altere piume,\r\n    E l'un per l'altro ando volando a prova;\"\r\n\r\n--and a long list of corresponding passages and sentiments might easily\r\nbe pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the door of Tasso's cell, _lies_, I believe, like\r\nmany other inscriptions. Tasso was _not_ confined in this cell for seven\r\nyears; but here it was that he addressed that affecting Canzone to\r\nLeonora and her sister Lucrezia, which begins \"Figlie di\r\nRenata,\"--\"daughters of Renee!\" Thus in the very commencement, by this\r\ndelicate and tender apostrophe, bespeaking their compassion, by\r\nawakening the remembrance of their mother, like him so long a wretched\r\nprisoner. He reminds them of the years he spent at their side--\"their\r\nnoble servant and their dear companion,\"\r\n\r\n    Gli anni miei tra voi spese,--\r\n    Qual son,--qual fui,--che chiedo--ove mi trovo![136]\r\n\r\nHe was, after the first year, removed to a larger cell, with better\r\naccommodations. Here he made a collection of his smaller poems lately\r\nwritten, and dedicated them to the two Princesses. But Leonora was no\r\nlonger in a state to be charmed by the verses, or flattered or touched\r\nby the admiring devotion of her lover,--her poet,--her faithful\r\nservant: she was dying. A slow and cureless disease preyed on her\r\ndelicate frame, and she expired in the second year of Tasso's\r\nimprisonment. When the news of her danger was brought to him, he\r\nrequested his friend Pignarola to kiss her hand in his name, and ask her\r\nwhether there was any thing which, in his sad state, he could do for her\r\nease or pleasure? We do not know how this tender message was received or\r\nanswered; but it was too late. Leonora died in February 1581, after\r\nlingering from the November previous.\r\n\r\nThus perished, of a premature decay, the woman who had been for\r\nseventeen years the idol of a poet's imagination--the worship of a\r\npoet's heart; she who was not unworthy of being enshrined in the rich\r\ntracery-work of sweet thoughts and bright fancies she had herself\r\nsuggested. The love of Tasso for the Princess Leonora might have\r\nappeared, in his own time, something like the \"desire of the night-moth\r\nfor the star;\" but what is it _now_? what was it _then_ in the eyes of\r\nher whom he adored? How far was it permitted, encouraged, repaid in\r\nsecret? This we cannot know; and perhaps had we lived at the time,--in\r\nthe very Court, and looked daily into her own soft eyes, practised to\r\nconceal,--we had been no wiser. Yet one more observation.\r\n\r\nWhen Leonora died, all the poets of Ferrara pressed forward with the\r\nusual tribute of elegy and eulogium; but the voice of Tasso was not\r\nheard among the rest. He alone flung no garland on the bier of her,\r\nwhose living brow he had wreathed with the brightest flowers of song.\r\nThis is adduced by Serassi as a proof that he had never loved her.\r\nGinguene himself can only account for it, by the presumption that he was\r\npiqued by that coldness and neglect, which I have shown was merely\r\nsupposititious. Strange reasoning! as if Tasso, while his heart bled\r\nover his loss, in his solitary cell, could have deigned to join this\r\ncrowd of courtly mourners! as if, under such circumstances, in such a\r\nmoment, the greatness of his grief could have burst forth in any terms\r\nthat must not have exposed himself to fresh rigours, and the fame, at\r\nleast the discretion, of her he had loved, to suspicion! No! nothing\r\nremained to him but silence;--and he was silent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] See the Rinaldo, c. 8.\r\n\r\n[121]\r\n\r\n            ----From my very birth\r\n    My soul was drunk with love, &c.\r\n\r\n                     LAMENT OF TASSO.\r\n\r\n[122]\r\n\r\n    Rose, che l' arte invidiosa mira. &c.\r\n\r\n[123]\r\n\r\n    Alteremente umile\r\n    Te chiudi ne' tuoi cari alti soggiorni.\r\n\r\n[124] The daughter of Louis XII.

We can think of them as pressing, though at an\r\ninterval of many years, the same friendly hand, and gracing the same\r\nhospitable board with \"colloquy sublime.\" Tasso, from the romance of his\r\nstory, and his personal character, is the most interesting of the two;\r\nyet Milton, besides standing highest in the scale of moral dignity, sits\r\nnearest to our hearts as an Englishman, whose genius, speaking through\r\nour native accents, strikes upon our sense,\r\n\r\n    Like the large utterance of the early gods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe rise from reading Johnson's Biography of Milton, either with the most\r\npainful and indignant feeling of the malignity of the critic,[137] or\r\nwith an impression of Milton's character, as false as it is odious. Of\r\nmoral inconsistency and weakness, blended with splendid genius, we have\r\nproofs lamentable and numerous enough: to be obliged to regard the\r\nmighty father of English verse,--him \"who rode sublime upon the seraph\r\nwings of ecstasy,\"--him, whose harmonious soul was tuned to the music\r\nof the spheres, though when struck in evil times, and by an adverse\r\nhand, it sent forth a crash of discord,--him, who has left us the most\r\nexquisite pictures of tenderness and beauty--to think of such a being as\r\na petty domestic tyrant, a coarse-minded fanatic, stern and unfeeling in\r\nall the relations of life, were enough to confound all our ideas of\r\nmoral fitness. When we figure to ourselves the author of Rasselas\r\ntrampling over the ashes of Milton, lending his mighty powers to degrade\r\nthe majestic, to disfigure the beautiful, and to darken the glorious, it\r\nis with the same feeling of concentrated disgust with which we recall\r\nthe violation of the poet's grave, some years ago, when vulgar savages\r\ndefaced and carried off his sacred and venerable remains\r\npiece-meal.[138] Let us for a moment imagine our Milton descending to\r\nearth to assert his injured fame, and confronted with his great\r\nbiographer--\r\n\r\n    Look here upon this picture, and on this--\r\n\r\nThe one, like his own Adam, with fair large front and hyacinthine locks,\r\nserene and blooming as his own Eden; in all the dignified graces which\r\ntemperance and self-conquest lend to youth,[139] in all the purity of\r\nhis stainless mind, radiant like another Moses, with the reflected\r\nglories of the Empyreum,--and then look upon the other!--But it is an\r\nawful thing for little people, to meddle with great and sacred names;\r\nand so leaving the Hippopotamus of literature in his den--proceed we.\r\n\r\nIt relieves the heart from an oppressive contradiction to behold Milton,\r\nsuch as he is represented by his other biographers, and such as\r\nundoubtedly he really was. It is well known, that in his youth, and\r\neven at a late age, he had an uncommonly fine person, almost to\r\neffeminacy; and was as gracefully endowed in form and manners, as he was\r\nhighly and holily gifted in mind. His natural mildness, cheerfulness,\r\nand courtesy, are commemorated by all who knew him, or lived near his\r\ntime.[140] He whom Johnson accuses of a \"Turkish contempt of females, as\r\ninferior beings,\" and whom he represents in a light so ungentle and\r\ngloomy, that we cannot imagine him under the influence of beauty, was\r\nearly touched by the softest passions, and during his whole life\r\npeculiarly sensible to the charm of female society: witness his\r\nsuccessive marriages, and his friendship and intercourse with Lady\r\nMargaret Ley, and the all-accomplished Countess of Ranelagh, who\r\nsupplied to him, as he says, the place of every friend:[141]--witness,\r\ntoo, a thousand most lovely and glorious passages scattered through his\r\nworks, which women may quote with triumph, as proofs that we had no\r\nsmall influence over the imagination of our great epic poet. What but\r\nthe most reverential and lofty feeling of the graces and virtues proper\r\nto our sex, could have embodied such an exquisite vision as the Lady in\r\nComus? or created his delightful Eve? on whom, \"as on a queen, a pomp of\r\nwinning graces waited still.\"\r\n\r\n    All higher knowledge in her presence falls\r\n    Degraded; wisdom, in discourse with her,\r\n    Loses discountenanc'd, and like folly shows;\r\n    Authority and reason on her wait,\r\n    As one intended first, not after made\r\n    Occasionally; and to consummate all,\r\n    Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat,\r\n    Build in her loveliest, and create an awe\r\n    About her, as a guard angelic plac'd.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the being whom a lady-author calls a \"great overgrown baby,\r\nwith nothing to recommend her but her submission, and her fine\r\nhair!\"[142]--two things, be it observed, among the most graceful of our\r\nfeminine attributes, mental and exterior. The poet who conceived and\r\nwrote this description, most assuredly had not a \"Turkish contempt\" for\r\nthe female character.\r\n\r\nMilton was in love, as he tells us himself, at nineteen; but the object\r\ncannot even be guessed at. He has celebrated this boyish passion very\r\nbeautifully in one of his Latin elegies. One of the passages in this\r\npoem, in which he compares the effect produced on him by the first\r\nmomentary view of his mistress, followed by her immediate absence to the\r\nTheban Oeclides,[143] swallowed up by the abyss which opens beneath\r\nhim, and gazing back upon the parting light of day, is admired for its\r\nclassic sublimity and appropriate beauty.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition mentioned by all his biographers, that while Milton\r\nwas a student at Cambridge, an Italian lady of rank, who was travelling\r\nin England, found him sleeping one day under the shade of a tree, and,\r\nstruck with his beauty, wrote with her pencil on a slip of paper, the\r\npretty madrigal of Guarini, which Menage translated for Madame de\r\nSevigne, \"Occhi, stelle mortali,\" and leaving it in his hand, pursued\r\nher journey. This fair unknown is said to have been the cause of\r\nMilton's travels into Italy; but the story rests on no authority: and it\r\nis clear, that the \"foreign fair\" to whom the Sonnets are addressed, was\r\nneither imaginary nor unknown. During his stay at Rome, he was received\r\nwith particular distinction by the Cardinal Barberini, the nephew of the\r\nreigning Pope, and at his palace had frequent opportunities of hearing\r\nLeonora Baroni, the finest singer in Italy. She was the daughter of\r\nAdriana of Mantua, surnamed, for her beauty, La Bella Adriana, and the\r\nbest singer and player on the lute of her time. Leonora inherited her\r\nmother's extraordinary talent for music, and conquered all hearts by the\r\ninexpressible charm of her voice and style. She was also a poetess,\r\nfrequently composing the words of her own songs. Though not a regular\r\nbeauty, she had brilliant eyes, and a captivating countenance and\r\nmanner. Count Fulvio Testi, in a Sonnet addressed to her, celebrates the\r\nunion of so many charms:\r\n\r\n    Tra il concento e 'l fulgor, dubbio e se sia\r\n    L'udir piu dolce, o il rimirar piu caro.\r\n    Deh fammi cieco, o fammi sordo, amore!\r\n\r\nM. Maugars, himself a musician, who saw and heard Leonora at Rome,\r\npraises her talents generally, and adds, that she was no coquette; that\r\nshe sang with confidence, but with modesty; that there was nothing in\r\nher manners that could be censured; that the effect she produced on\r\nthose who heard her, was owing, not only to the wonderful rapidity and\r\ndelicacy of her execution, but to the care with which she gave the exact\r\nsense and proper expression of the words she sang. He tells us, that on\r\none occasion, she _favoured_ him by singing with her mother and her\r\nsister, each accompanying herself on a different instrument (in those\r\ndays pianos were not, and Leonora's favourite instrument was the\r\nTheorbo, on which she excelled). This little concert so enraptured our\r\nmusician, that, to use his own words, he forgot his mortality, \"et crut\r\netre deja parmi les anges, jouissant des contentemens des bienheureux.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the charms and talents which exalted this prosaic\r\nFrenchman almost into a poet, should turn the heads of poets themselves.\r\nThe verses addressed to Leonora were collected into a volume, and\r\npublished under the title of \"Applausi poetici alle glorie della Signora\r\nLeonora Baroni.\"--\"Poetical eulogies to the glory of Signora Leonora\r\nBaroni.\" A similar homage had been paid to her mother, Adriana, who\r\nreckoned Tasso among her panegyrists. This may seem too high a\r\ndistinction for a species of talent, which, however admirable, can leave\r\nbehind no durable monument, and therefore can claim no interest with\r\nposterity. Yet is it just, that those whom heaven has enriched with the\r\ngift of melody, and who have cultivated that delicious faculty to its\r\nheight, until with angel-skill they can suspend the dominion of pain in\r\naching hearts,[144]--that such should ravish with delight a whole\r\ngeneration, and then perish from the earth, they and their memory, with\r\nthe pleasure they bestowed, and gratitude be voiceless and tuneless in\r\ntheir praise? The gift of song is fleeting as that of beauty; but while\r\nthe painter fixes on his canvas\r\n\r\n    The vermeil-tinctur'd lip,\r\n    Love-darting eyes, and tresses like the morn,\r\n\r\nwhat shall immortalise the tones which \"turned sense to soul?\" what but\r\npoetry, which, while it preserves the memory of such excellence, gives\r\nback to the fancy some reflection of the delight we have felt, when the\r\nfull tide of a divine voice is poured forth to the sense, like wine from\r\nan enchanted cup, making us thrill \"with music's pulse in every artery.\"\r\nLeonora Baroni had her poets, and her name, linked with that of Milton,\r\nshall never die.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious circumstance, and one but little consonant with the\r\npopular idea of Milton's austerity, that the object of his poetical\r\nhomage, and even of his serious admiration, was an Italian singer; but\r\nit must be remembered, that Milton, the son of an accomplished\r\nmusician,[145] was, by nature and education, peculiarly susceptible to\r\nthe power of sweet sounds. Next to poetry, music was with him a passion;\r\nand the profession of a singer in those days, when the art was in its\r\nsecond infancy, was more highly estimated, in proportion as excellence\r\nwas more rare and less publicly exhibited. I cannot find that either\r\nLeonora Baroni, or her mother Adriana, ever appeared on a stage; yet\r\ntheir celebrity had spread from one end of Italy to the other. Milton\r\njoined the crowd of Leonora's votaries at Rome, and has expressed his\r\nenthusiastic admiration, not only in verse but in prose.[146] He\r\naddressed her in Latin and Italian, the languages she understood, and\r\nwhich he had perfectly at command. In one of his Latin poems, \"To\r\nLeonora, singing at Rome,\" the allusion to Leonora d'Este,\r\n\r\n    Another Leonora once inspired\r\n    Tasso, by hopeless love to phrenzy fired, &c.\r\n\r\nis as happy as it is beautiful, and shows the belief which then\r\nprevailed of the real cause of Tasso's delirium.\r\n\r\nTwo of Milton's Italian sonnets are very beautiful, and have been\r\ntranslated by Cowper with singular felicity. All his biographers agree\r\nthat Leonora Baroni is the subject of both; the first, addressed to\r\nCarlo Diodati, describes the lady, whose dark and foreign charms are\r\nopposed to those of the _blonde_ beauties he had admired in his youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET.\r\n\r\n    _Diodati! e te 'l diro con maraviglia, &c._\r\n\r\n    Charles,--and I say it wondering,--thou must know\r\n    That I, who once assumed a scornful air,\r\n    And scoffed at Love, am fallen into his snare;\r\n    (Full many an upright man has fallen so.)\r\n    Yet think me not thus dazzled by the flow\r\n    Of golden locks, or damask rose; more rare\r\n    The heartfelt beauties of my foreign fair!\r\n    A mien majestic, with dark brows, that show\r\n    The tranquil lustre of a lofty mind,--\r\n    Words exquisite, of idioms more than one;\r\n    And song, whose fascinating power might bind,\r\n    And from her sphere draw down the lab'ring moon;\r\n    With such fire-darting eyes, that should I fill\r\n    Mine ears with wax, she would enchant me still!\r\n\r\nIn this translation, though elegant and faithful, the lines\r\n\r\n    A mien majestic, with dark brows, that show\r\n    The tranquil lustre of a lofty mind,\r\n\r\nhave much diluted the energy of Milton's\r\n\r\n    Portamenti alti onesti, e nelle ciglia\r\n    Quel sereno fulgor d'amabil nero.\r\n\r\nIn the other Sonnet, addressed to Leonora, he gives, with all the\r\nsimplicity of conscious worth, this lofty description of himself, and of\r\nhis claims to her preference.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET.\r\n\r\n    _Giovane, piano, e semplicetto amante, &c._\r\n\r\n    Enamour'd, artless, young, on foreign ground,\r\n    Uncertain whither from myself to fly,\r\n    To thee, dear lady, with an humble sigh,\r\n    Let me devote my heart, which I have found,\r\n    By certain proofs not few, intrepid, sound,\r\n    Good, and addicted to conceptions high:\r\n    When tempests shake the world, and fire the sky,\r\n    It rests in adamant, self-wrapt around,\r\n    As safe from envy and from outrage rude,\r\n    From hopes and fears that vulgar minds abuse,\r\n    As fond of genius and fixt solitude,\r\n    Of the resounding lyre and every muse.\r\n    Weak you will find it in one only part,\r\n    Now pierc'd by Love's immedicable dart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMilton was three times married. The relations of his first wife, (Mary\r\nPowell,) who were violent Royalists, and ashamed or afraid of their\r\nconnection with a republican, persuaded her to leave him. She\r\nabsolutely forsook her husband for nearly three years, and resided with\r\nher family at Oxford, when that city was the head-quarters of the King's\r\nparty. \"I have so much charity for her,\" says Aubrey, \"that she might\r\nnot wrong his bed; but what man (especially contemplative,) would like\r\nto have a young wife environed and stormed by the sons of Mars, and\r\nthose of the ennemie partie?\"\r\n\r\nMilton, though a suspicion of the nature hinted at by Aubrey never rose\r\nin his mind, was justly incensed at this dereliction. He was on the\r\npoint of divorcing this contumacious bride, and had already made choice\r\nof another[147] to succeed her, when she threw herself, impromptu, at\r\nhis feet and implored his forgiveness. He forgave her; and when the\r\nrepublican party triumphed, the family who had so cruelly wronged him\r\nfound a refuge in his house. This woman embittered his life for fourteen\r\nor fifteen years.\r\n\r\nA remembrance of the reconciliation with his wife, and of his own\r\nfeelings on that occasion, are said to have suggested to Milton's mind\r\nthe beautiful scene between Adam and Eve, in the tenth book of the\r\nParadise Lost.\r\n\r\n    She ended weeping; and her lowly plight,\r\n    Immoveable, till peace obtained for faults\r\n    Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought\r\n    Commiseration; soon his heart relented\r\n    Tow'rds her, his life so late and sole delight,\r\n    Now at his feet submissive in distress,\r\n    Creature so fair, his reconcilement seeking;\r\n    As one disarmed, his anger all he lost, &c.\r\n\r\nMilton's second and most beloved wife (Catherine Woodcock) died in\r\nchild-bed, within a year after their marriage. He honoured her memory\r\nwith what Johnson (out upon him!) calls a _poor_ sonnet; it is the one\r\nbeginning\r\n\r\n    Methought I saw my late espoused saint\r\n    Brought to me, like Alcestis from the grave;\r\n\r\nwhich, in its solemn and tender strain of feeling and modulated harmony,\r\nreminds us of Dante. He never ceased to lament her, and to cherish her\r\nmemory with a fond regret:--she must have been full in his heart and\r\nmind when he wrote those touching lines in the Paradise Lost--\r\n\r\n    How can I live without thee? how forego\r\n    Thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined,\r\n    To live again in these wild woods forlorn?\r\n    Should God create another Eve, and I\r\n    Another rib afford, yet loss of thee\r\n    Would never from my heart!\r\n\r\nAfter her death,--blind, disconsolate, and helpless--he was abandoned to\r\npetty wrongs and domestic discord; and suffered from the disobedience\r\nand unkindness of his two elder daughters, like another Lear.[148] His\r\nyoungest daughter, Deborah, was the only one who acted as his\r\namanuensis, and she always spoke of him with extreme affection:--on\r\nbeing suddenly shown his picture, twenty years after his death, she\r\nburst into tears.[149]\r\n\r\nThese three daughters were grown up, and the youngest about fifteen,\r\nwhen Milton married his third wife, Elizabeth Minshull. She was a\r\ngentle, kind-hearted woman,[150] without pretensions of any kind, who\r\nwatched over his declining years with affectionate care. One biographer\r\nhas not scrupled to assert, that to her,--or rather to her tender\r\nreverence for his studious habits, and to the peace and comfort she\r\nbrought to his heart and home,--we owe the Paradise Lost: if true, what\r\na debt immense of endless gratitude is due to the memory of this\r\nunobtrusive and amiable woman!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[137] What Dr. Johnson _wrote_ is known;--he was accustomed to _say_\r\nthat the admiration expressed for Milton was all _cant_.\r\n\r\n[138] I have before me the pamphlet, entitled \"A Narrative of the\r\ndisinterment of Milton's coffin, on Wednesday the 4th of August, 1790,\r\nand of the treatment of the Corpse during that and the following day.\"\r\nThe circumstances are too revolting to be dwelt upon.\r\n\r\n[139] Si les Anges, (said Madame de Stael) n'ont pas ete representes\r\nsous les traits de femme, c'est parceque l'union de la force avec la\r\npurete, est plus belle et plus celeste encore que la modestie meme la\r\nplus parfaite dans un etre faible.\r\n\r\n[140] See his life by Dr. Symmons, Dr. Todd, Newton, Hayley, Aubrey,\r\nRichardson, Warton.\r\n\r\n\"She (his daughter Deborah) spoke of him with great tenderness; she said\r\nhe was delightful company, the life of the conversation, and that on\r\naccount of a flow of subject, and an unaffected cheerfulness and\r\ncivility,\" &c.--RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n[141] She was Catherine Boyle, the daughter of the Great Earl of Cork,\r\none of the most excellent and most distinguished women of that\r\ntime.--_See Hayley's Life of Milton._\r\n\r\n[142] Miss Letitia Hawkins.\r\n\r\n[143] Otherwise Amphiaraus: his story is told by Ovid.

She possessed\r\n(according to Philips) both wit and beauty. A novelist could hardly\r\nimagine circumstances more singularly distressing to sensibility than\r\nthe situation of the poet, if, as we may reasonably conjecture, he was\r\ndeeply enamoured of this lady; if her father was inclined to accept him\r\nas a son-in-law, and the object of his love had no inclination to reject\r\nhis suit, but what arose from a dread of his being indissolubly mated to\r\nanother.\"--_Life of Milton_, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[148]\r\n\r\n    --I, dark in light, exposed\r\n    To daily fraud, contempt, abuse, and wrong,\r\n    Within doors or without, still as a fool\r\n    In power of others, never in my own, &c.\r\n\r\n                     SAMSON AGONISTES.\r\n\r\n[149] Todd's Life of Milton--See also Milton's Will, which has been\r\nlately recovered, and published by Warton.\r\n\r\n[150] Aubrey's Letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\nPRINTED BY S.
