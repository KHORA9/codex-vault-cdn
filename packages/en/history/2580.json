But on going further\r\ninto the interior in quest of the statue, a priest of grave aspect,\r\nadvancing to meet you and chanting a hymn in the Egyptian tongue,\r\nslightly raises a veil to show you the god. And what do you behold? A\r\ncrocodile, or some indigenous serpent, or other dangerous animal, the\r\nEgyptian god being a beast sprawling on a purple carpet.\"\r\n\r\nWe need not visit Egypt or go so far back in history to encounter\r\ncrocodile worship, as this can be readily found in France at the end\r\nof the last century.--Unfortunately, a hundred years is too long an\r\ninterval, too far away, for an imaginative retrospect of the past. At\r\nthe present time, standing where we do and regarding the horizon behind\r\nus, we see only forms which the intervening atmosphere embellishes,\r\nshimmering contours which each spectator may interpret in his own\r\nfashion; no distinct, animated figure, but merely a mass of moving\r\npoints, forming and dissolving in the midst of picturesque architecture.\r\nI was anxious to take a closer view of these vague points, and,\r\naccordingly, deported myself back to the last half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. I have now been living with them for twelve years, and, like\r\nClement of Alexandria, examined, first, the temple, and next the god.\r\nA passing glance at these is not sufficient; it was also necessary\r\nto understand the theology on which this cult is founded. This one,\r\nexplained by a very specious theology, like most others, is composed of\r\ndogmas called the principles of 1789; they were proclaimed, indeed, at\r\nthat date, having been previously formulated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau:\r\n\r\n* The well known sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\n* The rights of Man.\r\n\r\n* The social contract.\r\n\r\nOnce adopted, their practical results unfolded themselves naturally. In\r\nthree years these dogmas installed the crocodile on the purple carpet\r\ninsides the sanctuary behind the golden veil. He was selected for the\r\nplace on account of the energy of his jaws and the capacity of his\r\nstomach; he became a god through his qualities as a destructive brute\r\nand man-eater.--Comprehending this, the rites which consecrate him and\r\nthe pomp which surrounds him need not give us any further concern.--We\r\ncan observe him, like any ordinary animal, and study his various\r\nattitudes, as he lies in wait for his prey, springs upon it, tears it to\r\npieces, swallows it, and digests it. I have studied the details of his\r\nstructure, the play of his organs, his habits, his mode of living, his\r\ninstincts, his faculties, and his appetites.--Specimens abounded. I have\r\nhandled thousands of them, and have dissected hundreds of every species\r\nand variety, always preserving the most valuable and characteristic\r\nexamples, but for lack of room I have been compelled to let many of them\r\ngo because my collections was too large. Those that I was able to\r\nbring back with me will be found here, and, among others, about twenty\r\nindividuals of different dimensions, which--a difficult undertaking--I\r\nhave kept alive with great pains. At all events, they are intact and\r\nperfect, and particularly the three largest. These seem to me, of their\r\nkind, truly remarkable, and those in which the divinity of the day might\r\nwell incarnate himself.--Authentic and rather well kept cookbooks inform\r\nus about the cost of the cult: We can more or less estimate how much the\r\nsacred crocodiles consumed in ten years; we know their bills of daily\r\nfare, their favorite morsels. Naturally, the god selected the fattest\r\nvictims, but his voracity was so great that he likewise bolted down,\r\nand blindly, the lean ones, and in much greater number than the fattest.\r\nMoreover, by virtue of his instincts, and an unfailing effect of the\r\nsituation, he ate his equals once or twice a year, except when they\r\nsucceeded in eating him.--This cult certainly is instructive, at least\r\nto historians and men of pure science. If any believers in it still\r\nremain I do not aim to convert them; one cannot argue with a devotee on\r\nmatters of faith. This volume, accordingly, like the others that have\r\ngone before it, is written solely for amateurs of moral zoology, for\r\nnaturalists of the understanding, for seekers of truth, of texts, and\r\nof proofs--for these alone and not for the public, whose mind is made up\r\nand which has its own opinion on the Revolution. This opinion began to\r\nbe formed between 1825 and 1830, after the retirement or withdrawal of\r\neye witnesses. When they disappeared it was easy to convince a credulous\r\npublic that crocodiles were philanthropists; that many possessed\r\ngenius; that they scarcely ate others than the guilty, and that if they\r\nsometimes ate too many it was unconsciously and in spite of themselves,\r\nor through devotion and self-sacrifice for the common good.\r\n\r\nH. A. Taine, Menthon Saint Bernard, July 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIRST. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. JACOBIN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The despotic creed and instincts of the Jacobin.\r\n\r\n     Weakness of former governments.--Energy of the new\r\n     government.--The despotic creed and instincts of the\r\n     Jacobin.\r\n\r\nSo far, the weakness of the legal government is extreme. During\r\nfour years, whatever its kind, it has constantly and everywhere been\r\ndisobeyed. For four years it never dared enforce obedience. Recruited\r\namong the cultivated and refined class, the rulers of the country have\r\nbrought with them into power the prejudices and sensibilities of the\r\nepoch. Under the influence of the prevailing dogma they have submitted\r\nto the will of the multitude and, with too much faith in the rights\r\nof Man, they have had too little in the authority of the magistrate.\r\nMoreover, through humanity, they have abhorred bloodshed and, unwilling\r\nto repress, they have allowed themselves to be repressed. Thus from\r\nthe 1st of May, 1789, to June 2, 1793, they have administrated or\r\nlegislated, escaping countless insurrections, almost all of them going\r\nunpunished; while their constitution, an unhealthy product of theory and\r\nfear, have done no more than transform spontaneous anarchy into legal\r\nanarchy. Deliberately and through distrust of authority they have\r\nundermined the principle of command, reduced the King to the post of a\r\ndecorative puppet, and almost annihilated the central power: from the\r\ntop to the bottom of the hierarchy the superior has lost his hold on\r\nthe inferior, the minister on the departments, the departments on the\r\ndistricts, and the districts on the communes. Throughout all branches of\r\nthe service, the chief, elected on the spot and by his subordinates,\r\nhas come to depend on them. Thenceforth, each post in which authority\r\nis vested is found isolated, dismantled and preyed upon, while, to\r\ncrown all, the Declaration of Rights, proclaiming \"the jurisdiction of\r\nconstituents over their clerks,\"[1102] has invited the assailants to\r\nmake the assault. On the strength of this a faction arises which ends in\r\nbecoming an organized band; under its clamor, its menaces and its pikes,\r\nat Paris and in the provinces, at the polls and in the parliament,\r\nthe majorities are all silenced, while the minorities vote, decree and\r\ngovern; the Legislative Assembly is purged, the King is dethroned,\r\nand the Convention is mutilated. Of all the garrisons of the central\r\ncitadel, whether royalists, Constitutionalists, or Girondins, not one\r\nhas been able to defend itself, to re-fashion the executive instrument,\r\nto draw the sword and use it in the streets: on the first attack, often\r\nat the first summons, all have surrendered, and now the citadel, with\r\nevery other public fortress, is in the hands of the Jacobins.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time, its occupants are of a different stamp. Aside from the great\r\nmass of well-disposed people fond of a quiet life, the Revolution has\r\nsifted out and separated from the rest all who are fanatical, brutal\r\nor perverse enough to have lost respect for others; these form the new\r\ngarrison--sectarians blinded by their creed, the roughs (assommeurs) who\r\nare hardened by their calling, and those who make all they can out of\r\ntheir offices. None of this class are scrupulous concerning human life\r\nor property; for, as we have seen, they have shaped the theory to suit\r\nthemselves, and reduced popular sovereignty to their sovereignty.\r\nThe commonwealth, according to the Jacobin, is his; with him, the\r\ncommonwealth comprises all private possessions, bodies, estates, souls\r\nand consciences; everything belongs to him; the fact of being a Jacobin\r\nmakes him legitimately czar and pope. Little does he care about the\r\nwills of actually living Frenchmen; his mandate does not emanate from\r\na vote; it descends to him from aloft, conferred on him by Truth, by\r\nReason, by Virtue. As he alone is enlightened, and the only patriot,\r\nhe alone is worthy to take command, while resistance, according to his\r\nimperious pride, is criminal. If the majority protests it is because\r\nthe majority is imbecile or corrupt; in either case, it deserves to be\r\nbrought to heel. And, in fact, the Jacobin only does that and right\r\naway too; insurrections, usurpations, pillaging, murders, assaults on\r\nindividuals, on judges and public attorneys, on assemblies, violations\r\nof law, attacks on the State, on communities--there is no outrage not\r\ncommitted by him. He has always acted as sovereign instinctively; he\r\nwas so as a private individual and clubbist; he is not to cease being\r\nso, now that he possesses legal authority, and all the more because if\r\nhe hesitates he knows he is lost; to save himself from the scaffold\r\nhe has no refuge but in a dictatorship. Such a man, unlike his\r\npredecessors, will not allow himself to be turned out; on the contrary,\r\nhe will exact obedience at any cost. He will not hesitate to restore\r\nthe central power; he will put back the local wheels that have been\r\ndetached; he will repair the old forcing gear; he will set it agoing so\r\nas to work more rudely and arbitrarily than ever, with greater contempt\r\nfor private rights and public liberties than either a Louis XIV. or a\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Jacobin Dissimulation.\r\n\r\n     Contrast between his words and his acts.--How he\r\n     dissimulates his change of front.--The Constitution of June,\r\n     1793.--Its promises of freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, he has to harmonize his coming acts with his recent\r\ndeclarations, which, at the first glance, seems a difficult operation:\r\nfor, in the speeches he has made he has already condemned the actions he\r\nmeditates. Yesterday he exaggerated the rights of the governed, even to\r\na suppression of those of the government; to-morrow he is to exaggerate\r\nthe rights of the people in power, even to suppressing those who are\r\ngoverned. The people, as he puts it, is the sole sovereign, and he is\r\ngoing to treat the people as slaves; the government, as he puts it, is\r\na valet, and he is going to endow the government with prerogatives of a\r\nsultan. He has just denounced the slightest exercise of public\r\nauthority as a crime; he is now going to punish as a crime the slightest\r\nresistance to public authority. What will justify such a volte-face and\r\nwith what excuse can he repudiate the principles with which he justified\r\nhis takeover?--He takes good care not to repudiate them; it would\r\ndrive the already rebellious provinces to extremes; on the contrary,\r\nhe proclaims them with renewed vigor, through which move the ignorant\r\ncrowd, seeing the same flask always presented to it, imagines that it is\r\nalways served with the same liquor, and is thus forced to drink tyranny\r\nunder the label of freedom. Whatever the charlatan can do with his\r\nlabels, signboards, shouting and lies for the next six months, will be\r\ndone to disguise the new nostrum; so much the worse for the public if,\r\nlater on, it discovers that the draught is bitter; sooner or later it\r\nmust swallow it, willingly or by compulsion: for, in the interval,\r\nthe instruments are being got ready to force it down the public\r\nthroat.[1103]\r\n\r\nAs a beginning, the Constitution, so long anticipated and so often\r\npromised, is hastily fabricated:[1104] declarations of rights in\r\nthirty-five articles, the Constitutional bill in one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four articles, political principles and institutions of every\r\nsort, electoral, legislative, executive, administrative, judicial,\r\nfinancial and military;[1105] in three weeks all is drawn up and passed\r\non the double.--Of course, the new Constitutionalists do not propose to\r\nproduce an effective and serviceable instrument; that is the least of\r\ntheir worries. Hérault Séchelles, the reporter of the bill, writes on\r\nthe 7th of June, \"to have procured for him at once the laws of Minos,\r\nof which he has urgent need;\" very urgent need, as he must hand in\r\nthe Constitution that week.[1106] Such circumstance is sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic of both the workmen and the work. All is mere show and\r\npretense. Some of the workmen are shrewd politicians whose sole object\r\nis to furnish the public with words instead of realities; others,\r\nordinary scribblers of abstractions, or even ignoramuses, and unable to\r\ndistinguish words from reality, imagine that they are framing laws by\r\nstringing together a lot of phrases.--It is not a difficult job; the\r\nphrases are ready-made to hand. \"Let the plotters of anti-popular\r\nsystems,\" says the reporter, \"painfully elaborate their projects!\r\nFrenchmen.... have only to consult their hearts to read the Republic\r\nthere!\"[1107] Drafted in accordance with the \"Contrat-Social,\" filled\r\nwith Greek and Latin reminiscences, it is a summary \"in pithy style\" of\r\nthe manual of current aphorisms then in vogue, Rousseau's mathematical\r\nformulas and prescriptions, \"the axioms of truth and the consequences\r\nflowing from these axioms,\" in short, a rectilinear constitution which\r\nany school-boy may spout on leaving college. Like a handbill posted\r\non the door of a new shop, it promises to customers every imaginable\r\narticle that is handsome and desirable. Would you have rights and\r\nliberties? You will find them all here. Never has the statement been so\r\nclearly made, that the government is the servant, creature and tool\r\nof the governed; it is instituted solely \"to guarantee to them their\r\nnatural, imprescriptible rights.\" [1108] Never has a mandate been more\r\nstrictly limited: \"The right of expressing one's thoughts and opinions,\r\neither through the press or in any other way; the right of peaceful\r\nassembly, the free exercise of worship, cannot be interdicted.\" Never\r\nhave citizens been more carefully guarded against the encroachments and\r\nexcesses of public authority: \"The law should protect public and\r\nprivate liberties against the oppression of those who govern...\r\noffenses committed by the people's mandatories and agents must never\r\ngo unpunished. Let free men instantly put to death every individual\r\nusurping sovereignty. .. Every act against a man outside of the\r\ncases and forms which the law determines is arbitrary and tyrannical;\r\nwhosoever is subjected to violence in the execution of this act has the\r\nright to repel it by force... When the government violates the people's\r\nrights insurrection is, for the people and for each portion of the\r\npeople, the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties.\"\r\n\r\nTo civil rights the generous legislator has added political rights, and\r\nmultiplied every precaution for maintaining the dependence of rulers on\r\nthe people.--In the first place, rulers are appointed by the people and\r\nthrough direct choice or nearly direct choice: in primary meetings\r\nthe people elect deputies, city officers, justices of the peace, and\r\nelectors of the second degree; the latter, in their turn, elect in\r\nthe secondary meetings, district and department administrators, civil\r\narbitrators, criminal judges, judges of appeal and the eighty candidates\r\nfrom amongst which the legislative body is to select its executive\r\ncouncil.--In the second place, all powers of whatever kind are never\r\nconferred except for a very limited term: one year for deputies, for\r\nelectors of the second degree, for civil arbitrators, and for judges\r\nof every kind and class. As to municipalities and also department and\r\ndistrict administrations, these are one-half renewable annually. Every\r\nfirst of May the fountain-head of authority flows afresh, the people in\r\nits primary assemblies, spontaneously formed, manifesting or changing at\r\nwill its staff of clerks.--In the third place, even when installed and\r\nat work, the people may, if it pleases, become their collaborator:\r\nmeans are provided for \"deliberating\" with its deputies. The latter,\r\non incidental questions, those of slight importance, on the ordinary\r\nbusiness of the year, may enact laws; but on matters of general,\r\nconsiderable and permanent interest, they are simply to propose the\r\nlaws, while, especially as regards a declaration of war, the people\r\nalone must decide. The people have a suspensive veto and, finally, a\r\ndefinitive veto, which they may exercise when they please. To this end,\r\nthey may assemble in extraordinary session; one-fifth of the citizens\r\nwho have the right to vote suffice for their convocation. Once convoked,\r\nthe vote is determined by a Yes or a No on the act proposed by the\r\nlegislative body. If, at the expiration of forty days, one-tenth of the\r\nprimary assemblies in one-half of the departments vote No, there is\r\na suspensive veto. In that event all the primary assemblies of the\r\nRepublic must be convoked and if the majority still decides in the\r\nnegative, that is a definitive veto. The same formalities govern a\r\nrevision of the established constitution.--In all this, the plan of the\r\n\"Montagnards\" is a further advance on that of the Girondins; never was\r\nso insignificant a part assigned to the rulers nor so extensive a\r\npart to the governed. The Jacobins profess a respect for the popular\r\ninitiative which amounts to a scruple.[1109] According to them the\r\nsovereign people should be sovereign de facto, permanently, and without\r\ninterregnum, allowed to interfere in all serious affairs, and not\r\nonly possess the right, but the faculty, of imposing its will on its\r\nmandatories.--All the stronger is the reason for referring to it the\r\ninstitutions now being prepared for it. Hence the Convention, after the\r\nparade is over, convokes the primary assemblies and submits to them for\r\nratification the Constitutional bill has been drawn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Primary Assemblies\r\n\r\n\r\n     Primary Assemblies.--Proportion of Absentees.--Unanimity of\r\n     the voters.--Their motives for accepting the Constitution.\r\n     --Pressure brought to bear on voters.--Choice of Delegates.\r\n\r\nThe ratification will, undoubtedly, be approved. Everything has\r\nbeen combined beforehand to secure it, also to secure it as wanted,\r\napparently spontaneously, and almost unanimously.--The primary\r\nassemblies, indeed, are by no means fully attended; only one-half, or a\r\nquarter, or a third of the electors in the cities deposit their votes,\r\nwhile in the rural districts there is only a quarter, and less.[1110]\r\nRepelled by their experience with previous convocations the electors\r\nknow too well the nature of these assemblies; how the Jacobin faction\r\nrules them, how it manages the electoral comedy, with what violence\r\nand threats it reduces all dissidents to voting either as figurants or\r\nclaqueurs. From four to five million of electors prefer to hold aloof\r\nand stay at home as usual. Nevertheless the organization of most of the\r\nassemblies takes place, amounting to some six or seven thousand. This is\r\naccounted for by the fact that each canton contains its small group\r\nof Jacobins. Next to these come the simple-minded who still believe in\r\nofficial declarations; in their eyes a constitution which guarantees\r\nprivate rights and institutes public liberties must be accepted, no\r\nmatter what hand may present it to them. And all the more readily\r\nbecause the usurpers offer to resign; in effect, the Convention has\r\njust solemnly declared that once the Constitution is adopted, the people\r\nshall again be convoked to elect \"a new national assembly... a\r\nnew representative body invested with a later and more immediate\r\ntrust,\"[1111] which will allow electors, if they are so disposed, to\r\nreturn honest deputies and exclude the knaves who now rule. Thereupon\r\neven the insurgent departments, the mass of the Girondins population,\r\nafter a good deal of hesitation, resign themselves at last to voting for\r\nit.[1112] This is done at Lyons and in the department of Calvados only\r\non the 30th of July. A number of Constitutionalists or neutrals have\r\ndone the same thing, some through a horror of civil war and a spirit of\r\nconciliation, and others through fear of persecution and of being taxed\r\nwith royalism;[1113] one conception more: through docility they may\r\nperhaps succeed in depriving the \"Mountain\" of all pretext for violence.\r\n\r\nIn this they greatly deceive themselves, and, from the first, they\r\nare able to see once more the Jacobins interpretation of electoral\r\nliberty.--At first, all the registered,[1114] and especially the\r\n\"suspects,\" are compelled to vote, and to vote Yes; otherwise, says a\r\nJacobin journal,[1115] \"they themselves will indicate the true opinion\r\none ought to have of their attitudes, and no longer have reason to\r\ncomplain of suspicions that are found to be so well grounded.\" They come\r\naccordingly, \"very humbly and very penitent.\" Nevertheless they meet\r\nwith a rebuff, and a cold shoulder is turned on them; they are consigned\r\nto a corner of the room, or near the doors, and are openly insulted.\r\nThus received, it is clear that they will keep quiet and not risk the\r\nslightest objection. At Macon \"a few aristocrats muttered to themselves,\r\nbut not one dared say No.\"[1116] It would, indeed, be extremely\r\nimprudent. At Montbrison, \"six individuals who decline to vote,\" are\r\ndenounced in the procès-verbal of the Canton, while a deputy in the\r\nConvention demands \"severe measures\" against them. At Nogent-sur-Seine,\r\nthree administrators, guilty of the same offense, are to be turned\r\nout of office.[1117] A few months later, the offense becomes a capital\r\ncrime, and people are to be guillotined \"for having voted against the\r\nConstitution of 1793.\"[1118] Almost all the ill-disposed foresaw this\r\ndanger; hence, in nearly all the primary assemblies, the adoption is\r\nunanimous, or nearly unanimous.[1119] At Rouen, there are but twenty-six\r\nadverse votes; at Caen, the center of the Girondin opposition, fourteen;\r\nat Rheims, there are only two; at Troyes, Besançon, Limoges and Paris,\r\nthere are none at all; in fifteen departments the number of negatives\r\nvaries from five to one; not one is found in Var; this apparent unity is\r\nmost instructive. The commune of St. Donau, the only one in France, in\r\nthe remote district of Cotês-du-Nord, dares demand the restoration of\r\nthe clergy and the son of Capet for king. All the others vote as\r\nif directed with a baton; they have understood the secret of the\r\nplebiscite; that it is a Jacobin demonstration, not an honest vote,\r\nwhich is required.[1120] The operation undertaken by the local party is\r\nactually carried out. It beats to arms around the ballot-box; it arrives\r\nin force; it alone speaks with authority; it animates officers; it moves\r\nall the resolutions and draws up the report of proceedings, while the\r\nrepresentatives on mission from Paris add to the weight of the local\r\nauthority that of the central authority. In the Macon assembly \"they\r\naddress the people on each article; this speech is followed by\r\nimmense applause and redoubled shouting of Vive la République! Vive la\r\nConstitution! Vive le Peuple Français!\" Beware, ye lukewarm, who do not\r\njoin in the chorus! They are forced to vote \"in a loud, intelligible\r\nvoice.\" They are required to shout in unison, to sign the grandiloquent\r\naddress in which the leaders testify their gratitude to the Convention,\r\nand give their adhesion to the eminent patriots delegated by the primary\r\nassembly to bear its report to Paris.[1121]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Delegates reach Paris\r\n\r\n     The Delegates reach Paris.--Precautions taken against them.\r\n     --Constraints and Seductions.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the comedy is over and the second act now begins.--The\r\nfaction has convoked the delegates of the primary assemblies to Paris\r\nfor a purpose. Like the primary assemblies, they are to serve as its\r\ninstruments for governing; they are to form the props of dictatorship,\r\nand the object now is to restrict them to that task only.--Indeed, it\r\nis not certain that all will lend themselves to it. For, among the eight\r\nthousand commissioners, some, appointed by refractory assemblies, bring\r\na refusal instead of an adhesion;[1122] others, more numerous, are\r\ninstructed to present objections and point out omissions:[1123] it is\r\nvery certain that the envoys of the Girondist departments will insist on\r\nthe release or return of their excluded representatives. And lastly,\r\na good many delegates who have accepted the Constitution in good faith\r\ndesire its application as soon as possible, and that the Convention\r\nshould fulfill its promise of abdication, so as to give way to a new\r\nAssembly.--As it is important to suppress at once all these vague\r\ndesires for independence or tendencies for opposition a decree of the\r\nConvention \"authorizes the Committee of General Security to order the\r\narrest of 'suspect' commissioners;\" it is especially to look after those\r\nwho, \"charged with a special mission, would hold meetings to win over\r\ntheir colleagues,.... and engage them in proceedings contrary to their\r\nmandate.\"[1124] In the first place, and before they are admitted\r\ninto Paris, their Jacobinism is to be verified, like a bale in the\r\ncustoms-house, by the special agents of the executive council, and\r\nespecially by Stanislas Maillard, the famous September judge, and his\r\nsixty-eight bearded ruffians, each receiving pay at five francs a day.\r\n\"On all the roads, within a circuit of fifteen or twenty leagues of the\r\ncapital,\" the delegates are searched; their trunks are opened, and their\r\nletters read. At the barriers in Paris they find \"inspectors\" posted by\r\nthe Commune, under the pretext of protecting them against prostitutes\r\nand swindlers. There, they are taken possession of, and conducted to\r\nthe mayoralty, where they receive lodging tickets, while a picket of\r\ngendarmerie escorts them to their allotted domiciles.[1125]--Behold them\r\nin pens like sheep, each in his numbered stall; there is no fear of\r\nthe dissidents trying to escape and form a band apart: one of them, who\r\ncomes to the Convention and asks for a separate hall for himself and his\r\nadherents, is snubbed in the most outrageous manner; they denounce\r\nhim as an intriguer, and accuse him of a desire to defend the traitor\r\nCastries; they take his name and credentials, and threaten him with an\r\ninvestigation.[1126] The unfortunate speaker hears the Abbaye alluded\r\nto, and evidently thinks himself fortunate to escape sleeping there\r\nthat night.--After this, it is certain that he will not again demand the\r\nprivilege of speaking, and that his colleagues will remain quiet; and\r\nall this is the more likely\r\n\r\n* because the revolutionary tribunal holds permanent sessions under\r\ntheir eyes,\r\n\r\n* because the guillotine is set up and in operation on the \"Place de la\r\nRévolution;\"\r\n\r\n* because a recent act of the Commune enjoins on the police \"the most\r\nactive surveillance\" and \"constant patrols\" by the armed force;\r\n\r\n* because, from the first to the fourth of August, the barriers are\r\nclosed;\r\n\r\n* because, on the 2nd of August, a raid into three of the theaters puts\r\nfive hundred young men in the lock-up,[1127]\r\n\r\nso the discontented soon discover, if there are any, that this is not\r\nthe time or the place to protest.\r\n\r\nAs to the others, already Jacobin, the faction takes it upon itself to\r\nrender them still more so.--Lost in the immensity of Paris, all these\r\nprovincials require moral as well as physical guides; it agrees to\r\nexercise toward them \"hospitality in all its plenitude, the sweetest\r\nof Republican virtues.\"[1128] Hence, ninety-six sans-culottes, selected\r\nfrom among the sections, wait on them at the Mayoralty to serve as their\r\ncorrespondents, and perhaps as their guarantees, and certainly as pilots\r\n\r\n* to give them lodging-tickets,\r\n\r\n* to escort and install them,\r\n\r\n* to indoctrinate them, as formerly with the federates of July, 1792,\r\n\r\n* to prevent their getting into bad company,\r\n\r\n* to introduce them into all the exciting meetings,\r\n\r\n* to see that their ardent patriotism quickly rises to the proper\r\ntemperature of Parisian Jacobinism.[1129]\r\n\r\nThe theaters must not offend their eyes or ears with pieces \"opposed\r\nto the spirit of the Revolution.\"[1130] An order is issued for the\r\nperformance three times a week of \"republican tragedies, such as\r\n'Brutus', 'William Tell', 'Caius Gracchus,' and other dramas suitable\r\nfor the maintenance of the principles of equality and liberty.\" Once a\r\nweek the theaters must be free, when Chéniér's alexandrines are spouted\r\non the stage to the edification of the delegates, crowded into the boxes\r\nat the expense of the State. The following morning, led in groups into\r\nthe tribunes of the Convention,[1131] they there find the same, classic,\r\nsimple, declamatory, sanguinary tragedy, except that the latter is not\r\nfeigned but real, and the tirades are in prose instead of in verse.\r\nSurrounded by paid yappers like victims for the ancient Romans\r\ncelebrations of purifications, our provincials applaud, cheer and get\r\nexcited, the same as on the night before at the signal given by the\r\nclaqueurs and the regulars. Another day, the procureur-syndic Lhullier\r\nsummons them to attend the \"Evéché,\" to \"fraternize with the authorities\r\nof the Paris department;\"[1132] the \"Fraternité\" section invites them\r\nto its daily meetings; the Jacobin club lends them its vast hall in\r\nthe morning and admits them to its sessions in the evening.--Thus\r\nmonopolized and kept, as in a diving bell, they breathe in Paris nothing\r\nbut a Jacobin atmosphere; from one Jacobin den to another, as they are\r\nled about in this heated atmosphere, their pulse beats more rapidly.\r\nMany of them, who, on their arrival, were \"plain, quiet people,\"[1133]\r\nbut out of their element, subjected to contagion without any antidote,\r\nquickly catch the revolutionary fever. The same as at an American\r\nrevival, under the constant pressure of preaching and singing, of shouts\r\nand nervous spasms, the lukewarm and even the indifferent have not long\r\nto wait before the delirium puts them in harmony with the converted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Fête of August 10th\r\n\r\n     They make their profession of Jacobin faith.--Their part in\r\n     the Fête of August 10th.--Their enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August things come to a head.--Led by the department\r\nand the municipality, a number of delegates march to the bar of the\r\nConvention, and make a confession of Jacobin faith. \"Soon,\" they\r\nexclaim, \"will search be made on the banks of the Seine for the foul\r\nmarsh intended to engulf us. Were the royalist and intriguers to die\r\nof spite, we will live and die 'Montagnards.'\"[1134] Applause and\r\nembraces.--From thence they betake themselves to the Jacobin Club, where\r\none of them proposes an address prepared beforehand: the object of this\r\nis to justify the 31st of May, and the 2nd of June, \"to open the eyes\"\r\nof provincial France, to declare \"war against the federalists.\"[1135]\r\n\"Down with the infamous libelers who have calumniated Paris!.... We\r\ncherish but one sentiment, our souls are all melted into one... We form\r\nhere but one vast, terrible mountain, about to vomit forth its fires\r\non the royalists and supporters of tyranny.\" Applause and\r\ncheers.--Robespierre declares that they are there to save the\r\ncountry.[1136] On the following day, August 8th, this address is\r\npresented to the Convention and Robespierre has a resolution adopted,\r\nordering it to be sent to the armies, to foreign powers and all the\r\nCommunes. More applause, more embraces, and more cheers.--On the 9th\r\nof August,[1137] by order of the Convention, the delegates meet in\r\nthe Tuileries garden, where, divided into as many groups as there are\r\ndepartments, they study the program drawn up by David, in order to\r\nfamiliarize themselves with the parts they are to play in the festival\r\nof the following day.\r\n\r\nWhat an odd festival and how well it expresses the spirit of the time!\r\nIt is a sort of opera played in the streets by the public authorities,\r\nwith triumphant chariots, altars, censers, an Ark of the Covenant,\r\nfuneral urns, classic banners and other trappings! Its divinities\r\nconsist of plaster statues representing Nature, Liberty, the People, and\r\nHercules, all of which are personified abstractions, like those painted\r\non the ceiling of a theater. In all this there is no spontaneity nor\r\nsincerity; the actors, whose consciences tell them that they are only\r\nactors, render homage to symbols which they know to be nothing but\r\nsymbols, while the mechanical procession,[1138] the invocations, the\r\napostrophes, the postures, the gestures are regulated beforehand, the\r\nsame as by a ballet-manager. To any truth-loving person all this must\r\nseem like a charade performed by puppets.--But the festival is colossal,\r\nwell calculated to stimulate the imagination and excite pride through\r\nphysical excitement.[1139] On this grandiose stage the delegates become\r\nquite intoxicated with their part; for, evidently, theirs is the leading\r\npart; they represent twenty-six millions of Frenchmen, and the sole\r\nobject of this ceremony is to glorify the national will of which they\r\nare the bearers.--On the Place de la Bastille[1140] where the gigantic\r\neffigy of nature pours forth from its two breasts \"the regenerating\r\nwater,\" Hérault, the president, after offering libations and saluting\r\nthe new goddess, passes the cup to the eighty-seven elders (les doyens)\r\nof the eighty-seven departments, each \"summoned by sound of drum and\r\ntrumpet\" to step forward and drink in his turn, while cannon belch forth\r\ntheir thunders as if for a monarch. After the eighty-seven have passed\r\nthe cup around, the artillery roars. The procession them moves on, and\r\nthe delegates again are assigned the place of honor. The elders, holding\r\nan olive-branch in one hand, and a pike in the other, with a streamer on\r\nthe end of it bearing the name of their department, \"bound to each other\r\nby a small three-color ribbon,\" surround the Convention as if to\r\nconvey the idea that the nation maintains and conducts its legal\r\nrepresentative. Behind them march the rest of the eight thousand\r\ndelegates, likewise holding olive-branches and forming a second distinct\r\nbody, the largest of all, and on which all eyes are centered. For, in\r\ntheir wake, \"their is no longer any distinction between persons and\r\nfunctionaries,\" all being confounded together, marching pell-mell,\r\nexecutive council, city officials, judges scattered about haphazard and,\r\nby virtue of equality, lost in the crowd. At each station, thanks to\r\ntheir insignia, the delegates form the most conspicuous element. On\r\nreaching the last one, that of the Champ de Mars, they alone with the\r\nConvention, ascend the steps leading to the alter of the country; on the\r\nhighest platform stands the eldest of all alongside the president of\r\nthe Convention, also standing; thus graded above each other, the seven\r\nthousand, who envelope the seven hundred and fifty, form \"the veritable\r\nSacred Mountain.\" Now, the president, on the highest platform, turns\r\ntoward the eighty-seven elders; he confides to the Ark containing the\r\nConstitutional Act and the list of those who voted for it; they, on\r\ntheir part, then advance and hand him their pikes, which he\r\ngathers together into one bundle as an emblem of national unity and\r\nindivisibility. At this, shouts arise from every point of the immense\r\nenclosure; salvoes of artillery follow again and again; \"one would say\r\nthat heaven and earth answered each other\" in honor \"of the greatest\r\nepoch of humanity.\"--Certainly, the delegates are beside themselves;\r\ntheir nerves, strained to the utmost, vibrates too powerfully; the\r\nmillennium discloses itself before their eyes. Already, many among them\r\non the Place de la Bastille, had addressed the universe; others, \"seized\r\nwith a prophetic spirit,\" promise eternity to the Constitution. They\r\nfeel themselves \"reborn again, along with the human species;\" they\r\nregard themselves as beings of a new world. History is consummated in\r\nthem; the future is in their hands; they believe themselves gods\r\non earth.--In this critical state, their reason, like a pair of\r\nill-balanced scales, yields to the slightest touch; under the pressure\r\nof the manufacturers of enthusiasm, a sudden reaction will carry them\r\naway. They consider the Constitution as a panacea, and they are going to\r\nconsign it, like some dangerous drug, to this coffer which they call an\r\nark. They have just proclaimed the liberty of the people, and are going\r\nto perpetuate the dictatorship of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Mountain.\r\n\r\n     Maneuvers of the \"Mountain.\"--The Jacobin Club on the eve of\r\n     August 11th.--Session of the Convention on the 11th of\r\n     August.--The Delegates initiate Terror.--Popular\r\n     consecration of the Jacobin dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThis volteface has, of course, to appear spontaneous and the hand of the\r\ntitular rulers remain invisible: the Convention, as usual with usurpers,\r\nis to simulate reserve and disinterestedness.--Consequently, the\r\nfollowing morning, August 11, on the opening of the session, it simply\r\ndeclares that \"its mission is fulfilled:\"[1141] on the motion of\r\nLacroix, a confederate of Danton's, it passes a law that a new census\r\nof the population and of electors shall be made with as little delay\r\nas possible, in order to convoke the primary assemblies at once; it\r\nwelcomes with joy the delegates who bring to it the Constitutional Ark;\r\nthe entire Assembly rises in the presence of this sacred receptacle,\r\nand allows the delegates to exhort it and instruct it concerning its\r\nduties.[1142] But in the evening, at the Jacobin Club, Robespierre,\r\nafter a long and vague discourse on public dangers, conspiracies, and\r\ntraitors, suddenly utters the decisive words:\r\n\r\n\"The most important of my reflections was about to escape me[1143]...\r\nThe proposition made this morning will only facilitate the replacement\r\nof the purified members of this Convention by the envoys of Pitt and\r\nCobourg.\"\r\n\r\nDreadful words in the mouth of a man of principles! They are at once\r\nunderstood by the leaders, great and small, also by the selected fifteen\r\nhundred Jacobins then filling the hall. \"No! no! shouts the entire\r\nclub.\" The delegates are carried away:\r\n\r\n\"I demand,\" exclaims one of them, \"that the dissolution of the\r\nConvention be postponed until the end of the war.\"--\r\n\r\nAt last, the precious motion, so long desired and anticipated, is made:\r\nthe calumnies of the Girondins now fall the ground; it is demonstrated\r\nthat the Convention does not desire to perpetuate itself and that it has\r\nno ambition; if it remains in power it is because it is kept there; the\r\ndelegates of the people compel it to stay.\r\n\r\nAnd better still, they are going to mark out its course of action.--The\r\nnext day, the 12th of August, with the zeal of new converts, they spread\r\nthemselves through the hall in such numbers that Assembly, no longer\r\nable to carry on is deliberations, crowds toward the left and yields\r\nthe whole of the space on the right that they may occupy and \"purify\"\r\nit.[1144] All the combustible material in their minds, accumulated\r\nduring the past fortnight, takes fire and explodes; they are more\r\nfurious than the most ultra Jacobins; they repeat at the bar of the\r\nhouse the extravagances of Rose Lacombe, and of the lowest clubs; they\r\neven transcend the program drawn up by the \"Mountain.\" \"The time for\r\ndeliberation is past,\" exclaims their spokesman, \"we must act[1145]...\r\nLet the people rouse themselves in a mass... it alone can annihilate its\r\nenemies... We demand that all 'suspects' be put under arrest; that\r\nthey be dispatched to the frontiers, followed by the terrible mass of\r\nsans-culottes. There, in the front ranks, they will be obliged to fight\r\nfor that liberty which they have outraged for the past four years, or\r\nbe immolated on the tyrants' cannon.... Women, children, old men and\r\nthe infirm shall be kept as hostages by the women and children of\r\nsans-culottes.\" Danton seizes the opportunity. With his usual lucidity\r\nhe finds the expression which describes the situation:\r\n\r\n\"The deputies of the primary assemblies,\" he says, \"have just begun to\r\npractice among us the initiative of terror.\"\r\n\r\nHe moreover reduces the absurd notions of the fanatics to a practical\r\nmeasure: \"A mobilization en masse, yes, but with order\" by at once\r\ncalling out the first class of conscript, all men from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-five years of age; the arrest of all 'suspects', yes, but not to\r\nlead them against the enemy; \"they would be more dangerous than useful\r\nin our armies; let us shut them up; they will be our hostages.\"--He also\r\nproposes employment for the delegates who are only in the way in Paris\r\nand might be useful in the provinces. Let us make of them \"various kinds\r\nof representatives charged with animating citizens... Let them, along\r\nwith all good citizens and the constituted authorities, take charge of\r\nthe inventories of grain and arms, and make requisitions for men, and\r\nlet the Committee of Public Safety direct this sublime movement....\r\nAll will swear that, on returning to their homes, they will give this\r\nimpulse their fellow citizens.\" Universal applause; the delegates\r\nexclaim in one voice, \"We swear!\" Everybody springs to his feet; the men\r\nin the tribunes wave their hats and likewise should the same oath.--The\r\nscheme is successful; a semblance of popular will has authorized the\r\nstaff of officials, the policy, the principles and the very name of\r\nTerror. As to the instruments for the operation they are all there ready\r\nto be back into action. The delegates, of whose demands and interference\r\nthe \"Mountain\" is still in dread, are sent back to their departmental\r\nholes, where they shall serve as agents and missionaries.[1146] There is\r\nno further mention of putting the Constitution into operation; this\r\nwas simply a bait, a decoy, contrived for fishing in turbid waters: the\r\nfishing ended, the Constitution is now placed in a conspicuous place\r\nin the hall, in a small monument for which David furnished the\r\ndesign.[1147]--The Convention, now, says Danton, \"will rise to a sense\r\nof its dignity, for it is now invested with the full power of the\r\nnation.\" In other words, artifice completes what violence has begun.\r\nThrough the outrages committed in May and June, the Convention had lost\r\nits legitimacy; through the maneuvers of July and August it recovered\r\nthe semblance of it. The Montagnards still hold their slave by his lash,\r\nbut they have restored his prestige so as to make the most of him to\r\ntheir own profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Extent and Manifesto of the departmental insurrection\r\n\r\n     Effect of this maneuver.--Extent and Manifesto of the\r\n     departmental insurrection.--Its fundamental weakness.--The\r\n     mass of the population inert and distrustful.--The small\r\n     number of Girondists.--Their lukewarm adherents.--Scruples\r\n     of fugitive deputies and insurgent administrators.--They\r\n     form no central government.--They leave military authority\r\n     in the hands of the Convention.--Fatal progress of their\r\n     concessions.--Withdrawal of the departments one by one.\r\n     --Retraction of the compromised authorities.--Effect of\r\n     administrative habits.--Failings and illusions of the\r\n     Moderates.--Opposite character of the Jacobins.\r\n\r\nWith the same blow, and amongst the same playacting, they have nearly\r\ndisarmed their adversaries.--On learning the events of May 31 and June\r\n2, a loud cry of indignation arose among republicans of the cultivated\r\nclass in this generation, who, educated by the philosophers,\r\nsincerely believed in the rights of man.[1148] Sixty-nine department\r\nadministrations had protested,[1149] and, in almost all the towns of the\r\nwest, the south, the east and the center of France, at Caen, Alençon,\r\nEvreux, Rennes, Brest, Lorient, Nantes and Limoges, at Bordeaux,\r\nToulouse, Montpellier, Nîmes and Marseilles, at Grenoble, Lyons,\r\nClermont, Lons-le-Saunier, Besançon, Mâcon and Dijon,[1150] the\r\ncitizens, assembled in their sections, had provoked, or maintained by\r\ncheering them on, the acts of their administrators. Rulers and citizens,\r\nall declared that, the Convention not being free, its decrees after\r\nthe 31st of May, no longer had the force of law; that the troops of\r\nthe departments should march on Paris to deliver that city from its\r\noppressors, and that their substitutes should be called out and assemble\r\nat Bourges. In many places words were converted into acts. Already\r\nbefore the end of May, Marseilles and Lyons had taken up arms and\r\ncheckmated their local Jacobins. After the 2nd of June, Normandy,\r\nBrittany, Gard, Jura, Toulouse and Bordeaux, had also raised troops. At\r\nMarseilles, Bordeaux and Caen representatives on mission, arrested or\r\nunder guard, were retained as hostages.[1151] At Nantes, the national\r\nGuard and popular magistrates who, a week before, had so bravely\r\nrepulsed the great Vendéan army, dared to more than this; they limited\r\nthe powers of the Convention and condemned all meddling: according to\r\nthem, the sending of representatives on mission was \"an usurpation, an\r\nattack on national sovereignty;\" representatives had been elected\r\n\r\n\"to make and not to execute laws, to prepare a constitution and regulate\r\nall public powers, and not to confound these together and exercise\r\nthem all at once; to protect and maintain intermediary powers which\r\nthe people have delegated, and not to encroach upon and annihilate\r\nthem.\"[1152]\r\n\r\nWith still greater boldness, Montpellier enjoined all representatives\r\neverywhere to meet at the headquarters of their respective departments,\r\nand await the verdict of a national jury. In short, in accordance with\r\nthe very democratic creed, \"nothing was visible amid the ruins of the\r\nConvention,\" mutilated and degraded, but interloping \"attorneys.\" \"The\r\npeople's workmen\" are summoned \"to return to obedience and do justice to\r\nthe reproaches addressed to them by their legitimate master;\"[1153]\r\nthe nation canceled the pay of its clerks at the capital, withdrew the\r\nmandate they had misused, and declared them usurpers if they persisted\r\nin not yielding up their borrowed sovereignty \"to its inalienable\r\nsovereignty.\"--To this stroke, which strikes deep, the \"Mountain\"\r\nreplies by a similar stroke; it also renders homage to principles and\r\nfalls back on the popular will. Through the sudden manufacture of an\r\nultra-democratic constitution, through a convocation of the primary\r\nassemblies, and a ratification of its work by the people in these\r\nassemblies, through the summoning of delegates to Paris, through the\r\nassent of these converted, fascinated, or constrained delegates, it\r\nexonerates and justifies itself, and thus deprives the Girondins of\r\nthe grievances to which they had given currency, of the axioms they had\r\ndisplayed on their standards, and of the popularity they thought they\r\nhad acquired.[1154]--Henceforth, the ground their opponents had built on\r\nsinks under their feet; the materials collected by them disintegrate\r\nin their hands; their league dissolves before it is completed, and the\r\nincurable weakness of the party appears in full daylight.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in the departments, as at Paris,[1155] the party has no roots.\r\nFor the past three years all the sensible and orderly people, occupied\r\nwith their own affairs, who has no taste or interest in politics,\r\nnine-tenths of the electors, abstain from voting and in this large mass\r\nthe Girondins have no adherents. As they themselves admit,[1156] this\r\nclass remains attached to the institutions of 1791, which they have\r\noverthrown; if it has any esteem for them, it is as \"extremely honest\r\nmadmen.\" Again, this esteem is mingled with aversion: it reproaches\r\nthem with the violent decrees they have passed in concert with the\r\n\"Mountain;\" with persecutions, confiscations, every species of injustice\r\nand cruelty; it always sees the King's blood on their hands; they,\r\ntoo, are regicides, anti-Catholics, anti-Christians, demolishers and\r\nlevelers.[1157]--Undoubtedly they are less so than the \"Mountain;\"\r\nhence, when the provincial insurrection breaks out, many Feuillants and\r\neven Royalists follow them to the section assemblies and join in their\r\nprotests. But the majority goes no further, and soon falls back into\r\nis accustomed inertia. It is not in harmony with its leaders:[1158]\r\nits latent preferences are opposed to their avowed program; it does not\r\nwholly trust them; it has only a half-way affection for them; its recent\r\nsympathies are deadened by old animosities: everywhere, instead of\r\nfirmness there is only caprice. All this affords no assurance of\r\nsteadfast loyalty and practical adhesion. The Girondin deputies\r\nscattered through the provinces relied upon each department arousing\r\nitself at their summons and forming a republican Vendée against the\r\n\"Mountain:\" nowhere do they find anything beyond mild approval and\r\nspeculative hopes.\r\n\r\nThere remains to support them the élite of the republican party, the\r\nscholars and lovers of literature, who are honest and sincere thinkers,\r\nwho, worked upon by the current dogmas, have accepted the philosophical\r\ncatechism literally and seriously. Elected judges, or department,\r\ndistrict, and city administrators, commanders and officers of the\r\nNational Guard, presidents and secretaries of sections, they occupy\r\nmost of the places conferred by local authority, and hence their almost\r\nunanimous protest seems at first to be the voice of France. In reality,\r\nit is only the despairing cry of a group of staff-officers without an\r\narmy. Chosen under the electoral pressure with which we are familiar,\r\nthey possess rank, office and titles, but no credit or influence; they\r\nare supported only by those whom they really represent, that is to\r\nsay, those who elected them, a tenth of the population, and forming a\r\nsectarian minority. Again, in this minority there are a good many who\r\nare lukewarm; with most men the distance is great between conviction and\r\naction; the interval is filled up with acquired habits, indolence, fear\r\nand egoism. One's belief in the abstractions of the \"Contrat-social\" is\r\nof little account; no one readily bestirs oneself for an abstract end.\r\nUncertainties beset one at the outset; the road one has to follow is\r\nfound to be perilous and obscure, and one hesitates and postpones; one\r\nfeels himself a home-body and is afraid of engaging too deeply and of\r\ngoing too far. Having expended one's breath in words one is less willing\r\nto give one's money; another may open his purse but he may not be\r\ndisposed to give himself, which is as true of the Girondins as it is of\r\nthe Feuillants.\r\n\r\n\"At Marseilles,[1159] at Bordeaux,\" says a deputy, \"in nearly all the\r\nprincipal towns, the proprietor, slow, indifferent and timid, could not\r\nmake up his mind to leave home for a moment; it was to mercenaries that\r\nhe entrusted his cause his arms.\"\r\n\r\nOnly the federates of Mayenne, Ile-et-Vilaine, and especially of\r\nFinisterre, were \"young men well brought up and well informed about the\r\ncause they were going to support.\" In Normandy, the Central Committee,\r\nunable to do better, has to recruit its soldiers, and especially\r\ngunners, from the band of Carabots, former Jacobins, a lot of ruffians\r\nready for anything, pillagers and runaways at the first canon-shot.\r\nAt Caen, Wimpffen, having ordered the eight battalions of the National\r\nGuard to assemble in the court, demands volunteers and finds that only\r\nseventeen step forth; on the following day a formal requisition brings\r\nout only one hundred and thirty combatants; other towns, except Vire,\r\nwhich furnishes about twenty, refuse their contingent. In short, a\r\nmarching army cannot be formed, or, if it does march, it halts at\r\nthe first station, that of Evreux before reaching Vernon, and that of\r\nMarseilles at the walls of Avignon.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, by virtue of being sincere and logical, those who\r\nhave rebelled entertain scruples and themselves define the limits of\r\ntheir insurrection. The fugitive deputies at their head would believe\r\nthemselves guilty of usurpation had they, like the \"Mountain\" at Paris,\r\nconstituted themselves at Caen en sovereign assembly[1160]: according\r\nto them, their right and their duty is reduced to giving testimony\r\nconcerning the 31st of May and the 1st of June, and to exhorting the\r\npeople and to being eloquent. They are not legally qualified to take\r\nexecutive power; it is for the local magistrates, the élus(elected) of\r\nthe sections, and better still, the department committees to command\r\nin the departments. Lodged as they are in official quarters, they\r\nare merely to print formal statements, write letters, and, behaving\r\nproperly, wait until the sovereign people, their employer, reinstates\r\nthem. It has been outraged in their persons; it must avenge itself\r\nfor this outrage; since it approves of its mandatories, it is bound to\r\nrestore them to office; it being the master of the house, it is bound to\r\nhave its own way in the house.--As to the department committees, it is\r\ntrue that, in the heat of the first excitement, they thought of forming\r\na new Convention at Bourges,[1161] either through a muster of substitute\r\ndeputies, or through the convocation of a national commission of one\r\nhundred and seventy members. But time is wanting, also the means, to\r\ncarry out the plan; it remains suspended in the air like vain menace; at\r\nthe end of a fortnight it vanishes in smoke; the departments succeed in\r\nfederating only in scattered groups; they desist from the formation of\r\na central government, and thus, through this fact alone, condemn\r\nthemselves to succumb, one after the other, in detail, and each at\r\nhome.--What is worse, through conscientiousness and patriotism, they\r\nprepare their own defeat: the refrain from calling upon the armies\r\nand from stripping the frontiers; they do not contest the right of the\r\nConvention to provide as it pleases for the national defense.\r\nLyons allows the passage of convoys of cannon-balls which are to be\r\nsubsequently used in cannonading its defenders[1162]. The authorities\r\nof Puy-de-Dome aid by sending to Vendée the battalion that they\r\nhad organized against the \"Mountain.\" Bordeaux is to surrender\r\nChateau-Trompette, its munitions of war and supplies, to the\r\nrepresentatives on mission; and, without a word, with exemplary\r\ndocility, both the Bordeaux battalions which guard Blaye suffer\r\nthemselves to be dislodged by two Jacobin battalions.[1163]\r\nComprehending the insurrection in this way, defeat is certain\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents are thus conscious of their false position; they have a\r\nvague sort of feeling that, in recognizing the military authority of the\r\nConvention, they admit its authority in full; insensibly they glide down\r\nthis slope, from concession to concession, until they reach complete\r\nsubmission. From the 16th of June, at Lyons,[1164] \"people begin to\r\nfeel that it ought not break with the Convention.\" Five weeks later, the\r\nauthorities of Lyons \"solemnly recognize that the Convention is the\r\nsole central rallying point of all French citizens and republicans,\" and\r\ndecree that \"all acts emanating from it concerning the general interests\r\nof the republic are to be executed.\"[1165] Consequently, at Lyons and in\r\nother departments, the administrations convoke the primary assemblies\r\nas the Convention has prescribed; consequently, the primary assemblies\r\naccept the Constitution which it has proposed; consequently, the\r\ndelegates of the primary assemblies betake themselves to Paris according\r\nto its orders.--Henceforth, the Girondins' cause is lost; the discharge\r\nof a few cannon at Vernon and Avignon disperse the only two columns\r\nof soldiery that have set out on their march. In each department, the\r\nJacobins, encouraged by the representatives on mission, raise their\r\nheads; everywhere the local club enjoins the local government to\r\nsubmit,[1166] everywhere the local governments report the acts\r\nthey pass, make excuses and ask forgiveness. Proportionately to the\r\nretraction of one department, the rest, feeling themselves abandoned,\r\nare more disposed to retract. On the 9th of July forty-nine departments\r\nare enumerated as having given in their adhesion. Several of them\r\ndeclare that the scales have dropped from their eyes, that they approve\r\nof the acts of May 31 and June 2, and thus ensure their safety by\r\nmanifesting their zeal. The administration of Calvados notifies the\r\nBreton fédérés that \"having accepted the Constitution it can no longer\r\ntolerate their presence in Caen;\" it sends them home, and secretly makes\r\npeace with the \"Mountain;\" and only informs the deputies, who are its\r\nguests, of this proceeding, three days afterwards, by postings on their\r\ndoor the decree that declares them outlaws.\r\n\r\nDisguised as soldiers, the latter depart along with the Breton fédérés;\r\non the way, they are able to ascertain the veritable sentiments of this\r\npeople whom they believe imbued with their rights and capable of taking\r\na political initiative.[1167] The pretended citizens and republicans\r\nthey have to do with are, in sum, the former subjects of Louis XVI. and\r\nthe future subjects of Napoleon I., that is to say, administrators and\r\npeople, disciplined by habit and instinctively subordinate, requiring a\r\ngovernment just as sheep require a shepherd and a watch-dog, accepting\r\nor submitting to shepherd and dog, provided these look and act the\r\npart, even if the shepherd be a butcher and the dog a wolf. To avoid\r\nisolation, to rejoin the most numerous herd as soon as possible, to\r\nalways form masses and bodies and thus follow the impulsion which comes\r\nfrom above, and gather together scattered individuals, such is the\r\ninstinct of the flock.\r\n\r\nIn the battalion of federates, they begin by saying that, as the\r\nConstitution is now accepted and the convention recognized, it is no\r\nlonger allowed to protect deputies whom it has declared outlaws: \"that\r\nwould be creating a faction.\" Thereupon, the deputies withdraw from the\r\nbattalion, and, in a little squad by themselves, march along separately.\r\nAs they are nineteen in number, resolute and well armed, the authorities\r\nof the market-towns through which they pass make no opposition by force;\r\nit would be offering battle, and that surpasses a functionary's\r\nzeal; moreover, the population is either indifferent toward them or\r\nsympathetic. Nevertheless, efforts are made to stop them, sometimes to\r\nsurround them and take them by surprise; for, a warrant of arrest is out\r\nagainst them, transmitted through the hierarchical channel, and every\r\nlocal magistrate feels bound to do his duty as gendarme. Under this\r\nadministrative network, the meshes of which they encounter everywhere,\r\nthe proscribed deputies can do naught else but hide in caves or escape\r\nby sea.--On reaching Bordeaux, they find other sheep getting ready\r\nfor the slaughter-house. Saige, the mayor, preaches conciliation and\r\npatience: he declines the aid of four or five thousand young men, three\r\nthousand grenadiers of the National Guard, and two or three hundred\r\nvolunteers who had formed themselves into a club against the Jacobin\r\nclub. He persuades them to disband; he sends a deputation to Paris to\r\nentreat the Convention to overlook \"a moment of error\" and pardon their\r\n\"brethren who had gone astray.\"--\"They flattered themselves,\" says a\r\ndeputy, an eye-witness,[1168] \"that prompt submission would appease\r\nthe resentment of tyrants and that these would be, or pretend to be,\r\ngenerous enough to spare a town that had distinguished itself more than\r\nany other during the Revolution.\" Up to the last, they are to entertain\r\nthe same illusions and manifest the same docility. When Tallien, with\r\nhis eighteen hundred peasants and brigands, enters Bordeaux, twelve\r\nthousand National Guards, equipped, armed and in uniform, receive him\r\nwearing oak-leaf crowns; they listen in silence to \"his astounding\r\nand outrageous discourse;\" they suffer him to tear off their crowns,\r\ncockades and epaulettes; the battalions allow themselves to be disbanded\r\non the spot; on returning to their quarters they listen with downcast\r\neyes to the proclamation which \"orders all inhabitants without\r\ndistinction to bring their arms within thirty-six hours, under the\r\npenalty of death, to the glacis of the Chateau-Trompette; before\r\nthe time elapses thirty thousand guns, swords, pistols and even\r\npocket-knives are given up.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as at Paris, on the 20th of June, 10th of August, 2nd of\r\nSeptember, 3rd of May and 2nd of June, as at every critical moment of\r\nthe Revolution in Paris and the provinces, habits of subordination\r\nand of amiability, stamped on a people by a provident monarchy and a\r\ntime-honored civilization, have blunted in man the foresight of danger,\r\nhis aggressive instinct, his independence and the faculty of depending\r\nupon himself only, the willingness to help one another and of saving\r\nhimself. Inevitably, when anarchy brings a nation back to the state of\r\nnature, the tame animals will be eaten by the savage ones,--these are\r\nnow let loose and immediately they show their true nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. The Reasons for the Terror.\r\n\r\n     The last local resistance.--Political orthodoxy of the\r\n     insurgent towns.--They stipulate but one condition.--Reasons\r\n     of State for granting this.--Party arguments against it.\r\n\r\nIf the men of the \"Mountain\" had been statesmen, or even sensible\r\nmen, they would have shown themselves humane, if not for the sake of\r\nhumanity, at least through calculation; for in this France, so little\r\nrepublican, all the republican strength is not too great for the\r\nfounding of the Republic, while, through their principles, their\r\nculture, their social position and their number, the Girondins form the\r\nélite and the force, the flower and the sap of the party.--The death-cry\r\nof the \"Mountain\" against the insurgents of Lozére[1169] and Vendée\r\ncan be understood: they had raised the king's white flag; they accepted\r\nleaders and instructions from Coblentz and London. But neither Bordeaux,\r\nMarseilles nor Lyons are royalist, or in alliance with the foreigner.\r\n\r\n\"We, rebels!\" write the Lyonnese;[1170] \"Why we see no other than the\r\ntri-color flag waving; the white cockade, the symbol of rebellion, has\r\nnever been raised within our walls. We, royalists! Why, shouts of 'Long\r\nlive the Republic' are heard on all sides, and, spontaneously (in the\r\nsession of July 2nd) we have all sworn to fall upon whoever should\r\npropose a king.... Your representatives tell you that we are\r\nanti-revolutionaries, we who have accepted the Constitution. They tell\r\nyou that we protect émigrés when we have offered to surrender all those\r\nthat you might indicate. They tell you that our streets are filled\r\nwith refractory priests, when we have not even opened the doors of\r\nPierre-en-Cize (prison) to the thirty-two priests confined there by\r\nthe old municipality, without indictment, without any charge whatever\r\nagainst them, solely because they were priests.\"\r\n\r\nThus, at Lyons, the pretended aristocrats were, then, not only\r\nrepublicans but democrats and radicals, loyal to the established régime,\r\nand submissive to the worst of the revolutionary laws, while the\r\nsame state of things prevailed at Bordeaux, at Marseilles and even at\r\nToulon.[1171] And furthermore, they accepted the outrages of May 31 and\r\nJune 2;[1172] they stopped contesting the usurpations of Paris; they no\r\nlonger insisted on the return of the excluded deputies. On the 2nd\r\nof August at Bordeaux, and the 30th of July at Lyons, the\r\nCommittee-Extraordinary of Public Safety resigned; there no longer\r\nexisted any rival assembly opposed to the Convention. After the 24th of\r\nJuly,[1173] Lyons solemnly recognized the supreme and central authority,\r\nreserving nothing but its municipal franchises.--And better still, in\r\nstriking testimony of political orthodoxy, the Council-General of the\r\ndepartment prescribed a civic festival for the 10th of August analogous\r\nto that of Paris. The Lyonnese, already blockaded, indulged in no\r\nhostile manifestation; on the 7th of August they marched out of their\r\nadvanced positions to fraternize with the first body of troops sent\r\nagainst them.[1174] They conceded everything, save on one point, which\r\nthey could not yield without destruction, namely, the assurance that\r\nthey should not be given up defenseless to the arbitrary judgment of\r\ntheir local tyrants, to the spoliation, proscriptions and revenge of the\r\nJacobin rabble. In sum, at Marseilles and Bordeaux, especially at Lyons\r\nand Toulon, the sections had revolted only on that account; acting\r\npromptly and spontaneously, the people had thrust aside the knife which\r\na few ruffians aimed at their throats; they had not been, and were\r\nnot now, willing to be \"Septemberised,\" that was their sole concern.\r\nProvided they were not handed over to the butchers bound hand and foot,\r\nthey would open their gates. On these minimum terms the \"Mountain\" could\r\nterminate the civil war before the end of July. It had only to follow\r\nthe example of Robert Lindet who, at Evreux the home of Buzot, at\r\nCaen the home of Charlotte Corday and the central seat of the fugitive\r\nGirondins, established permanent obedience through the moderation he had\r\nshown and the promises he had kept.[1175] The measures that had pacified\r\nthe most compromised province would have brought back the others, and\r\nthrough this policy, Paris, without striking a blow, would have secured\r\nthe three largest cities in France, the capital of the South-west, that\r\nof the South, and the capital of the Center.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, should Paris persist in imposing on them the domination\r\nof its local Jacobins there was a risk of their being thrown into the\r\narms of the enemy. Rather than fall back into the hands of the bandits\r\nwho had ransomed and decimated them, Toulon, starved out, was about to\r\nreceive the English within its walls and surrender to them the great\r\narsenal of the South. Not less famished, Bordeaux might be tempted to\r\ndemand aid from another English fleet; a few marches would brings the\r\nPiedmontese army to Lyons; France would then b cut in two, while the\r\nplan of stirring up the South against the North was proposed to the\r\nallies by the most clear-sighted of their councilors.[1176] Had this\r\nplan been carried out it is probably that the country would have been\r\nlost.--In any event, there was danger in driving the insurgents to\r\ndespair: for, between the unbridled dictatorship of their victorious\r\nassassins and the musketry of the besieging army, there could be no\r\nhesitation by men of any feeling; it was better to be beaten on the\r\nramparts than allow themselves to be bound for the guillotine; brought\r\nto a stand under the scaffold, their sole resource was to depend\r\non themselves to the last.--Thus, through its unreasonableness, the\r\n\"Mountain\" condemns itself to a number of sieges or blockades which\r\nlasted several months,[1177] to leaving Var and Savoy unprotected, to\r\nexhausting the arsenals, to employing against Frenchmen[1178] troops\r\nand munitions needed against foreigners, and all this at the moment\r\nthe foreigner was taking Valenciennes[1179] and Mayence, when thirty\r\nthousand royalist were organizing in Lozére, when the great Vendean\r\narmy was laying siege to Nantes, when each new outbreak of fighting was\r\nthreatening to connect the flaming frontier with the conflagration in\r\nthe Catholic countries.[1180]--With a jet of cold water aptly directed,\r\nthe \"Mountain\" could extinguish the fires it had kindled in the great\r\nrepublican towns; otherwise, nothing remained but to let them increase\r\nat the risk of consuming the whole country, with no other hope than\r\nthat they might at last die out under a mass of ruins, and with no other\r\nobject but to rule over captives and the dead.\r\n\r\nBut this is precisely the Jacobin aim; for, he is not satisfied with\r\nless than absolute submission; he must rule at any cost, just as he\r\npleases, by fair means or foul, no matter over what ruins. A despot by\r\ninstinct and installation, his dogma has consecrated him King; he is\r\nKing by natural and divine right, in the name of eternal verity, the\r\nsame as Philip II., enthroned by his religious system and blessed by\r\nhis Holy Office. Hence he can abandon no jot or title of his authority\r\nwithout a sacrifice of principle, nor treat with rebels, unless they\r\nsurrender at discretion; simply for having risen against legitimate\r\nauthority, they are traitors and villains. And who are greater rascals\r\nthe renegades who, after three years of patient effort, just as the sect\r\nfinally reaches its goal, oppose its accession to power![1181] At Nîmes,\r\nToulouse, Bordeaux, Toulon, and Lyons, not only have they interfered\r\nwith or arrested the blow which Paris struck, but they have put down the\r\naggressors, closed the club, disarmed the fanatical and imprisoned the\r\nleading Maratists; and worse still, at Lyons and at Toulon, five or\r\nsix massacreurs, or promoters of massacre, Châlier and Riard, Jassaud,\r\nSylvestre and Lemaille, brought before the courts, have been condemned\r\nand executed after a trial in which all the forms were strictly adhered\r\nto.--That is the inexpiable crime; for, in this trial, the \"Mountain\"\r\nis involved; the principles of Sylvestre and Châlier are its principles;\r\nwhat is accomplished in Paris, they have attempted in the provinces; if\r\nthey are guilty, it is also guilty; it cannot tolerate their punishment\r\nwithout assenting to its own punishment. Accordingly,\r\n\r\n* it must proclaim them heroes and martyrs,\r\n\r\n* it must canonize their memory,[1182]\r\n\r\n* it must avenge their tortures,\r\n\r\n* it must resume and complete their assaults,\r\n\r\n* it must restore their accomplices to their places,\r\n\r\n* it must render them omnipotent,\r\n\r\n* it must force each rebel city to accept the rule of its rabble and\r\nvillains.\r\n\r\nIt matters little whether the Jacobins be a minority, whether at\r\nBordeaux, they have but four out of twenty-eight sections on their side,\r\nat Marseilles five out of thirty-two, whether at Lyons they can count\r\nup only fifteen hundred devoted adherents.[1183] Suffrages are not\r\nreckoned, but weighed, for legality is founded, not on numbers, but on\r\npatriotism, the sovereign people being composed wholly of sans-culottes.\r\nSo much the worse for towns where the anti-revolutionary majority is so\r\ngreat; they are only more dangerous; under the republican demonstrations\r\nis concealed the hostility of old parties and of the \"suspect\" classes,\r\nthe Moderates, the Feuillants and Royalists, merchants, men of the legal\r\nprofession, property-owners and muscadins.[1184] These towns are nests\r\nof reptiles and must be crushed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Destruction of Rebel Cities\r\n\r\n     Bordeaux.--Marseilles.--Lyons.---Toulon.\r\n\r\nConsequently, obedient or disobedient, they are crushed out. They\r\nare declared traitors to the country, not merely the members of the\r\ndepartmental committees, but, at Bordeaux, all who have \"aided or\r\nabetted the Committee of Public Safety;\" at Lyons, all administrators,\r\nfunctionaries, military or civil officers who \"convoked or tolerated the\r\nRhône-et-Loire congress,\" and furthermore, \"every individual whose son,\r\nclerk, servant, or even day-laborer, may have borne arms or contributed\r\nthe means of resistance,\" that is to say, the entire National Guard\r\nwho took up arms, and nearly all the population which gave its money\r\nor voted in the sections.[1185]--By virtue of this decree, all are\r\n\"outlaws,\" or, in other words subject to the guillotine just on the\r\nestablishment of their identity, and their property confiscated.\r\nConsequently, at Bordeaux, where not a gun had been fired, the mayor\r\nSaige, and principal author of the submission, is at once led to the\r\nscaffold without any form of trial,[1186] while eight hundred and\r\neighty-one others succeed him amidst the solemn silence of a dismayed\r\npopulation.[1187] Two hundred prominent merchants are arrested in one\r\nnight; more than fifteen hundred persons are imprisoned; all who are\r\nwell off are ransomed, even those against who no political charge could\r\nbe made; nine millions of fines are levied against \"rich egoists.\" One\r\nof these,[1188] accused of \"indifference and moderatism,\" pays twenty\r\nthousand francs \"not to be harnessed to the car of the Revolution;\"\r\nanother \"convicted of having shown contempt for his section and for the\r\npoor by giving thirty livres per months,\" is taxed at one million two\r\nhundred thousand livres, while the new authorities, a crooked mayor and\r\ntwelve knaves composing the Revolutionary Committee, traffic in lives\r\nand property.[1189] At Marseilles, says Danton,[1190] the object is\r\n\"to give the commercial aristocracy an important lesson;\" we must\r\n\"show ourselves as terrible to traders as to nobles and priests;\"\r\nconsequently, twelve thousand of them are proscribed and their\r\npossessions sold.[1191] From the first day the guillotine works as\r\nfast as possible; nevertheless, it does not work fast enough for\r\nRepresentative Fréron who finds the means for making it work faster.\r\n\r\n\"The military commission we have established in place of the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal,\" he writes, \"works frightfully fast against\r\nthe conspirators.... They fall like hail under the sword of the law.\r\nFourteen have already paid for their infamous treachery with their\r\nheads. To-morrow, sixteen more are to be guillotined, all chiefs of\r\nthe legion, notaries, sectionists, members of the popular tribunal;\r\nto-morrow, also, three merchants will dance the carmagnole, and they are\r\nthe ones we are after.\"[1192]\r\n\r\nMen and things, all must perish; he wishes to demolish the city and\r\nproposes to fill up the harbor. Restrained with great difficulty, Fréron\r\ncontents himself with a destruction of \"the haunts\" of the aristocracy,\r\ntwo churches, the concert-hall, the houses around it, and twenty-three\r\nbuildings in which the rebel sections had held their meetings.\r\n\r\nAt Lyons, to increase the booty, the representatives had taken pains\r\nto encourage the manufacturers and merchants with vague promises; these\r\nopened their shops and brought their valuable goods, books and papers\r\nout of their hiding-places. No time is lost in seizing the plunder; \"a\r\nlist of all property belonging to the rich and to anti-revolutionaries\"\r\nis drawn up, which is \"confiscated for the benefit of the patriots of\r\nthe city;\" in addition to this a tax of six millions is imposed,\r\npayable in eight days, by those whom the confiscation may have still\r\nspared;[1193] it is proclaimed, according to principle, that the surplus\r\nof each individual belongs by right to the sans-culottes, and whatever\r\nmay have been retained beyond the strictly necessary, is a robbery by\r\nthe individual to the detriment of the nation.[1194] In conformity with\r\nthis rule there is a general rounding up, prolonged for ten months,\r\nwhich places the fortunes of a city of one hundred and twenty thousand\r\nsouls in the hands of its scoundrels. Thirty-two revolutionary\r\ncommittees \"whose members are thick as thieves select thousands of\r\nguards devoted to them.\"[1195] In confiscated dwellings and warehouses,\r\nthey affix seals without an inventory; they drive out women and children\r\n\"so that there shall be no witnesses;\" they keep the keys; they enter\r\nand steal when they please, or install themselves for a revel with\r\nprostitutes.--Meanwhile, the guillotine is kept going, and people are\r\nfired at and shot down with grape-shot. The revolutionary committee\r\nofficially avow one thousand six hundred and eighty-two acts of murder\r\ncommitted in five months,[1196] while a confederate of Robespierre's\r\nprivately declare that there were six thousand.[1197]\r\n\r\nBlacksmiths are condemned to death for having shod the Lyonnese cavalry,\r\nfiremen for having extinguished fires kindled by republican bombshells,\r\na widow for having paid a war-tax during the siege, market women\r\nfor \"having shown disrespect to patriots.\" It is an organized\r\n\"Septembrisade\" made legal and lasting; its authors are so well\r\naware of the fact as to use the word itself in their public\r\ncorrespondence.[1198]--At Toulon it is worse, people are slaughtered in\r\nheaps, almost haphazard. Notwithstanding that the inhabitants the\r\nmost compromised, to the number of four thousand, take refuge on board\r\nEnglish vessels, the whole city, say the representatives, is guilty.\r\nFour hundred workmen in the navy-yard having marched out to meet Fréron,\r\nhe reminds them that they kept on working during the English occupation\r\nof the town, and he has them put to death on the spot. An order is\r\nissued to all \"good citizens to assemble in the Champ de Mars on penalty\r\nof death.\" They come there to the number of three thousand; Fréron, on\r\nhorseback, surrounded by cannon and troops, arrives with about a hundred\r\nMaratists, the former accomplices of Lemaille, Sylvestre, and other\r\nwell-known assassins, who form a body of local auxiliaries and\r\ncounselors; he tells them to select out of the crowd at pleasure\r\naccording to their grudge, fancy, or caprice; all who are designated\r\nare ranged along a wall and shot. The next morning, and on the following\r\ndays, the operation is renewed: Fréron writes on the 16th of Nivose\r\nthat \"eight hundred Toulonese have already been shot.\" ... \"A volley\r\nof musketry,\" says he, in another letter, and after that, volley after\r\nvolley, until \"the traitors are all gone.\" Then, for three months after\r\nthis, the guillotine dispatches eighteen hundred persons; eleven young\r\nwomen have to mount the scaffold together, in honor of a republican\r\nfestival; an old woman of ninety-four is borne to it in an armchair. The\r\npopulation, initially of twenty-eight thousand people, is reduced to six\r\nor seven thousand only.\r\n\r\nAll this is not enough; the two cities that dared maintain a siege must\r\ndisappear from the French soil. The Convention decrees that \"the city\r\nof Lyons shall be destroyed: every house occupied by a rich man shall be\r\ndemolished; only the dwellings of the poor shall remain, with edifices\r\nspecially devoted to industry, and monuments consecrated to humanity and\r\npublic education.\"[1199] The same at Toulon: \"the houses within the town\r\nshall be demolished; only the buildings that are essential for army and\r\nnavy purposes, for stores and munitions, shall be preserved.\"[11100]\r\nConsequently, a requisition is made in Var and the neighboring\r\ndepartments for twelve thousand masons to level Toulon to the\r\nground.--At Lyons, fourteen thousand laborers pull down the Chateau\r\nPierre-Encize; also the superb houses on Place Bellecour, those of the\r\nQuai St.-Clair, those of the Rues de Flandre and de Bourgneuf, and many\r\nothers; the cost of all this amounts to four hundred thousand livres\r\nper decade; in six months the Republic expends fifteen millions in\r\ndestroying property valued at three or four hundred millions, all\r\nbelonging to the Republic.[11101] Since the Mongols of the fifth\r\nand thirteenth centuries, no such vast and irrational waste had been\r\nseen--such frenzy against the most profitable fruits of industry and\r\nhuman civilization.--Again, one can understand how the Mongols, who\r\nwere nomads, desired to convert the soil into one vast steppe. But, to\r\ndemolish a town whose arsenal and harbor is maintained by it, to destroy\r\nthe leaders of manufacturing interests and their dwellings in a city\r\nwhere its workmen and factories are preserved, to keep up a fountain and\r\nstop the stream which flows from it, or the stream without the fountain,\r\nis so absurd that the idea could only enter the head of a Jacobin. His\r\nimagination has run so wild and his prevision become so limited that\r\nhe is no longer aware of contradictions; the ferocious stupidity of the\r\nbarbarian and the fixed idea of the inquisition meet on common ground;\r\nthe earth is not big enough for any but himself and the orthodox of his\r\nspecies. Employing absurd, inflated and sinister terms he decrees the\r\nextermination of heretics: not only shall their monuments, dwellings and\r\npersons be destroyed, but every vestige of them shall be eradicated and\r\ntheir names lost to the memory of man.[11102]\r\n\r\n\"The name of Toulon shall be abolished; that commune shall henceforth\r\nbear the name of Port-la-Montagne.\"--\"The name of Lyons shall be\r\nstricken off the list of towns belonging to the Republic; the remaining\r\ncollection of houses shall henceforth bear the name of Ville-Affranchie.\r\nA column shall be erected on the ruins of Lyons bearing this\r\ninscription: 'Lyons made war on Liberty! Lyons is no more!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. Destruction of the Girondin party\r\n\r\n     Destruction of the Girondin party.--Proscription of the\r\n     Deputies of the \"Right\".--Imprisonment of the 73.--Execution\r\n     of the 21.--Execution, suicide, or flight of the rest.\r\n\r\nIn all this there is no intention to spare in Paris the chiefs of the\r\ninsurrection or of the party, either deputies or ministers; on the\r\ncontrary, the object is to complete the subjection of the Convention,\r\nto stifle the murmurs of the \"Right,\" to impose silence on Ducos,\r\nBoyer-Fonfrède, Vernier, and Couhey, who still speak and protest.[11103]\r\nHence the decrees of arrest or death, launched weekly from the top\r\nof the \"Mountain,\" fall on the majority like guns fired into a crowd.\r\nDecrees of accusation follow: on the 15th of June, against Duchâtel, on\r\nthe 17th against Barbaroux, on the 23rd against Brissot, on the 8th of\r\nJuly against Devérité and Condorcet, on the 14th against Lauze-Deperret\r\nand Fauchet, on the 30th against Duprat Jr., Valée and Mainvielle,\r\non the 2nd of August against Rouyer, Brunel and Carra; Carra,\r\nLauze-Deperret and Fauchet, present during the session, are seized on\r\nthe spot, which is plain physical warning: none is more effective to\r\ncheck the unruly.--Decrees are passed on the 18th of July accusing\r\nCoustard, on the 28th of July against Gensonné, La Source, Vergniaud,\r\nMollevaut, Gardien, Grangeneuve, Fauchet, Boilleau, Valazé, Cussy,\r\nMeillan; each being aware that the tribunal before which he must appear\r\nis the waiting room to the guillotine.--Decrees of condemnation are\r\npassed on the 12th of July against Birotteau, the 28 of July against\r\nBuzot, Barbaroux, Gorsas, Lanjuniais, Salles, Louvet, Bergoeing,\r\nPétion, Guadet, Chasset, Chambon, Lidon, Valady, Defermon, Kervelégen,\r\nLarivière, Rabaut-Saint-Étienne, and Lesage; pronounced outlaws and\r\ntraitors, they are to be led to the scaffold without trial as soon as\r\nthey can be got hold of.--Finally, on the 3rd of October, a great\r\nhaul of the net in the Assembly itself sweeps off the benches all the\r\ndeputies that still seem capable of any independence: the first thing is\r\nto close the doors of the hall, which is done by Amar, reporter of the\r\nCommittee of General Security;[11104] then, after a declamatory and\r\ncalumnious speech, which lasts two hours, he reads off names on two\r\nlists of proscriptions: forty-five deputies, more or less prominent\r\namong the Girondins, are to be at once summoned before the revolutionary\r\ntribunal; seventy-three others, who have signed secret protests against\r\nthe 31st of May and 2nd of June, are to be put in jail. No arguing!\r\nthe majority dares not even express an opinion. Some of the proscribed\r\nattempt to exculpate themselves, but they are not allowed to be heard;\r\nnone but the Montagnards have the floor, and they do no more than add\r\nto the lists, each according to personal enmity; Levasseur has Vigée put\r\ndown, and Duroi adds the name of Richon. One their names being called,\r\nall the poor creatures who happen to be inscribed, quietly advance and\r\n\"huddle together within the bar of the house, like lambs destined to\r\nslaughter,\" and here they are separated into two flocks; on the one hand\r\nthe seventy-three, and on the other, the ten or twelve who, with\r\nthe Girondins already kept under lock and key, are to furnish the\r\nsacramental and popular number, the twenty-two traitors, whose\r\npunishment is a requirement of the Jacobin imagination;[11105] on\r\nthe left, the batch for the prison; on the right, the batch for the\r\nguillotine.\r\n\r\nTo those who might be tempted to imitate them or defend them this is\r\na sufficient lesson.--Subject to the boos, hisses and insults from the\r\nhags lining the streets, the seventy-three[11106] are conducted to the\r\nprisoners' room in the town hall. This, already full, is where they pass\r\nthe night standing on benches, scarcely able to breathe. The next day\r\nthey are crammed into the prison for assassins and robbers, \"la Force,\"\r\non the sixth story, under the roof; in this narrow garret their beds\r\ntouch each other, while two of the deputies are obliged to sleep on the\r\nfloor for lack of room. Under the skylights, which serve for windows,\r\nand at the foot of the staircase are two pig-pens; at the end of\r\nthe apartment are the privies, and in one corner a night-tub, which\r\ncompletes the poisoning of the atmosphere already vitiated by this\r\ncrowded mass of human beings. The beds consist of sacks of\r\nstraw swarming with vermin; they are compelled to endure the\r\ndiscipline,[11107] rations and mess of convicts. And they are lucky to\r\nescape at this rate: for Amar takes advantage of their silent deportment\r\nto tax them with conspiracy; other Montagnards likewise want to arraign\r\nthem at the revolutionary Tribunal: at all events, it is agreed that the\r\nCommittee of General Security shall examine their records and maintain\r\nthe right of designating new culprits amongst them. For ten months\r\nthey thus remain under the knife, in daily expectation of joining the\r\ntwenty-two on the Place de la Révolution.--With respect to the latter,\r\nthe object is not to try them but to kill them, and the semblance of a\r\ntrial is simply judicial assassination; the bill of indictment against\r\nthem consists of club gossip; they are accused of having desired the\r\nrestoration of the monarchy, of being in correspondence with Pitt and\r\nCoburg;[11108] of having excited Vendée to insurrection. The betrayal\r\nof Dumouriez is imputed to them, also the murder of Lepelletier, and the\r\nassassination of Marat; while pretended witnesses, selected from amongst\r\ntheir personal enemies, come and repeat, like a theme agreed upon, the\r\nsame ill-contrived fable: nothing but vague allegations and manifest\r\nfalsehoods, not one definite fact, not once convincing document; the\r\nlack of proof is such that the trial has to be stopped as soon as\r\npossible. \"You brave b----forming the court,\" writes Hébert, \"don't\r\ntrifle away your time. Why so much ceremony in shortening the days of\r\nwretches whom the people have already condemned?\" Care is especially\r\ntaken not to let them have a chance to speak. The eloquence of\r\nVergniaud and logic of Guadet might turn the tables at the last\r\nmoment. Consequently, a prompt decree authorizes the tribunal to stop\r\nproceedings as soon as the jury becomes sufficiently enlightened, which\r\nis the case after the seventh session of the court, the record of death\r\nsuddenly greeting the accused, who are not allowed to defend themselves.\r\nOne of them, Valazé, stabs himself in open court, and the next day\r\nthe national head-chopper strikes off the remaining twenty heads in\r\nthirty-eight minutes.--Still more expeditious are the proceedings\r\nagainst the accused who avoid a trial. Gorsas, seized in Paris on\r\nthe 8th of October, is guillotined the same day. Birotteau, seized at\r\nBordeaux, on the 24th of October, mounts the scaffold within twenty-four\r\nhours. The others, tracked like wolves, wandering in disguise from one\r\nhiding-place to another, and most of them arrested in turn, have only\r\nchoice of several kinds of death. Cambon is killed in defending himself.\r\nLidon, after having defended himself, blows out his brains, Condorcet\r\ntakes poison in the guard-room of Bourg-la-Reine. Roland kills himself\r\nwith his sword on the highway. Clavière stabs himself in prison.\r\nRébecqui is found drowned in the harbor of Marseilles, and Pétion\r\nand Buzon half eaten by wolves on a moor of Saint-Emilion. Valady is\r\nexecuted at Périgueux, Dechézeau at Rochefort, Grangeneuve, Guadet,\r\nSalle and Barbaroux at Bordeaux, Coustard, Cussy, Rabout-Saint-Étienne,\r\nBernard, Masuyer, and Lebrun at Paris. Even those who resigned in\r\nJanuary, 1793, Kersaint and Manuel, atone with their lives for the crime\r\nof having sided with the \"Right\" and, of course, Madame Roland, who\r\nis taken for the leader of the party, is one of the first to be\r\nguillotined.[11109]--Of the one-hundred and eighty Girondins who led\r\nthe Convention, one hundred and forty have perished or are in prison,\r\nor fled under sentence of death. After such a curtailment and such an\r\nexample the remaining deputies cannot be otherwise than docile;[11110]\r\nneither in the central nor in the local government will the \"Mountain\"\r\nencounter resistance; its despotism is practically established, and all\r\nthat remains is to proclaim this in legal form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. Institutions of the Revolutionary Government\r\n\r\n     Institutions of the Revolutionary Government.--Its\r\n     principle, objects, proceedings, tools and structure.--The\r\n     Committee of Public Safety.--Subordination of the Convention\r\n     and ministry.--The use of the Committee of General Security\r\n     and the Revolutionary Tribunal.--Administrative\r\n     centralization.--Representatives on Mission, National Agents\r\n     and Revolutionary Committees.--Law of Lése-majesty.\r\n     --Restoration and Aggravation of the institutions of the old\r\n     monarchy.\r\n\r\nAfter the 2nd of August, on motion of Bazire, the Convention decrees\r\n\"that France is in revolution until its independence is recognized.\"\r\nwhich means[11111] that the period of hypocritical phrases has come to\r\nan end, that the Constitution was merely a signboard for a fair, and\r\nthat the charlatans who had made use of it no longer need it, that it is\r\nto be put away in the store containing other advertising material, that\r\nindividual, local and parliamentary liberties are abolished, that the\r\ngovernment is arbitrary and absolute, that no institution, law, dogma,\r\nor precedent affords any guarantee for it against the rights of the\r\npeople, that property and lives are wholly at its mercy, that there are\r\nno longer any rights of man.--Six weeks later, when, through the protest\r\nof the forty-five and the arrest of the seventy-three, obedience to the\r\nConvention is assured, all this is boldly and officially announced in\r\nthe tribune. \"Under the present circumstances of the Republic,\" says\r\nSt. Just, \"the Constitution cannot be implemented as this would enable\r\nattacks on liberty to take place because it would lack the violent\r\nmeasures necessary to repress these.\" We are no longer to govern\r\n\"according to maxims of natural peace and justice; these maxims are only\r\nvalid among the friends of liberty;\" but they are not applicable between\r\npatriots and the malevolent. The latter are \"outside our sovereignty,\"\r\nare lawless, excluded from the social pact, slaves in rebellion, to be\r\npunished or imprisoned, and, amongst the malevolent must be placed\r\n\"the indifferent[11112]\".--\"You are to punish whoever is passive in\r\nthe Republic and does nothing for it;\" for his passivity is treason and\r\nranks him among other public enemies. Now, between the people and its\r\nenemies, there is nothing in common but the sword; steel must control\r\nthose who cannot be ruled \"by justice\"; the monarchical and neutral\r\nmajority must be repressed (comprimé);\r\n\r\n\"The Republic will be founded only when the sans-culottes,[11113] the\r\nsole representatives of the nation, the only citizens, \"shall rule by\r\nright of conquest.\"[11114]\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this is more than clear. The régime of which St. Just\r\npresents the plan, is that by which every oligarchy of invaders installs\r\nand maintains itself over a subjugated nation. Through this régime, in\r\nGreece, ten thousand Spartans, after the Dorian invasion, mastered three\r\nhundred thousand helots and périocques; through this régime, in England,\r\nsixty thousand Normans, after the battle of Hastings, mastered two\r\nmillion Saxons; through this régime in Ireland, since the battle of the\r\nBoyne, two hundred thousand English Protestants have mastered a million\r\nof Catholic Irish; through this régime, the three hundred thousand\r\nJacobins of France will master the seven or eight millions of Girondins,\r\nFeuillants, Royalists or Indifferents.\r\n\r\nThis system of government is a very simple one and consist in\r\nmaintaining the subject population in a state of extreme helplessness\r\nand of extreme terror. To this end, it is disarmed;[11115] it is kept\r\nunder surveillance; all action in common is prohibited; its eyes should\r\nalways be directed to the up-lifted ax and to the prison doors always\r\nopen; it is ruined and decimated.--For the past six months all these\r\nrigors are decreed and applied,--disarmament of \"suspects,\" taxes on\r\nthe rich, the maximum against traders, requisitions on land-owners,\r\nwholesale arrests, rapid executions of sentences, arbitrary penalties of\r\ndeath, and publicized, multiplied tortures. For the past six months, all\r\nsorts of executive instruments are set up and put into operation:\r\nThe Committee of Public Safety, the Committee of General Security,\r\nambulating proconsuls with full power, local committees authorized\r\nto tax and imprison at will, a revolutionary army, a revolutionary\r\ntribunal. But, for lack of internal harmony and of central impulsion,\r\nthe machine only half works, the power not being sufficient and its\r\naction not sufficiently sweeping and universal.\r\n\r\n\"You are too remote from the conspiracies against you,\" says St.\r\nJust;[11116] \"it is essential that the sword of the law should\r\neverywhere be rapidly brandished and your arm be everywhere present\r\nto arrest crime.... The ministers confess that, beyond their first\r\nand second subordinates, they find nothing but inertia and\r\nindifference.\"--\"A similar apathy is found in all the government\r\nagents,\" adds Billaud-Varennes;[11117] \"the secondary authorities\r\nwhich are the strong points of the Revolution serve only to impede it.\"\r\nDecrees, transmitted through administrative channels, arrive slowly and\r\nare indolently applied. \"You are missing that co-active force which\r\nis the principle of being, of action, of execution.... Every good\r\ngovernment should possess a center of willpower and the levers connected\r\nwith it.... Every government activity should exclusively originate from\r\nthe central source.\"--\r\n\r\n\"In ordinary governments,\" says Couthon, finally,[11118] \"the right of\r\nelecting belongs to the people; you cannot take it away from them. In\r\nextraordinary governments all impulsion must come from the center; it is\r\nfrom the convention that elections must issue.... You would injure the\r\npeople by confiding the election of officials to them, because you would\r\nexpose them to electing men that would betray them.\"\r\n\r\n--The result is that the constitutional maxims of 1789 give way to\r\nradically opposed maxims; instead of subjecting the government to the\r\npeople, the people is made subject to the government. The hierarchy\r\nof the ancient régime is re-established under revolutionary terms, and\r\nhenceforth all powers, much more formidable than those of the ancient\r\nrégime, cease to be delegated from the depths to the summit and will\r\nhenceforth instead be delegated from the summit to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAt the summit, a committee of twelve members, similar to the former\r\nroyal council, exercises collective royalty; nominally, authority is\r\ndivided amongst the twelve; it is, in practice, concentrated in a few\r\nhands. Several members occupy only a subaltern position, and amongst\r\nthese, Barère, who, official secretary and mouthpiece, is always ready\r\nto make a speech or draft an editorial; others, with special functions,\r\nJean Bon St. André, Lindet, and above all, Prieur de la Côte d'Or and\r\nCarnot, confine themselves each to his particular department, navy, war,\r\nsupplies, with blank signatures, for which they give in return their\r\nsignatures to the political leaders; the latter, called \"the statesmen,\"\r\nRobespierre, Couthon, Saint-Just, Collot d'Herbois, Billaud-Varennes,\r\nare the real rulers providing overall direction. It is true that their\r\nmandate has to be renewed monthly; but this is a certainty, for, in the\r\npresent state of the Convention, its vote, required beforehand, becomes\r\nan almost vain formality. More submissive than the parliament of Louis\r\nXIV., the Convention adopts, without discussion, the decrees which the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety present to it ready made. It is no more than\r\na registry-office, and scarcely that, for it has relinquished its right\r\nof appointing its own committees, that office being assigned to the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety; it votes as a whole all lists of names which\r\nthe Committee send in.[11119] Naturally, none but the creatures of the\r\nlatter and the faithful are inscribed; thus, the whole legislative and\r\nparliamentary power belongs to it.--As to executive and administrative\r\npower, the ministers have become mere clerks of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety; \"they come every day at specified hours to receive its orders\r\nand acts;[11120] \"they submit to it \"the list with explanations, of all\r\nthe agents\" sent into the departments and abroad; they refer to it\r\nevery minute detail; they are its scribes, merely its puppets,\r\nso insignificant that they finally lose their title, and for the\r\n\"Commission on External Relations\" a former school-master is taken, an\r\ninept clubbist, bar-fly and the pillar of the billiard-room, scarcely\r\nable to read the documents brought to him to sign in the café where he\r\npasses his days.[11121]--Thus is the second power in the State converted\r\nby the Committee into a squad of domestics, while the foremost one is\r\nconverted into an audience of claqueurs.\r\n\r\nTo make them do their duty, it has two hands.--One, the right, which\r\nseizes people unawares by the collar, is the Committee of General\r\nSecurity, composed of twelve extreme Montagnards, such as Panis, Vadier,\r\nLe Bas, Geoffroy, David, Amar, La Vicomterie, Lebon and Ruhl, all\r\nnominated, that is to say, appointed by it, being its confederates and\r\nsubalterns. They are its lieutenants of police, and once a week they\r\ncome and take part in its labors, as formerly the Sartines, and\r\nthe Lenoirs assisted the Comptroller-general. A man who this secret\r\ncommittee deems a \"suspect,\" is suddenly seized, no matter who, whether\r\nrepresentative, minister, or general, and finds himself the next morning\r\nbehind the bars in one of the ten new Bastilles.--There, the other\r\nhand seizes him by the throat; this is the revolutionary tribunal, an\r\nexceptional court like the extraordinary commissions of the ancient\r\nrégime, only far more terrible. Aided by its police gang, the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety itself selects the sixteen judges and sixty\r\njurymen[11122] from among the most servile, the most furious, or the\r\nmost brutal of the fanatics:[11123] Fouquier-Tinville, Hermann, Dumas,\r\nPayan, Coffinhal, Fleuriot-Lescot, and, lower down on the scale,\r\napostate priests, renegade nobles, disappointed artists, infatuated\r\nstudio-apprentices, journeymen scarcely able to write their names,\r\nshoemakers, joiners, carpenters, tailors, barbers, former lackeys,\r\nan idiot like Ganney, a deaf man like Leroy-Dix-Août; their names and\r\nprofessions indicate all that is necessary to be told: these men are\r\nlicensed and paid murderers. The Jurymen themselves are allowed eighteen\r\nfrancs a day, so that they may attend to their business more leisurely.\r\nThis business consists in condemning without proof, without any\r\npleadings, and scarcely any examination, in a hurry, in batches,\r\nwhoever the Committee of Public Safety might send to them, even the most\r\nconfirmed Montagnards: Danton, who contrived the tribunal, will soon\r\ndiscover this.--it is through these two government institutions that the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety keeps every head under the cleaver and each\r\nhead, to avoid being struck off, bows down,[11124] in the provinces as\r\nwell as in Paris.\r\n\r\nThis has happened when the existing local hierarchy was replaced by\r\nnew authorities making the omnipotent will of the Committee present\r\neverywhere. Directly or indirectly, \"for all government measures or\r\nmeasures of public safety, all that relates to persons and the\r\ngeneral and internal police, all constituted bodies and all public\r\nfunctionaries, are placed under its inspection.\"[11125] You may imagine\r\nhow the risk of being guillotined weighed upon them.\r\n\r\nTo suppress in advance any tendency to administrative inertia, it has\r\nhad withdrawn from the too powerful, too much respected, department\r\ngovernments, \"too inclined to federalism,\" their departmental dominance\r\nand their \"political influence.\"[11126] It reduces these to the levying\r\nof taxes and the supervision of roads and canals; it purges them out\r\nthrough its agents; it even purges out the governments of municipalities\r\nand districts. To suppress beforehand all probability of popular\r\nopposition, it has had the sessions of the sections reduced to two\r\nper week; it installs in these sections, for about forty sous a day,\r\na majority of sans-culottes; it orders the suspension \"until further\r\ndirectives\" of all municipal elections.[11127]\r\n\r\nFinally, to have full control on the spot, it appoints its own men,\r\nfirst, the commissioners and the representatives on missions, a sort of\r\ntemporary corps of directors sent into each department with unlimited\r\npowers;[11128] next, a body of national agents, a sort of permanent\r\nbody of sub-delegates, through whom in each district and municipality it\r\nreplaces the procureurs-syndics.[11129] To this army of functionaries is\r\nadded in each town, bourg or large village, a revolutionary committee,\r\npaid three francs a day per member, charged with the application of its\r\ndecrees, and required to make reports thereon. Never before was such\r\na vast and closely woven network cast from above to envelope and keep\r\ncaptive twenty-six million people. Such is the real constitution which\r\nthe Jacobins substitute for the constitution they have prepared for\r\nshow. In the arsenal of the monarchy which they destroyed they took the\r\nmost despotic institutions--centralization, Royal Council, lieutenants\r\nof police, special tribunals, intendants and sub-delegates; they\r\ndisinterred the antique Roman law of lèse-majesty, refurbished old\r\nblades which civilization had dulled, aiming them at every throat and\r\nnow wielded at random against liberties, property and lives. It is\r\ncalled the \"revolutionary government;\" according to official statements\r\nit is to last until peace is secured; in the minds of genuine Jacobins\r\nit must continue until all the French have been regenerated in\r\naccordance with the formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1101: Titus Flavious Clemens, (Greek writer born in Athens\r\naround 150 and dead in Cappadoce in 250) He lived in Alexandria.

THE JACOBIN PROGRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE JACOBIN PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Doctrine.\r\n\r\n     Program of the Jacobin party.--Abstract principle and\r\n     spontaneous development of the theory.\r\n\r\nNothing is more dangerous than a general idea in narrow and empty minds:\r\nas they are empty, it finds no knowledge there to interfere with it; as\r\nthey are narrow it is not long before it occupies the place entirely.\r\nHenceforth they no longer belong to themselves but are mastered by it;\r\nit works in them and through them, the man, in the true sense of the\r\nword, being possessed. Something which is not himself, a monstrous\r\nparasite, a foreign and disproportionate conception, lives within\r\nhim, developing and giving birth to the evil purposes with which it is\r\npregnant. He did not foresee that he would have them; he did not know\r\nwhat his dogma contained, what venomous and murderous consequences were\r\nto issue from it. They issue from it fatally, each in its turn, and\r\nunder the pressure of circumstances, at first anarchical consequences\r\nand now despotic consequences. Having obtained power, the Jacobin brings\r\nhis fixed idea along with him; whether at the head of the government or\r\nin opposition to it, this idea is fruitful, and the all-powerful dogma\r\nprojects over a new domain the innumerable links of its endless chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. A Communist State.\r\n\r\n     The Jacobin concept of Society.--The Contrat-Social.--Total\r\n     surrender of the Individual to the Community.--Everything\r\n     belongs to the State.--Confiscations and Sequestrations.\r\n     --Pre-emption and requisition and requisition of produce and\r\n     merchandise.--Individuals belong to the State.--Drafts of\r\n     persons for Military service.--Drafts of persons for the\r\n     Civil service.--The State philanthropist, educator,\r\n     theologian, moralist, censor and director of ideas and\r\n     intimate feelings.\r\n\r\nLet us trace this inward development and go back, along with the\r\nJacobin, to first principles, to the original pact, to the first\r\norganization of society. There is but one just and sound society, the\r\none founded on the \"contrat-social,\" and\r\n\r\n\"the clauses of this contract, fully understood, reduce themselves to\r\none, the total transfer of each individual, with all his rights, to\r\nthe community,.... each surrendering himself up absolutely, just as\r\nhe actually stands, he and all his forces, of which the property he\r\npossesses forms a part.\"[2101]\r\n\r\nThere must be no exception or reservation. Nothing of what he previously\r\nwas, or had, now belongs to him in his own right; henceforth, what he\r\nis, or has, devolves upon him only through delegation. His property\r\nand his person now form a portion of the commonwealth. If he is in\r\npossession of these, his ownership is at second hand; if he derives\r\nany benefit there from, it is as a concession. He is their depository,\r\ntrustee and administrator, and nothing more.[2102] In other words, with\r\nrespect to these he is simply a managing director, that is to say\r\na functionary like others, with a precarious appointment and always\r\nrevocable by the State which has appointed him.\r\n\r\n\"As nature gives to every man absolute power over the members of his\r\nbody the social pact gives the social body absolute power over all its\r\nmembers.\"\r\n\r\nThe State, as omnipotent sovereign and universal proprietor,\r\nexercises at discretion, its boundless rights over persons and things;\r\nconsequently we, its representatives, take all things and persons into\r\nour hands; as they belong to it, so do they belong to us.\r\n\r\nWe have confiscated the possessions of the clergy, amounting to\r\nabout four billion livres; we confiscate the property of the emigrés,\r\namounting to three billion livres;[2103] we confiscate the property\r\nof the guillotined and deported: all this amounts to some hundreds of\r\nmillions; later on, the count will be made, because the list remains\r\nopen and is being daily added to. We will sequestrate the property of\r\n\"suspects,\" which gives us the right to use it: here are many hundred\r\nmillions more; after the war and the banishment of \"suspects,\" we shall\r\nseize the property along with its income: here, again, are billions of\r\ncapital.[2104] Meanwhile we take the property of hospitals and of other\r\nbenevolent institutions, about eight hundred million livres; we take the\r\nproperty of factories, of endowments, of educational institutions, and\r\nof literary and scientific associations: another lot of millions.[2105]\r\nWe take back the domains rented or surrendered by the State for the\r\npast three centuries and more, which gives again about a couple of\r\nbillions.[2106] We take the possessions of the communes up to the amount\r\nof their indebtedness. We have already received as inheritance the\r\nancient domains of the crown, also the later domain of the civil list.\r\nMore than three-fifths[2107] of the soil thus falls into our hands,\r\nwhich three-fifths are much the best stocked; they comprise almost\r\nall the large and fine edifices, châteaux, abbeys, mansions, houses of\r\nsuperintendents and nearly all the royal, episcopal, seigniorial and\r\nbourgeois stock of rich and elegant furniture; all plate, libraries,\r\npictures and artistic objects accumulated for centuries.--Remark, again,\r\nthe seizure of specie and all other articles of gold and silver; in the\r\nmonths alone of November and December, 1793, this swoop puts into our\r\ncoffers three or four hundred millions,[2108] not assignats, but ringing\r\ncoin. In short, whatever the form of established capital may be we take\r\nall we can get hold of, probably more than three-fourths of it.--There\r\nremains the portion which is not fixed capital, that which disappears\r\nin use, namely, all that is consumed, all the fruits of the soil, every\r\ndescription of provision, all the products of human art and labor\r\nwhich contribute the maintenance of existence. Through \"the right of\r\npre-emption\" and through the right of \"requisition,\" \"the Republic\r\nbecomes temporary proprietor of whatever commerce, manufacture and\r\nagriculture have produced and added to the soil of France: \"all food and\r\nmerchandise is ours before being owned by their holder. We carry out of\r\nhis house whatever suits us; we pay him for this with worthless paper;\r\nwe frequently do not pay him at all. For greater convenience, we seize\r\nobjects directly and wherever we find them, grain in the farmer's barn,\r\nhay in the reaper's shed, cattle in the fold, wine in the vats, hides\r\nat the butcher's, leather in the tanneries, soap, tallow, sugar, brandy,\r\ncloths, linens and the rest, in stores, depots and ware-houses. We stop\r\nvehicles and the horses in the street. We enter the premises of mail\r\nor coach contractors and empty their stables. We carry away kitchen\r\nutensils to obtain the copper; we turn people out of their rooms to get\r\ntheir beds; we strip them of their coats and shirts; in one day, we make\r\nten thousand individuals in one town go barefoot.[2109]\r\n\r\n\"When public needs require it,\" says representative Isoré, \"all belongs\r\nto the people and nothing to individuals.\"\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the same right we dispose of persons as we do of things. We\r\ndecree the levy en masse and, stranger still, we carry it out, at least\r\nin many parts of the country, and we keep it up for months: in Vendée,\r\nand in the northern and eastern departments, it is the entire male,\r\nable-bodied population, up to fifty years of age, which we drive in\r\nherds against the enemy.[2110] We afterwards sign an entire generation\r\non, all young men between eighteen and twenty-five, almost a million of\r\nmen:[2111] whoever fails to appear is put in irons for ten years; he is\r\nregarded as a deserter; his property is confiscated, and his family is\r\npunished as well; later he is classed with the emigrants, condemned to\r\ndeath, and his father, mother and progenitors, treated as \"suspects,\"\r\nimprisoned and their possessions taken.--To clothe, shoe and equip\r\nour recruits, we must have workmen; we summon to head-quarters all\r\ngunsmiths, blacksmiths and locksmiths, all the tailors and shoemakers of\r\nthe district, \"foremen, apprentices and boys;\"[2112] we imprison those\r\nwho do not come; we install the rest in squads in public buildings\r\nand assign them their tasks; they are forbidden to furnish anything to\r\nprivate individuals. Henceforth, French shoemakers must work only for\r\nus, and each must deliver to us, under penalty, so many pairs of shoes\r\nper decade.[2113]--But, the civil service is no less important than the\r\nmilitary service, and to feed the people is as urgent as it is to defend\r\nthem. Hence we put \"in requisition all who have anything to do with\r\nhandling, transporting or selling provisions and articles of prime\r\nnecessity,\"[2114] especially combustibles and food--wood-choppers,\r\ncarters, raftsmen, millers, reapers, threshers, wine-growers, movers,\r\nfield-hands, \"country people\" of every kind and degree. Their hands\r\nbelong to us: we make them bestir themselves and work under the penalty\r\nof fine and imprisonment. There shall be no idlers, especially in crop\r\ntime: we take the entire population of a commune or canton into the\r\nfields, comprising \"the lazy of both sexes;\"[2115] willingly or not,\r\nthey shall do the harvesting under our eyes, banded together in fields\r\nbelonging to others as well as in their own, and they shall put the\r\nsheaves indiscriminately into the public granary.\r\n\r\nBut in labor all hangs together, from the initial undertaking to the\r\nfinal result, from the raw material to the most finished production,\r\nfrom the great manufacturer down to the pettiest jobber; grasping the\r\nfirst link of the chain involves grasping the last one. The requisition\r\nhere again answers the purpose: we apply it to all pursuits; each is\r\nbound to continue his own; the manufacturer to manufacture, the trader\r\nto trade, even to his own detriment, because, if he works at a loss, the\r\npublic profits, and every good citizen ought to prefer public profit to\r\nhis own profit.[2116] In effect, let his office be what it will, he\r\nis an employee of the community; therefore, the community may not only\r\nprescribe task-work to him, but select his task; it need not consult\r\nhim in the matter, for he has no right to refuse. Hence it is that we\r\nappoint or maintain people in spite of themselves, in the magistracy,\r\nin the army and in every other species of employment. In vain may they\r\nexcuse themselves or try get out of the way; they must remain or\r\nbecome generals, judges, mayors, national agents, town councilors,\r\ncommissioners of public welfare or administration,[2117] even against\r\ntheir will. Too bad for them if the responsibility is expensive or\r\ndangerous, if they have no time for leisure, if they do not feel\r\nthemselves qualified for it, if the rank or services seems to them to\r\nlead to a prison or the guillotine; when they declare that the work is\r\nforced labor we reply that they liable to work for the State.--Such is,\r\nhenceforth, the condition of all Frenchmen, and likewise of all French\r\nwomen. We force mothers to take their daughters to the meetings of\r\npopular clubs. We oblige women to parade in companies, and march in\r\nprocession at republican festivals; we invade the family and select\r\nthe most beautiful to be draped as antique goddesses, and publicly\r\npromenaded on a chariot; we sometimes even designate those among the\r\nrich who must wed patriots[2118]: there is no reason why marriage, which\r\nis the most important of all services, should not be put in requisition\r\nlike the others.--Accordingly, we enter families, we carry of the\r\nchild, we subject him to a civic education. We are schoolmasters,\r\nphilanthropists, theologians, and moralists. We impose by force our\r\nreligion and our ritual, our morality and our social customs. We lord it\r\nover private lives and consciences; we dictate ideas, we scrutinize and\r\npunish secret inclinations, we tax, imprison and guillotine not only\r\nthe evil-disposed, but again \"the indifferent, the moderate and the\r\negoists.\"[2119] Over and above his visible acts we dictate to the\r\nindividual his ideas and his deepest feelings; we prescribe to him his\r\naffections as well as his beliefs, and, according to a preconceived\r\ntype, we refashion his intellect, his conscience and his sensibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The object of the State is the regeneration of man.\r\n\r\n     The object of the State is the regeneration of man.--Two\r\n     sides to this undertaking.--Restoration of the Natural man.\r\n     --Formation of the Social man.--Grandeur of the undertaking.\r\n     --To carry it out, the use of force is a right and a duty.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing arbitrary in this operation; for the ideal model is\r\ntraced beforehand. If the State is omnipotent, it is for the purpose of\r\n\"regenerating Mankind,\" and the theory which confers its rights, at the\r\nsame time assigns to it its object. In what does this regeneration\r\nof Man consist?--Consider a domestic animal such as a dog or a horse.\r\nScrawny, battered, tied up or chained, a thousand are strained and\r\noverworked compared to the few basking in idleness, dying from rich\r\nliving; and with all of them, whether fat or lean, the soul is more\r\nspoiled than the body. A superstitious respect keeps them cowed under\r\ntheir burden, or makes them cringe before their master. Servile,\r\nslothful, gluttonous, feeble, incapable of resisting adversity, if they\r\nhave acquired the miserable skills of slavery, they have also contracted\r\nits needs, weaknesses and vices. A crust of absurd habits and perverse\r\ninclinations, a sort of artificial and supplementary being, has covered\r\nover their original nature.--And, on the other hand, the better side of\r\ntheir original nature has had no chance to develop itself, for lack of\r\nuse. Separated from the other, these two parts of its nature have\r\nnot acquired the sentiment of community; they do not know, like their\r\nbrethren of the prairies, how to help each other and subordinate private\r\ninterests to the interests of the flock. Each pulls his own way,\r\nnobody cares for others, all are egoists; social interests have\r\nmiscarried.--Such is Man nowadays, a disfigured slave that has to be\r\nrestored. Our task, accordingly is two-fold: we have to demolish and we\r\nhave to construct; we must first set free the natural Man that we may\r\nafterwards build up the social Man.\r\n\r\nIt is a vast enterprise and we are conscious of its vastness.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary,\" says Billaud-Varennes,[2120] \"that the people to\r\nwhich one desires to restore their freedom should in some way be created\r\nanew, since old prejudices must be destroyed, old habits changed,\r\ndepraved affections improved, superfluous wants restricted, and\r\ninveterate vices extirpated.\"\r\n\r\nBut the task is sublime, as the aim is \"to fulfill the desires of\r\nnature,[2121] accomplish the destinies of humanity, and fulfill the\r\npromises of philosophy\".--\"Our purpose,\" says Robespierre,[2122] \"is\r\nto substitute morality for egoism, honesty for honor, principles for\r\ncustom, duties for etiquette, the empire of reason for the tyranny of\r\nfashion, contempt of vice for indifference to misfortune, pride for\r\narrogance, a noble mind for vanity, love of glory for the love of\r\nprofit, good people for high society, merit for intrigue, genius for\r\nintellectual brilliancy, the charm of contentment for the boredom of\r\nvoluptuous pleasure, the majesty of Man for the high-breeding of\r\nthe great, a magnanimous, powerful and happy people for an amiable,\r\nfrivolous and wretched people, that is to say, every virtue and miracle\r\nof the Republic in the place of the vices and absurdities of the\r\nmonarchy.\"\r\n\r\nWe will do this, the whole of it, whatever the cost. Little do we care\r\nfor the present generation: we are working for generations to come.\r\n\r\n\"Man, forced to isolate himself from society, anchors himself in\r\nthe future and presses to his heart a posterity innocent of existing\r\nevils.\"[2123]\r\n\r\nHe sacrifices to this work his own and the lives of others.\r\n\r\n\"On the day that I am persuaded,\" writes Saint-Just, \"that it is\r\nimpossible to render the French people kind, energetic, tender and\r\nrelentless against tyranny and injustice, I will stab myself.\"\r\n\r\n--\"What I have done in the South I will do in the North,\" says Baudot;\r\n\"I will convert them into patriots; either they or I must die.\"--\r\n\r\n\"We will make France a cemetery,\" says Carrier, \"rather than not\r\nregenerate it our own way.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain may the ignorant or the vicious protest; they protest because\r\nthey are ignorant or vicious. In vain may the individual plead his\r\npersonal rights; he has none: through the social contract, which is\r\nobligatory and solely valid, he has surrendered his entire being; having\r\nmade no reservation, \"he has nothing to claim.\" Undoubtedly, some will\r\ngrumble, because, with them, the old wrinkle remains and artificial\r\nhabits still cover over the original instinct. Untie the mill-horse, and\r\nhe will still go round in the same track; let the mountebank's dog be\r\nturned loose, and he will still raise himself on his hind-legs; if we\r\nwould bring them back to their natural gait we must handle them roughly.\r\nIn like manner, to restore Man to his normal attitude, you must handle\r\nhim roughly. But, in this respect, have no scruples,[2124] for we do not\r\nbow him down, we raise him up; as Rousseau says, \"we compel him to be\r\nfree;\" we confer on him the greatest boon a human being can receive; we\r\nbring him back to nature and to justice. For this reason, now that he\r\nis warned, if he persists in his resistance, he is a criminal and merits\r\nevery kind of chastisements[2125], for, he declares himself a rebel and\r\na perjurer, inimical to humanity, and a traitor to the social compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Two distortions of the natural man.\r\n\r\n     Two distortions of the natural man.--Positive religion.\r\n     --Proscription of the orthodox cult.--Measures against unsworn\r\n     priests.--Measures against the loyal orthodox.--Destruction\r\n     of the constitutional cult.--Pressure on the sworn priests.\r\n     --Churches closed and ceremonies suppressed.--Continuation of\r\n     these persecutions until the Consulate.\r\n\r\nLet us (Taine lets the Jacobin say) begin by figuring to ourselves the\r\nnatural man; certainly we of to-day have some difficulty in recognizing\r\nhim; he bears but little resemblance to the artificial being who (in\r\n1789) stands in his shoes, the creature which an antiquated system of\r\nconstraint and fraud has deformed, held fast in his hereditary harness\r\nof thralldom and superstition, blinded by his religion and held in check\r\nby prestige, exploited by his government and tamed by dint of blows,\r\nalways with a halter on, always put to work in the wrong way and against\r\nnature, whatever stall he may occupy, high or low, however full or\r\nempty his crib may be, now in menial service like the blinded hack-horse\r\nturning the mill-wheel, and now on parade like a trained dog which,\r\ndecked with flags, shows off its antics before the public.[2126] But\r\nimagine all these out of the way, the flags and the bands, the fetters\r\nand compartments in the social stable, and you will see a new man\r\nappearing, the original man, intact and healthy in mind, soul and\r\nbody.--In this condition, he is free of prejudice, he is not ensnared in\r\na net of lies, he is neither Jew, Protestant nor Catholic; if he tries\r\nto imagine the universe as a whole and the principle of events, he will\r\nnot let himself be duped by a pretended revelation; he will listen only\r\nto his own reason; he may chance, now and then, to become an atheist,\r\nbut, generally, he will settle down into a deist.--In this condition\r\nof things he is not fettered by a hierarchy; he is neither noble nor\r\ncommoner, land-owner nor tenant, inferior nor superior. Independent\r\nof the others, all are equal, and, if all agree in the forming of an\r\nassociation, their common-sense will stipulate that its first article\r\nshall secure the maintenance of this primordial equality.--Such is man,\r\nas nature made him, as history has unmade him, and as the Revolution is\r\nto re-make him.[2127] One cannot batter away too vigorously against the\r\ntwo casings that hold him tight, one the positive religion which narrows\r\nand perverts his intellect, and the other the social inequality which\r\nperverts and weakens his will;[2128] for, at every effort, some band is\r\nloosened, and, as each band gives way, the paralyzed limbs recover their\r\naction.\r\n\r\nLet us trace, (say the Jacobins), the progress of this liberating\r\noperation.--Always timid and at loggerheads with the ecclesiastical\r\norganization, the Constituent Assembly could take only half-measures; it\r\ncut into the bark without daring to drive the ax into the solid trunk.\r\nIts work reduced itself down to the confiscation of clerical property,\r\nto a dissolution of the religious orders, and to a check upon the\r\nauthority of the pope; its object was to establish a new church and\r\ntransform priests into sworn functionaries of the State, and this\r\nwas all. As if Catholicism, even administrative, would cease to be\r\nCatholicism! As if the noxious tree, once stamped with the public seal,\r\nwould cease to be noxious! Instead of the old laboratory of falsehoods\r\nbeing destroyed another one is officially established alongside of it,\r\nso that there are now two instead of one. With or without the official\r\nlabel it operates in every commune in France and, as in the past, it\r\ndistributes with impunity its drug to the public. This is precisely\r\nwhat we, (the Jacobins) cannot tolerate.--We must, indeed, keep up\r\nappearances, and, as far as words go, we will decree anew freedom\r\nof worship.[2129] But, in fact and in practice, we will demolish the\r\nlaboratory and prevent the drug from being sold; there shall no longer\r\nbe any Catholic worship in France, no baptism, no confession, no\r\nmarriage, no extreme unction, no mass; nobody shall preach or listen\r\nto a sermon; nobody shall administer or receive a sacrament, save\r\nin secret, and with the prospect before him of imprisonment or the\r\nscaffold.--With this object in mind, we do one thing at a time. There\r\nis no problem with the Church claiming to be be orthodox: its members\r\nhaving refused to take the oath are outlaws; one excludes oneself\r\nfrom an association when one repudiates the pact; they have lost their\r\nqualifications as citizens and have become ordinary foreigners under\r\nthe surveillance of the police; and, as they propagate around them\r\ndiscontent and disobedience, they are not only foreigners but seditious\r\npersons, enemies in disguise, the authors of a secret and widespread\r\nVendée; it is not necessary for us to prosecute them as charlatans, it\r\nis sufficient to strike them down as rebels. As such, we have already\r\nbanished from France all unsworn ecclesiastics, about forty thousand\r\npriests, and we are deporting those who did not cross the frontier\r\nwithin the allotted time: we allow only sexagenarians and the infirm to\r\nremain on French soil, and, again, as prisoners and in seclusion; they\r\nincur the penalty of death if they do not of their own accord report to\r\nthe prisons of their country town; the banished who return home incur\r\nthe penalty of death, and there is penalty of death against those who\r\nshelter priests.[2130] Consequently, in default of an orthodox clergy,\r\nthere must no longer be an orthodox worship; the most dangerous of the\r\ntwo manufactories of superstition is shut down. That the sale of this\r\npoisonous food may be more surely stopped we punish those who ask for it\r\nthe same as those who provide it, and we prosecute not only the pastors,\r\nbut, again, the fanatics of the flock; if these are not the authors of\r\nthe ecclesiastical rebellion they are its promoters and accomplices.\r\nNow, thanks to the schism among them, we already know who they are,\r\nand, in each commune, the list is made out. We style as fanatics all who\r\nreject the ministry of the sworn priests, the bourgeois who calls him an\r\ninterloper, all the nuns who do not confess to him, all the peasants who\r\nstay away from his mass, all the old women who do not kiss his paten,\r\nand all the relations of an infant who do not wish him to baptize it.\r\nAll these people and those who associate with them, whether allied,\r\nclose relatives, friends, guests or visitors, of whatever class, either\r\nmen or women, are seditious at heart, and, therefore, \"suspects.\" We\r\ndeprive them of their electoral rights, we withdraw their pensions, we\r\nimpose on them special taxation, we confine them to their dwellings, we\r\nimprison them by thousands, and guillotine them by hundreds; the\r\nrest will gradually become discouraged and abandon an impracticable\r\ncult.[2131]--The lukewarm remain, the sheep-like crowd which holds on\r\nto its rites: the Constituent Assembly will seize them wherever it finds\r\nthem, and, as they are the same in the authorized as in the refractory\r\nchurch, instead of seeking them with the priest who does not submit, it\r\nwill seek them with the one who does. But it will proceed without zeal,\r\nwithout confidence, often even with distrust, questioning itself whether\r\nthese rites, being administered by one who is excommunicated, are not of\r\ndoubtful quality. Such a church is not sound, and we have only to\r\ngive it a push to knock it down. We will do all we can to discredit\r\nconstitutional priests: we will prohibit them from wearing the\r\necclesiastical costume, and force them by law to bestow the nuptial\r\nbenediction on their apostate brethren; we will employ terror and\r\nimprisonment to constrain them to marry; we will given them no respite\r\nuntil they return to civil life, some admitting themselves to be\r\nimpostors, many by surrendering their priestly credentials, and most\r\nof them by resigning their places.[2132] Deprived of leaders by these\r\nvoluntary or forced desertions, the Catholic flock will allow itself\r\nto be easily led out of the fold, while, to remove all temptation to go\r\nback, we will tear the enclosure down. In the communes in which we are\r\nmasters we will make the Jacobins of the place demand the abolition\r\nof worship, while, in other communes, we will get rid of this\r\nauthoritatively through our missionary representatives. We will close\r\nthe churches, demolish the steeples, melt down the bells, send all\r\nsacred vessels to the Mint, smash the images of the saints, desecrate\r\nrelics, prohibit religious burials, impose the civil burial, prescribe\r\nrest during the décadi[2133] and labor on Sundays. No exception\r\nwhatever. Since all positive religions deal in error, we will outlaw\r\nthem all: we will exact from Protestant clergymen a public abjuration;\r\nwe will not let the Jews practice their ceremonies; we will have \"an\r\n'auto-da-fé,' of all the books and symbols of the faith of Moses.\"[2134]\r\nBut, of all these various juggling machines, the worst is the Catholic,\r\nthe most hostile to nature due to the celibacy of its priesthood, the\r\nmost opposed to reason in the absurdity of its dogmas, the most opposed\r\nto democracy, since its powers are delegated from above downwards,\r\nthe best protected from civil authority because its head is outside\r\nof France.[2135] Accordingly, we must be most furious against it; even\r\nafter Thermidor,[2136] we will keep up constant persecution, great and\r\nsmall; up to the Consulate, we will deport and shoot the priests, we\r\nwill revive against fanatics the laws of the Reign of Terror, we will\r\nhamper their movements, we will exhaust their patience; we will keep\r\nthem anxious during the day and restless at night; we will not give them\r\na moment's repose.[2137] We will restrict the population to the decadal\r\ncult only; we will change the market-days, so that no believer shall\r\nbe able to buy fish on a fast-day.[2138]--We have nothing more at heart\r\nthan this war against Catholicism; no article on our program will be\r\ncarried out with more determination and perseverance. The question\r\ninvolved is truth. We are its guardians, its champions, its ministers,\r\nand never did the servants of truth apply force with such minute detail\r\nand such effect to the extirpation of error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Equality and Inequality.\r\n\r\n     Social inequality.--Malice of the aristocratic race.\r\n     --Measures against the King and Nobles.--Malice of the\r\n     aristocracy of wealth.--Measures against landowners,\r\n     capitalists and people with incomes.--Destruction of large\r\n     fortunes.--Measures taken to prevent the large fortunes in\r\n     reconstituting themselves.\r\n\r\nNext to superstition there is another monster to be destroyed, and, also\r\nhere it was the Constituent Assembly that had begun the assault. But it\r\nhad also, through lack of courage or of logic, it stopped, after two or\r\nthree feeble blows:\r\n\r\n* Banning of heraldic insignia, titles of nobility and territorial\r\nnames;\r\n\r\n* abolition, without indemnity, of all the dues belonging to the\r\nseigneur by right of his former proprietorship over persons;\r\n\r\n* abolition of the permission to purchase other feudal rights at a price\r\nagreed upon,\r\n\r\n* limitation of royal power. This was little enough. When it concerns\r\nusurpers and tyrants they must be treated in another fashion; for their\r\nprivilege is, of itself, an outrage on the rights of man. Consequently,\r\n\r\n* we (the Jacobins) have dethroned the King and cut off his head;[2139]\r\n\r\n* we have suppressed, without indemnity, the entire feudal debt,\r\ncomprising the rights vested in the seigneurs by virtue of their being\r\nowners of real-estate, and merely lessors;\r\n\r\n* we have abandoned their persons and possessions to the claims and\r\nrancor of local jacqueries;\r\n\r\n* we have reduced them to emigration;\r\n\r\n* we imprison them if they stay at home;\r\n\r\n* we guillotine them if they return.\r\n\r\n(As the aristocrats are)Reared in habits of supremacy, and convinced\r\nthat they are of a different species from other men, the prejudices of\r\ntheir race are incorrigible; they are incapable of companionship with\r\ntheir social equals; we cannot too carefully crush them out, or, at the\r\nvery least, hold them firmly down.[2140] Besides, they are guilty from\r\nthe fact of having existed; for, they have taken both the lead and the\r\ncommand without any right to do so, and, in violation of all right, they\r\nhave misused mankind; having enjoyed their rank, it is but just that\r\nthey should pay for it. Privileged in reverse, they must be treated the\r\nsame as vagabonds were treated under their reign,\r\n\r\n* stopped by the police and sent off with their families into the\r\ninterior,\r\n\r\n* crowded into prisons,\r\n\r\n* executed in a mass, or, at least,\r\n\r\n* expelled from Paris, the seaports and fortified towns, put on the\r\nlimits,\r\n\r\n* compelled to present themselves daily at the municipality,\r\n\r\n* deprived of their political rights,\r\n\r\n* excluded from public offices, \"popular clubs, committees of\r\nsupervision and from communal and section assemblages.\"[2141]\r\n\r\nEven this is indulgence; branded with infamy, we ought to class them\r\nwith galley-slaves, and set them to work on the public highways.[2142]\r\n\r\n\"Justice condemns the people's enemies and the partisans of tyranny to\r\neternal slavery.\"[2143]\r\n\r\nBut that is not enough, because, apart from the aristocracy of rank,\r\nthere are other aristocracies which the Constituent Assembly has left\r\nuntouched,[2144] especially the aristocracy of wealth. Of all the\r\nsovereignties, that of the rich man over the poor one is the most\r\nburdensome. In effect, not only, in contempt of equality, does he\r\nconsume more than his share of the common products of labor, and without\r\nproducing anything himself, but again, in contempt of liberty, he may\r\nfix wages as he pleases, and, in contempt of humanity, he always fixes\r\nthem at the lowest point. Between himself and the needy he never makes\r\nother than the most unjust contracts. Sole possessor of land, capital\r\nand the necessities of life, he imposes conditions which others,\r\ndeprived of means, are forced to accept at the risk of starvation; he\r\nspeculates at his discretion on wants which cannot be put off, and makes\r\nthe most of his monopoly by maintaining the poor in their destitute\r\nsituations. That is why, writes Saint Just:[2145]\r\n\r\n\"Opulence is a disgrace; for every thousand livres expenditure of this\r\nkind a smaller number of natural or adopted children can be looked\r\nafter.\"--\r\n\r\n\"The richest Frenchman,\" says Robespierre, \"ought not to have now more\r\nthree thousand livres rental.\"--\r\n\r\nBeyond what is strictly necessary, no property is legitimate; we have\r\nthe right to take the superfluous wherever we find it. Not only to-day,\r\nbecause we now require it for the State and for the poor, but at all\r\ntimes, because the superfluous, in all times, confers on its owner an\r\nadvantage in contracts, a control of wages, an arbitrary power over\r\nthe means of living, in short, a supremacy of condition worse than\r\npreeminence in rank. Consequently, our hand is not only against the\r\nnobles, but also against the rich and well-to-do bourgeois[2146] the\r\nlarge land-owners and capitalists; we are going to demolish their crafty\r\nfeudalism from top to bottom.[2147]--In the first place, and merely\r\nthrough the effect of the new institutions, we prevent any capitalist\r\nfrom deducting, as he is used to do, the best portion of the fruits of\r\nanother's labor; the hornets shall no longer, year after year, consume\r\nthe honey of the bees. To bring this about, we have only to let the\r\nassignats (paper money) and their forced rate (of exchange) work things\r\nout. Through the depreciation of paper-money, the indolent land-owner\r\nor capitalist sees his income melting away in his hands; his receipts\r\nconsist only of nominal values. On the 1st of January, his tenant pays\r\nhim really for a half term instead of a full term; on the 1st of March,\r\nhis farmer settles his account with a bag of grain.[2148] The effect\r\nis just the same as if we had made fresh contracts, and reduced by\r\none-half, three-quarters, or, even more, the rate of interest on loans,\r\nthe rent of houses and the leases of farm lands.--Whilst the revenue of\r\nthe landlord evaporates, his capital melts away, and we do the best\r\nwe can to help this along. If he has claims on ancient corporations\r\nor civil and religious establishments of any description, whether\r\nprovincial governments, congregations, associations, endowments or\r\nhospitals, we withdraw his special guarantee; we convert his title-deeds\r\ninto a state annuity, we combine his private fortune with the public\r\nfortune whether he will or not, we drag him into the universal\r\nbankruptcy, toward which we are conducting all the creditors of the\r\nRepublic.[2149]--Besides, to ruin him, we have more direct and prompt\r\nmeans. If an émigré, and there are hundreds of thousands of émigrés, we\r\nconfiscate his possessions. If he has been guillotined or deported, and\r\nthere are tens of thousands of these, we confiscate his possessions.\r\nIf he is \"recognized as an enemy of the Revolution,\"[2150] and \"all\r\nthe rich pray for the counter-revolution,\"[2151] we sequestrate his\r\nproperty, enjoying the usufruct of it until peace is declared, and we\r\nshall have the property after the war is over. Usufruct or property, the\r\nState, in either case, inherits; at the most we might grant temporary\r\naid to the family, which is not even entitled to maintenance.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to uproot fortunes more thoroughly. As to those which\r\nare not at once eradicated we get rid of them piecemeal, and against\r\nthese we employ two axes:\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we decree the principle of progressive taxation, and\r\non this basis we establish the forced loan:[2152] in incomes, we\r\ndistinguish between the essential and the surplus; we fix according as\r\nthe excess is greater or less we take a quarter, a third or the half of\r\nit, and, when above nine thousand francs, the whole; beyond its small\r\nalimentary reserve, the most opulent family will keep only four thousand\r\nfive hundred francs income.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we cut deep into capital through revolutionary taxes;\r\nour committees and provincial proconsuls levy arbitrarily what suits\r\nthem, three hundred, five hundred, up to one million two hundred\r\nthousand francs,[2153] on this or that banker, trader, bourgeois or\r\nwidow, payable within a week; all the worse for the person taxed if he\r\nor she has no money on hand and is unable to borrow it; we declare them\r\n\"suspects,\" we imprison them, we sequestrate their property and the\r\nState enjoys it in their place.\r\n\r\nIn any event, even when the amount is paid, we force him or her\r\nto deposit their silver and gold coin in our hands, sometimes with\r\nassignats as security, and often nothing; henceforth, money must\r\ncirculate and the precious metals are in requisition;[2154] everybody\r\nwill deliver up what plate he possesses. And let nobody presume to\r\nconceal his hoard; all treasure, whether silver-plate, diamonds,\r\ningots, gold or silver, coined or un-coined, \"discovered, or that may\r\nbe discovered, buried in the ground or concealed in cellars, inside of\r\nwalls or in garrets, under floors, pavements, or hearthstones, or in\r\nchimneys and other hiding places,\"[2155] becomes the property of\r\nthe Republic, with a premium of twenty per cent. in assignats to the\r\ninformer.--As, furthermore, we make requisitions for bed-linen, beds,\r\nclothes, provisions, wines and the rests, along with specie and precious\r\nmetals, the condition of the mansion may be imagined, especially after\r\nwe have lodged in it; it is the same as if the house had been on fire;\r\nall movable property and all real estate have perished.--Now that both\r\nare destroyed they must not be allowed to accumulate again. To ensure\r\nthis,\r\n\r\n1. we abolish, according to rule, the freedom of bequest,[2156]\r\n\r\n2. we prescribe equal and obligatory divisions of all\r\ninheritances;[2157]\r\n\r\n3. we include bastards in this under the same title as legitimate\r\nchildren;\r\n\r\n4. we admit representation à l'infini,[2158] \"in order to multiply heirs\r\nand parcel out inheritances;\"[2159]\r\n\r\n5. we reduce the disposable portion to one-tenth, in the direct line,\r\nand one-sixth in a collateral line;\r\n\r\n6. we forbid any gift to persons whose income exceeds one thousand\r\nquintals of grain;\r\n\r\n7. we inaugurate adoption, \"an admirable institution,\" and essentially\r\nrepublican, \"since it brings about a division of large properties\r\nwithout a crisis.\"\r\n\r\nAlready, in the Legislative Assembly a deputy had stated that \"equal\r\nrights could be maintained only by a persistent tendency to uniformity\r\nof fortunes.\"[2160]\r\n\r\nWe have provided for this for the present day and we likewise provide\r\nfor it in the future.--None of the vast tumors which have sucked the\r\nsap of the human plant are to remain; we have cut them away with a few\r\ntelling blows, while the steady-moving machine, permanently erected\r\nby us, will shear off their last tendrils should they change to sprout\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Conditions requisite for making a citizen.\r\n\r\n     Conditions requisite for making a citizen.--Plans for\r\n     suppressing poverty.--Measures in favor of the poor.\r\n\r\nIn returning Man to his natural condition we have prepared for the\r\nadvent of the Social Man. The object now is to form the citizen, and\r\nthis is possible only through a leveling of conditions. In a well made\r\nsociety there shall be \"neither rich nor poor\"[2161]: we have already\r\ndestroyed the opulence which corrupts; it now remains for us to suppress\r\nthe poverty which degrades. Under the tyranny of material things, which\r\nis as oppressive as the tyranny of men, Man falls below himself. Never\r\nwill a citizen be made out of a poor fellow condemned to remain valet,\r\nhireling or beggar, reduced to thinking only of himself and his daily\r\nbread, asking in vain for work, or, plodding when he gets it, twelve\r\nhours a day at a monotonous pursuit, living like a beast of burden and\r\ndying in a alms-house.[2162] He should have his own bread, his own roof,\r\nand all that is indispensable for life; he must not be overworked, nor\r\nsuffer anxiety or constraint;\r\n\r\n\"he must live independently, respect himself, have a tidy wife and\r\nhealthy and robust children.\"[2163]\r\n\r\nThe community should guarantee him comfort, security, the certainty of\r\nnot going hungry if he becomes infirm, and, if he dies, of not leaving\r\nhis family in want.\r\n\r\n\"It is not enough,\" says Barère,[2164] \"to bleed the rich, to pull down\r\ncolossal fortunes; the slavery of poverty must be banished from the soil\r\nof the Republic. No more beggars, no more almsgiving, no poor-houses\".\r\n\r\n\"The poor and unfortunates,\" says Saint Just, \"are the powerful of the\r\nearth; they have a right to speak as masters to the governments which\r\nneglect them;[2165] they have a right to national charity.... In a\r\ndemocracy under construction, every effort should be made to free people\r\nfrom having to battle for the bare minimum needed for survival; by labor\r\nif he is fit for work, by education if he is a child, or with public\r\nassistance if he is an invalid or in old age.\"[2166]\r\n\r\nAnd never had the moment been so favorable. \"Rich in property, the\r\nRepublic now expects to use the many millions the rich would have spent\r\non a counter revolution for the improvement of the conditions of its\r\nless fortunate citizens... Those who would assassinate liberty have made\r\nit the richer. The possessions of conspirators exist for the benefit of\r\nthe unfortunate.\"[2167]--Let the poor take with a clear conscience: it\r\nis not a charity but \"an indemnity\" which we provide for them; we save\r\ntheir pride by providing for their comfort, and we relieve them without\r\nhumiliating them.\r\n\r\n\"We leave charity and benevolent works to the monarchies; this insolent\r\nand shabby way of furnishing assistance is fit only for slaves and\r\nmasters; we substitute for it a system of national works, on a grand\r\nscale, over the whole territory of the Republic.\"[2168]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we cause a statement to be drawn up in each commune,\r\nof \"the condition of citizens without property,\" and \"of national\r\npossessions not disposed of;\" we divide these possession in small lots;\r\nwe distribute them \"in the shape of national sales\" to poor folks able\r\nto work. We give, \"through the form of rental, \"an acre to each head\r\nof a family who has less than an acre of his own. \"We thus bind all\r\ncitizens to the country as well as to property. We restore idle and\r\nrobust arms to the soil, and lost or weakened families to the workshops\r\nin the towns.\"--As to old and infirm farmers or craftsmen, also poor\r\nmothers, wives and widows of artisans and farmers, we keep in each\r\ndepartment a \"big ledger of national welfare;\" we inscribe thereon for\r\nevery thousand inhabitants, four farmers, two mechanics, five women,\r\neither mothers or widows; each registered person shall be pensioned\r\nby the State, the same as a maimed soldier; labor-invalids are as\r\nrespectable as war-invalids.--Over and above those who are thus aided\r\non account of poverty, we relieve and elevate the entire poor class, not\r\nalone the thirteen hundred thousand destitutes counted in France,[2169]\r\nbut, again, all who, having little or no means on hand, live from day\r\nto day on what they can earn. We have passed a law[2170] by which the\r\npublic treasury shall, through a tax on large fortunes, \"furnish to each\r\ncommune or district the necessary funds for adapting the price of bread\r\nto the rate of wages.\" Our representatives in the provinces impose\r\non the wealthy the obligation of \"lodging, feeding, and clothing all\r\ninfirm, aged, and indigent citizens and orphans of their respective\r\ncantons.\"[2171] Through the decree on monopolization and the\r\nestablishment of the \"maximum\" we bring within reach of the poor all\r\nobjects of prime necessity. We pay them forty sous a day for attending\r\ndistrict meetings; and three francs a day for serving on committees of\r\nsurveillance. We recruit from amongst them our revolutionary army;[2172]\r\nwe select amongst them the innumerable custodians of sequesters: in\r\nthis way, hundreds of thousands of sans-culottes enter into the various\r\npublic services.--At last, the poor are taken out of a state of poverty:\r\neach will now have his plot of ground, his salary or pension;\r\n\r\n\"in a well-ordered republic nobody is without some property.\"[2173]\r\n\r\nHenceforth, among individuals, the difference in welfare will be small;\r\nfrom the maximum to the minimum, there will be only a degree, while\r\nthere will be found in every dwelling about the same sort of household,\r\na plain, simple household, that of the small rural proprietor, well-off\r\nfarmer or factory foreman; that of Rousseau at Montmorency, or that\r\nof the Savoyard Vicar, or that of Duplay, the carpenter, with whom\r\nRobespierre lodges.[2174] There will be no more domestic servitude:\r\n\"only the bond of help and gratitude will exists between employer and\r\nemployee.\"[2175]--He who works for another citizen belongs to his family\r\nand sits at his table.\"[2176]--Through the transformation of lower\r\nsocial classes into middle class conditions we restore human dignity,\r\nand out of the proletarian, the valet and the workman, we begin to\r\nliberate the citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Socialist projects.\r\n\r\n     Repression of Egoism.--Measures against farmers,\r\n     manufacturers and merchants.--Socialist projects.\r\n     --Repression of Federalism.--Measures against the local,\r\n     professional and family spirit.\r\n\r\nTwo leading obstacles hinder the development of civism, and the first is\r\negoism. Whilst the citizen prefers the community to himself, the egoist\r\nprefers himself to the community. He cares only for his own interest, he\r\ngives no heed to public necessities; he sees none of the superior\r\nrights which take precedence of his derived right; he supposes that his\r\nproperty is his own without restriction or condition; he forgets\r\nthat, if he is allowed to use it, he must not use it to another's\r\ndetriment.[2177] This even the middle or low class, who possess goods\r\nessential for survival, will do. The greater the demand for these\r\ngoods the higher they raise their prices; soon, they sell only at an\r\nexorbitant rate, and worse still, stop selling and store their goods or\r\nproducts, in the expectation of selling them dearer. In this way, they\r\nspeculate on another's wants; they augment the general distress and\r\nbecome public enemies. Nearly all the agriculturists, manufacturers\r\nand tradesmen of the day, little and big, are public enemies--farmers,\r\ntenant farmers, market-gardeners, cultivators of every degree, as well\r\nas foremen, shopkeepers, especially wine-dealers, bakers and butchers.\r\n\r\n\"All merchants are essentially anti-revolutionaries, and would sell\r\ntheir country to gain a few pennies.\"[2178]\r\n\r\nWe will not tolerate this legal brigandage. Since \"agriculture has done\r\nnothing for liberty and has sought only its own gain,\"[2179] we will put\r\nit under surveillance, and, if necessary, under control. Since\r\n\"commerce has become a species of miserly tyrant,\" since \"it has become\r\nself-paralyzed,\" and, \"through a sort of anti-revolutionary contempt,\r\nneglected the manufacture, handling and expedition of diverse\r\nmaterials,\" we will thwart \"the calculations of its barbarous\r\narithmetic, and purge it of the aristocratic and corrupting fermentation\r\nwhich oppresses it.\" We make monopoly \"a capital crime;\"[2180] we call\r\nhim a monopolist who \"takes food and wares of prime necessity out of\r\ncirculation,\" and \"keeps them stored without daily and publicly offering\r\nthem for sale.\" Penalty of death against whoever, within eight days,\r\ndoes not make a declaration, or if he makes a false one. Penalty of\r\ndeath against the dealer who does not post up the contents of his\r\nwarehouse, or who does not keep open shop. Penalty of death against\r\nany person who keeps more bread on hand than he needs for his\r\nsubsistence.[2181] Penalty of death against the cultivator who does not\r\nbring his grain weekly to market. Penalty of death against the dealer\r\nwho does not post up the contents of his warehouse, or who does not keep\r\nopen shop. Penalty of death against the manufacturer who does not verify\r\nthe daily use of his workable material.--As to prices, we intervene\r\nauthoritatively between buyer and seller; we fix the maximum price for\r\nall objects which, near or remotely, serve to feed, warm and clothe man;\r\nwe will imprison whoever offers or demands anything more. Whether the\r\ndealer or manufacturer pays expenses at this rate, matters not; if,\r\nafter the maximum is fixed, he closes factory, or gives up business, we\r\ndeclare him a \"suspect;\" we chain him down to his pursuit, we oblige\r\nhim to lose by it.--This is the way to clip the claws of beasts of prey,\r\nlittle and big! But the claws grow out again, and, instead of paring\r\nthem down, it would probably be better to pull them out. Some amongst us\r\nhave already thought of that; the right of pre-emption shall be applied\r\nto every article; \"in each department, national storehouse might be\r\nestablished where farmers, land-owners and manufacturers would be\r\nobliged to deposit at a fixed price, paid down, the surplus of their\r\nconsumption of every species of merchandise. The nation would distribute\r\nthis merchandise to wholesale dealers, reserving a profit of six per\r\ncent. The profit of the wholesale dealer would be fixed at eight per\r\ncent and that of the retailer at twelve per cent.\"[2182] In this way,\r\nfarmers, manufacturers, and merchants would all become clerks of the\r\nState, appointed on a premium or a discount; unable to gain a great\r\ndeal, they would not be tempted to gain too much; they would cease to be\r\ngreedy and soon cease to be egoists.[2183]--Since, fundamentally,\r\negoism is the capital vice and individual proprietorship the food that\r\nnourishes it, why not suppress individual proprietorship altogether? Our\r\nextreme logicians, with Babæuf at the head of them, go as far as that,\r\nand Saint-Just seems to be of that opinion.[2184] We are not concerned\r\nwith the enacting of an Agrarian; the nation may reserve the soil to\r\nitself and divide among individuals, not the soil, but its lease. The\r\noutcome of this principle affords us a glimpse of an order of things in\r\nwhich the State, sole proprietor of real-estate, sole capitalist, sole\r\nmanufacturer, sole trader, having all Frenchmen in its pay and service,\r\nwould assign to each one his task according to his aptitude, and\r\ndistribute to each one his rations according to his wants.[2185]--These\r\nvarious uncompleted plans still float in a hazy distance but their\r\ncommon purpose is clearly distinguishable.\r\n\r\n\"All which tends to center human passions on the vile, individual ego\r\nmust be repudiated or repressed;\"[2186]\r\n\r\nWe should annihilate special interests, deprive the individual of\r\nthe motives and means for self-isolation, suppress preoccupations and\r\nambitions by which Man makes himself a focal point at the expense of the\r\nreal center, in short, to detach him from himself in order to attach him\r\nwholly to the State.\r\n\r\nThis is why, disregarding the narrow egoism through which the individual\r\nprefers himself to the community, we strive towards the enlarged egoism\r\nby which the individual prefers the community to the group of which he\r\nforms a part. Under no pretext must he separate himself from the whole,\r\nat no price, must he be allowed to form for himself a small homeland\r\nwithin the large one, for, by the affection he entertains for the small\r\none, he frustrates the objects of the large one. Nothing is worse than\r\npolitical, civil, religious and domestic federalism; we combat it under\r\nall its forms.[2187] In this particular, the Constituent Assembly has\r\npaved the way for us, since it has broken up all the principal historic\r\nor material groups by which men have separated themselves from the\r\nmasses and formed a band apart, provinces, clergy, nobles, parliaments,\r\nreligious orders and trades-unions. We complete its work, we destroy\r\nchurches, we suppress literary or scientific associations, educational\r\nor benevolent societies, even down to financial companies.[2188] We\r\nprohibit any departmental or commercial \"local spirit:\" we find\r\n\r\n\"odious and opposed to all principles, that, amongst municipalities,\r\nsome should be rich and others poor, that one should have immense\r\npatrimonial possessions and another nothing but debts.\"[2189]\r\n\r\nWe regard these possessions as the nation's, and we place indebtedness\r\nto the nation's account. We take grain from rich communes and\r\ndepartments, to feed poor communes and departments. We build bridges,\r\nroads and canals of each district, at the expense of the State;\r\n\"we centralize the labor of the French people in a broad, opulent\r\nfashion.\"[2190] We want no more local interests, recollections,\r\ndialects, idioms and patriotisms. Only one bond should subsist between\r\nindividuals, that which attaches them to the social body. We sunder all\r\nothers; we do not tolerate any special aggregation; we do the best we\r\ncan to break up the most tenacious of all, the family.--We therefore\r\ngive marriage the status of an ordinary contract: we render this loose\r\nand precarious, resembling as much as possible the free and transient\r\nunion of the sexes; it shall be dissolved at the option of both parties,\r\nand even of one of the parties, after one month of formalities and of\r\nprobation. If the couple has lived separate six months; the divorce\r\nmay be granted without any probation or delay; divorced parties may\r\nre-marry. On the other hand, we suppress marital authority: since\r\nspouses are equal, each has equal rights over common property and the\r\nproperty of each other; we deprive the husband of its administration and\r\nrender it \"common\" to both parties. We abolish \"paternal authority;\"\r\n\r\n\"it is cheating nature to enforce her rights through constraint.. ..\r\nThe only rights that parents have are those of protection and\r\nwatchfulness.\"[2191]\r\n\r\nThe father can no longer control the education of his children;\r\nthe State takes charge of it. The father is no longer master of his\r\nproperty; that portion he can dispose of by donation or testament is\r\nof the smallest; we prescribe an equal and forced division of\r\nproperty.--Finally we preach adoption, we efface bastardy, we confer on\r\nchildren born of free love, or of a despotic will, the same rights as\r\nthose of legitimate children. In short, we break that sacred circle,\r\nthat exclusive group, that aristocratic organization which, under\r\nthe name of the family, was created out of pride and\r\negoism.[2192]--Henceforth, affection and obedience will no longer be\r\nfrittered away; the miserable supports to which they have clung like ivy\r\nvines, castes, churches, corporations, provinces, communes or families,\r\nare ruined and rooted out; on the ground which is thus leveled, the\r\nState alone remains standing, and it alone offers any point of adhesion;\r\nall these vines are about to twine themselves in on trunk about the\r\ngreat central column.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Indoctrination of mind and intellect.\r\n\r\n     Indoctrination of mind and intellect.--Civil religion.\r\n     --National education.--Egalitarian moral standards.\r\n     --Obligatory civism.--The recasting and reduction of human\r\n     nature to the Jacobin type.\r\n\r\nLet not Man go astray, let us lead him on, let us direct minds and\r\nsouls, and, to this end, let us enfold him in our doctrines. He needs\r\ngeneral ideas and the daily experiences flowing out of them; he needs\r\nsome theory explaining the origin and nature of things, one which\r\nassigns him his place and the part he has to play in the world, which\r\nteaches him his duties, which regulates his life, which fixes the days\r\nhe shall work and the days he shall rest, which stamps itself on\r\nhis mind through commemorations, festivals and ceremonies, through a\r\ncatechism and a calendar. Up to this time Religion has been the power\r\ncharged with this service, interpreted and served by the Church; now\r\nit is to be Reason, interpreted and served by the State.--In this\r\nconnection, many among us, disciples of the encyclopedists, constitute\r\nReason a divinity, and honor her with a system of worship; but it is\r\nplain that they personify an abstraction; their improvised goddess is\r\nsimply an allegorical phantom; none of them see in her the intelligent\r\ncause of the world; in the depths of their hearts they deny this Supreme\r\nCause, their pretended religion being merely a show or a sham.--We\r\ndiscard atheism, not only because it is false, but again, and more\r\nespecially, because it is disintegrating and unwholesome.[2193] We want\r\nan effective, consolatory and fortifying religion, and that religion is\r\nnatural religion, which is social as well as true. \"Without this,[2194]\r\nas Rousseau has said, it is impossible to be a good citizen......The\r\nexistence of divinity, the future life, the sacredness of the social\r\ncontract and of the laws,\" all are its dogmas; \"no one may be forced\r\nto believe in these, but whoever dares say that he does not believe in\r\nthem, sets himself up against the French people, the human species and\r\nnature.\" Consequently, we decree that \"the French people recognizes the\r\nSupreme Being and the immortality of the soul.\"--The important thing now\r\nis to plant this entirely philosophic faith in all hearts. We introduce\r\nit into the civil order of things, we take the calendar out of the hands\r\nof the Church, we purge it of its Christian imagery; we make the new era\r\nbegin with the advent of the Republic; we divide the year according to\r\nthe metric system, we name the months according to the vicissitudes of\r\nthe seasons, \"we substitute, in all directions, the realities of reason\r\nfor the visions of ignorance, the truths of nature for a sacerdotal\r\nprestige,\"[2195] the decade for the week, the décadi for Sundays, lay\r\nfestivals for ecclesiastical festivals.[2196] On each décadi, through\r\nsolemn and appropriate pomp, we impress on the popular mind one of the\r\nhighest truths of our creed; we glorify, in the order of their dates,\r\nNature, Truth, Justice, Liberty, Equality, the People, Adversity,\r\nHumanity, the Republic, Posterity, Glory, Patriotism, Heroism, and other\r\nvirtues. Besides this, we honor the important days of the Revolution,\r\nthe taking of the Bastille, the fall of the Throne, the punishment\r\nof the tyrant, the expulsion of the Girondins. We, too, have our\r\nanniversaries, our relics, the relics of Chalier and Marat,[2197] our\r\nprocessions, our services, our ritual,[2198] and the vast system of\r\nvisible pageantry by which dogmas are made manifest and propagated. But\r\nours, instead of leading men off to an imaginary heaven, brings them\r\nback to a living patrimony, and, through our ceremonies as well as\r\nthrough our creed, we shall preach public-spiritedness (civism).\r\n\r\nIt is important to preach this to adults, it is still more important to\r\nteach it to children: for children are more easily molded than adults.\r\nOur hold on these still flexible minds is complete, and, through\r\nnational education \"we seize the coming generations.\"[2199] Naught is\r\nmore essential and naught is more legitimate.\r\n\r\n\"The country,\" says Robespierre, \"has a right to bring up its own\r\nchildren; it cannot confide this trust to family pride nor to the\r\nprejudices of individuals, the eternal nourishment of aristocracies and\r\nof a domestic federalism which narrows the soul by keeping it isolated.\"\r\nWe are determined to have \"education common and equal for all French\r\npeople,\" and \"we stamp on it a great character, analogous to the nature\r\nof our government and the sublime doctrines of our Republic. The aim is\r\nno longer to form gentlemen (messieurs) but citizens.\"[21100]\r\n\r\nWe oblige[21101] teachers, male and female, to present certificates of\r\ncivism, that is to say, of Jacobinism. We close the school if \"precepts\r\nor maxims opposed to revolutionary morality\" are taught in it, that is\r\nto say, in conformity with Christian morals. Children will learn to read\r\nin the Declaration of Rights and in the Constitution of 1793. Republican\r\nmanuals and catechisms will be prepared for their use.[21102] \"They must\r\nbe taught the virtuous traits which most honor free men, and especially\r\nthe traits characteristic of the French Revolution, the best calculated\r\nto elevate the soul and render them worthy of equality and liberty.\"\r\nThe 14th of July, 10th of August, 2nd of September, 21st of January, and\r\n31st of May must be lauded or justified in their presence. They must be\r\ntaken to meetings of the municipalities, to the law courts,[21103]\r\nand especially to the popular clubs; from these pure sources they will\r\nderive a knowledge of their rights, of their duties, of the laws,\r\nof republican morality,\" and, on entering society, they will find\r\nthemselves imbued with all good maxims. Over and above their political\r\nopinions we shape their ordinary habits. We apply on a grand scale the\r\nplan of education drawn out by Jean-Jacques (Rousseau).[21104] We want\r\nno more literary prigs; in the army, \"the 'dandy' breaks down during the\r\nfirst campaign;[21105] we want young men able to endure privation\r\nand fatigue, toughened, like Emile, \"by hard work\" and physical\r\nexercise.--We have, thus far, only sketched out this department of\r\neducation, but the agreement amongst the various plans shows the meaning\r\nand bearings of our principle. \"Children generally, without exception,\r\nsays Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau,[21106] the boys from five to twelve,\r\nthe girls from five to eleven years of age, must be brought up in common\r\nat the expense of the Republic; all, under the sacred law of equality,\r\nare to receive the same clothing, the same food, the same education, the\r\nsame attention \"in boarding-schools distributed according to cantons,\r\nand containing each from four to six hundred pupils.\r\n\r\n\"Pupils will be made to submit every day and every moment to the same\r\nrigid rules... Their beds must be hard, their food healthy, but simple,\r\ntheir clothing comfortable, but coarse.\" Servants will not be allowed;\r\nchildren must help themselves and, besides this, they must wait on the\r\nold and infirm, lodged with or near them. \"Among daily duties, manual\r\nlabor will be the principal thing; all the rest will be accessory.\"\r\nGirls must learn to spin, sew and wash clothes; the boys will work the\r\nroads, be shepherds, ploughmen and work-hands; both will have tasks set\r\nthem, either in the school-workshops, or in the fields and factories in\r\nthe neighborhood; they will be hired out to surrounding manufacturers\r\nand to the tillers of the soil. Saint-Just is more specific and\r\nrigid.[21107] \"Male children from five to sixteen years of age, must\r\nbe raised for their country. They must be clad in common cloth at all\r\nseasons, and have mats for beds, and sleep eight hours. They are to have\r\ncommon food only, fruits, vegetables, preparations of milk, bread and\r\nwater. They must not eat meat before sixteen.. Their education, from ten\r\nto sixteen, is to be military and agricultural. They will be formed into\r\ncompanies of sixty; six companies make a battalion; the children of\r\na district form a legion; they will assemble annually at the district\r\ntown, encamp there and drill in infantry tactics, in arenas specially\r\nprovided for the purpose; they will also learn cavalry maneuvers and\r\nevery other species of military evolution. In harvest time they are to\r\nbe distributed amongst the harvesters.\" After sixteen, \"they enter\r\nthe crafts,\" with some farmer, artisan, merchant or manufacturer, who\r\nbecomes their titular \"instructor,\" and with whom they are bound to\r\nremain up to the age of twenty-one, \"under the penalty of being deprived\r\nfor life of a citizen's rights.[21108]... All children will dress alike\r\nup to sixteen years of age; from twenty-one to twenty-five, they will\r\ndress as soldiers, if they are not in the magistracy.\"--Already we show\r\nthe effects of the theory by one striking example; we founded the \"Ecole\r\nde Mars;\"[21109] we select out of each district six boys from sixteen to\r\nseventeen and a half years old \"among the children of sans-culottes;\"\r\nwe summon them to Paris, \"to receive there, through a revolutionary\r\neducation, whatever belongs to the knowledge and habits of a republican\r\nsoldier. They are schooled in fraternity, in discipline, in frugality,\r\nin good habits, in love of country and in detestation of kings.\" three\r\nor four thousand young people are lodged at the Sablons, \"in a palisaded\r\nenclosure, the intervals of which are guarded by chevaux de frises\r\nand sentinels.\"[21110] We puts them into tents; we feed them with bran\r\nbread, rancid pork, water and vinegar; we drill them in the use of arms;\r\nwe march them out on national holidays and stimulate them with patriotic\r\nharangues.--Suppose all Frenchmen educated in such a school; the habits\r\nthey acquire in youth will persist in the adult, and, in each adult we\r\nshall find the sobriety, energy and patriotism of a Spartan or Roman.\r\n\r\nAlready, under the pressure of our decrees, civism affects customs, and\r\nthere are manifest signs, on all sides, of public regeneration. \"The\r\nFrench people,\" says Robespierre, \"seems to have outstripped the rest\r\nof humanity, by two thousand years; one might be tempted to regard them,\r\nliving amongst them, as a different species. In the rest of Europe, a\r\nploughman, an artisan, is an animal formed for the pleasures of a noble;\r\nin France, the nobles are trying to transform themselves into ploughmen\r\nand artisans, but do not succeed in obtaining that honor.\"[21111]\r\nLife in all directions is gradually assuming democratic forms Wealthy\r\nprisoners are prohibited from purchasing delicacies, or procuring\r\nspecial conveniences; they eat along with the poor prisoners the same\r\nration, at the common mess[21112]. Bakers have orders to make but one\r\nquality of bread, the brown bread called equality bread, and, to obtain\r\nhis ration, each person must place himself in line with the rest of the\r\ncrowd. On holidays[21113] everybody will bring his provisions down into\r\nthe street and eat as one family with his neighbor; on décadi all are to\r\nsing and dance together, pell-mell, in the temple of the Supreme being.\r\nThe decrees of the Convention and the orders of the representatives\r\nimpose the republican cockade on women; public opinion and example\r\nimpose on men the costume and appearance of sans-culottes we see even\r\ndandies wearing mustaches, long hair, red cap, vest and heavy wooden\r\nshoes.[21114] Nobody calls a person Monsieur or Madame; the only titles\r\nallowed are citoyen and citoyenne while thee and Thou is the general\r\nrule. Rude familiarity takes the place of monarchical politeness; all\r\ngreet each other as equals and comrades.[21115] There is now only one\r\ntone, one style, one language; revolutionary forms constitute the\r\ntissue of speech, as well as of written discourse; thought now seems\r\nto consists entirely of our ideas and phrases.[21116] All names are\r\ntransformed, those of months and of days, those of places and of\r\nmonuments, baptismal names and names of families: St. Denis has become\r\nFranciade; Peter Gaspard is converted into Anaxagoras, and Antoine-Louis\r\ninto Brutus; Leroi, the deputy, calls himself Laloi, and Leroy, the\r\njurist, calls himself August-Tenth.--By dint of thus shaping the\r\nexterior we reach the interior, and through outward civism we prepare\r\ninternal civism. Both are obligatory, but the latter much more so than\r\nthe former; for that is the fundamental principle,[21117] \"the incentive\r\nwhich sustains and impels a democratic and popular government.\" It\r\nis impossible to apply the social contract if everybody does not\r\nscrupulously observe the first clause of it, namely, the complete\r\nsurrender of himself to the community; everybody, then, must give\r\nhimself up entirely, not only actually but heartily, and devote himself\r\nto the public good, which public good is the regeneration of Man as we\r\nhave defined it. The veritable citizen is he who thus marches along\r\nwith us. With him, as with us, abstract truths of philosophy control the\r\nconscience and govern the will. He starts with our articles of faith and\r\nfollows them out to the end; he endorses our acts, he recites our creed,\r\nhe observes our discipline, he is a believing and practicing Jacobin,\r\nan orthodox Jacobin, unsullied, and without taint of heresy or schism.\r\nNever does he swerve to the left toward exaggeration, nor to the right\r\ntoward toleration; without haste or delay he travels along the narrow,\r\nsteep and straight path which we have marked out for him; this is the\r\npathway of reason, for, as there is but one reason, there is but one\r\npathway. Let no one swerve from the line; there are abysses on each side\r\nof it. Let us follow our guides, men of principles, the pure, especially\r\nCouthon, Saint-Just and Robespierre; they are choice specimens, all\r\ncast in the true mold, and it is this unique and rigid mold in which all\r\nFrench men are to be recast.\r\n\r\n\r\n***** ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2101: This and the following text are taken from the\r\n\"Contrat-Social\" by Rousseau.

It\r\nis well to add, perhaps, that one of his curés now in Paris has called\r\non him, and that he came to request him to second his marriage. The\r\nname of the said curé is Greffier Sauvage; he is still in Paris, and\r\nis preparing to be married the same time as himself. Aside from these\r\nmotives, which may have given rise to some talk, citizen Pontard sees no\r\ncause whatever for suspicion. Besides, so thoroughly patriotic as he,\r\nhe asks nothing better than to know the truth, in order to march along\r\nunhesitatingly in the revolutionary path.

REACTIONARY CONCEPT OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Reactionary concept of the State.\r\n\r\n     Reactionary concept of the State.--Analogy between this idea\r\n     of the State and that of antiquity.--Difference between\r\n     antique and modern society.--Changed circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobin theory can then be summarized in the following points:\r\n\r\n* The speculative creation of a curtailed type of human being.\r\n\r\n* An effort to adapt the living man to this type.\r\n\r\n* The interference of public authority in every branch of public\r\nendeavor.\r\n\r\n* Constraints put upon labor, trade and property, upon the family and\r\neducation, upon worship, habits, customs and sentiments.\r\n\r\n* The sacrifice of the individual to the community.\r\n\r\n* The omnipotence of the State.\r\n\r\nNo theory could be more reactionary since it moves modern man back to\r\na type of society which he, eighteen centuries ago, had already passed\r\nthrough and left behind.\r\n\r\nDuring the historical era proceeding our own, and especially in the old\r\nGreek or Latin cities, in Rome or Sparta, which the Jacobins take for\r\ntheir models,[2201] human society was shaped after the pattern of an\r\narmy or convent. In a convent as in an army, one idea, absorbing and\r\nunique, predominates:\r\n\r\n* The aim of the monk is to please God at any sacrifice.\r\n\r\n* The soldier makes every sacrifice to obtain a victory.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, each renounces every other desire and entirely abandons\r\nhimself, the monk to his rules and the soldier to his drill. In like\r\nmanner, in the antique world, two preoccupations were of supreme\r\nimportance. In the first place, the city had its gods who were both its\r\nfounders and protectors: it was therefore obliged to worship these in\r\nthe most reverent and particular manner; otherwise, they abandoned it.\r\nThe neglect of any insignificant rite might offend them and ruin it.\r\nIn the second place, there was incessant warfare, and the spoils of war\r\nwere atrocious; on a city being taken every citizen might expect to be\r\nkilled or maimed, or sold at auction, and see his children and wife\r\nsold to the highest bidder.[2202] In short, the antique city, with its\r\nacropolis of temples and its fortified citadel surrounded by implacable\r\nand threatening enemies, resembles for us the institution of the Knights\r\nof St. John on their rocks at Rhodes or Malta, a religious and military\r\nconfraternity encamped around a church.--Liberty, under such conditions,\r\nis out of the question: public convictions are too imperious; public\r\ndanger is too great. With this pressure upon him, and thus hampered,\r\nthe individual gives himself up to the community, which takes full\r\npossession of him, because, to maintain its own existence, it needs the\r\nwhole man. Henceforth, no one may develop apart and for himself; no\r\none may act or think except within fixed lines. The type of Man\r\nis distinctly and clearly marked out, if not logically at least\r\ntraditionally; each life, as well as each portion of each life must\r\nconform to this type; otherwise public security is compromised: any\r\nfalling off in gymnastic education weakens the army; passing the images\r\nof the gods and neglecting the usual libation draws down celestial\r\nvengeance on the city. Consequently, to prevent all deviations, the\r\nState, absolute master, exercises unlimited jurisdiction; no freedom\r\nwhatever is left to the individual, no portion of himself is reserved\r\nto himself, no sheltered corner against the strong hand of public force,\r\nneither his possessions, his children, his personality, his opinions or\r\nhis conscience.[2203] If, on voting days, he shares in the sovereignty,\r\nhe is subject all the rest of the year, even to his private sentiments.\r\nRome, to serve these ends, had two censors. One of the archons of Athens\r\nwas inquisitor of the faith. Socrates was put to death for not believing\r\nin the gods in which the city believed.[2204]--In reality, not only\r\nin Greece and in Rome, but in Egypt, in China, in India, in Persia,\r\nin Judea, in Mexico, in Peru, during the first stages of\r\ncivilization,[2205] the principle of human communities is still that of\r\ngregarious animals: the individual belongs to his community the same as\r\nthe bee to its hive and the ant to its ant-hill; he is simply an\r\norgan within an organism. Under a variety of structures and in diverse\r\napplications authoritative socialism alone prevails.\r\n\r\nJust the opposite in modern society; what was once the rule has now\r\nbecome the exception; the antique system survives only in temporary\r\nassociations, like that of an army, or in special associations, as in\r\na convent. Gradually, the individual has liberated himself, and century\r\nafter century, he has extended his domain and the two chains which once\r\nbound him fast to the community, have snapped or been lightened.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, public power has ceased to consist of a militia\r\nprotecting a cult. In the beginning, through the institution of\r\nChristianity, civil society and religious society have become two\r\ndistinct empires, Christ himself having separated the two jurisdictions;\r\n\r\n\"Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and unto God the things\r\nthat are God's.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, through the rise of Protestantism, the great Church is\r\nsplit into numerous sects which, unable to destroy each other, have been\r\nso compelled to live together and the State, even when preferring one\r\nof them, has found it necessary to tolerate the others. Finally,\r\nthrough the development of Protestantism, philosophy and the sciences,\r\nspeculative beliefs have multiplied. There are almost as many faiths\r\nnow-a-days as there are thinking men, and, as thinking men are becoming\r\ndaily more numerous, opinions are daily becoming more numerous. So\r\nshould the State try to impose any one of these on society, this would\r\nexcite opposition from an infinity of others; hence the wisdom\r\nin governing is found, first, in remaining neutral, and, next, in\r\nacknowledging that it is not qualified to interfere.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, war has become less frequent and less destructive\r\nbecause men have not so many motives for waging it, nor the same motives\r\nto push it to the same extremes. Formerly, war was the main source of\r\nwealth; through victories Man acquired slaves, subjects and tributaries;\r\nhe turned these to the best account; he leisurely enjoyed their forced\r\nlabor. Nothing of this kind is seen now-a-days; people no longer think\r\nof providing themselves human cattle; they have discovered that, of all\r\nanimals, these are the most troublesome, the least productive, and the\r\nmost dangerous. Comforts and security are obtained much more readily\r\nthrough free labor and machinery; the great object no is not to conquer,\r\nbut to produce and interchange. Every day, man, pressing forward more\r\neagerly in civil careers, is less disposed to put up with any obstacle\r\nthat interferes with his aims; if he still consents to be a soldier it\r\nis not to become an invader, but to provide against invasion. Meanwhile,\r\nwar has become more scientific and, through the complications of its\r\nmachinery, more costly; the State can no longer call out and enlist\r\nfor life every able-bodied man without ruining itself, nor put too\r\nmany obstacles in the way of the free industry which, through taxation,\r\nprovides for its expenses; however short-sighted the State may be, it\r\nconsults civil interests, even in its military interest.--Thus, of\r\nthe two nets in which it has enveloped all human activity, one is rent\r\nasunder and the other has slackened its meshes. There is no longer any\r\nreason for making the community omnipotent; the individual need not\r\nalienate himself entirely; he may, without inconvenience, reserve to\r\nhimself a part of himself, and, if now called upon to sign a social\r\ncontract, you may be sure that he would make this reservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Changed minds.\r\n\r\n     Changed minds.--Conscience and its Christian origin.--Honor\r\n     and its feudal origin.--The individual of to-day refuses to\r\n     surrender himself entirely.--His motives.--Additional\r\n     motives in modern democracy.--Character of the elective\r\n     process and the quality of the representative.\r\n\r\nAnd so have not only outward circumstances changed, but the very human\r\nattitudes are now different. In the mind of modern man a feeling,\r\ndistasteful to the antique pact, has evolved.--Undoubtedly, in extreme\r\ncases and under the pressure of brutal necessity I may, momentarily,\r\nsign a blank check. But, never, if I understand what I am doing, will\r\nI sign away in good faith the complete and permanent abandonment of\r\nmyself: it would be against conscience and against honor, which two\r\npossessions are not to be alienated. My honor and my conscience are\r\nnot to go out of my keeping; I am their sole guardian and depositary; I\r\nwould not even entrust them to my father.--Both these terms are recent\r\nand express two conceptions unknown to the ancients,[2206] both being\r\nof profound import and of infinite reach. Through them, like a bud\r\nseparated from its stem and taking root apart, the individual has\r\nseparated himself from the primitive body, clan, family, caste or city\r\nin which he has lived indistinguishable and lost in the crowd; he has\r\nceased to be an organ and appendage; he has become a personality.--The\r\nfirst of these concepts is of Christian origin the second of feudal\r\norigin; both, following each other and conjoined, measure the enormous\r\ndistance which separates an antique soul from a modern soul.[2207]\r\n\r\nAlone, in the presence of God, the Christian has felt melting, like wax,\r\nall the ties binding him to his group; this because he is in front of\r\nthe Great Judge, and because this infallible judge sees all souls as\r\nthey are, not confusedly and in masses, but clearly, each by itself. At\r\nthe bar of His tribunal no one is answerable for another; each answers\r\nfor himself alone; one is responsible only for one's own acts. But those\r\nacts are of infinite consequence, for the soul, redeemed by the blood of\r\na God, is of immeasurable value; hence, according as it has or has not\r\nprofited by the divine sacrifice, so will the reward or punishment be\r\ninfinite; at the final judgment, an eternity of torment or bliss opens\r\nbefore it. All other interests vanish alongside of a vision of such\r\nvastness. Thenceforth, righteousness is the most serious of all aims,\r\nnot in the eyes of man, but of God and again, day after day, the\r\nsoul renews within itself that tragic questioning in which the Judge\r\ninterrogates and the sinner responds.--Through this dialogue, which\r\nhas been going on for eighteen centuries, and which is yet to continue,\r\nconscience has grown more and more sensitive, and man has conceived\r\nthe idea of absolute justice. Whether this is vested in an all-powerful\r\nmaster, or whether it is a self-existent truth, like mathematical\r\ntruths, in no way diminishes its sacredness nor, consequently, from its\r\nauthority. It commands with a superior voice and its commands must be\r\nobeyed, irrespective of cost: there are strict duties to which every man\r\nis rigorously bound. No pledge may relieve him of these duties; if not\r\nfulfilled because he has given contrary pledges he is no less culpable\r\non this account, and besides, he is culpable for having pledged himself;\r\nthe pledging of himself to crimes was in itself a crime. His fault thus\r\nappears to himself twofold, and the inward prick galls him twice instead\r\nof once. Hence, the more sensitive the conscience, the more loath it is\r\nto give up; it rejects any promise which may lead to wrong-doing, and\r\nrefuses to give to give others any right of imposing remorse.\r\n\r\nAt the same time another sentiment has arisen, not less valuable, but\r\nhardier, more energetic, more human and more effective. On his own in\r\nhis stronghold, the feudal chieftain, at the head of his band, could\r\ndepend on nobody but himself, for a public force did not then exist. It\r\nwas necessary that he should protect himself, and, indeed, over-protect\r\nhimself. Whoever, in the anarchical and military society in which\r\nhe lived, allowed the slightest encroachment, or left unpunished the\r\nslightest approach to insult, was regarded as weak or craven and at once\r\nbecame a prey; one had to be proud-spirited, if not, one risked death.\r\nThis was not difficult either. Sole proprietor and nearly absolute\r\nsovereign, with neither equals or peers on his domain, here he was\r\nunique being, superior and incomparable to every one else.[2208] On that\r\nsubject revolved his long monologue during his hours of gloomy solitude,\r\nwhich soliloquy has lasted for nine centuries.[2209] Thus in his own\r\neyes, his person and all that depends on him are inviolable; rather than\r\ntolerate the slightest infringement on his prerogatives he will dare all\r\nand sacrifice all.[2210] A sensitive pride (orgueil exalté) is the best\r\nof sentinels to protect a right; for, not only does it mount guard\r\nover the right to preserve it, but, again, and especially, for its own\r\nsatisfaction; the imagination has conceived a personality appropriate\r\nfor his rank, and this character the man imposes on himself as his role.\r\nHenceforth, he not only forces the respect of others, but he respects\r\nhimself; he possesses the sentiment of honor, a generous self-esteem\r\nwhich makes him regard himself as noble and incapable of doing anything\r\nmean. In discriminating between his actions, he may err; fashion or\r\nvanity may sometimes lead him too far, or lead him astray, either on the\r\npath of recklessness or on that of puerility; his point of honor may be\r\nfixed in the wrong direction. But, in sum, and thanks to this being\r\na fixed point, he will maintain himself erect even under an absolute\r\nmonarchy, under a Philip II. in Spain, under a Louis XIV. in France,\r\nunder a Frederick II. in Prussia. From the feudal baron or gentleman of\r\nthe court to the modern gentleman, this tradition persists and descends\r\nfrom story to story down to lowest social substratum: to-day, every man\r\nof spirit, the bourgeois, the peasant, the workman, has his point of\r\nhonor like the noble. He likewise, in spite of the social encroachments\r\nthat gain on him, reserves to himself his private nook, a sort of\r\nmoral stronghold wherein he preserves his faiths, his opinions, his\r\naffections, his obligations as son, husband and father; it is the sacred\r\ntreasury of his innermost being. This stronghold belongs to him alone;\r\nno one, even in the name of the public, has a right to enter it; to\r\nsurrender it would be cowardice, rather than give up its keys he would\r\ndie in the breach;[2211] when this militant sentiment of honor is\r\nenlisted on the side of conscience it becomes virtue itself.[2212]--Such\r\nare, in these days, (1870) the two central themes of our European\r\nmorality.[2213] Through the former the individual recognizes duties from\r\nwhich nothing can exempt him; through the latter, he claims rights of\r\nwhich nothing can deprive him: our civilization has vegetated from these\r\ntwo roots, and still vegetates. Consider the depth and the extent of\r\nthe historical soil in which they penetrate, and you may judge of their\r\nvigor. Consider the height and unlimited growth of the trees which they\r\nnourish, and you may judge of their healthiness. Everywhere else, one\r\nor other having failed, in China, in the Roman Empire, in Islam, the sap\r\nhas dried downward and the tree has become stunted, or has fallen.... It\r\nis the modern man, who is neither Chinese, nor antique, nor Moslem,\r\nnor Negro, nor savage, the man formed by Christian education and taking\r\nrefuge in his conscience as in a sanctuary, the man formed by feudal\r\neducation and entrenched behind his honor as in a fortress, whose\r\nsanctuary and stronghold the new social contract bids him surrender.\r\n\r\nNow, in this democracy founded on the preponderance of numbers, into\r\nwhose hands am I required to make this surrender?--Theoretically, to the\r\ncommunity, that is to say, to a crowd in which an anonymous impulse\r\nis the substitute for individual judgment; in which action becomes\r\nimpersonal because it is collective; in which nobody acknowledges\r\nresponsibility; in which I am borne along like a grain of sand in a\r\nwhirlwind; in which all sorts of outrages are condoned beforehand for\r\nreasons of state: practically, to the plurality of voices counted by\r\nheads, to a majority which, over-excited by the struggle for mastery,\r\nwill abuse its victory and wrong the minority to which I may belong;\r\nto a provisional majority which, sooner or later, will be replaced by\r\nanother, so that if I am to-day oppressor I am sure of being\r\noppressed to-morrow; still more particularly, to six or seven hundred\r\nrepresentatives, among who I am called upon to choose but one. To elect\r\nthis unique mandatory I have but one vote among ten thousand; and in\r\nhelping to elect him I am only the ten-thousandth; I do not even count\r\nfor a ten-thousandth in electing the others. And it is these six or\r\nseven hundred strangers to me to who I give full power to decide for\r\nme--note the expression full power--which means unlimited power, not\r\nalone over my possessions and life, but, again, over my conscience, with\r\nall its powers combined; that is to say, with powers much more extensive\r\nthan those I confer separately on ten persons in whom I place the most\r\nconfidence--to my legal adviser who looks after my fortune, to the\r\nteacher of my children, to the physician who cares for my health, to\r\nthe confessor who directs my conscience, to friends who are to serve as\r\nexecutors of my last will and testament, to seconds in a duel who decide\r\non my life, on the was of my blood and who guard my honor. Without\r\nreference to the deplorable farce, so often played around the\r\nballot-box, or to the forced and distorted elections which put a\r\ncontrary interpretation on public sentiment, or to the official lies\r\nby which, at this very moment, a few fanatics and madmen, who represent\r\nnobody but themselves, assume to represent the nation,[2214] measure\r\nwhat degree of confidence I may have, even after honest elections,\r\nin mandatories who are thus chosen! Frequently, I have voted for the\r\ndefeated candidate; in which case I am represented by the other who I\r\ndid not want for a representative. In voting for the elected candidate,\r\nI did it because I knew of no better one, and because his opponent\r\nseemed to me worse. I have only seen him one time out of four and then\r\nfleetingly, at odd moment; I scarcely knew more of him than the color\r\nof his coat, the tone of his voice, and the way he has of thumping\r\nhis breast. All I know of him is through his \"platform,\" vague and\r\ndeclamatory, through editorials, and through drawing-room, coffee-house,\r\nor street gossip. His title to my confidence is of the flimsiest and\r\nshallowest kind; there is nothing to substantiate to me his integrity\r\nor competency; he has no diploma, and no one to endorse him as has a\r\nprivate tutor; he has no guarantee from the society to which he belongs,\r\nlike the physician, the priest or the lawyer. With references as poor as\r\nthese I should hesitate to recruit him even as a domestic. And all the\r\nmore because the class from which I am obliged to take him is almost\r\nalways that of politicians, a suspicious class, especially in countries\r\nin which universal suffrage prevails. This class is not recruited\r\namong the most independent, the ablest, and the most honest, but among\r\nvoluble, scheming men, zealous charlatans, who for want of perseverance,\r\nhaving failed in private careers, in situations where one is watched too\r\nclosely and too nicely weighed in the balance, have selected roles in\r\nwhich the want of scrupulousness and discretion is a force instead of a\r\nweakness; to their indelicacy and impudence the doors of a public\r\ncareer stand wide open.--Such is the august personage into whose hands,\r\naccording to the theory, I am called upon to surrender my will, my will\r\nin full; certainly, if self-renunciation were necessary, I should\r\nrisk less in giving myself up to a king or to an aristocracy, even\r\nhereditary; for then would my representatives be at least recommended\r\nby their evident rank and their probable competency.--Democracy, in its\r\nnature and composition, is a system in which the individual awards to\r\nhis representatives the least trust and deference; hence, it is the\r\nsystem in which he should entrust them with the least power. Conscience\r\nand honor everywhere enjoin a man to retain for himself some portion of\r\nhis independence; but nowhere is there so little be ceded. If a modern\r\nconstitution ought to clearly define and limit the domain of the State,\r\nit is in respect of contemporary democracy that it ought to be the most\r\nrestrictive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Origin and nature of the modern State.\r\n\r\n     Origin and nature of the modern State.--Its functions,\r\n     rights and limits.\r\n\r\nLet us try to define these limits.--After the turmoil of invasions and\r\nconquest, at the height of social disintegration, amidst the combats\r\ndaily occurring between private parties, there arose in every European\r\ncommunity a public force, which force, lasting for centuries, still\r\npersists to our day. How it was organized, through what early stages of\r\nviolence it passed, through what accidents and struggles, and into whose\r\nhands it is now entrusted, whether temporarily or forever, whatever\r\nthe laws of its transmission, whether by inheritance or election, is of\r\nsecondary importance; the main thing is its functions and their mode of\r\noperation. It is essentially a mighty sword, drawn from its scabbard\r\nand uplifted over the smaller blades around it, with which private\r\nindividuals once cut each others' throats. Menaced by it, the smaller\r\nblades repose in their scabbards; they have become inert, useless, and,\r\nfinally rusty; with few exceptions, everybody save malefactors, has now\r\nlost both the habit and the desire to use them, so that, henceforth,\r\nin this pacified society, the public sword is so formidable that all\r\nprivate resistance vanishes the moment it flashes.--This sword is forged\r\nout of two interests: it was necessary to have one of its magnitude,\r\nfirst, against similar blades brandished by other communities on the\r\nfrontier, and next, against the smaller blades which bad passions are\r\nalways sharpening in the interior. People demanded protection against\r\noutside enemies and inside ruffians and murderers, and, slowly and\r\npainfully, after much groping and much re-tempering, the agreement\r\nbetween hereditary forces has fashioned the sole arm which is capable of\r\nprotecting lives and property with any degree of success.--So long as it\r\ndoes no more I am indebted to the State which holds the hilt: it gives\r\nme a security which, without it, I could not have enjoyed. In return for\r\nthis security I owe it, for my quota, the means for keeping this weapon\r\nin good condition: he who enjoys a service is under an obligation to pay\r\nfor it. Accordingly, there is between the State and myself, if not an\r\nexpress contract, at least a tacit understanding equivalent to that\r\nwhich binds a child to its parent, a believer to his church, and, on\r\nboth sides, this mutual understanding is clear and precise. The state\r\nengages to look after my security within and without; I engage to\r\nfurnish the means for so doing, which means consist of my respect\r\nand gratitude, my zeal as a citizen, my services as a conscript, my\r\ncontributions as a tax-payer, in short, whatever is necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of an army, a navy, a diplomatic organization, civil\r\nand criminal courts, a militia and police, central and local\r\nadministrations, in short, a harmonious set of organs of which my\r\nobedience and loyalty constitute the food, the substance and the\r\nblood. This loyalty and obedience, whatever I am, whether rich or poor,\r\nCatholic, Protestant, Jew or free-thinker, royalist or republican,\r\nindividualist or socialist, upon my honor and in my conscience I owe.\r\nThis because I have received the equivalent; I am delighted that I am\r\nnot vanquished, assassinated, or robbed. I reimburse the State, exactly\r\nbut not more that which it has spent on equipment and personnel for\r\nkeeping down brutal cupidity, greedy appetites, deadly fanaticism, the\r\nentire howling pack of passions and desires of which, sooner or later,\r\nI might become the prey, were it not constantly to extend over me its\r\nvigilant protection. When it demands its outlay of me it is not my\r\nproperty which it takes away, but its own property, which it collects\r\nand, in this light, it may legitimately force me to pay.--On condition,\r\nhowever, that it does not exact more than my liabilities, and this it\r\ndoes when it oversteps its original engagements;\r\n\r\n1. when it undertakes some extra material or moral work that I do not\r\nask for;\r\n\r\n2. when it constitutes itself sectarian, moralist, philanthropist, or\r\npedagogue;\r\n\r\n3. when it strives to propagate within its borders, or outside of them,\r\nany religious or philosophic dogma, or any special political or social\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nFor then, it adds a new article to the primitive pact, for which article\r\nthere is not the same unanimous and assured assent that existed for\r\nthe pact. We are all willing to be secured against violence and fraud;\r\noutside of this, and on almost any other point, there are divergent\r\nwills. I have my own religion, my own opinions, my habits, my customs,\r\nmy peculiar views of life and way of regarding the universe; now, this\r\nis just what constitutes my personality, what honor and conscience\r\nforbid me to alienate, and which the State has promised me to protect.\r\nConsequently, when, through its additional article, it attempts to\r\nregulate these in a certain way, if that way is not my way, it fails\r\nto fulfill its primordial engagement and, instead of protecting me, it\r\noppresses me. Even if it should have the support of a majority, even\r\nif all voters, less one, should agree to entrusting it with this\r\nsupererogatory function, were there only one dissenter, he would be\r\nwronged, and in two ways.--\r\n\r\nFirst of all, and in any event, the State, to fulfill its new tasks,\r\nexacts from him an extra amount of subsidy and service; for, every\r\nsupplementary work brings along with it supplementary expenses; the\r\nbudget is overburdened when the State takes upon itself the procuring\r\nof work for laborers or employment for artists, the maintenance of any\r\nparticular industrial or commercial enterprise, the giving of alms,\r\nand the furnishing of education. To an expenditure of money add an\r\nexpenditure of lives, should it enter upon a war of generosity or of\r\npropaganda. Now, to all these expenditures that it does not approve of,\r\nthe minority contributes as well as the majority which does approve\r\nof them; so much the worse for the conscript and the tax-payer if they\r\nbelong to the dissatisfied group. Like it or not, the collector puts his\r\nhand in the tax-payer's pocket, and the sergeant lays his hand on the\r\nconscript's collar.--\r\n\r\nIn the second place, and in many circumstances, not only does the State\r\nunjustly take more than its due, but it uses the money it has extorted\r\nfrom me to apply unjustly new constraints against me. Such is the case,\r\n\r\n* when it imposes on me its theology or philosophy;\r\n\r\n* when it prescribes for me, or interdicts, a cult;\r\n\r\n* when it assumes to regulate my ways and habits,\r\n\r\n* when it assumes to limit my labor or expenditure,\r\n\r\n* when it assumes to direct the education of my children,\r\n\r\n* when it assumes to fix the prices of my wares or the rate of my wages.\r\n\r\nFor then, to enforce its commands and prohibitions, it enacts light or\r\nserious penalties against the recalcitrant, all the way from political\r\nor civil incapacity to fines, imprisonment, exile and the guillotine.\r\nIn other words, the money I do not owe it, and of which it robs me, pays\r\nfor the persecution which it inflicts upon me; I am reduced to paying\r\nout of my own purse the wages of my inquisitors, my jailer and my\r\nexecutioner. A more glaring oppression could not be imagined!--Let us\r\nwatch out for the encroachments of the State and not allow it to become\r\nanything more than a watch-dog. Whilst the teeth and nails of other\r\nguests in the household have been losing their sharpness, its fangs have\r\nbecome formidable; it is now colossal and it alone still keeps up the\r\npractice of fighting. Let us supply it with nourishment against wolves;\r\nbut never let it touch peaceable folks around the table. Appetite grows\r\nby eating; it would soon become a wolf itself, and the most ravenous\r\nwolf inside the fold. The important thing is to keep a chain around its\r\nneck and confine it within its own enclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The state is tempted to encroach.\r\n\r\n     The state is tempted to encroach.--Precedents and reasons\r\n     for its pretensions.\r\n\r\nLet us go around the fold, which is an extensive one, and, through its\r\nextensions, reach into almost every nook of private life.--Each private\r\ndomain, indeed, physical or moral, offers temptations for its neighbors\r\nto trespass on it, and, to keep this intact, demands the superior\r\nintervention of a third party. To acquire, to possess, to sell, to give,\r\nto bequeath, to contract between husband and wife, father, mother or\r\nchild, between master or domestic, employer or employee, each act\r\nand each situation, involves rights limited by contiguous and adverse\r\nrights, and it is the State which sets up the boundary between them.\r\nNot that it creates this boundary; but, that this may be recognized, it\r\ndraws the line and therefore enacts civil laws which it applies through\r\nits courts and gendarmes in such a way as to secure to each individual\r\nwhat belongs to him. The State stands, accordingly, as regulator and\r\ncontroller, not alone of private possessions, but also of the family\r\nand of domestic life; its authority is thus legitimately introduced into\r\nthat reserved circle in which the individual will has entrenched itself,\r\nand, as is the habit of all great powers, once the circle is invaded,\r\nits tendency is to occupy it fully and entirely.--To this end, it\r\ninvokes a new principle. Constituted as a moral personality, the same as\r\na church, university, or charitable or scientific body, is not the State\r\nbound, like every corporate body that is to last for ages, to extend\r\nits vision far and near and prefer to private interests, which are only\r\nlife-interests, the common interest (l'intérêt commun) which is eternal?\r\nIs not this the superior end to which all others should be subordinated,\r\nand must this interest, which is supreme over all, be sacrificed to\r\ntwo troublesome instincts which are often unreasonable and sometimes\r\ndangerous; to conscience, which overflows in mystic madness, and to\r\nhonor, which may lead to strife even to murderous duels?--Certainly not,\r\nand first of all when, in its grandest works, the State, as legislator,\r\nregulates marriages, inheritances, and testaments, then it is not\r\nrespect for the will of individuals which solely guides it; it does not\r\ncontent itself with obliging everybody to pay his debts, including even\r\nthose which are tacit, involuntary and innate; it takes into account\r\nthe public interest; it calculates remote probabilities, future\r\ncontingencies, all results singly and collectively. Manifestly, in\r\nallowing or forbidding divorce, in extending or restricting what a man\r\nmay dispose of by testament, in favoring or interdicting substitutions,\r\nit is chiefly in view of some political, economical or social advantage,\r\neither to refine or consolidate the union of the sexes, to implant in\r\nthe family habits of discipline or sentiments of affection, to excite\r\nin children an initiatory spirit, or one of concord, to prepare for the\r\nnation a staff of natural chieftains, or an army of small proprietors,\r\nand always authorized by the universal assent. Moreover, and always with\r\nthis universal assent, it does other things outside the task originally\r\nassigned to it, and nobody finds that it usurps when,\r\n\r\n* it coins money,\r\n\r\n* it regulates weights and measures,\r\n\r\n* it establishes quarantines,\r\n\r\n* on condition of an indemnity, it expropriates private property for\r\npublic utility,\r\n\r\n* it builds lighthouses, harbors, dikes, canals, roads,\r\n\r\n* it defrays the cost of scientific expeditions,\r\n\r\n* it founds museums and public libraries;\r\n\r\n* at times, toleration is shown for its support of universities,\r\nschools, churches, and theaters, and, to justify fresh drafts on private\r\npurses for such objects, no reason is assigned for it but the common\r\ninterest. (l'intérêt commun)--Why should it not, in like manner, take\r\nupon itself every enterprise for the benefit of all? Why should it\r\nhesitate in commanding the execution of every work advantageous to\r\nthe community, and why abstain from forbidding every harmful work? Now\r\nplease note that in human society every act or omission, even the most\r\nconcealed or private, is either a loss or a gain to society. So if I\r\nneglect to take care of my property or of my health, of my intellect or\r\nof my soul, I undermine or weaken in my person a member of the community\r\nwhich can only be rich, healthy and strong through the wealth, health\r\nand strength of his fellow members, so that, from this point of view,\r\nmy private actions are all public benefits or public injuries. Why then,\r\nfrom this point of view, should the State scruple about prescribing some\r\nof these to me and forbidding others? Why, in order to better exercise\r\nthis right, and better fulfill this obligation, should it not constitute\r\nitself the universal contractor for labor, and the universal distributor\r\nof productions? Why should it not become the sole agriculturist,\r\nmanufacturer and merchant, the unique proprietor and administrator of\r\nall France?--Precisely because this would be opposed to the common weal\r\n(l'intérêt de tous, the interest of everyone)[2215]. Here the second\r\nprinciple, that advanced against individual independence, operates\r\ninversely, and, instead of being an adversary, it becomes a champion.\r\nFar from setting the State free, it puts another chain around its neck,\r\nand thus strengthens the fence within which modern conscience and modern\r\nhonor have confined the public guardian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Direct common interest.\r\n\r\n     Direct common interest.--This consists in the absence of\r\n     constraint.--Two reasons in favor of freedom of action.--\r\n     Character, in general, of the individual man.--Modern\r\n     complication.\r\n\r\nIn what, indeed, does the common weal (l'intérêt de tous, the interest\r\nof everyone) consist?--In the interest of each person, while that which\r\ninterests each person is the things of which the possession is agreeable\r\nand deprivation painful. The whole world would in vain gainsay this\r\npoint; every sensation is personal. My suffering and my enjoyments\r\nare not to be contested any more than my inclination for objects which\r\nprocure me the one, and my dislike of objects which procure me the\r\nother. There is, therefore, no arbitrary definition of each one's\r\nparticular interest; this exists as a fact independently of the\r\nlegislator; all that remains is to show what this interest is, and what\r\neach individual prefers. Preferences vary according to race, time, place\r\nand circumstance. Among the possessions which are ever desirable and\r\nthe privation of which is ever dreaded, there is one, however, which,\r\ndirectly desired, and for itself, becomes, through the progress of\r\ncivilization, more and more cherished, and of which the privation\r\nbecomes, through the progress of civilization, more and more grievous.\r\nThat is the disposition of one's self, the full ownership of one's body\r\nand property, the faculty of thinking, believing and worshipping as one\r\npleases, of associating with others, of acting separately or along with\r\nothers, in all senses and without hindrance; in short, one's liberty.\r\nThat this liberty may as extensive as possible is, in all times, one of\r\nman's great needs, and, in our days, it is his greatest need. There are\r\ntwo reasons for this, one natural and the other historical.--\r\n\r\nBy nature Man is an individual, that is to say a small distinct world\r\nin himself, a center apart in an enclosed circle, a detached organism\r\ncomplete in itself and which suffers when his spontaneous inclinations\r\nare frustrated by the intervention of an outside force.\r\n\r\nThe passage of time has made him a complicated organism, upon which\r\nthree or four religions, five or six civilizations, thirty centuries\r\nof rich culture have left their imprint; in which its acquisitions are\r\ncombined together, wherein inherited qualities are crossbred, wherein\r\nspecial traits have accumulated in such a way as to produce the most\r\noriginal and the most sensitive of beings. As civilization increases, so\r\ndoes his complexity: with the result that man's originality strengthens\r\nand his sensitivity become keener; from which it follows that the more\r\ncivilized he becomes, the greater his repugnance to constraint and\r\nuniformity.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, (1880), each of us is the terminal and peculiar\r\nproduct of a vast elaboration of which the diverse stages occur in this\r\norder but once, a plant unique of its species, a solitary individual of\r\nsuperior and finer essence which, with its own inward structure and\r\nits own inalienable type, can bear no other than its own characteristic\r\nfruit. Nothing could be more adverse to the interest of the oak than to\r\nbe tortured into bearing the apples of the apple tree; nothing could be\r\nmore adverse to the interests of the apple tree than to be tortured into\r\nbearing acorns; nothing could be more opposed to the interests of both\r\noak and apple tree, also of other trees, than to be pruned, shaped and\r\ntwisted so as all to grow after a forced model, delineated on paper\r\naccording to the rigid and limited imagination of a surveyor. The least\r\npossible constraint is, therefore, everybody's chief interest; if one\r\nparticular restrictive agency is established, it is that every one may\r\nbe preserved by if from other more powerful constraints, especially\r\nthose which the foreigner and evil-doer would impose. Up to that point,\r\nand not further, its intervention is beneficial; beyond that point, it\r\nbecomes one of the evils it is intended to forestall. Such then, if the\r\ncommon weal is to be looked after, the sole office of the State is,\r\n\r\n1. to prevent constraint and, therefore, never to use it except to\r\nprevent worse constraints;\r\n\r\n2. to secure respect for each individual in his own physical and moral\r\ndomain; never to encroach on this except for that purpose and then to\r\nwithdraw immediately;\r\n\r\n3. to abstain from all indiscreet meddling, and yet more, as far as is\r\npracticable, without any sacrifice of public security;\r\n\r\n4. to reduce old assessments, to exact only a minimum of subsidies and\r\nservices;\r\n\r\n5. to gradually limit even useful action;\r\n\r\n6. to set itself as few tasks as possible;\r\n\r\n7. to let each one have all the room possible and the maximum of\r\ninitiative;\r\n\r\n8. to slowly abandon monopolies;\r\n\r\n9. to refrain from competition with private parties;\r\n\r\n10. to rid itself of functions which these private parties can fulfill\r\nequally well--and we see that the limits assigned to the State by the\r\npublic interest (l'intérêt commun) correspond to those stipulated by\r\nduty and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Indirect common interest.\r\n\r\n     Indirect common interest.--This consists in the most\r\n     economical and most productive employment of spontaneous\r\n     forces.--Difference between voluntary labor and forced\r\n     labor.--Sources of man's spontaneous action. Conditions of\r\n     their energy, work and products.--Motives for leaving them\r\n     under personal control.--Extent of the private domain.\r\n     --Individuals might voluntarily extend it.--What is left\r\n     becomes the domain of the State.--Obligatory functions of\r\n     the State.--Optional functions of the State.\r\n\r\nLet us now take into consideration, no longer the direct, but the\r\nindirect interest of all. Instead of considering individuals let us\r\nconcern ourselves with their works. Let us regard human society as a\r\nmaterial and spiritual workshop, whose perfection consists in making\r\nit as productive, economical, and as well furnished and managed as\r\npossible. Even with this secondary and subordinate aim, the domain of\r\nthe State is scarcely to be less restricted: very few new functions are\r\nto be attributed to it; nearly all the rest will be better fulfilled by\r\nindependent persons, or by natural or voluntary associations.--\r\n\r\nLet us consider the man who works for his own benefit, the farmer,\r\nthe manufacturer, the merchant, and observe how attentive he is to his\r\nbusiness. This is because his interest and pride are involved. One side\r\nhis welfare and that of those around him is at stake, his capital, his\r\nreputation, his social position and advancement; on the other side,\r\nare poverty, ruin, social degradation, dependence, bankruptcy and the\r\nalms-house. In the presence of this alternative he keeps close watch and\r\nbecomes industrious; he thinks of his business even when abed or at his\r\nmeals; he studies it, not from a distance, speculatively, in a general\r\nway, but on the spot, practically, in detail, in all its bearings and\r\nrelationships, constantly calculating difficulties and resources, with\r\nsuch sharp insight and special information that for any other person\r\nto try to solve the daily problem which he solves, would be impossible,\r\nbecause nobody could possess or estimate as he can the precise elements\r\nwhich constitute it.--Compare with this unique devotion and these\r\npeculiar qualifications the ordinary capacity and listless regularity of\r\na senior public official, even when expert and honest. He is sure of his\r\nsalary, provided he does his duty tolerably well, and this he does when\r\nhe is occupied during official hours. Let his papers be correct, in\r\nconformity with regulations and custom, and nothing more is asked\r\nof him; he need not tax his brain beyond that. If he conceives any\r\neconomical measure, or any improvement of his branch of the service, not\r\nhe, but the public, an anonymous and vague impersonality, reaps all the\r\nbenefit of it. Moreover, why should he care about it, since his project\r\nor reform might end up in the archives. The machine is too vast and\r\ncomplicated, too unwieldy, too clumsy, with its rusty wheels, its \"old\r\ncustoms and acquired rights,\" to be renewed and rebuilt as one might a\r\nfarm, a warehouse or a foundry. Accordingly, he has no idea of troubling\r\nhimself further in the matter; on leaving his office he dismisses it\r\nfrom his mind; he lets things go on automatically, just as it happens,\r\nin a costly way and with indifferent results. Even in a country of as\r\nmuch probity as France, it is calculated that every enterprise managed\r\nby the State costs one quarter more, and brings in one quarter less,\r\nthan when entrusted to private hands. Consequently if work were\r\nwithheld from individuals in order that the State might undertake it the\r\ncommunity, when the accounts came to be balanced, would suffer a loss of\r\none-half.[2216]\r\n\r\nNow, this is true of all work, whether spiritual or material not only of\r\nagricultural, industrial and commercial products, but, again, of works\r\nof science and of art, of literature and philosophy, of charity, of\r\neducation and propaganda. Not only when driven by egoism, such as\r\npersonal interest and vulgar vanity, but also when a disinterested\r\nsentiment is involved, such the discovery of truth, the creation of\r\nbeauty, the propagation of a faith, the diffusion of convictions,\r\nreligious enthusiasm or natural generosity, love in a broad or a narrow\r\nsense, spanning from one who embraces all humanity to one who devotes\r\nhimself wholly to his friends and kindred. The effect is the same in\r\nboth cases, because the cause is the same. Always, in the shop directed\r\nby the free workman, the motivating force is enormous, almost\r\ninfinite, because it is a living spring which flows at all hours and is\r\ninexhaustible. The mother thinks constantly of her child, the savant of\r\nhis science, the artist of his art, the inventor of his inventions, the\r\nphilanthropist of his endowments, Faraday of electricity, Stephenson\r\nof his locomotive, Pasteur of his microbes, De Lesseps of his isthmus,\r\nsisters of charity of their poor. Through this peculiar concentration of\r\nthought, man derives every possible advantage from human faculties and\r\nsurroundings; he himself gets to be a more and more perfect instrument,\r\nand, moreover, he fashions others: with this he daily reduces the\r\nfriction of the powerful machine which he controls and of which he\r\nis the main wheel; he increases its yield ; he economizes, maintains,\r\nrepairs and improves it with a capability and success that nobody\r\nquestions; in short, he fabricates in a superior way.--But this\r\nliving source, to which the superiority of the works is due, cannot\r\nbe separated from the owner and chief, for it issues from his own\r\naffections and deepest sentiments. It is useless without him; out of\r\nhis hands, in the hands of strangers, the fountain ceases to flow and\r\nproduction stops.--If, consequently, a good and large yield is required,\r\nhe alone must have charge of the mill; he is the resident owner of\r\nit, the one who sets it in motion, the born engineer, installed and\r\nspecially designed for that position. In vain may attempts be made to\r\nturn the stream elsewhere; there simply ensues a stoppage of the natural\r\nissue, a dam barring useful canals, a haphazard change of current\r\nnot only without gain, but loss, the stream subsiding in swamps or\r\nundermining the steep banks of a ravine. At the utmost, the millions of\r\nbuckets of water, forcibly taken from private reservoirs, half fill with\r\na good deal of trouble the great central artificial basin in which the\r\nwater, low and stagnant, is never sufficient in quantity or force to\r\nmove the huge public wheel that replaces the small private wheels, doing\r\nthe nation's work.\r\n\r\nThus, even when we only consider men as manufactures, even if we treat\r\nthem simply as producers of what is valuable and serviceable, with\r\nno other object in view than to furnish society with supplies and to\r\nbenefit the consumers, even though the private domain includes all\r\nenterprises undertaken by private individuals, either singly or\r\nassociated together, through personal interests or personal taste, then\r\nthis is enough to ensure that all is managed better than the State could\r\nhave done; it is by virtue of this that they have devolved into their\r\nhands. Consequently, in the vast field of labor, they themselves decide\r\non what they will undertake; they themselves, of their own authority,\r\nset their own limits. They may therefore enlarge their own domain to any\r\nextent they please, and reduce indefinitely the domain of the State. On\r\nthe contrary, the State cannot pretend to more than what they leave; as\r\nthey advance on their common territory separated by vague frontiers, it\r\nis bound to recede and leave the ground to them; whatever the task\r\nis, it should not perform it except in case of their default, or their\r\nprolonged absence, or on proof of their having abandoned it.\r\n\r\nAll the rest, therefore falls to the State; first, the offices which\r\nthey would never claim, and which they will deliberately leave in its\r\nhands, because they do not have that indispensable instrument, called\r\narmed force. This force forces assures the protection of the community\r\nagainst foreign communities, the protection of individuals against one\r\nanother, the levying of soldiers, the imposition of taxes, the execution\r\nof the laws, the administration of justice and of the police.--Next\r\nto this, come matters of which the accomplishment concerns everybody\r\nwithout directly interesting any one in particular--the government of\r\nunoccupied territory, the administration of rivers, coasts, forests and\r\npublic highways, the task of governing subject countries, the framing\r\nof laws, the coinage of money, the conferring of a civil status,\r\nthe negotiating in the name of the community with local and special\r\ncorporations, departments, communes, banks, institutions, churches, and\r\nuniversities.--Add to these, according to circumstances, sundry optional\r\nco-operative services,[2217] such as subsidies granted to institutions\r\nof great public utility, for which private contributions could not\r\nsuffice, now in the shape of concessions to corporations for which\r\nequivalent obligations are exacted, and, again, in those hygienic\r\nprecautions which individuals fail to take through indifference; so\r\noccasionally, such provisional aid as supports a man, or so stimulates\r\nhim as to enable him some day or other to support himself; and, in\r\ngeneral, those discreet and scarcely perceptible interpositions for\r\nthe time being which prove so advantageous in the future, like a\r\nfar-reaching code and other consistent regulations which, mindful of the\r\nliberty of the existing individual, provide for the welfare of coming\r\ngenerations. Nothing beyond that.\r\n\r\nAgain, in this preparation for future welfare the same principle still\r\nholds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Fabrication of social instruments.\r\n\r\n     Fabrication of social instruments.--Application of this\r\n     principle.--How all kinds of useful laborers are formed.--\r\n     Respect for spontaneous sources, the essential and adequate\r\n     condition.--Obligation of the State to respect these.--They\r\n     dry up when it monopolizes them.--The aim of patriotism.--\r\n     The aim of other liberal dispositions.--Impoverishment of\r\n     all the productive faculties.--Destructive effect of the\r\n     Jacobin system.\r\n\r\nAmong the precious products, the most precious and important are,\r\nevidently, the animated instruments, namely the men, since they produce\r\nthe rest. The object then, is to fashion men capable of physical,\r\nmental or moral labor, the most energetic, the most persistent, the most\r\nskillful and most productive; now, we already know the conditions of\r\ntheir formation. It is essential and sufficient, that the vivacious\r\nsources, described above, should flow there, on the spot, each through\r\nits natural outlet, and under the control of the owner. On this\r\ncondition the jet becomes more vigorous, for the acquired impetus\r\nincreases the original outflow; the producer becomes more and more\r\nskillful, since 'practice makes perfect.' Those around him likewise\r\nbecome better workmen, inasmuch as they find encouragement in his\r\nsuccess and avail themselves of his discoveries.--Thus, simply because\r\nthe State respects, and enforces respect, for these individual sources\r\nin private hands, it develops in individuals, as well as in those around\r\nthem, the will and the talent for producing much and well, the faculty\r\nfor, and desire to, keep on producing more and better; in other words,\r\nall sorts of energies and capacities, each of its own kind and in its\r\nown place, with all compatible fullness and efficiency. Such is the\r\noffice, and the sole office, of the State, first in relation to the\r\nturbid and frigid springs issuing from selfishness and self-conceit,\r\nwhose operations demand its oversight, and next for still stronger\r\nreasons, in relation to the warm and pure springs whose beneficence is\r\nunalloyed, as in the family affections and private friendships; again,\r\nin relation to those rarer and higher springs, such as the love of\r\nbeauty, the yearning for truth, the spirit of association, patriotism\r\nand love of mankind; and, finally, for still stronger reasons, in\r\nrelation to the two most sacred and salutary of all springs, conscience\r\nwhich renders will subject to duty, and honor which makes will the\r\nsupport of justice. Let the State prevent, as well as abstain from, any\r\ninterference with either; let this be its object and nothing more; its\r\nabstention is as necessary as its vigilance. Let it guard both, and\r\nit will see everywhere growing spontaneously, hourly, each in degree\r\naccording to conditions of time and place, the most diligent and most\r\ncompetent workmen, the agriculturist, the manufacturer, the merchant,\r\nthe savant, the artist, the inventor, the propagandist, the husband and\r\nwife, the father and mother, the patriot, the philanthropist and the\r\nsister of charity.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if, like our Jacobins, the State seeks to confiscate\r\nevery natural force to its own profit, it seeks to make affection for\r\nitself paramount, if it strives to suppress all other passions and\r\ninterests, if it tolerates no other preoccupation than that which\r\nconcerns the common weal, if it tries to forcibly convert every member\r\nof society into a Spartan or Jesuit, then, at enormous cost, will it not\r\nonly destroy private fountains, and spread devastation over the entire\r\nterritory, but it will destroy its own fountain-head. We honor the State\r\nonly for the services it renders to us, and proportionately to these\r\nservices and the security it affords us, and to the liberty which it\r\nensures us under the title of universal benefactor; when it deliberately\r\nwounds us through our dearest interests and most tender affections, when\r\nit goes so far as to attack our honor and conscience, when it becomes\r\nthe universal wrong-doer, our affection for it, in the course of time,\r\nturns into hatred. Let this system be maintained, and patriotism,\r\nexhausted, dries up, and, one by one, all other beneficent springs,\r\nuntil, finally, nothing is visible over the whole country, but stagnant\r\npools or overwhelming torrents, inhabited by passive subjects or\r\ndepredators. As in the Roman empire in the fourth century, in Italy in\r\nthe seventeenth century, in the Turkish provinces in our own day, naught\r\nremains but an ill-conducted herd of stunted, torpid creatures, limited\r\nto their daily wants and animal instincts, indifferent to the public\r\nwelfare and to their own prospective interests, so degenerate as to have\r\nlost sight of their own discoveries, unlearned their own sciences,\r\narts and industries, and, in short, and worse than all, base, false,\r\ncorrupted souls entirely wanting in honor and conscience. Nothing is\r\nmore destructive than the unrestricted meddling of the State, even when\r\nwise and paternal; in Paraguay, under the discipline of Jesuits, so\r\nminute in its details, \"Indian physiognomy appeared like that of animals\r\ntaken in a trap.\" They worked, ate, drank and gave birth by sound of\r\nbells, under watch and ward, correctly and mechanically, but showing no\r\nliking for anything, not even for their own existence, being transformed\r\ninto so may automatons; at least it may be said is that the means\r\nemployed to produce this result were gentle and that they, before their\r\ntransformation were mere brutes. But those who the revolutionary-Jesuit\r\nnow undertakes to transform into robots, and by harsh means, are human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Comparison between despotisms.\r\n\r\n     Comparison between despotisms.--Philip II and Louis XIV.--\r\n     Cromwell and Frederick the Great.--Peter the Great and the\r\n     Sultans.--Relationship between the tasks the Jacobins are to\r\n     carry out and the assets at their disposal.--Disproportion\r\n     between the burdens they are to carry and the forces at\r\n     their disposal.--Folly of their undertaking.--Physical force\r\n     the only governmental force they possess.--They are\r\n     compelled to exercise it.--They are compelled to abuse it.--\r\n     Character of their government.--Character requisite of their\r\n     leaders.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, in European history, despotism almost equally harsh have\r\nborn down heavily on human effort; but never have any of them been so\r\nthoroughly inept; for none have ever attempted to raise so heavy a mass\r\nwith so short a lever. And to start with, no matter how authoritative\r\nthe despot might have been, his intervention was limited.--Philip\r\nII. burned heretics, persecuted Moors and drove out Jews; Louis XIV.\r\nforcibly converted the Protestants; but both used violence only against\r\ndissenters, about a fifteenth or a twentieth of their subjects. If\r\nCromwell, on becoming Protector, remained sectarian, and the compulsory\r\nservant of an army of sectarians, he took good care not to impose\r\non other churches the theology, rites and discipline of his own\r\nchurch;[2218] on the contrary, he repressed fanatical outrages;\r\nprotected the Anabaptists as well as his Independents. He granted paid\r\ncurates to the Presbyterians as well as the public exercise of their\r\nworship, he showed the Episcopalians a large tolerance and gave them\r\nthe right to worship in private; he maintained the two great Anglican\r\nuniversities and allowed the Jews to erect a synagogue.--Frederick II.\r\ndrafted into his army every able-bodied peasant that he could feed; he\r\nkept every man twenty years in the service, under a discipline worse\r\nthan slavery, with almost certain prospect of death; and in his last\r\nwar, he sacrificed about one sixth of his male subjects;[2219] but they\r\nwere serfs, and his conscription did not touch the bourgeois class. He\r\nput his hands in the pockets of the bourgeois and of every other man,\r\nand took every crown they had; when driven to it, he adulterated coin\r\nand stopped paying his functionaries; but, under the scrutiny of his\r\neyes, always open, the administration was honest, the police effective,\r\njustice exact, toleration unlimited, and the freedom of the press\r\ncomplete; the king allowed the publication of the most cutting pamphlets\r\nagainst himself, and their public sale, even at Berlin.--A little\r\nearlier, in the great empire of the east, Peter the Great,[2220] with\r\nwhip in hand, lashed his Muscovite bears and made them drill and dance\r\nin European fashion; but were bears accustomed from father to son to the\r\nwhip and chain; moreover, he stood as the orthodox head of their faith,\r\nand left their mir (the village commune) untouched.--Finally, at the\r\nother extremity of Europe, and even outside of Europe, in the seventh\r\ncentury the caliph, in the fifteenth century a sultan, a Mahomet or an\r\nOmar, a fanatical Arab or brutal Turk, who had just overcome Christians\r\nwith the sword, himself assigned the limits of his own absolutism:\r\nif the vanquished were reduced to the condition of heavily ransomed\r\ntributaries and of inferiors daily humiliated, he allowed them\r\ntheir worship, civil laws and domestic usages; he left them their\r\ninstitutions, their convents and their schools; he allowed them to\r\nadminister the affairs of their own community as they pleased under\r\nthe jurisdiction of their patriarch, or other natural chieftains.--Thus\r\nwhatever the tyrant may have been, he did not attempt to entirely\r\nrecast Man, nor to subject all his subjects to the recasting. However\r\npenetrating the tyranny, it stopped in the soul at a certain point;\r\nthat point reached, the sentiments were left free. No matter how\r\ncomprehensive this tyranny may have been, it affected only one class of\r\nmen; the others, outside the net, remained free. When it wounded all at\r\nonce all sensitive chords, it did so only to a limited minority, unable\r\nto defend themselves. As far as the majority, able to protect itself,\r\ntheir main sensibilities were respected, especially the most sensitive,\r\nthis one or that one, as the case might be, now the conscience which\r\nbinds man to his religion, now that amour-propre on which honor depends,\r\nand now the habits which make man cling to customs, hereditary usages\r\nand outward observances. As far as the others were concerned, those\r\nwhich relate to property, personal welfare, and social position, it\r\nproceeded cautiously and with moderation. In this way the discretion\r\nof the ruler lessened the resistance of the subject, and a daring\r\nenterprise, even mischievous, was not outrageous; it might be carried\r\nout; nothing was required but a force in hand equal to the resistance it\r\nprovoked.\r\n\r\nAgain, and on the other hand, the tyrant possessed this force. Very many\r\nand very strong arms stood behind the prince ready to cooperate with him\r\nand countervail any resistance.--Behind Philip II. or Louis XIV. ready\r\nto drive the dissidents out or at least to consent to their oppression,\r\nstood the Catholic majority, as fanatical or as illiberal as their king.\r\nBehind Philip II., Louis XIV., Frederick II., and Peter the Great, stood\r\nthe entire nation, equally violent, rallied around the sovereign through\r\nhis consecrated title and uncontested right, through tradition and\r\ncustom, through a rigid sentiment of duty and the vague idea of public\r\nsecurity.--Peter the Great counted among his auxiliaries every eminent\r\nand cultivated man in the country; Cromwell had his disciplined and\r\ntwenty-times victorious army; the caliph or sultan brought along with\r\nhim his military and privileged population.--Aided by cohorts of this\r\nstamp, it was easy to raise a heavy mass, and even maintain it in a\r\nfixed position. Once the operation was concluded there followed a sort\r\nof equilibrium; the mass, kept in the air by a permanent counterbalance,\r\nonly required a little daily effort to prevent it from falling.\r\n\r\nIt is just the opposite with the Jacobin enterprise. When it is put\r\ninto operation, the theory, more exacting, adds an extra weight to the\r\nuplifted mass, and, finally, a burden of almost infinite weight.--At\r\nfirst, the Jacobin confined his attacks to royalty, to nobility, to\r\nthe Church, to parliaments, to privileges, to ecclesiastical and feudal\r\npossessions, in short, to medieval foundations. Then he attacks yet more\r\nancient and more solid foundations, positive religion, property and the\r\nfamily.--For four years he has been satisfied with demolition and now he\r\nwants to construct. His object is not merely to do away with a positive\r\nfaith and suppress social inequality, to proscribe revealed dogmas,\r\nhereditary beliefs, an established cult, the supremacy of rank and\r\nsuperiority of fortunes, wealth, leisure, refinement and elegance, but\r\nhe wants, in addition to all this, to re-fashion the citizen. He wants\r\nto create new sentiments, impose natural religion on the individual,\r\ncivic education, uniform ways and habits, Jacobin conduct, Spartan\r\nvirtue; in short, nothing is to be left in a human being that is not\r\nprescribed, enforced and constrained.--Henceforth, there is opposed to\r\nthe Revolution, not alone the partisans of the ancient régime--priests,\r\nnobles, parliamentarians, royalists, and Catholics--but, again, every\r\nperson imbued with European civilization, every member of a regular\r\nfamily, any possessor of a capital, large or small; every kind or degree\r\nof proprietor, farmer, manufacturer, merchant, artisan or farmer, even\r\nmost of the revolutionaries. Nearly all the revolutionaries count on\r\nescaping the constraints they impose, and who only like the strait\r\njacket when it is on another's back.--The influence of resistant wills\r\nat this moment becomes incalculable: it would be easier to raise\r\na mountain, and, just at this moment, the Jacobins have deprived\r\nthemselves of every moral force through which a political engineer acts\r\non human wills.\r\n\r\nUnlike Philip II. and Louis XIV. they are not supported by the\r\nintolerance of a vast majority, for, instead of fifteen or twenty\r\northodox against one heretic, they count in their church scarcely more\r\nthan one orthodox against fifteen or twenty heretics.[2221]--They are\r\nnot, like legitimate sovereigns, supported by the stubborn loyalty of\r\nan entire population, following in the steps of its chieftain out of the\r\nprestige of hereditary right and through habits of ancient fealty. On\r\nthe contrary, their reign is only a day old and they themselves are\r\ninterlopers. At first installed by a coup d'état and afterwards by the\r\nsemblance of an election, they have extorted or obtained by trick the\r\nsuffrages through which they act. They are so familiar with fraud and\r\nviolence that, in their own Assembly, the ruling minority has seized\r\nand held on to power by violence and fraud, putting down the majority by\r\nriots, and the departments by force of arms. To give their brutalities\r\nthe semblance of right, they improvise two pompous demonstrations,\r\nfirst, the sudden manufacture of a paper constitution, which molders\r\naway in their archives, and next, the scandalous farce of a hollow\r\nand compulsory plebiscite.--A dozen leaders of the party concentrate\r\nunlimited authority in their own hands; but, as admitted by them, their\r\nauthority is derivative; it is the Convention which makes them its\r\ndelegates; their precarious title has to be renewed monthly; a turn\r\nof the majority may sweep them and their work away to-morrow;\r\nan insurrection of the people, whom they have familiarized with\r\ninsurrection, may to-morrow sweep them away, their work and their\r\nmajority.--They maintain only a disputed, limited and transient\r\nascendancy over their adherents. They are not military chieftains like\r\nCromwell and Napoleon, generals of an army obeyed without a murmur, but\r\ncommon stump-speakers at the mercy of an audience that sits in judgment\r\non them. There is no discipline in this public; every Jacobin remains\r\nindependent by virtue of his principles; if he accepts leaders, it is\r\nwith a reservation of their worth to him; selecting them as he pleases,\r\nhe is free to change them when he pleases; his trust in them is\r\nintermittent, his loyalty provisional, and, as his adhesion depends on a\r\nmere preference, he always reserves the right to discard the favorite of\r\nto-day as he has discarded the favorite of yesterday. In this audience,\r\nthere is no such thing as subordination; the lowest demagogue, any noisy\r\nsubaltern, a Hébert or Jacques Roux, aspiring to step out of the ranks,\r\noverbidding the charlatans in office in order to obtain their places.\r\nEven with a complete and lasting ascendancy over an organized band\r\nof docile supporters, the Jacobin leaders would be feeble for lack of\r\nreliable and competent instruments; for they have but very few\r\npartisans other than those of doubtful probity and of notorious\r\nincapacity.--Cromwell had around him, to carry out the puritan program,\r\nthe moral élite of the nation, an army of rigorists, with narrow\r\nconsciences, but much more strict towards themselves than towards\r\nothers, men who never drank and who never swore, who never indulged for\r\na moment in sensuality or idleness, who forbade themselves every act\r\nof omission or commission about which they held any scruples, the most\r\nhonest, the most temperate, the most laborious and the most persevering\r\nof mankind,[2222] the only ones capable of laying the foundations of\r\nthat practical morality on which England and the United States still\r\nsubsist at the present day.--Around Peter the Great, in carrying out\r\nhis European program, stood the intellectual élite of the country, an\r\nimported staff of men of ability associated with natives of moderate\r\nability, every well-taught resident foreigner and indigenous Russian,\r\nthe only ones able to organize schools and public institutions, to set\r\nup a vast central and regular system of administration, to assign rank\r\naccording to service and merit, in short, to erect on the snow and\r\nmud of a shapeless barbarism a conservatory of civilization which,\r\ntransplanted like an exotic tree, grows and gradually becomes\r\nacclimated.--Around Couthon, Saint-Just, Billaud, Collot, and\r\nRobespierre, with the exception of certain men devoted, not to\r\nUtopianism but the country, and who, like Carnot, conform to the system\r\nin order to save France, there are but a few sectarians to carry out\r\nthe Jacobin program. These are men so short-sighted as not to clearly\r\ncomprehend its fallacies, or sufficiently fanatical to accept its\r\nhorrors, a lot of social outcasts and self-constituted statesmen,\r\ninfatuated through incommensurate faculties with the parts they\r\nplay, unsound in mind and superficially educated, wholly incompetent,\r\nboundless in ambition, their consciences perverted, callous or deadened\r\nby sophistry, hardened through arrogance or killed by crime, by impunity\r\nand by success.\r\n\r\nThus, whilst other despots raise a moderate weight, calling around them\r\neither the majority or the flower of the nation, employing the best\r\nstrength of the country and lengthening their lever (of despotism) as\r\nmuch as possible, the Jacobins attempt to raise an incalculable weight,\r\nrepel the majority as well as the flower of the nation, discard the best\r\nstrength of the country, and shorten their lever to the utmost. They\r\nhold on only to the shorter end, the rough, clumsy, iron-bound, creaking\r\nand grinding extremity, that is to say, to physical force,--the means\r\nfor physical constraint, the heavy hand of the gendarme on the shoulder\r\nof the suspect, the jailer's bolts and keys turned on the prisoner, the\r\nclub used by the sans-culottes on the back of the bourgeois to quicken\r\nhis pace, and, better still, the Septembriseur's pike thrust into the\r\naristocrat's belly, and the blade falling on the neck held fast in the\r\nclutches of the guillotine.--Such, henceforth, is the only machinery\r\nthey posses for governing the country, for they have deprived themselves\r\nof all other. Their engine has to be exhibited, for it works only on\r\ncondition that its bloody image be stamped indelibly on every body's\r\nimagination; if the Negro monarch or the pasha desires to see heads\r\nbowing as he passes along, he must be escorted by executioners. They\r\nmust abuse their engine because fear losing its effect through habit,\r\nneeds example to keep it alive; the Negro monarch or the pasha who would\r\nkeep the fear alive by which he rules, must be stimulated every day;\r\nhe must slaughter too many to be sure of slaughtering enough; he must\r\nslaughter constantly, in heaps, indiscriminately, haphazard, no matter\r\nfor what offense, on the slightest suspicion, the innocent along with\r\nthe guilty. He and his are lost the moment they cease to obey this rule.\r\nEvery Jacobin, like every African monarch or pasha, must it that he\r\nmay be and remain at the head of his band.--That is the reason why\r\nthe chiefs of the party, its natural and pre-determined leaders, are\r\ntheoreticians able to grasp its principle and logicians capable of\r\ndrawing its consequences. They are, however, so inept as to be unable\r\nto understand that their enterprise exceeds both their own and all other\r\nhuman resources, but shrewd enough to see that brutal force is their\r\nonly tool, inhuman enough to apply it unscrupulously and without\r\nreserve, and perverted enough to murder at random in order to\r\ndisseminate terror.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2201: Buchez et Roux, XXXII, 354.

I., 241, 247, II., 393,\r\nIII., 9, 11, 21, 52. \"Every district chief, on the twelfth day of the\r\nfirst moon, assembles together the men of his district and reads to\r\nthem the table of rules; he examines their virtue, their conduct, their\r\nprogress in the right path, and in their knowledge, and encourages them;\r\nhe investigates their errors, their failings and prevents them from\r\ndoing evil.... Superintendents of marriages see that young people marry\r\nat the prescribed age.\" The reduction of man to a State automaton is\r\nplain enough in the institution of \"Overseer of Gags...\" At all grand\r\nhunts, at all gatherings of troops, he orders the application of gags.\r\nIn these cases gags are put in the soldiers' mouths; they then fulfill\r\ntheir duties without tumult or shouting.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2206: These two words have no exact equivalents in Greek or\r\nLatin, Conscientia, dignitas, honos denote different shade of meaning.\r\nThis difference is most appreciable in the combination of the two modern\r\nterms delicate conscience, scrupulous conscience, and the phrase of\r\nstake one's honour on this or that, make it a point of honor, the laws\r\nof honor, etc. The technical terms of antique morality: the beautiful,\r\ntruthfulness, the sovereign good, indicate ideas of another stamp and\r\norigin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2207: Alas, modern 20th century democratic Man has given up\r\nhonor and conscience, all he has got to do is to be correct and follow\r\nthe thousands of rules governing his life. And, of course, make sure\r\nthat he is following orders or sure of not being caught when he breaks\r\nthe natural rules of friendship, honor or conscience. Conscience, on\r\nthe other had, will always lurk somewhere in the shadows of our mind,\r\nbecause we all know how we would like to be treated by others, and\r\nwill be forced not to transgress certain boundaries in case an intended\r\nvictim might be in a position to take his revenge. That I am not alone\r\nin seeing things this way I noted in an interview with the 79 year old\r\nFrench author Michel Déon in Le Figaro on the 16th of May 1998 in which\r\nMr. Déon said: \"Everywhere we are still in a nursery. A great movement\r\nattempting to turn us all into half-wits (une grande campagne de\r\ncrétinisation est en route). When these are the only ones left, the\r\ngovernments have an easy job. It is very clever.\" (SR.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2208: Montaigne, Essays, book I., ch. 42: \"Observe in\r\nprovinces far from the court, in Brittany for example, the retinue,\r\nthe subjects, the duties, the ceremony, of a seignior living alone\r\nby himself, brought up among his dependents, and likewise observe the\r\nflights of his imagination, there is nothing which is more royal; he may\r\nallude to his superior once a year, as if he were the King of Persia...\r\nThe burden of sovereignty scarcely affects the French gentilhomme twice\r\nin his life... he who lurks in his own place avoiding dispute and trial\r\nis as free as the Duke of Venice.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2209: \"Mémoires de Chateaubriand,\" vol. I. (\"Les Soirées au\r\nChateau de Cambourg\".)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2210: In China, the moral principle is just the opposite. The\r\nChinese, amidst obstacles and embarrassments, always enjoin siao-sin,\r\nwhich means, \"abate thy affections.\" (Huc, \"L'Empire Chinoise,\" I.,\r\n204.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2211: In the United states the moral order of things reposes\r\nchiefly on puritan ideas; nevertheless deep traces of feudal conceptions\r\nare found there; for instance, the general deference for women which is\r\nquite chivalric there, and even excessive.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2212: Observe, from this point of view, in the woman of modern\r\ntimes the defenses of female virtue. The (male) sentiment of duty is the\r\nfirst safeguard of modesty, but this has a much more powerful auxiliary\r\nin the sentiment of honor, or deep innate pride.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2213: The moral standard varies, but according to a fixed law,\r\nthe same as a mathematical function. Each community has its own moral\r\nelements, organization, history and surroundings, and necessarily its\r\npeculiar conditions of vitality. When the queen been in a hive is chosen\r\nand impregnated this condition involves the massacre of useless male\r\nand female rivals (Darwin). In China, it consists of paternal authority,\r\nliterary education and ritual observances. In the antique city, it\r\nconsisted of the omnipotence of the State, gymnastic education, and\r\nslavery. In each century, and in each country, these vital conditions\r\nare expressed by more or less hereditary passwords which set forth or\r\ninterdict this or that class of actions. When the individual feels\r\nthe inward challenge he is conscious of obligation; the moral conflict\r\nconsists in the struggle within himself between the universal password\r\nand personal desire. In our European society the vital condition, and\r\nthus the general countersign, is self-respect coupled with respect for\r\nothers (including women and children). This countersign, new in history,\r\nhas a singular advantage over all preceding ones: each individual being\r\nrespected, each can develop himself according to his nature; he can\r\naccordingly invent in every sense, bring forth every sort of production\r\nand be useful to himself and others in every way, thus enabling society\r\nto develop indefinitely.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2214: Taine is probably speaking of the colonial wars in China\r\nand the conquest of Madagascar. (SR).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2215: Here Taine is seeing mankind as being male, strong and\r\nhardy; however I feel that liberty is more desirable for the strong and\r\nconfident while the child, the lost, the sick, the ignorant or feeble\r\nperson is looking for protection, reassurance and guidance. When society\r\nconsisted of strong independent farmers, hunters, warriors, nomads or\r\nartisans backed by family and clan, liberty was an important idea. Today\r\nfew if any can rise above the horde and gain the insights, the wisdom\r\nand the competence which once was such a common thing. Today the strong\r\nseek promotion inside the hierarchy of the welfare state rest-house.\r\n(S.R.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2216: This is just what Lenin could not believe when he read\r\nthis around 1906. Even Taine did not see how much a French government\r\norganization depended upon staff recruited from a hardworking,\r\nmodest and honest French population. We have now lived to see how the\r\nnationalization of private property in Egypt, Argentina, Algeria not\r\nto speak of Ethiopia and India proved disastrous and how 40 years of\r\ngovernment ownership should degrade and corrupt the populations of\r\nRussia, China, Yugoslavia, Albania etc. (SR).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2217: When the function to be performed is of an uncertain or\r\nmixed character the following rule may be applied in deciding\r\nwhether the State or individuals shall be entrusted with it; also in\r\ndetermining, in the case of cooperation, what portion of it shall be\r\nassigned to individuals and what portion to the State. As a general\r\nrule, when individuals, either singly or associated together, have a\r\ndirect interest in, or are drawn toward, a special function, and\r\nthe community has no direct interest therein, the matter belongs to\r\nindividuals and not to the State. On the other hand, if the interest of\r\nthe community in any function is direct, and indirect for individuals\r\nsingly or associated together, it is proper for the State and not for\r\nindividuals to take hold of it.--According to this rule the limits of\r\nthe public and private domain can be defined, which limits, as they\r\nchange backward and forward, may be verified according to the changes\r\nwhich take place in interests and preferences, direct or indirect.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2218: Carlyle: \"Cromwell's Speeches and Letters,\" III., 418.\r\n(Cromwell's address to the Parliament, September 17, 1656.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2219: Seeley, \"Life and Times of Stein,\" II., 143.--Macaulay,\r\n\"Biographical essays,\" Frederick the Great. 33, 35, 87, 92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2220: Eugene Schuyler, \"Peter the Great,\" vol. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2221: Cf. \"The Revolution\" vol.

In addition to this,\r\nhe displays the usual physical symptoms, such as insomnia, a pallid\r\ncomplexion, hot-headed, foulness of dress and person,[3101] with,\r\nduring the last five months of his life, rashes and itching all over his\r\nbody.[3102] Issuing from ill-matched stock, born of a mixed blood and\r\ntainted with serious moral agitation,[3103] he carries within him a\r\npeculiar germ: physically, he is a freak, morally a pretender, and one\r\nwho covet all places of distinction. His father, who was a physician,\r\nintended, from his early childhood, that he should be a scholar; his\r\nmother, an idealist, had prepared him to become a philanthropist, while\r\nhe himself always steered his course towards both summits.\r\n\r\n\"At five years of age,\" he says, \"it would have pleased me to be a\r\nschool-master, at fifteen a professor, at eighteen an author, and a\r\ncreative genius at twenty,\"[3104]and, afterwards, up to the last, an\r\napostle and martyr to humanity. \"From my earliest infancy I had an\r\nintense love of fame which changed its object at various stages of my\r\nlife, but which never left me for a moment.\" He rambled over Europe\r\nor vegetated in Paris for thirty years, living a nomadic life in\r\nsubordinate positions, hissed as an author, distrusted as a man of\r\nscience and ignored as a philosopher, a third rate political writer,\r\naspiring to every sort of celebrity and to every honor, constantly\r\npresenting himself as a candidate and as constantly rejected,--too\r\ngreat a disproportion between his faculties and ambition! Without\r\ntalents,[3105] possessing no critical acumen and of mediocre\r\nintelligence, he was fitted only to teach some branch of the sciences,\r\nor to practice some one of the arts, either as professor or doctor more\r\nor less bold and lucky, or to follow, with occasional slips on one side\r\nor the other, some path clearly marked out for him. \"But,\" he says, \"I\r\nconstantly refused any subject which did not hold out a promise.... of\r\nshowing off my originality and providing great results, for I\r\ncannot make up my mind to treat a subject already well done by\r\nothers.\"--Consequently, when he tries to originate he merely imitates,\r\nor commits mistakes. His treatise on \"Man\" is a jumble of physiological\r\nand moral common-places, made up of ill-digested reading and words\r\nstrung together haphazard,[3106] of gratuitous and incoherent\r\nsuppositions in which the doctrines of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, coupled together, end in empty phraseology. \"Soul and Body\r\nare distinct substances with no essential relationship, being connected\r\ntogether solely through the nervous fluid;\" this fluid is not gelatinous\r\nfor the spirits by which it is renewed contains no gelatin; the soul,\r\nexcited by this, excites that; hence the place assigned to it \"in the\r\nbrain.\"--His \"Optics\"[3107] is the reverse of the great truth already\r\ndiscovered by Newton more than a century before, and since confirmed by\r\nmore than another century of experiment and calculation. On \"Heat\"\r\nand \"Electricity\" he merely puts forth feeble hypotheses and literary\r\ngeneralizations; one day, driven to the wall, he inserts a needle in a\r\nresin to make this a conductor, in which piece of scientific trickery\r\nhe is caught by the physicist Charles.[3108] He is not even qualified to\r\ncomprehend the great discoverers of his age, Laplace, Monge, Lavoisier,\r\nor Fourcroy; on the contrary, he libels them in the style of a low\r\nrebellious subordinate, who, without the shadow of a claim, aims to take\r\nthe place of legitimate authorities. In Politics, he adopts every absurd\r\nidea in vogue growing out of the \"Contrat-Social\" based on natural\r\nright, and which he renders still more absurd by repeating as his own\r\nthe arguments advanced by those bungling socialists, who, physiologists\r\nastray in the moral world, derive all rights from physical necessities.\r\n\r\n\"All human rights issue from physical wants[3109]... If a man has\r\nnothing, he has a right to any surplus with which another gorges\r\nhimself. What do I say? He has a right to seize the indispensable,\r\nand, rather than die of hunger, he may cut another's throat and eat\r\nhis throbbing flesh.... Man has a right to self-preservation, to the\r\nproperty, the liberty and even the lives of his fellow creatures. To\r\nescape oppression he has a right to repress, to bind and to massacre. He\r\nis free to do what he pleases to ensure his own happiness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain enough what this leads to.--But, let the consequences\r\nbe what they may, whatever he writes or does, it is always in\r\nself-admiration and always in a counter sense, being as vain-glorious\r\nof his encyclopedic impotence as he is of his social mischievousness.\r\nTaking his word for it, his discoveries in Physics will render him\r\nimmortal[3110]:\r\n\r\n\"They will at least effect a complete transformation in Optics.... The\r\ntrue primitive colors were unknown before me.\"\r\n\r\nHe is a Newton, and still better. Previous to his appearance \"the place\r\noccupied by the electrical fluid in nature, considered as an universal\r\nagent, was completely ignored. .. I have made it known in such a way as\r\nto leave no further doubt about it.\"[3111] As to the heat-engendering\r\nfluid, \"that substance unknown until my discovery, I have freed\r\nthe theory from every hypothesis and conjecture, from every alembic\r\nargument; I have purged it of error, I have rendered it intuitive; I\r\nhave written this out in a small volume which consigns to oblivion all\r\nthat scientific bodies have hitherto published on that subject.\"[3112]\r\nAnterior to his treatise on \"Man,\" the relationships between moral and\r\nphysics were incomprehensible. \"Descartes, Helvetius, Hailer, Lecat,\r\nHume, Voltaire, Bonnet, held this to be an impenetrable secret, 'an\r\nenigma.'\" He has solved the problem, he has fixed the seat of the soul,\r\nhe has determined the medium through which the soul communicates with\r\nthe body.[3113]--In the higher sciences, those treating of nature\r\ngenerally, or of human society, he reaches the climax. \"I believe that\r\nI have exhausted every combination of the human intellect in relation\r\nto morals, philosophy and political science.\"[3114] Not only has he\r\ndiscovered the true theory of government, but he is a statesman, a\r\npractical expert, able to forecast the future and shape events. He makes\r\npredictions, on the average, twice a week, which always turn out right;\r\nhe already claims, during the early sessions of the Convention, to have\r\nmade \"three hundred predictions on the leading points of the Revolution,\r\nall justified by the event.\"[3115]--In the face of the Constituents who\r\ndemolish and reconstruct so slowly, he is sufficiently strong to take\r\ndown, put up and complete at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\n\"If I were one of the people's tribunes[3116] and were supported by a\r\nfew thousand determined men, I answer for it that, in six weeks, the\r\nConstitution would be perfected, the political machine well agoing,\r\nand the nation free and happy. In less than a year there would be a\r\nflourishing, formidable government which would remain so as long as I\r\nlived.\"--If necessary, he could act as commander-in-chief of the army\r\nand always be victorious: having twice seen the Vendeans carry on a\r\nfight he would end the war \"at the first encounter.\"[3117]--\"If I could\r\nstand the march, I would go in person and carry out my views. At the\r\nhead of a small party of trusty troops the rebels could be easily put\r\ndown to the last man, and in one day. I know something of military art,\r\nand; without boasting, I can answer for success.\"--On any difficulty\r\noccurring, it is owing to his advice not having been taken; he is the\r\ngreat political physician: his diagnosis from the beginning of the\r\nRevolution is always correct, his prognosis infallible, his therapeutics\r\nefficacious, humane and salutary. He provides the panacea and he should\r\nbe allowed to prescribe it; only, to ensure a satisfactory operation, he\r\nshould himself administer the dose. Let the public lancet, therefore,\r\nbe put in his hands that he may perform the humanitarian operation of\r\nbloodletting. \"Such are my opinions. I have published them in my works.\r\nI have signed them with my name and I am not ashamed of it.... If you\r\nare not equal to me and able to comprehend me so much the worse for\r\nyou.\"[3118] In other words, in his own eyes, Marat is in advance of\r\neverybody else and, through his superior genius and character, he is the\r\nveritable savior.\r\n\r\nSuch are the symptoms by which medical men recognize immediately one of\r\nthose partial lunatics who may not be put in confinement, but who are\r\nall the more dangerous;[3119] the malady, as they would express it in\r\ntechnical terms, may be called the ambitious delirium, well known in\r\nlunatic asylums.--Two predispositions, one an habitually perverted\r\njudgment, and the other a colossal excess of self-esteem,[3120]\r\nconstitute its sources, and nowhere are both more prolific than in\r\nMarat. Never did a man with such diversified culture, possess such an\r\nincurably perverted intellect. Never did a man, after so many abortive\r\nspeculations and such repeated malpractices, conceive and maintain so\r\nhigh an opinion of himself. Each of these two sources in him augments\r\nthe other: through his faculty of not seeing things as they are, he\r\nattributes to himself virtue and genius; satisfied that he possesses\r\ngenius and virtue, he regards his misdeeds as merits and his whims as\r\ntruths.--Thenceforth, and spontaneously, his malady runs its own course\r\nand becomes complex; to the ambitious delirium comes the persecution\r\nmania. In effect, the evident or demonstrated truths which he advances\r\nshould strike the public at once; if they burn slowly or miss fire,\r\nit is owing to their being stamped out by enemies or the envious;\r\nmanifestly, they have conspired against him, and against him plots have\r\nnever ceased. First came the philosophers' plot: when his treatise on\r\n\"Man\" was sent to Paris from Amsterdam, \"they felt the blow I struck at\r\ntheir principles and had the book stopped at the custom-house.\"[3121]\r\nNext came the plot of the doctors: \"they ruefully estimated my enormous\r\ngains. Were it necessary, I could prove that they often met together to\r\nconsider the best way to destroy my reputation.\" Finally, came the plot\r\nof the Academicians; \"the disgraceful persecution I had to undergo from\r\nthe Academy of Sciences for two years, after being satisfied that my\r\ndiscoveries on Light upset all that it had done for a century, and that\r\nI was quite indifferent about becoming a member of its body.... Would it\r\nbe believed that these scientific charlatans succeeded in underrating\r\nmy discoveries throughout Europe, in exciting every society\r\nof savants against me, and in closing against me all the\r\nnewspapers?\"[3122]--Naturally, the would-be-persecuted man defends\r\nhimself, that is to say, he attacks. Naturally, as he is the aggressor,\r\nhe is repulsed and put down, and, after creating imaginary enemies, he\r\ncreates real ones, especially in politics where, on principle, he\r\ndaily preaches insurrection and murder. And finally, he is of course\r\nprosecuted, convicted at the Chatelet court, tracked by the police,\r\nobliged to fly and wander from one hiding-place to another; to live like\r\na bat \"in a cellar, underground, in a dark dungeon;\"[3123] once, says\r\nhis friend Panis, he passed \"six weeks sitting on his behind\" like\r\na madman in his cell, face to face with his reveries.--It is not\r\nsurprising that, with such a system, the reverie should become more\r\nintense, more and more gloomy, and, at last settle down into a\r\nconfirmed nightmare; that, in his distorted brain, objects should appear\r\ndistorted; that, even in full daylight men and things should seem awry,\r\nas in a magnifying, dislocating mirror; that, frequently, on the numbers\r\n(of his journal) appearing too blood-thirsty, and his chronic disease\r\ntoo acute, his physician should bleed him to arrest these attacks and\r\nprevent their return.[3124]\r\n\r\nBut it has become a habit: henceforth, falsehood grow in his brain as\r\nif it was their native soil; planting himself on the irrational he\r\ncultivates the absurd, even physical and mathematical. \"If we include\r\neveryone;\"[3125] he says, \"the patriotic tax-contribution of one-quarter\r\nof all income will produce, at the very least, 4,860 millions, and\r\nperhaps twice that sum.\" With this sum M. Necker may raise five\r\nhundred thousand men, which he calculates on for the subjugation of\r\nFrance.--Since the taking of the Bastille, \"the municipality's waste\r\nalone amount to two hundred millions. The sums pocketed by Bailly are\r\nestimated at more than two millions; what 'Mottié' (Lafayette) has taken\r\nfor the past two years is incalculable.\"[3126]--On the 15th of November,\r\n1791, the gathering of emigrés comprises \"at least 120,000 former\r\ngentlemen and drilled partisans and soldiers, not counting the forces of\r\nthe German princes about to join them.\"[3127]--Consequently, as with\r\nhis brethren in Bicêtre, (a lunatic asylum), he raves incessantly on the\r\nhorrible and the foul: the procession of terrible or disgusting phantoms\r\nhas begun.[3128] According to him, the scholars who do not choose to\r\nadmire him are fools, charlatans and plagiarists. Laplace and Monge are\r\neven \"automatons,\" so many calculating machines; Lavoisier, \"reputed\r\nfather of every discovery causing a sensation in the world, has not an\r\nidea of his own;\" he steals from others without comprehending them, and\r\n\"changes his system as he changes his shoes.\" Fourcroy, his disciple and\r\nhorn-blower, is of still thinner stuff. All are scamps: \"I could cite a\r\nhundred instances of dishonesty by the Academicians of Paris, a hundred\r\nbreaches of trust;\" twelve thousand francs were entrusted to them for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining how to direct balloons, and \"they divided\r\nit among themselves, squandering it at the Rapée, the opera and in\r\nbrothels.\"[3129]--In the political world, where debates are battles,\r\nit is still worse. Marat's publication \"The Friend of the people\"\r\nhas merely rascals for adversaries. Praise of Lafayette's courage and\r\ndisinterestedness, how absurd If he went to America it was because he\r\nwas jilted, \"cast off by a Messalina;\" he maintained a park of artillery\r\nthere as \"powder-monkeys look after ammunition-wagons; \"these are his\r\nonly exploits; besides, he is a thief. Bailly is also a thief, and\r\nMabuet a \"clown.\" Necker has conceived the \"horrible project of starving\r\nand poisoning the people; he has drawn on himself for all eternity the\r\nexecration of Frenchmen and the detestation of mankind.\"--What is\r\nthe Constituent Assembly but a set of \"low, rampant, mean, stupid\r\nfellows?\"--\"Infamous legislators, vile scoundrels, monsters athirst for\r\ngold and blood, you traffic with the monarch, with our fortunes,\r\nwith our rights, with our liberties, with our lives!\"--\"The second\r\nlegislative corps is no less rotten than the first one.\"--In the\r\nConvention, Roland, \"the officious Gilles and the forger Pasquin, is\r\nthe infamous head of the monopolizers.\" \"Isnard is a juggler, Buzot a\r\nTartuffe, Vergniaud a police spy.\"[3130]--When a madman sees everywhere\r\naround him, on the floor, on the walls, on the ceiling, toads,\r\nscorpions, spiders, swarms of crawling, loathsome vermin, he thinks only\r\nof crushing them, and the disease enters on its last stage: after the\r\nambitious delirium, the mania for persecution and the settled nightmare,\r\ncomes the homicidal mania.\r\n\r\nWith Marat, this broke out at the very beginning of the Revolution.\r\nThe disease was innate; he was inoculated with it beforehand. He had\r\ncontracted it in good earnest, on principle; never was there a plainer\r\ncase of deliberate insanity.--On the one hand, having derived the rights\r\nof man from physical necessities, he concluded, \"that society owes to\r\nthose among its members who have no property, and whose labor scarcely\r\nsuffices for their support, an assured subsistence, the wherewithal to\r\nfeed, lodge and clothe oneself suitably, provision for attendance in\r\nsickness and when old age comes on, and for bringing up children. Those\r\nwho wallow in wealth must (then) supply the wants of those who lack\r\nthe necessaries of life.\" Otherwise, \"the honest citizen whom society\r\nabandons to poverty and despair, reverts back to the state of nature and\r\nthe right of forcibly claiming advantages which were only alienated by\r\nhim to procure greater ones. All authority which is opposed to this is\r\ntyrannical, and the judge who condemns a man to death (through it) is\r\nsimply a cowardly assassin.\"[3131]\r\n\r\nThus do the innumerable riots which the dearth excites, find\r\njustification, and, as the dearth is permanent, the daily riot is\r\nlegitimate.--On the other hand, having laid down the principle\r\nof popular sovereignty he deduces from this, \"the sacred right of\r\nconstituents to dismiss their delegates;\" to seize them by the throat\r\nif they prevaricate, to keep them in the right path by fear, and wring\r\ntheir necks should they attempt to vote wrong or govern badly. Now, they\r\nare always subject to this temptation.\r\n\r\n\"If there is one eternal truth of which it is important to convince man,\r\nit is that the mortal enemy of the people, the most to be dreaded by\r\nthem, is the Government.\"--\"Any minister who remains more than 2 days\r\nin office, once the ministry is able to plot against the country is\r\n'suspect.' \"[3132]--Bestir yourselves, then, ye unfortunates in town and\r\ncountry, workmen without work, street stragglers without fuel or shelter\r\nsleeping under bridges, prowlers along the highways, beggars,\r\ntattered vagabonds, cripples and tramps, and seize your faithless\r\nrepresentatives!--On July 14th and October 5th and 6th, \"the people\r\nhad the right not only to execute some of the conspirators in military\r\nfashion, but to immolate them all, to put to the sword the entire body\r\nof royal satellites leagued together for our destruction, the whole herd\r\nof traitors to the country, of every condition and degree.\"[3133]\r\nNever go to the Assembly, \"without filling your pockets with stones and\r\nthrowing them at the impudent scoundrels who preach monarchical maxims;\"\r\n\"I recommend to you no other precaution but that of telling their\r\nneighbors to look out.\"[3134]--\"We do not demand the resignation of the\r\nministers-we demand their heads. We demand the heads of all the cabinet\r\nofficials in the Assembly, your mayor's, your general's, the heads of\r\nmost of the staff-officers, of most of the municipal council, of the\r\nprincipal agents of the executive power in the kingdom. \"--Of what use\r\nare half-way measures, like the sack of the hotel de Castries?[3135]\r\n\r\n\"Avenge yourselves wisely! Death! Death! is the sole penalty for\r\ntraitors raging to destroy you It is the only one that strikes terror\r\ninto them. Follow the example of your implacable enemies! Keep always\r\narmed, so that they may not escape through the delays of the law! Stab\r\nthem on the spot or blow their brains out!\"--\"Twenty-four millions of\r\nmen shout in unison: If the black, gangrened, archi-gangrened officials\r\ndare pass a bill reducing and reorganizing the army, citizens, then you\r\nbuild eight hundred scaffolds in the Tuileries garden and hang on them\r\nevery traitor to his country--that infamous Riquetti, Comte de Mirabeau,\r\nat the head of them--and, at the same time, erect in the middle of\r\nthe fountain basin a big pile of logs to roast the ministers and their\r\ntools!\"[3136]--Could \"the Friend of the People\" rally around him two\r\nthousand men determined \"to save the country, he would go and tear the\r\nheart out of that infernal Mottié in the very midst of his battalions\r\nof slaves; he would go and burn the monarch and his imps in his palace,\r\nimpale the deputies on their benches, and bury them beneath the flaming\r\nruins of their den.\"[3137]-On the first cannon shot being fired on the\r\nfrontier,\r\n\r\n\"it is indispensable that the people should close the gates of the towns\r\nand unhesitatingly make way with every priest, public functionary and\r\nanti-revolutionary, known instigators and their accomplices.\"--\"It would\r\nbe wise for the people's magistrates to keep constantly manufacturing\r\nlarge quantities of strong, sharp, short-bladed, double-edged knives, so\r\nas to arm each citizen known as a friend of his country. Now, the art of\r\nfighting with these terrible weapons consists in this: Use the left arm\r\nas buckler, and cover it up to the arm-pit with a sleeve quilted with\r\nsome woollen stuff, filled with rags and hair, and then rush on the\r\nenemy, the right hand wielding the knife.\"[3138]--Let us use these\r\nknives as soon as possible, for \"what means are now remaining for us to\r\nput an end to the problems which overwhelm us? I repeat it, no other but\r\nexecutions by the people.\"[3139]--The Throne is at last down; but \"be\r\ncareful not to give way to false pity!.... No quarter! I advise you\r\nto decimate the anti-revolutionary members of the municipality, of the\r\njustices of the peace, of the members of the departments and of the\r\nNational Assembly.\"[3140]--At the outset, a few lives would have\r\nsufficed: \"five hundred heads ought to have fallen when the Bastille\r\nwas taken, and all would then have gone on well.\" But, through lack of\r\nforesight and timidity, the evil was allowed to spread, and the more it\r\nspread the larger the amputation should have been.--With the sure,\r\nkeen eye of the surgeon, Marat gives its dimensions; he has made his\r\ncalculation beforehand. In September, 1792, in the Council at the\r\nCommune, he estimates forty thousand as the number of heads that should\r\nbe laid low.[3141] Six weeks later, the social abscess having enormously\r\nincreased, the figures swell in proportion; he now demands two hundred\r\nand seventy thousand heads,[3142] always on the score of humanity, \"to\r\nensure public tranquility,\" on condition that the operation be entrusted\r\nto him, as the temporary enforcer of the justice.--Except for this last\r\npoint, the rest is granted to him; it is unfortunate that he could not\r\nsee with his own eyes the complete fulfillment of his programme, the\r\nbatches condemned by the revolutionary Tribunal, the massacres of Lyons\r\nand Toulon, the drownings of Nantes.--From the beginning to the end, he\r\nwas in keeping with the Revolution, lucid on account of his blindness,\r\nthanks to his crazy logic, thanks to the concordance of his personal\r\nmalady with the public malady, to the early manifestation of his\r\ncomplete madness in the midst of the incomplete or tardy madness of the\r\nrest, he alone steadfast, remorseless, triumphant, perched aloft at the\r\nfirst bound on the sharp pinnacle which his rivals dared not climb or\r\nonly stumbled up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Danton.\r\n\r\n     Danton.--Richness of his faculties.--Disparity between his\r\n     condition and instincts.--The Barbarian.--His work.--His\r\n     weakness.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of the madman about Danton; on the contrary, not only\r\nis his intellect sound, but he possesses political aptitudes to an\r\neminent degree, and to such an extent that, in this particular, none of\r\nhis associates or adversaries compare with him, while, among the men\r\nof the Revolution, only Mirabeau equals or surpasses him. He is an\r\noriginal, spontaneous genius and not, like most of his contemporaries, a\r\ndisputatious, quill-driving theorist,[3143] that is to say, a fanatical\r\npedant, an artificial being composed of his books, a mill-horse with\r\nblinkers, and turning around in a circle without an issue. His free\r\njudgment is not hampered by abstract prejudices: he does not carry about\r\nwith him a social contract, like Rousseau, nor, like Siéyès, a social\r\nart and cabinet principles or combinations;[3144] he has kept aloof from\r\nthese instinctively and, perhaps, through contempt for them; he had no\r\nneed of them; he would not have known what to do with them. Systems are\r\ncrutches for the impotent, while he is able-bodied; formulas serve as\r\nspectacles for the short-sighted, while his eyes are good. \"He had\r\nread and meditated very little,\" says a learned and philosophical\r\nwitness;[3145] \"his knowledge was scanty and he took no pride in\r\ninvestigation; but he observed and saw .. His native capacity, which\r\nwas very great and not absorbed by other things, was naturally closed to\r\nvague, complex and false notions, and naturally open to every notion\r\nof experience the truth of which was made manifest.\" Consequently, \"his\r\nperceptions of men and things, sudden, clear, impartial and true, were\r\ninstinct with solid, practical discretion.\" To form a clear idea of\r\nthe divergent or concordant dispositions, fickle or earnest, actual or\r\npossible, of different parties and of twenty-six millions of souls, to\r\njustly estimate probable resistances, and calculate available forces,\r\nto recognize and take advantage of the one decisive moment, to combine\r\nexecutive means, to find men of action, to measure the effect produced,\r\nto foresee near and remote contingencies, to regret nothing and take\r\nthings coolly, to accept crimes in proportion to their political\r\nefficacy, to dodge before insurmountable obstacles, even in contempt\r\nof current maxims, to consider objects and men the same as an engineer\r\ncontracting for machinery and calculating horse-power[3146]--such are\r\nthe faculties of which he gave proof on the 10th of August and the 2nd\r\nof September, during his effective dictatorship between the 10th of\r\nAugust and the 21st of September, afterwards in the Convention, on the\r\nfirst Committee of Public Safety, on the 31st of May and on the 2nd of\r\nJune:[3147] we have seen him busy at work. Up to the last, in spite of\r\nhis partisans, he has tried to diminish or, at least, not add to, the\r\nresistance the government had to overcome. Nearly up to the last, in\r\nspite of his adversaries, he tried to increase or, at least, not destroy\r\nthe available forces of the government. In defiance of the outcries\r\nof the clubs, which clamor for the extermination of the Prussians, the\r\ncapture of the King of Prussia, the overthrow of all thrones, and the\r\nmurder of Louis XVI., he negotiated the almost pacific withdrawal of\r\nBrunswick;[3148] he strove to detach Prussia from the coalition;[3149]\r\nhe wanted to turn a war of propaganda into one of interests;[3150] he\r\ncaused the Convention to pass the decree that France would not in any\r\nway interfere with foreign governments; he secured an alliance with\r\nSweden; he prescribed beforehand the basis of the treaty of Basle,\r\nand had an idea of saving the King.[3151] In spite of the distrust and\r\nattacks of the Girondists, who strove to discredit him and put him out\r\nof the way, he persists in offering them his hand; he declared war on\r\nthem only because they refused to make peace,[3152] and he made efforts\r\nto save them when they were down. Amidst so many ranters and scribblers\r\nwhose logic is mere words and whose rage is blind, who grind out phrases\r\nlike a hand-organ, or are wound up for murder, his intellect, always\r\ncapacious and supple, went right to facts, not to disfigure and pervert\r\nthem, but to accept them, to adapt himself to them, and to comprehend\r\nthem. With a mind of this quality one goes far no matter in what\r\ndirection; nothing remains but to choose one's path. Mandrin, under the\r\nancient régime, was also, in a similar way, a superior man;[3153] only\r\nhe chose the highway.\r\n\r\nBetween the demagogue and the highwayman the resemblance is close: both\r\nare leaders of bands and each requires an opportunity to organize his\r\nband. Danton, to organize his band, needed the Revolution.--\"Of low\r\nbirth, without patronage,\" penniless, every office being filled,\r\nand \"the Paris bar exorbitantly priced,\" admitted a lawyer after\r\n\"a struggle,\" he for a long time wandered jobless frequenting the\r\ncoffee-houses, the same as similar men nowadays frequent the bars. At\r\nthe Café de l'École, the proprietor, a good natured old fellow \"in a\r\nsmall round wig, gray coat and a napkin on his arm,\" circulated among\r\nhis tables smiling blandly, while his daughter sat in the rear as\r\ncashier.[3154] Danton chatted with her and demanded her hand in\r\nmarriage. To obtain her, he had to mend his ways, purchase an\r\nattorneyship in the Court of the Royal Council and find guarantors and\r\nsponsors in his small native town.[3155] Once married and lodged in the\r\ngloomy Passage du Commerce, he finds himself \"more burdened with debts\r\nthan with causes,\" tied down to a sedentary profession which demands\r\nvigorous application, accuracy, a moderate tone, a respectable style and\r\nblameless deportment; obliged to keep house on so small a scale that,\r\nwithout the help of a louis regularly advanced to him each week by his\r\ncoffee-house father-in-law, he could not make both ends meet.[3156]\r\nHis free-and-easy tastes, his alternately impetuous and indolent\r\ndisposition, his love of enjoyment and of having his own way, his rude,\r\nviolent instincts, his expansiveness, creativeness and activity, all\r\nrebel against this life: he is ill-suited for the quiet routine of our\r\ncivil careers. It is not the steady discipline of an old society, but\r\nthe tumultuous brutality of a society going to pieces or in a state\r\nof formation, that suits him. In temperament and character he is a\r\nbarbarian, and a barbarian born to command his fellow-creatures, like\r\nthis or that vassal of the sixth century or baron of the tenth century.\r\nA giant with the face of a \"Tartar,\" pitted with the small-pox,\r\ntragically and terribly ugly, with a mask convulsed like that of a\r\ngrowling \"bull-dog,\"[3157] with small, cavernous, restless eyes buried\r\nunder the huge wrinkles of a threatening brow, with a thundering voice\r\nand moving and acting like a combatant, full-blooded, boiling over with\r\npassion and energy. His strength in its outbursts appears boundless like\r\na force of nature, when speaking he is roaring like a bull and be\r\nheard through closed windows fifty yards off in the street, employing\r\nimmoderate imagery, intensely in earnest, trembling with indignation,\r\nrevenge and patriotic sentiments, able to arouse savage instincts in\r\nthe most tranquil breast and generous instincts in the most brutal\r\npersonalities.[3158] He may be profane, using emphatic terms,[3159]\r\ncynical, but not monotonous and affected like Hébert, but spontaneous\r\nand to the point, full of crude jests worthy of Rabelais, possessing a\r\nstock of jovial sensuality and good-humor, cordial and familiar in his\r\nways, frank, friendly in tone. He is, both outwardly and inwardly,\r\nthe best fitted for winning the confidence and sympathy of a Gallic,\r\nParisian populace. His talents all contribute to \"his inborn,\r\npractical popularity,\" and to make of him \"a grand-seignior of\r\nsans-cullotterie.\"[3160]--With such talents for acting, there is\r\na strong temptation to act it out the moment the theatre is ready,\r\nwhatever the theatre, even unlawful and murky, whatever the actors\r\nrogues, scoundrels and loose women, whatever the part, ignoble,\r\nmurderous, and finally fatal to him who undertakes it.--To hold out\r\nagainst such temptation, would require a sentiment of repugnance which\r\na refined or thorough culture develops in both sense and mind, but which\r\nwas completely wanting in Danton. Nothing disgusts him physically\r\nor morally: he embraces Marat,[3161] fraternizes with drunkards,\r\ncongratulates the Septembriseurs, retorts in blackguard terms to the\r\ninsults of prostitutes, treats reprobates, thieves and jail-birds\r\nas equals,--Carra, Westermann, Huguenin, Rossignol and the confirmed\r\nscoundrels whom he sends into the departments after the 2nd of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! What the hell! Do you think we ought to send young misses.\" [3162]\r\nGarbage men are needed for the collection of garbage; one cannot hold\r\none's nose when they come for their wages; one must pay them well, talk\r\nto them encouragingly, and leave them plenty of elbow room. Danton is\r\nwilling to play the part of the fire, and he humors vices; he has no\r\nscruples, and lets people scratch and take.--He has stolen as much\r\nto give as to keep, to maintain his role as much as to benefit by it,\r\nsquaring accounts by spending the money of the Court against the Court,\r\nprobably inwardly chuckling, the same as the peasant in a blouse on\r\ngetting ahead of his well-duped landlord, or as the Frank, whom the\r\nancient historian describes as leering on pocketing Roman gold the\r\nbetter to make war against Rome.--The graft on this plebeian seedling\r\nhas not taken; in our modern garden this remains as in the ancient\r\nforest; its vigorous sap preserves its primitive raciness and produces\r\nnone of the fine fruits of our civilization, a moral sense, honor and\r\nconscience. Danton has no respect for himself nor for others; the nice,\r\ndelicate limitations that circumscribe human personality, seem to him as\r\nlegal conventionality and mere drawing-room courtesy. Like a Clovis,\r\nhe tramples on this, and like a Clovis, equal in faculties, in similar\r\nexpedients, and with a worse horde at his back, he throws himself\r\nathwart society, to stagger along, destroy and reconstruct it to his own\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAt the start, he comprehended the peculiar character and normal\r\nprocedure of the Revolution, that is to say, the useful agency of\r\npopular brutality: in 1788 he had already figured in insurrections. He\r\ncomprehended from the first the ultimate object and definite result\r\nof the Revolution, that is to say, the dictatorship of the violent\r\nminority. Immediately after the 14th of July,\" 1789, he organized in his\r\nquarter of the city[3163] a small independent republic, aggressive and\r\npredominant, the center of the faction, a refuge for the riff-raff and\r\na rendezvous for fanatics, a pandemonium composed of every available\r\nmadcap, every rogue, visionary, shoulder-hitter, newspaper scribbler\r\nand stump-speaker, either a secret or avowed plotter of murder, Camille\r\nDesmoulins, Fréron, Hébert, Chaumette, Clootz, Théroigne, Marat,--while,\r\nin this more than Jacobin State, the model in anticipation of that he\r\nis to establish later, he reigns, as he will afterwards reign, the\r\npermanent president of the district, commander of the battalion, orator\r\nof the club, and the concocter of bold undertakings. Here, usurpation\r\nis the rule there is no recognition of legal authority; they brave the\r\nKing, the ministers, the judges, the Assembly, the municipality, the\r\nmayor, the commandant of the National Guard. Nature and principle raise\r\nthem above the law; the district takes Marat under its protection, posts\r\ntwo sentinels at his door to protect him from prosecutions, and uses\r\narms against the armed force sent with a warrant to arrest him.[3164]\r\nyet more, in the name of the city of Paris, \"chief sentinel of the\r\nnation,\" they assume to govern France: Danton betakes himself to the\r\nNational Assembly and declares that the citizens of Paris are the\r\nnatural representatives of the eighty-three departments, and summons it,\r\non their injunction, to cancel an act it has passed.[3165]--The entire\r\nJacobin conception is therein expressed: Danton, with his keen insight,\r\ntook it all in and proclaimed it in appropriate terms; to apply it at\r\nthe present time on a grand scale,[3166] he has merely to pass from the\r\nsmall theatre to the large one, from the Cordeliers club to the Commune,\r\nto the Ministry, and the Committee of Public Safety, and, in all these\r\ntheatres, he plays the same part with the same end in view and the same\r\nresults. A despotism formed by conquest and maintained by terror,\r\nthe despotism of the Jacobin Parisian rabble, is the end to which he\r\ndirectly marches. He employs no other means and, adapting the means\r\nto the end and the end to the means, manages the important days\r\nand instigates the decisive measures of the Revolution: the 10th\r\nof August,[3167] the 2nd of September, the 31st of May, the 2nd of\r\nJune;[3168] the decree providing for an army of paid sans-culottes \"to\r\nkeep down aristocrats with their pikes;\" the decree in each commune\r\nwhere grain is dear, taxing the rich to put bread within reach of the\r\npoor;[3169] the decree giving laborers forty sous for attending the\r\nmeetings of the Section Assemblies;[3170] the institution of the\r\nrevolutionary Tribunal;[3171] the proposal to erect the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety into a provisional government; the proclamation of Terror;\r\nthe concentration of Jacobin zeal on useful works; the employment of the\r\neight thousand delegates of the primary assemblies, who had been\r\nsent home as recruiting agents for the universal armament;[3172]\r\nthe inflammatory expressions of young men on the frontier; the wise\r\nresolutions for limiting the levy en masse to men between eighteen and\r\ntwenty-five, which put an end to the scandalous songs and dances by the\r\npopulace in the very hall of the Convention.[3173]\r\n\r\nIn order to set the machine up, he cleared the ground, fused the metal,\r\nhammered out the principal pieces, filed off the blisters, designed the\r\naction, adjusted the minor wheels, set it agoing and indicated what it\r\nhad to do, and, at the same time, he forged the armor which guarded\r\nit against strangers and outside violence. The machine being his, why,\r\nafter constructing it, did he not serve as its engineer?\r\n\r\nBecause, if competent to construct it, he was not qualified to manage\r\nit. In a crisis, he may give a helping hand, win the support of an\r\nassembly or a mob, direct, high-handedly and for a few weeks, an\r\nexecutive committee. But regular, persistent labor is repugnant to him;\r\nhe is not made for bookkeeping,[3174] for paper and administrative work.\r\nNever, like Robespierre and Billaud can he attend to both official and\r\npolice duties at the same time, carefully reading minute daily reports,\r\nannotating mortuary lists, extemporizing ornate abstractions, coolly\r\nenunciating falsehoods and acting out the patient, satisfied inquisitor;\r\nand especially, he can never become the systematic executioner.--On the\r\none hand, his eyes are not obscured by the gray veil of theory: he does\r\nnot regard men through the \"Contrat-Social\" as a sum of arithmetical\r\nunits,[3175] but as they really are, living, suffering, shedding their\r\nblood, especially those he knows, each with his peculiar physiognomy and\r\ndemeanor. Compassion is excited by all this when one has any feeling,\r\nand he had. Danton had a heart; he had the quick sensibilities of a man\r\nof flesh and blood stirred by the primitive instincts, the good ones\r\nalong with the bad ones, instincts which culture had neither impaired\r\nnor deadened, which allowed him to plan and permit the September\r\nmassacre, but which did not allow him to practice daily and blindly,\r\nsystematic and wholesale murder. Already in September, \"cloaking his\r\npity under his bellowing,\"[3176] he had shielded or saved many eminent\r\nmen from the butchers. When the axe is about to fall on the Girondists,\r\nhe is \"ill with grief\" and despair. \"I am unable to save them,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \" and big tears streamed down his cheeks.\"--On the other\r\nhand, his eyes are not covered by the bandage of incapacity or lack of\r\nfore-thought. He detected the innate vice of the system, the inevitable\r\nand approaching suicide of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\"The Girondists forced us to throw ourselves upon the sans-culotterie\r\nwhich has devoured them, which will devour us, and which will eat itself\r\nup.\"[3177]--\"Let Robespierre and Saint-Just alone, and there will\r\nsoon be nothing left in France but a Thebiad of political\r\nTrappists.\"[3178]--At the end, he sees more clearly still:\r\n\r\n\"On a day like this I organized the Revolutionary Tribunal: I ask pardon\r\nfor it of God and man.--In Revolutions, authority remains with the\r\ngreatest scoundrels.--It is better to be a poor fisherman than govern\r\nmen.\"[3179]\r\n\r\nBut he has aspired to govern them; he constructed a new machine for\r\nthe purpose, and, deaf to its squeals, it worked in conformity with\r\nthe structure and the impulse he gave to it. It towers before him, this\r\nsinister machine, with its vast wheel and iron cogs grinding all France,\r\ntheir multiplied teeth pressing out each individual life, its steel\r\nblade constantly rising and falling, and, as it plays faster and faster,\r\ndaily exacting a larger and larger supply of human material, while those\r\nwho furnish this supply are held to be as insensible and as senseless\r\nas itself. This Danton cannot, will not be.--He gets out of the way,\r\ndiverts himself, gambles,[3180] forgets; he supposes that the titular\r\ndecapitators will probably consent to take no notice of him; in any\r\nevent they do not pursue him; \"they would not dare do it.\" \"No one\r\nmust lay hands on me, I am the ark.\" At the worst, he prefers \"to be\r\nguillotined rather than guillotine.\"--Having said or thought this, he is\r\nripe for the scaffold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Robespierre.\r\n\r\n     Robespierre.--Mediocrity of his faculties.--The Pedant.\r\n     --Absence of ideas.--Study of phrases.--Wounded self-esteem.\r\n     --His infatuation.--He plays victim.--His gloomy fancies.--His\r\n     resemblance to Marat.--Difference between him and Marat.\r\n     --The sincere hypocrite.--The festival in honor of the Supreme\r\n     Being, and the law of Prairial 22.--The external and\r\n     internal characters of Robespierre and the Revolution.\r\n\r\nEven with the firm determination to remain decapitator-in-chief, Danton\r\ncould never be a perfect representative of the Revolution. It is\r\nan armed but philosophical robbery; its creed includes robbery and\r\nassassination, but only as a knife in its sheath; the showy, polished\r\nsheath is for public display, and not the sharp and bloody blade.\r\nDanton, like Marat, lets the blade be too plainly visible. At the mere\r\nsight of Marat, filthy and slovenly, with his livid, frog-like face,\r\nwith his round, gleaming and fixed eyeballs, and his bold, maniacal\r\nstare and steady monotonous rage, common-sense rebels; no-one selects\r\na homicidal maniac as a guide. At the mere sight of Danton, with his\r\nporter's vocabulary, his voice like an alarm bell of insurrection, his\r\ncyclopean features and air of an exterminator, humanity takes alarm; one\r\ndoes not surrender oneself to a political butcher without repugnance.\r\nThe Revolution demands another interpreter, like itself captivatingly\r\nfitted out, and Robespierre fits the bill,[3181] with his irreproachable\r\nattire, well-powdered hair, carefully brushed coat,[3182] strict habits,\r\ndogmatic tone, and formal, studied manner of speaking. No mind, in its\r\nmediocrity and incompetence, so well harmonizes with the spirit of the\r\nepoch. The reverse of the statesman, he soars in empty space, amongst\r\nabstractions, always mounted on a principle and incapable of dismounting\r\nso as to see things practically.\r\n\r\n\"That bastard there,\" exclaims Danton, \"is not even able to boil an\r\negg!\"\r\n\r\n\"The vague generalities of his preaching,\" writes another\r\ncontemporary,[3183] \"rarely culminated in any specific measure or legal\r\nprovision. He combated everything and proposed nothing; the secret of\r\nhis policy happily accorded with his intellectual impotence and with\r\nthe nullity of his legislative conceptions.\" Once he has rattled his\r\nrevolutionary pedantry off, he no longer knows what to say.--As to\r\nfinancial matters and military art, he knows nothing and risks nothing,\r\nexcept to underrate or calumniate Carnot and Cambon who did know and\r\nwho took risks.[3184]--In relation to a foreign policy his speech on\r\nthe state of Europe is the amplification of a schoolboy; on exposing\r\nthe plans of the English minister he reaches the pinnacle of chimerical\r\nnonsense;[3185] eliminate the rhetorical passages, and it is not the\r\nhead of a government who speaks, but the porter of the Jacobin club.\r\nOn contemporary France, as it actually exists, he has not one sound or\r\nspecific idea: instead of men, he sees only twenty-six millions simple\r\nrobots, who, when duly led and organized, will work together in peace\r\nand harmony. Basically they are good,[3186] and will, after a little\r\nnecessary purification, become good again. Accordingly, their collective\r\nwill is \"the voice of reason and public interest,\" hence, on meeting\r\ntogether, they are wise. \"The people's assembly of delegates should\r\ndeliberate, if possible, in the presence of the whole body of the\r\npeople;\" the Legislative body, at least, should hold its sittings \"in\r\na vast, majestic edifice open to twenty thousand spectators.\" Note that\r\nfor the past four years, in the Constituent Assembly, in the Legislative\r\nAssembly, in the Convention, at the Hotel de-Ville, in the Jacobin Club,\r\nwherever Robespierre speaks, the galleries have never ceased to shout,\r\nyell and express their opinion. Such a positive, palpable experience\r\nwould open anybody's eyes; his are closed through prejudice or interest;\r\neven physical truth finds no access to his mind, because he is unable to\r\ncomprehend it, or because he has to keep it out. He must, accordingly,\r\nbe either obtuse or a charlatan. Actually he is both, for both combine\r\nto form the pedant (cuistre), that is to say, the hollow, inflated mind\r\nwhich, filled with words and imagining that these are ideas, revels in\r\nits own declamation and dupes itself that it may dictate to others.\r\n\r\nSuch is his title, his personality and role. In this artificial and\r\ndeclamatory tragedy of the Revolution he takes the leading part;\r\nthe maniac and the barbarian slowly retire in the background on the\r\nappearance of the cuistre; Marat and Danton finally become effaced, or\r\nefface themselves, and the stage is left to Robespierre who attracts all\r\nthe attention.[3187]--If we want to understand him we must look at him\r\nas he stands in the midst of his surroundings. At the last stage of\r\na dying intellectual vegetation, on the last branch of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, he is the final freak and dried fruit of the classical\r\nspirit.[3188] He has retained nothing of a worn-out system of philosophy\r\nbut its lifeless dregs and well-conned formulae, the formulae of\r\nRousseau, Mably, and Raynal, concerning \"the people, nature,\r\nreason, liberty, tyrants, factions, virtue, morality,\" a ready-made\r\nvocabulary,[3189] expressions too ample, the meaning of which,\r\nill-defined by the masters, evaporates in the hands of the disciple. He\r\nnever tries to get at this; his writings and speeches are merely long\r\nstrings of vague abstract periods; there is no telling fact in them, no\r\ndistinct, characteristic detail, no appeal to the eye evoking a living\r\nimage, no personal, special observation, no clear, frank original\r\nimpression. It might be said of him that he never saw anything with his\r\nown eyes, that he neither could nor would see, that false conceptions\r\nhave intervened and fixed themselves between him and the object;[3190]\r\nhe combines these in logical sequence, and simulates the absent thought\r\nby an affected jargon, and this is all. The other Jacobins alongside of\r\nhim likewise use the same scholastic jargon; but none of them spout\r\nand spread out so complacently and lengthily as he. For hours, we grope\r\nafter him in the vague shadows of political speculation, in the cold\r\nand perplexing mist of didactic generalities, trying in vain to make\r\nsomething out of his colorless tirades, and we grasp nothing.[3191] When\r\nwe, in astonishment, ask ourselves what all this talk amounts to, and\r\nwhy he talks at all; the answer is, that he has said nothing and that he\r\ntalks only for the sake of talking, the same as a sectarian preaching to\r\nhis congregation, neither the preacher nor his audience ever wearying,\r\nthe one of turning the dogmatic crank, and the other of listening. So\r\nmuch the better if the container is empty; the emptier it is the easier\r\nand faster the crank turns. And better still, if the empty term he\r\nselects is used in a contrary sense; the sonorous words justice,\r\nhumanity, mean to him piles of human heads, the same as a text from the\r\ngospels means to a grand inquisitor the burning of heretics.--Through\r\nthis extreme perversity, the cuistre spoils his own mental instrument;\r\nthenceforth he employs it as he likes, as his passions dictate,\r\nbelieving that he serves truth in serving these.\r\n\r\nNow, his first passion, his principal passion, is literary vanity. Never\r\nwas the chief of a party, sect or government, even at critical moments,\r\nsuch an incurable, insignificant rhetorician, so formal, so pompous, and\r\nso dull.--On the eve of the 9th of Thermidor, when it was a question\r\nof life or death, he enters the tribune with a set speech, written and\r\nre-written, polished and re-polished,[3192] overloaded with studied\r\nornaments and bits for effect,[3193] coated by dint of time and labor,\r\nwith the academic varnish, the glitter of symmetrical antitheses,\r\nrounded periods, exclamations, omissions, apostrophes and other\r\ntricks of the pen.[3194]--In the most famous and important of\r\nhis reports,[3195] I have counted eighty-four instances of\r\npersonifications[3196] imitated from Rousseau and the antique, many of\r\nthem largely expanded, some addressed to the dead, to Brutus, to\r\nyoung Barra, and others to absentees, priests, and aristocrats, to the\r\nunfortunate, to French women, and finally to abstract substantives\r\nlike Liberty and Friendship. With unshaken conviction and intense\r\nsatisfaction, he deems himself an orator because he harps on the same\r\nold tune. There is not one true tone in his elaborate eloquence,\r\nnothing but recipes and only those of a worn-out art, Greek and Roman\r\ncommon-places, Socrates and the hemlock, Brutus and his dagger,\r\nclassic metaphors like \"the flambeaux of discord,\" and \"the vessel of\r\nState,\"[3197]s coupled together and beauties of style which a pupil in\r\nrhetoric aims at on the college bench;[3198]times a grand bravura air,\r\nso essential for parade in public;[3199] centimes a delicate strain of\r\nthe flute, for, in those days, one must have a tender heart;[31100]\r\nin short, Marmontel's method in \"Belisarius,\" or that of Thomas in his\r\n\"Eloges,\" all borrowed from Rousseau, but of inferior quality, like a\r\nsharp, thin voice strained to imitate a rich, powerful voice. All is a\r\nsort of involuntary parody, and the more repulsive because a word\r\nends in a blow, because a sentimental, declamatory Trissotin poses as\r\nstatesman, because the studied elegance of the closet become pistol\r\nshots aimed at living breasts, because an epithet skillfully directed\r\nsends a man to the guillotine.--The contrast is too great between his\r\ntalent and the part he plays. With such a talent, as mediocre and false\r\nas his intellect, there is no employment for which he is less suited\r\nthan that of governing men; he was cut out for another, which, in\r\na peaceable community, he would have been able to do. Suppress the\r\nRevolution, and Marat would have probably ended his days in an asylum.\r\nDanton might possibly have become a legal filibuster, a highwayman or\r\ngangster, and finally throttled or hung. Robespierre, on the contrary,\r\nmight have continued as he began,[31101] a busy, hard-working lawyer\r\nof good standing, member of the Arras Academy, winner of competitive\r\nprizes, author of literary eulogies, moral essays and philanthropic\r\npamphlets; his little lamp, lighted like hundreds of others of\r\nequal capacity at the focus of the new philosophy, would have burned\r\nmoderately without doing harm to any one, and diffused over a provincial\r\ncircle a dim, commonplace illumination proportionate to the little oil\r\nhis lamp would hold.\r\n\r\nBut the Revolution bore him into the Constituent Assembly, where, for a\r\nlong time on this great stage, his amour propre, the dominant feeling\r\nof the pedant, suffered terribly. He had already suffered on this score\r\nfrom his earliest youth, and his wounds being still fresh made him only\r\nthe more sensitive.--Born in Arras in 1758, orphaned and poor, protégé\r\nof his bishop, a bursar through favor at the college Louis-le-Grand,\r\nlater a clerk with Brissot under the revolutionary system of\r\nlaw-practice, and at length settled down in his gloomy rue des\r\nRapporteurs as a pettifogger. Living with a bad-tempered sister, he has\r\nadopts Rousseau, whom he had once seen and whom he ardently studies, for\r\nhis master in philosophy, politics and style. Fancying, probably, like\r\nother young men of his age and condition, that he could play a similar\r\npart and thus emerge from his blind alley, he published law pleadings\r\nfor effect, contended for Academy prizes, and read papers before\r\nhis Arras colleagues. His success was moderate: one of his harangues\r\nobtained a notice in the Artois Almanac; the Academy of Metz awarded him\r\nonly a second prize; that of Amiens gave him no prize, while the critic\r\nof the \"Mercure\" spoke of his style as smacking of the provinces.--In\r\nthe National Assembly, eclipsed by men of great and spontaneous ability,\r\nhe remains a long time in the shade, and, more than once, through\r\nobstination or lack of tact, makes himself ridiculous. With his sharp,\r\nthin, attorney's visage, \"dull, monotonous, coarse voice and wearisome\r\ndelivery,\"--\"an artesian accent\" and constrained air,[31102] his\r\nconstantly putting himself forward, his elaboration of commonplaces, his\r\nevident determination to impose on cultivated people, still a body of\r\nintelligent listeners, and the intolerable boredom he caused them--all\r\nthis is not calculated to render the Assembly indulgent to errors\r\nof sense and taste.[31103] One day, referring to certain acts of the\r\n\"Conseil:\" \"It is necessary that a noble and simple formula should\r\nannounce national rights and carry respect for law into the hearts of\r\nthe people. Consequently, in the decrees as promulgated, after the words\r\nLouis, by the grace of God,\" etc., these words should follow:\r\n\r\n\"People, behold the law imposed on you! Let this law be considered\r\nsacred and inviolable for all!\" Upon this, a Gascon deputy arises\r\nand remarks in his southern accent, \"Gentlemen, this style is\r\nunsuitable--there is no need for sermons.[31104] (cantique).\"\r\n\r\nGeneral laughter; Robespierre keeps silent and bleeds internally: two or\r\nthree such mishaps nettle such a man from head to foot. It is not that\r\nhis stupid remarks seem silly to him; no pedant taken in the act and\r\nhissed would avow that he deserved such treatment; on the contrary, he\r\nis content to have spoken as becomes a philosophic and moral legislator,\r\nand so much the worse for the narrow minds and corrupt hearts unable\r\nto comprehend him.--Thrown back upon himself, his wounded vanity seeks\r\ninward nourishment and takes what it can find in the sterile uniformity\r\nof his bourgeois moderation. Robespierre, unlike Danton, has no\r\ncravings. He is sober; he is not tormented by his senses; if he gives\r\nway to them, it is only no further than he can help, and with a bad\r\ngrace. In the rue Saintonge in Paris, \"for seven months,\" says his\r\nsecretary,[31105] \"I knew of but one woman that he kept company with,\r\nand he did not treat her very well. .. very often he would not let her\r\nenter his room\": when busy, he must not be disturbed. He is naturally\r\nsteady, hard-working, studious and fond of seclusion, at college a model\r\npupil, at home in his province an attentive advocate, a punctual deputy\r\nin the Assembly, everywhere free of temptation and incapable of going\r\nastray.--\"Irreproachable\" is the word which from early youth an\r\ninward voice constantly repeats to him in low tones to console him for\r\nobscurity and patience. Thus has he ever been, is now, and ever will be;\r\nhe says this to himself, tells others so, and on this foundation, all of\r\na piece, he builds up his character. He is not, like Desmoulins, to be\r\nseduced by dinners, like Barnave, by flattery, like Mirabeau and Danton,\r\nby money, like the Girondists, by the insinuating charm of ancient\r\npoliteness and select society, like the Dantonists, by the bait of\r\njoviality and unbounded license--he is the incorruptible. He is not\r\nto be deterred or diverted, like the Feuillants, Girondists, and\r\nDantonists, like statesmen or specialists, by considerations of a lower\r\norder, by regard for interests or respect for acquired positions, by\r\nthe danger of undertaking too much at once, by the necessity of not\r\ndisorganizing the service and of giving play to human passions, motives\r\nof utility and opportunity: he is the uncompromising champion of the\r\nright.[31106] \"Alone, or nearly alone, I do not allow myself to be\r\ncorrupted; alone or nearly alone, I do not compromise justice; which two\r\nmerits I possess in the highest degree. A few others may live correctly,\r\nbut they oppose or betray principles; a few others profess to have\r\nprinciples, but they do not live correctly. No one else leads so pure\r\na life or is so loyal to principles; no one else joins to so fervent a\r\nworship of truth so strict a practice of virtue: I am the unique.\"--What\r\ncan be more agreeable than this mute soliloquy? From the very first day\r\nit can be heard toned down in Robespierre's address to the Third-Estate\r\nof Arras;[31107] the last day it is spoken aloud in his great speech\r\nin the Convention;[31108] during the interval, it crops out and shines\r\nthrough all his compositions, harangues, or reports, in exordiums,\r\nparentheses and perorations, permeating every sentence like the drone of\r\na bag-pipe.[31109]--Through the delight he takes in this he can listen\r\nto nothing else, and it is just here that the outward echoes supervene\r\nand sustain with their accompaniment the inward cantata which he sings\r\nto his own glory. Towards the end of the Constituent Assembly, through\r\nthe withdrawal or the elimination of every man at all able or competent,\r\nhe becomes one of the conspicuous tenors on the political stage, while\r\nin the Jacobin Club he is decidedly the tenor most in vogue.--\"Unique\r\ncompetitor of the Roman Fabricius,\" writes the branch club at Marseilles\r\nto him; \"immortal defender of popular rights,\" says the Jacobin crew of\r\nBourges.[31110] One of two portraits of him in the exhibition of 1791\r\nbears the inscription: \"The Incorruptible.\" At the Moliere Theatre a\r\ndrama of the day represents him as launching the thunderbolts of\r\nhis logic and virtue at Rohan and Condé. On his way, at Bapaume,\r\nthe patriots of the place, the National Guard on the road and the\r\nauthorities, come in a body to honor the great man. The town of Arras\r\nis illuminated on his arrival. On the adjournment of the Constituent\r\nAssembly the people in the street greet him with shouts, crown him with\r\noak wreaths, take the horses from his cab and drag him in triumph to the\r\nrue St. Honoré, where he lodges with the carpenter Duplay.--Here, in\r\none of those families in which the semi-bourgeois class borders on\r\nthe people, whose minds are unsophisticated, and on whom glittering\r\ngeneralities and oratorical tirades take full hold, he finds his\r\nworshippers; they drink in his words; they have the same opinion of him\r\nthat he has of himself; to every person in the house, husband, wife\r\nand daughter, he is the great patriot, the infallible sage; he bestows\r\nbenedictions night and morning; he inhales clouds of incense; he is a\r\ngod at home. The faithful, to obtain access to him form a line in the\r\ncourt.[31111] One by one they are admitted into the reception room,\r\nwhere they gather around portraits of him drawn with pencil, in stump,\r\nin sepia and in water color, and before miniature busts in red or gray\r\nplaster. Then, on the signal being given by him, they penetrate through\r\na glass door into the sanctuary where he presides, into the private\r\ncloset in which the best bust of him, with verses and mottoes, replaces\r\nhim during his absence.--His worshippers adore him on their knees, and\r\nthe women more than the men. On the day he delivers his apology before\r\nthe Convention \"the passages are lined with women[31112].... seven\r\nor eight hundred of them in the galleries, and but two hundred men at\r\nmost;\" and how frantically they cheer him! He is a priest surrounded by\r\ndevotees.\"[31113] In the Jacobin club, when he delivers his \"amphigory,\"\r\nthere are sobs of emotion, \"outcries and stamping of feet almost making\r\nthe house tumble.\"[31114] An onlooker who shows no emotion is greeted\r\nwith murmurs and obliged to slip out, like a heretic that has\r\nstrayed into a church on the elevation of the Host.--The faster the\r\nrevolutionary thunderbolts fall on other heads, so does Robespierre\r\nmount higher and higher in glory and deification. Letters are addressed\r\nto him as \"the founder of the Republic, the incorruptible genius\r\nwho foresees all and saves all, who can neither be deceived nor\r\nseduced;\"[31115] who has \"the energy of a Spartan and the eloquence of\r\nan Athenian;\"[31116] \"who shields the Republic with the aegis of his\r\neloquence;\"[31117] who \"illuminates the universe with his writings,\r\nfills the world with his renown and regenerates the human species here\r\nbelow;\"[31118] whose\" name is now, and will be, held in veneration for\r\nall ages, present and to come;\"[31119] who is \"the Messiah promised by\r\nthe Eternal for universal reform.\"[31120] An extraordinary popularity,\"\r\nsays Billaud-Varennes,[31121] a popularity which, founded under the\r\nConstituent Assembly, \"only increased during the Legislative Assembly,\"\r\nand, later on, so much more, that, \"in the National Convention he soon\r\nfound himself the only one able to fix attention on his person.... and\r\ncontrol public opinion.... With this ascendancy over public opinion,\r\nwith this irresistible preponderance, when he reached the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety, he was already the most important being in France.\" After\r\nthree years, a chorus of a thousand voices,[31122] which he formed and\r\ndirects, repeats again and again in unison his litany, his personal\r\ncreed, a hymn of three stanzas composed by him in his own honor, and\r\nwhich he daily recites to himself in a low tone of voice, and often in a\r\nloud one:\r\n\r\n\"Robespierre alone has discovered the best type of citizen! Robespierre\r\nalone, modestly and without shortcomings, fits the description!\r\nRobespierre alone is worthy of and able to lead the Revolution!\"[31123]\r\n\r\nCool infatuation carried thus far is equivalent to a raging fever, and\r\nRobespierre almost attains to the ideas and the ravings of Marat.\r\n\r\nFirst, in his own eyes, he, like Marat, is a persecuted man, and, like\r\nMarat, he poses himself as a \"martyr,\" but more skillfully and keeping\r\nwithin bounds, affecting the resigned and tender air of an innocent\r\nvictim, who, offering himself as a sacrifice, ascends to Heaven,\r\nbequeathing to mankind the imperishable souvenir of his virtues.[31124]\r\n\r\n\"I arouse against me the pride of everybody;[31125] I sharpen against me\r\na thousand daggers. I am a sacrifice to every species of hatred. ... It\r\nis certain that my head will atone for the truths I have uttered. I have\r\ngiven my life, and shall welcome death almost as a boon. It is, perhaps,\r\nHeaven's will that my blood should indicate the pathway of my country\r\nto happiness and freedom. With what joy I accept this glorious\r\ndestiny!\"[31126]--\r\n\r\n\"It is hardly in order to live that one declares war against tyrants,\r\nand, what is still more dangerous, against miscreants.... The greater\r\ntheir eagerness to put an end to my career here below, the more eager\r\nI shall be to fill it with actions serving the welfare of my\r\nfellow-creatures.\"[31127]\r\n\r\n\"All these offenders outrage me;[31128] actions which to others may\r\nappear insignificant or completely legitimate are for me crimes. As soon\r\nas someone becomes acquainted with me he is at once calumniated. Others\r\nare forgiven for their fortune, my zeal is considered a crime. Deprive\r\nme of my conscience and I am the most wretched of men. I do not even\r\nenjoy the rights of a citizen. I am not even allowed to perform my duty\r\nas a representative of the people.... To the enemies of my country, to\r\nwhom my existence seems an obstacle to their heinous plots, I am ready\r\nto sacrifice it, if their odious empire is to endure..... Let their road\r\nto the scaffold be the pathway of crime, ours shall be that of virtue;\r\nlet the hemlock be got ready for me, I await it on this hallowed spot.\r\nI shall at least bequeath to my country an example of constant affection\r\nfor it, and to the enemies of humanity the disgrace of my death.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, and always just like Marat, he sees around himself only\r\n\"the perverted, the plotters, the traitors.\"[31129]--Naturally, as with\r\nMarat, common sense with him is perverted, and, like Marat again, he\r\nthinks at random.\r\n\r\n\"I am not obliged to reflect,\" said he to Garat, \"I always rely on first\r\nimpressions.\"\r\n\r\n\"For him,\" says the same authority, \"the best reasons are\r\nsuspicions,\"[31130] and naught makes headway against suspicions,\r\nnot even the most positive evidence. On September 4, 1792, talking\r\nconfidentially with Pétion, and hard pressed with the questions that he\r\nput to him, he ends by saying, \"Very well, I think that Brissot is on\r\nBrunswick's side.\"[31131]--Naturally, finally, he, like Marat, imagines\r\nthe darkest fictions, but they are less improvised, less grossly\r\nabsurd, more slowly worked out and more industriously interwoven in his\r\ncalculating inquisitorial brain.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently,\" he says to Garat, \"the Girondists are conspiring.\"[31132]\r\n\r\n\"And where?\" demands Garat.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere,\" Robespierre replies, \"in Paris, throughout France, over\r\nall Europe. Gensonné, at Paris, is plotting in the Faubourg St. Antoine,\r\ngoing about among the shopkeepers and persuading them that we patriots\r\nmean to pillage their shops. The Gironde (department) has for a long\r\ntime been plotting its separation from France so as to join England; the\r\nchiefs of its deputation are at the head of the plot, and mean to carry\r\nit out at any cost. Gensonné makes no secret of it; he tells all among\r\nthem who will listen to him that they are not representatives of the\r\nnation, but plenipotentiaries of the Gironde. Brissot is plotting in his\r\njournal, which is simply a tocsin of civil war; we know of his going\r\nto England, and why he went; we know all about his intimacy with that\r\nLebrun, minister of foreign affairs, a Liegois and creature of the\r\nAustrian house. Brissot's best friend is Clavière, and Clavière\r\nhas plotted wherever he could breathe. Rabaut, treacherous like the\r\nProtestant and philosopher that he is, was not clever enough to conceal\r\nhis correspondence with that courtier and traitor Montesquiou; six\r\nmonths ago they were working together to open Savoy and France to the\r\nPiedmontese. Servan was made general of the Pyrenean army only to give\r\nthe keys of France to the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no doubt of this in your mind?\" asks Garat.\r\n\r\n\"None, whatever.\"[31133]\r\n\r\nSuch assurance, equal to that of Marat, is terrible and worse in its\r\neffect, for Robespierre's list of conspirators is longer than that of\r\nMarat. Political and social, in Marat's mind, the list comprehends only\r\naristocrats and the rich; theological and moral in Robespierre's mind,\r\nit comprehends all atheists and dishonest persons, that is to say,\r\nnearly the whole of his party. In this narrow mind, given up to\r\nabstractions and habitually classifying men under two opposite headings,\r\nwhoever is not with him on the good side is against him on the bad side,\r\nand, on the bad side, the common understanding between the factious of\r\nevery flag and the rogues of every degree, is natural.\r\n\r\n\"All aristocrats are corrupt, and every corrupt man is an aristocrat;\"\r\nfor, \"republican government and public morality are one and the same\r\nthing.\"[31134]\r\n\r\nNot only do evil-doers of both species tend through instinct and\r\ninterest to league together, but their league is already perfected. One\r\nhas only to open one's eyes to detect \"in all its extent\" the plot\r\nthey have hatched, \"the frightful system of destruction of public\r\nmorality.\"[31135] Guadet, Vergniaud, Gensonné, Danton, Hébert, \"all of\r\nthem artificial characters,\" had no other end in view: \"they felt[31136]\r\nthat, to destroy liberty, it was necessary to favor by every means\r\nwhatever tended to justify egoism, wither the heart and efface that idea\r\nof moral beauty, which affords the only rule for public reason in its\r\njudgment of the defenders and enemies of humanity.\"--Their heirs\r\nremain; but let those be careful. Immorality is a political offense; one\r\nconspires against the State merely by making a parade of materialism or\r\nby preaching indulgence, by acting scandalously, or by following evil\r\ncourses, by stock-jobbing, by dining too sumptuously; by being vicious,\r\nscheming, given to exaggeration, or \"on the fence;\" by exciting or\r\nperverting the people, by deceiving the people, by finding fault with\r\nthe people, by distrusting the people,[31137] short, when one does not\r\nmarch straight along on the prescribed path marked out by Robespierre\r\naccording to principles: whoever stumbles or turns aside is a scoundrel,\r\na traitor. Now, not counting the Royalists, Feuillantists, Girondists,\r\nHébertists, Dantonists, and others already decapitated or imprisoned\r\naccording to their merit, how many traitors still remain in the\r\nConvention, on the Committees, amongst the representatives on mission,\r\nin the administrative bodies not properly weeded out, amongst petty\r\ntyrannical underlings and the entire ruling, influential class at Paris\r\nand in the provinces? Outside of \"about twenty political Trappists in\r\nthe Convention,\" outside of a small devoted group of pure Jacobins in\r\nParis, outside of a faithful few scattered among the popular clubs of\r\nthe departments, how many Fouchés, Vadiers, Talliens, Bourdons, Collots,\r\nremain amongst the so-called revolutionaries? How many dissidents are\r\nthere, disguised as orthodox, charlatans disguised as patriots, and\r\npashas disguised as sans-culottes?[31138] Add all this vermin to\r\nthat which Marat seeks to crush out; it is no longer by hundreds of\r\nthousands, but by millions, exclaim Baudot, Jeanbon-Saint-André and\r\nGuffroy, that the guilty must be counted and cut off their heads!--And\r\nall these heads, Robespierre, according to his maxims, must strike off.\r\nHe is well aware of this; hostile as his intellect may be to precise\r\nideas, he, when alone in his closet, face to face with himself, sees\r\nclearly, as clearly as Marat. Marat's chimera, on first spreading out\r\nits wings, bore its frenzied rider swiftly onward to the charnel house;\r\nthat of Robespierre, fluttering and hobbling along, reaches the goal\r\nin its turn; in its turn, it demands something to feed on, and the\r\nrhetorician, the professor of principles, begins to assess the voracity\r\nof the monstrous brute on which he is mounted. Slower than the other,\r\nthis one is still more ravenous, for, with similar claws and teeth,\r\nit has a vaster appetite. At the end of three years Robespierre has\r\novertaken Marat, at that distant end of the line, at the station\r\nwhere Marat had established himself from the very beginning, and the\r\ntheoretician now adopts the policy, the aim, the means, the work, and\r\nalmost the vocabulary of a maniac:[31139]\r\n\r\n     armed dictatorship of the urban mob,\r\n     systematic perturbation of the bribed rabble,\r\n     war against the bourgeoisie,\r\n     extermination of the rich,\r\n\r\nplacing opposition writers, administrators and deputies outside the law.\r\n\r\nBoth monsters get the same food; only, to the ration of his monster,\r\nRobespierre adds \"vicious men\" as its special and favorite prey.\r\nHenceforth, he may in vain abstain from action, take refuge in his\r\nrhetoric, stop his chaste ears, and raise his hypocritical eyes to\r\nheaven, he cannot avoid seeing or hearing under his immaculate feet\r\nthe streaming gore, and the bones crashing in the open jaws of the\r\ninsatiable monster which he has fashioned and on which he rides.[31140]\r\nThese ever open and hungry jaws must be daily fed with an ampler supply\r\nof human flesh; not only is he bound to let it eat, but to furnish the\r\nfood, often with his own hands, except that he must afterwards wash\r\nthem, declaring, and even believing, that no spot of blood has ever\r\nsoiled them. He is generally content to caress and flatter the brute, to\r\nexcuse it, to let it go on. Nevertheless, more than once, tempted by the\r\nopportunity, he has launched it against his designated victim.[31141] He\r\nis now himself starting off in quest of living prey; he casts the net of\r\nhis rhetoric[31142] around it; he fetches it bound to the open jaws; he\r\nthrusts aside with an uncompromising air the arms of friends, wives and\r\nmothers, the outstretched hands of suppliants begging for lives;[31143]\r\nhe suddenly throttles the struggling victims[31144] and, for fear that\r\nthey might escape, he strangles them in time. Near the end, this is no\r\nlonger enough; the brute must have grander quarries, and, accordingly, a\r\npack of hounds, beaters-up, and, willingly or not, it is Robespierre who\r\nequips, directs and urges them on, at Orange, at Paris,[31145] ordering\r\nthem to empty the prison's, and be expeditious in doing their work.--In\r\nthis profession of slaughtering, destructive instincts, long repressed\r\nby civilization, become aroused. His feline physiognomy, at first \"that\r\nof a domestic cat, restless but mild, changes into the savage appearance\r\nof the wildcat, and close to the ferocious exterior of the tiger. In the\r\nConstituent Assembly he speaks with a whine, in the Convention he froths\r\nat the mouth.\"[31146] The monotonous drone of a stiff sub-professor\r\nchanges into the personal accent of furious passion; he hisses and\r\ngrinds his teeth;[31147] Sometimes, on a change of scene, he affects to\r\nshed tears.[31148] But his wildest outbursts are less alarming than his\r\naffected sensibility. The festering grudges, corrosive envies and bitter\r\nscheming which have accumulated in his breast are astonishing. The gall\r\nbladder is full, and the extravasated gall overflows on the dead. He\r\nnever tires of re-executing his guillotined adversaries, the Girondists,\r\nChaumette, Hébert and especially Danton,[31149] probably because Danton\r\nwas the active agent in the Revolution of which he was simply the\r\nincapable pedagogue; he vents his posthumous hatred on this still warm\r\ncorpse in artful insinuations and obvious misrepresentations. Thus,\r\ninwardly corroded by the venom it distills, his physical machine gets\r\nout of order, like that of Marat, but with other symptoms. When speaking\r\nin the tribune \"his hands crisp with a sort of nervous contraction;\"\r\nsudden tremors agitate \"his shoulders and neck, shaking him convulsively\r\nto and fro.\"[31150] \"His bilious complexion becomes livid,\" his eyelids\r\nquiver under his spectacles, and how he looks! \"Ah,\" said a Montagnard,\r\n\"you would have voted as we did on the 9th of Thermidor, had you seen\r\nhis green eyeballs!\" \"Physically as well as morally,\" he becomes a\r\nsecond Marat, suffering all the more because his delirium is not steady,\r\nand because his policy, being a moral one, forces him to exterminate on\r\na grander scale.\r\n\r\nBut he is a discreet Marat, of a timid temperament, anxious,[31151]\r\nkeeping his thoughts to himself, made for a school-master or a\r\npleader, but not for taking the lead or for governing, always acting\r\nhesitatingly, and ambitious to be rather the pope, than the dictator\r\nof the Revolution.[31152] Above all, he wants to remain a political\r\nGrandison[31153]; until the very end, he keeps his mask, not only in\r\npublic but also to himself and in his inmost conscience. The mask,\r\nindeed, has adhered to his skin; he can no longer distinguish one from\r\nthe other; never did an impostor more carefully conceal intentions and\r\nacts under sophisms, and persuade himself that the mask was his face,\r\nand that in telling a lie, he told the truth.\r\n\r\nTaking his word for it, he had nothing to do with the September\r\nevents.[31154] \"Previous to these events, he had ceased to attend the\r\nGeneral Council of the Commune... He no longer went there.\" He was not\r\ncharged with any duty, he had no influence there; he had not provoked\r\nthe arrest and murder of the Girondists.[31155] All he did was to \"speak\r\nfrankly concerning certain members of the Committee of Twenty-one;\" as\r\n\"a magistrate\" and \"one of a municipal assembly.\" Should he not\" explain\r\nhimself freely on the authors of a dangerous plot?\" Besides, the Commune\r\n\"far from provoking the 2nd of September did all in its power to prevent\r\nit.\" After all, only one innocent person perished, \"which is undoubtedly\r\none too many. Citizens, mourn over this cruel mistake; we too have long\r\nmourned over it! But, as all things human come to an end, let your tears\r\ncease to flow.\" When the sovereign people resumes its delegated\r\npower and exercises its inalienable rights, we have only to bow our\r\nheads.--Moreover, it is just, wise and good \"in all that it undertakes,\r\nall is virtue and truth; nothing can be excess, error or crime.\"[31156]\r\nIt must intervene when its true representatives are hampered by the\r\nlaw \"let it assemble in its sections and compel the arrest of faithless\r\ndeputies.\"[31157] What is more legal than such a motion, which is the\r\nonly part Robespierre took on the 31st of May. He is too scrupulous to\r\ncommit or prescribe an illegal act. That will do for the Dantons, the\r\nMarats, men of relaxed morals or excited brains, who if need be, tramp\r\nin the gutters and roll up their shirt-sleeves; as to himself, he can\r\ndo nothing that would ostensibly derange or soil the dress proper to\r\nan honest man and irreproachable citizen. In the Committee of Public\r\nSafety, he merely executes the decrees of the Convention, and the\r\nConvention is always free. He a dictator! He is merely one of seven\r\nhundred deputies, and his authority, if he has any, is simply the\r\nlegitimate ascendancy of reason and virtue.[31158] He a murderer! If\r\nhe has denounced conspirators, it is the Convention which summons these\r\nbefore the revolutionary Tribunal,[31159] and the revolutionary Tribunal\r\npronounces judgment on them. He a terrorist! He merely seeks to simplify\r\nthe established proceedings, so as to secure a speedier release of the\r\ninnocent, the punishment of the guilty, and the final purgation that\r\nis to render liberty and morals the order of the day.[31160]--Before\r\nuttering all this he almost believes it, and, when he has uttered it he\r\nbelieves it fully.[31161] When nature and history combine, to produce a\r\ncharacter, they succeed better than man's imagination. Neither Molière\r\nin his \"Tartuffe,\" nor Shakespeare in his \"Richard III.,\" dared bring\r\non the stage a hypocrite believing himself sincere, and a Cain that\r\nregarded himself as an Abel.[31162] There he stands on a colossal stage,\r\nin the presence of a hundred thousand spectators, on the 8th of June,\r\n1794, the most glorious day of his life, at that fête in honor of the\r\nSupreme Being, which is the glorious triumph of his doctrine and\r\nthe official consecration of his papacy. Two characters are found in\r\nRobespierre, as in the Revolution which he represents: one, apparent,\r\nparaded, external, and the other hidden, dissembled, inward, the latter\r\nbeing overlaid by the former.--The first one all for show, fashioned\r\nout of purely cerebral cogitations, is as artificial as the solemn farce\r\ngoing on around him. According to David's programme, the cavalcade\r\nof supernumeraries who file in front of an allegorical mountain,\r\ngesticulate and shout at the command, and under the eyes, of Henriot\r\nand his gendarmes,[31163] manifesting at the appointed time the emotions\r\nwhich are prescribed for them. At five o'clock in the morning\r\n\r\n\"friends, husbands, wives, relations and children will embrace....\r\nThe old man, his eyes streaming with tears of joy, feels himself\r\nrejuvenated.\"\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock, on the turf-laid terraces of the sacred mountain,\r\n\r\n\"all will show a state of commotion and excitement: mothers here press\r\nto their bosoms the infants they suckle, and there offer them up in\r\nhomage to the author of Nature, while youths, aglow with the ardor\r\nof battle, simultaneously draw their swords and hand them to their\r\nvenerable fathers. Sharing in the enthusiasm of their sons, the deported\r\nold men embrace them and bestow on them the paternal benediction.....\r\nAll the men distributed around the 'Field of Reunion' sing in chorus\r\nthe (first) refrain.... All the Women distributed around the 'Field of\r\nReunion' sing in unison the (second) refrain.... All Frenchmen partake\r\nof each other's sentiments in one grand fraternal embrace.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could better than such an idyll, ruled with an iron hand, in the\r\npresence of moral symbols and colored pasteboard divinities, could\r\nbetter please the counterfeit moralist, unable to distinguish the\r\nfalse from the true, and whose skin-deep sensibility is borrowed from\r\nsentimental authors! \"For the first time\" his glowing countenance beams\r\nwith joy, while \"the enthusiasm\"[31164] of the scribe overflows, as\r\nusual, in book phraseology.\r\n\r\n\"Behold!\" he exclaims, \"that which is most interesting in humanity! The\r\nUniverse is here assembled! O, Nature, how sublime, how exquisite is thy\r\npower! How tyrants must quail at the contemplation of this festival!\"\r\n\r\nIs not he himself its most dazzling ornament? Was not he unanimously\r\nchosen to preside over the Convention and conduct the ceremonies? Is he\r\nnot the founder of the new cult, the only pure worship on the face of\r\nthe earth, approved of by morality and reason? Wearing the uniform of a\r\nrepresentative, nankeen breeches, blue coat, tri-colored sash and plumed\r\nhat,[31165] holding in his hand a bouquet of flowers and grain, he\r\nmarches at the head of the Convention and officiates on the platform;\r\nhe sets fire to the veil which hides from view the idol representing\r\n\"Atheism,\" and suddenly, through an ingenious contrivance, the majestic\r\nstatue of \"Wisdom\" appears in its place. He then addresses the crowd,\r\nover and over again, exhorting, apostrophizing, preaching, elevating his\r\nsoul to the Supreme Being, and with what oratorical combinations! What\r\nan academic swell of bombastic cadences, strung together to enforce\r\nhis tirades! How cunning the even balance of adjective and\r\nsubstantive![31166] From these faded rhetorical flowers, arranged as if\r\nfor a prize distribution or a funeral oration, exhales a sanctimonious,\r\ncollegiate odor which he complacently breathes, and which intoxicates\r\nhim. At this moment, he must certainly be in earnest; there is no\r\nhesitation or reserve in his self-admiration; he is not only in his own\r\neyes a great writer and great orator, but a great statesman and\r\ngreat citizen his artificial, philosophic conscience awards him\r\nonly praise.--But look underneath, or rather wait a moment. Signs of\r\nimpatience and antipathy appear behind his back: Lecointre has braved\r\nhim openly; numerous insults, and, worse than these, sarcasms, reach his\r\nears. On such an occasion, and in such a place! Against the pontiff of\r\nTruth, the apostle of Virtue! The miscreants, how dare they! Silent and\r\npale, he suppresses his rage, and,[31167] losing his balance, closing\r\nhis eyes, he plunges headlong on the path of murder: cost what it\r\nwill, the miscreants must perish and without loss of time. To expedite\r\nmatters, he must get their heads off quietly, and as \"up to this time\r\nthings have been managed confidentially in the Committee of Public\r\nSafety,\" he, alone with Couthon, two days after, without informing his\r\ncolleagues,[31168] draws up, brings to the Convention, and has passed\r\nthe terrible act of Prairial which places everybody's life at his\r\ndisposal.--In his crafty, blundering haste, he has demanded too much;\r\neach one, on reflection, becomes alarmed for himself; he is compelled\r\nto back out, to protest that he is misunderstood, admit that\r\nrepresentatives are excepted, and, accordingly, to sheathe the knife he\r\nhas already applied to his adversaries throats. But he still holds it\r\nin his grasp. He watches them, and, pretending to retreat, affects\r\na renunciation, crouched in his corner,[31169] waiting until they\r\ndiscredit themselves, so as to spring upon them a second time. He has\r\nnot to wait long, for the exterminating machine he set up on the 22nd\r\nof Prairial, is in their hands, and it has to work as he planned it,\r\nnamely, by making rapid turns and almost haphazard: the odium of a blind\r\nsweeping massacre rests with them; he not only makes no opposition to\r\nthis, but, while pretending to abstain from it, he urges it on. Secluded\r\nin the private office of his secret police, he orders arrests;[31170]\r\nhe sends out his principal bloodhound, Herman; he first signs and\r\nthen dispatches the resolution by which it is supposed that there are\r\nconspirators among those in confinement and which, authorizing spies\r\nor paid informers, is to provide the guillotine with those vast batches\r\nwhich purge and clean prisons out in a trice.\"[31171]--\"I am not\r\nresponsible,\" he states later on....\" My lack of power to do any good,\r\nto arrest the evil, forced me for more than six weeks to abandon my post\r\non the Committee of Public Safety.\"[31172] To ruin his adversaries by\r\nmurders committed by him, by those which he makes them commit and which\r\nhe imputes to them, to whitewash himself and blacken them with the same\r\nstroke of the brush, what intense delight! If the natural conscience\r\nmurmurs in whispers at moments, the acquired superposed conscience\r\nimmediately imposes silence, concealing personal hatreds under public\r\npretexts: the guillotined, after all, were aristocrats, and whoever\r\ncomes under the guillotine is immoral. Thus, the means are good and the\r\nend better; in employing the means, as well as in pursuing the end, the\r\nfunction is sacerdotal.\r\n\r\nSuch is the scenic exterior of the Revolution, a specious mask with a\r\nhideous visage beneath it, under the reign of a nominal humanitarian\r\ntheory, covering over the effective dictatorship of evil and low\r\npassions. In its true representative, as in itself, we see ferocity\r\nissuing from philanthropy, and, from the pedant (cuistre), the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3101: Harmand (de la Meuse): \"Anecdotes relatives à la\r\nRevolution.\" \"He was dressed like a tough cab-driver.

THE RULERS OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nLet us follow the operations of the new government from top to bottom,\r\nfrom those of its ruling bodies and leaders, to its assemblies,\r\ncommittees, delegates, administrators and underlings of every kind\r\nand degree. Like living flesh stamped with a red-hot iron, so will the\r\nsituation put one their brows the two marks, each with its own different\r\ndepth and discoloration. In vain do they, too, strive to conceal their\r\nscars: we detect under the crowns and titles they assume the brand of\r\nthe slave or the mark of the tyrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Convention.\r\n\r\n     The Convention.--The \"Plain.\"--The \"Mountain.\"--Degradation\r\n     of Souls.--Parades which the Convention is obligated to\r\n     make.\r\n\r\nAt the Tuileries, the omnipotent Convention sits enthroned in\r\nthe theater, converted into an Assembly room. It carries on its\r\ndeliberations daily, in grand style. Its decrees, received with blind\r\nobedience, startle France and upset all Europe. At a distance, its\r\nmajesty is imposing, more august than that of the Republican senate\r\nin Rome. Near by, the effect is quite otherwise; these undisputed\r\nsovereigns are serfs who live in trances, and justly so, for, nowhere,\r\neven in prison, is there more constraint and less security than on their\r\nbenches. After the 2nd of June, 1793, their inviolable precincts, the\r\ngrand official reservoir from which legal authority flows, becomes a\r\nsort of tank, into which the revolutionary net plunges and successfully\r\nbrings out its choicest fish, singly or by the dozen, and sometimes\r\nin vast numbers; at first, the sixty-seven Girondist deputies, who are\r\nexecuted or proscribed; then, the seventy-three members of the \"Right,\"\r\nswept off in one day and lodged in the prison of La Force; next, the\r\nprominent Jacobins:\r\n\r\nOsselin, arrested on the 19th of Brumaire, Bazire, Chabot, and Delaunay,\r\naccused by decree on the 24th Brumaire, Fabre d'Eglantine, arrested\r\non the 24th of Nivôse, Bernard, guillotined on the 3rd of Pluviôse,\r\nAnacharsis Clootz guillotined on the 4th of Germinal, Hérault de\r\nSéchelles, Lacroix, Philippeaux, Camille Desmoulins and Danton,\r\nguillotined with four others on the 10th of Germinal, Simon, guillotined\r\non the 24th of Germinal, and Osselin, guillotined on the 8th of\r\nMessidor.--Naturally, the others take warning and are careful. At the\r\nopening of the session they are seen entering the hall, looking uneasy,\r\nfull of distrust,\"[3201] like animals driven into a pen and suspicious\r\nof a trap.\r\n\r\n\"Each,\" writes an eye-witness, \"acted and spoke with circumspection,\r\nfor fear of being charged with some crime: in effect, nothing was\r\nunimportant, the seat one took, a glance of the eye, a gesture, a\r\nmurmur, a smile.\"\r\n\r\nHence, they flock instinctively to the side which is best sheltered, the\r\nleft side.\r\n\r\n\"The tide flowed towards the summit of the Mountain; the right side was\r\ndeserted.... Many took no side at all, and, during the session, often\r\nchanged their seats, thinking that they might thus elude the spy by\r\ndonning a mixed hue and keeping on good terms with everybody. The most\r\nprudent never sat down; they kept off the benches, at the foot of the\r\ntribune, and, on matters getting to be serious, slipped quietly out of\r\nthe hall.\"\r\n\r\nMost of them took refuge in their committee-rooms; each tries to be\r\nover-looked, to be obscure, to appear insignificant or absent.[3202]\r\nDuring the four months following the 2nd of June, the hall of the\r\nConvention is half or three-quarters empty; the election of a president\r\ndoes not bring out two hundred and fifty voters;[3203] only two hundred,\r\none hundred, fifty votes, elect the Committees of Public Safety\r\nand General Security; about fifty votes elect the judges of\r\nthe Revolutionary Tribunal; less than ten votes elect their\r\nsubstitutes;[3204] not one vote is cast for the adoption of the decree\r\nindicting the deputy, Dulaure;[3205] \"no member rises for or against\r\nit; there is no vote;\" the president, nevertheless, pronounces the\r\nact passed and the Marais lets things take their course.\"--\"Marais\r\nfrogs\"[3206] is the appellation bestowed on them before the 2nd of\r\nJune, when, amongst the dregs of the \"Center,\" they \"broke\" with the\r\n\"Mountain;\" now, they still number four hundred and fifty, three times\r\nas many as the \"Montagnards;\" but they purposely keep quiet; their\r\nold name \"renders them, so to say, soft; their ears ring with eternal\r\nmenaces; their hearts shrivel up with terror;[3207] while their tongues,\r\nparalyzed by habitual silence, remain as if glued to the roofs of their\r\nmouths. In vain do they keep in the back-ground, consent to everything,\r\nask nothing for themselves but personal safety, and surrender all else,\r\ntheir votes, their wills and their consciences; they feel that their\r\nlife hangs by a thread. The greatest mute among them all, Siéyès,\r\ndenounced in the Jacobin Club, barely escapes, and through the\r\nprotection of his shoemaker, who rises and exclaims: \"That Siéyès! I\r\nknow him. He don't meddle with politics. He does nothing but read his\r\nbook. I make his shoes and will answer for him.\"[3208]\r\n\r\nOf course, previous to the 9th of Thermidor, none of them open their\r\nmouths; it is only the \"Montagnards\" who make speeches, and on the\r\ncountersign being given. If Legendre, the admirer, disciple and\r\nconfidential friend of Danton, dares at one time interfere in relation\r\nto the decree which sends his friend to the scaffold, asking that he may\r\nfirst be heard, it is only to retract immediately; that very evening, at\r\nthe Jacobin club, for greater security, \"he wallows in the mud;\"[3209]\r\nhe declares \"that he submits to the judgment of the revolutionary\r\nTribunal,\" and swears to denounce \"whoever shall oppose any obstacle\r\nto the execution of the decree.\"[3210] Has not Robespierre taught him\r\na lesson, and in his most pedantic manner? What is more beautiful,\r\nsays the great moralist, more sublime, than an Assembly which purges\r\nitself?[3211]--Thus, not only is the net which has already dragged out\r\nso many palpitating victims still intact, but it is enlarged and set\r\nagain, only, the fish are now caught on the \"Left\" as well as on the\r\n\"Right,\" and preferably on the topmost benches of the \"Mountain.\"[3212]\r\nAnd better still, through the law of Prairial 22, its meshes are reduced\r\nin size and its width increased; with such admirable contraption, the\r\nfishpond could not fail to be exhausted. A little before the 9th of\r\nThermidor, David, who was one of Robespierre's devoted adherents,\r\nhimself exclaimed: \"Will twenty of us be left on the Mountain?\" About\r\nthe same time, Legendic, Thuriot, Léonard Bourdon, Tallien, Bourdon de\r\nl'Oise, and others, each has a spy all day long at his heels. There are\r\nthirty deputies to be proscribed and their names are whispered about;\r\nwhereupon, sixty stay out all night, convinced that they will be seized\r\nthe next morning before they can get up.[3213]\r\n\r\nSubject to such a system, prolonged for so many months, people sink down\r\nand become discouraged. \"Everybody made themselves small so as to\r\npass beneath the popular yoke.[3214] Everybody became one of the low\r\nclass.... Clothes, manners, refinement, cleanliness, the conveniences\r\nof life, civility and politeness were all renounced.\"--People wear\r\ntheir clothes indecently and curse and swear; they try to resemble the\r\nsans-culottes Montagnards \"who are profane and dress themselves like so\r\nmany dock-loafers;\"[3215] at Armonville, the carder, who presides (at a\r\nmeeting) wears a woolen cap, and similarly at Cusset, a gauze-workman,\r\nwho is always drunk. Only Robespierre dares appear in neat attire; among\r\nthe others, who do not have his influence, among the demi-suspects\r\nwith a pot-belly, such a residue of the ancient régime might become\r\ndangerous; they do well not to attract the attention of the foul-mouthed\r\nspy who cannot spell;[3216] especially is it important at a meeting to\r\nbe one of the crowd and remain unnoticed by the paid claqueurs, drunken\r\nswaggerers and \"fat petticoats\" of the tribunes. It is even essential\r\nto shout in harmony with them and join in their bar-room dances. The\r\ndeputations of the popular clubs come for fourteen months to the bar of\r\nthe house and recite their common-place or bombastic tirades, and the\r\nConvention is forced to applaud them. For nine months,[3217] street\r\nballad-singers and coffee-house ranters attend in full session and sing\r\nthe rhymes of the day, while the Convention is obliged to join in the\r\nchorus. For six weeks,[3218] the profaners of churches come to the hall\r\nand display their dance-house buffooneries, and the Convention has not\r\nonly to put up with these, but also to take part in them.--Never, even\r\nin imperial Rome, under Nero and Heliogabalus, did a senate descend so\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Its participation in crime.\r\n\r\n     How the parades are carried out.--Its slavery and servility\r\n     --Its participation in crime.\r\n\r\nObserve one of their parades, that of Brumaire 20th, 22nd or 30th, which\r\nmasquerade often occurs several times a week and is always the same,\r\nwith scarcely any variation.--Male and female wretches march in\r\nprocession to the doors of the deputies' hall, still \"drunk with the\r\nwine imbibed from chalices, after eating mackerel broiled in patens,\"\r\nbesides refreshing themselves on the way. \"Mounted astride of asses\r\nwhich they have rigged out in chasuble and which they guide with a\r\nstole,\" they halt at each low smoking-den, holding a drinking cup in\r\ntheir hand; the bartender, with a mug in his hand, fills it, and, at\r\neach station, they toss off their bumpers, one after the other, in\r\nimitation of the Mass, and which they repeat in the street in their own\r\nfashion.--On finishing this, they don copes, chasubles and dalmatica,\r\nand, in two long lines, file before the benches of the Convention. Some\r\nof them bear on hand-barrows or in baskets, candelabra, chalices, gold\r\nand silver salvers, monstrances, and reliquaries; others hold aloft\r\nbanners, crosses and other ecclesiastical spoils. In the mean time\r\n\"bands play the air of the carmagnole and 'Malbrook.'... On the entry\r\nof the dais, they strike up 'Ah! le bel oiseau;'\"[3219] all at once the\r\nmasqueraders throw off their disguise, and, mitres, stoles, chasubles\r\nflung in the air, \"disclose to view the defenders of the country in the\r\nnational uniform.\" Peals of laughter, shouts and enthusiasm, while the\r\ninstrumental din becomes louder! The procession, now in full blast,\r\ndemands the carmagnole, and the Convention consents; even some of the\r\ndeputies descend from their benches and cut the pigeon-wing with the\r\nmerry prostitutes.--To wind up, the Convention decrees that it will\r\nattend that evening the fête of Reason and, in fact, they go in a body.\r\nBehind an actress in short petticoats wearing a red cap, representing\r\nLiberty or Reason, march the deputies, likewise in red caps, shouting\r\nand singing until they reach the new temple, which is built of planks\r\nand pasteboard in the choir of Notre Dame. They take their seats in the\r\nfront rows, while the Goddess, an old frequenter of the suppers of the\r\nDuc de Soubise, along with \"all the pretty dames of the Opera,\"\r\ndisplay before them their operatic graces.[3220] They sing the \"Hymn\r\nto Liberty,\" and, since the Convention has that morning decreed that\r\nit must sing, I suppose that it also joined in.[3221] After this there\r\nfollows dancing; but, unfortunately, the authorities are wanting for\r\nstating whether the Convention danced or not. In any event, it is\r\npresent at the dance, and thus consecrates an unique orgy, not\r\nRubens' \"Kermesse\" in the open air, racy and healthy, but a nocturnal\r\nboulevard-jollification, a \"Mardi-gras\" composed of lean and haggard\r\nscapegraces.--In the great nave of the Cathedral, \"the dancers, almost\r\nnaked, with bare necks and breasts, and stockings down at the heel,\"\r\nwrithe and stamp, \"howling the carmagnole.\" In the side chapels, which\r\nare \"shut off by high tapestries, prostitutes with shrill voices\" pursue\r\ntheir avocation.[3222]--To descend to this low level so barefacedly, to\r\nfraternise with barrier sots, and wenches, to endure their embraces and\r\nhiccoughs, is bad enough, even for docile deputies. More than one half\r\nof them loathed it beforehand and remained at home; after this they do\r\nnot feel disposed to attend the Convention.[3223]--But the \"Mountain\r\nsends for them, and an officer brings them back;\" it is necessary that\r\nthey should co-operate through their presence and felicitations in the\r\nprofanations and apostasies which follow;[3224] it is necessary that\r\nthey should approve of and decree that which they hold in horror, not\r\nalone folly and nonsense, but crime, the murder of innocent people, and\r\nthat of their friends.--All this is done. \"Unanimously, and with the\r\nloudest applause,\" the Left, united with the Right, sends Danton to the\r\nscaffold, its natural chieftain, the great promoter and leader of the\r\nRevolution.[3225] \"Unanimously, and with the loudest applause,\"\r\nthe Right, united with the Left, votes the worse decrees of the\r\nRevolutionary government.[3226] \"Unanimously,\" with approving and\r\nenthusiastic cheers, manifesting the warmest sympathy for Collot\r\nd'Herbois, Couthon, and Robespierre,[3227] the Convention, through\r\nmultiplied and spontaneous re-elections, maintains the homicidal\r\ngovernment which the Plain detests, because it is homicidal, and which\r\nthe Mountain detests, because it is decimated by it. Plain and Mountain,\r\nby virtue of terror, majority after majority, end in consenting to and\r\nbringing about their own suicide: on the 22nd of Prairial, the entire\r\nConvention has stretched out its neck;[3228] on the 8th of Thermidor,\r\nfor a quarter of an hour after Robespierre's speech,[3229] it has again\r\nstretched this out, and would probably have succumbed, had not five or\r\nsix of them, whom Robespierre designated or named, Bourdon de l'Oise,\r\nVadier, Cambon, Billaud and Panis, stimulated by the animal instinct of\r\nself-preservation, raised their arms to ward off the knife. Nothing but\r\nimminent, personal, mortal danger could, in these prostrated beings,\r\nsupplant long-continued fear with still greater fear. Later on, Siéyès,\r\non being asked how he acted in these times, replied, \"I lived.\" In\r\neffect, he and others are reduced to that; they succeeded in doing this,\r\nat all costs, and at what a price![3230] His secret notes, his most\r\nprivate sketches confirm this[3231]...\r\n\r\n\"On the Committee of March 20, \"Paillasse, half drunk, gives a\r\ndissertation on the way to carry on the war, and interrogates and\r\ncensures the Minister. The poor Minister evades his questions with café\r\ngossip and a review of campaigns. These are the men placed at the head\r\nof the government to save the Republic!\"--\"H...., in his distraction,\r\nhad the air of a sly fox inwardly smiling at his own knavish thoughts.\r\nRuit irrevocabile vulgus... Jusque Datum sceleri.\"--\"Are you keeping\r\nsilent?\"--\"Of what use is my glass of wine in this torrent of ardent\r\nspirits?\"--\r\n\r\nAll this is very well, but he did not merely keep silent and abstain. He\r\nvoted, legislated and decreed, along with the unanimous Convention; he\r\nwas a collaborator, not only passively, through his presence, but also\r\nthrough his active participation in the acts of the government which he\r\nelected and enthroned, re-elected twelve times, cheered every week,\r\nand flattered daily, authorizing and keeping on to the end its work of\r\nspoliation and massacre.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody is guilty here,\" said Carrier in the Convention, \"even to the\r\npresident's bell.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain do they constantly repeat to themselves that they were forced to\r\nobey under penalty of death: the conscience of the purest among them, if\r\nhe has any, replies:\r\n\r\n\"You too, in spite of yourself, I admit; less than others, if you\r\nplease, but you were a terrorist, that is to say, a brigand and an\r\nassassin.\"[3232]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Committee of Public Safety.\r\n\r\n     The Men who do the work.--Carnot, Prieur de-la-Côte d'Or,\r\n     Jean Bon Saint André, Robert Lindet.\r\n\r\nOn a man becoming a slave, said old Homer, the Gods take away the half\r\nof his soul; the same is true of a man who becomes a tyrant.--In the\r\nPavilion de Flore, alongside of and above the enslaved Convention, sit\r\nthe twelve kings it has enthroned, twice a day,[3233] ruling over it as\r\nwell as over France.[3234] Of course, some guarantee is required\r\nfrom those who fill this place; there is not one of them who is not a\r\nrevolutionary of long standing, an impenitent regicide, a fanatic in\r\nessence and a despot through principle; but the fumes of omnipotence\r\nhave not intoxicated them all to the same degree.--Three or four of\r\nthem, Robert Lindet, Jean Bon St. André, Prieur de la Côte-d'Or and\r\nCarnot, confine themselves to useful and secondary duties; this suffices\r\nto keep them partially safe. As specialists, charged with an important\r\nservice, their first object is to do this well, and hence they\r\nsubordinate the rest to this, even theoretical exigencies and the\r\noutcries of the clubs.\r\n\r\nLindet's prime object is to feed the departments that are without wheat,\r\nand the towns that are soon to be short of bread.\r\n\r\nPrieur's business is to see that biscuits, brandy, clothes, shoes,\r\ngunpowder and arms are manufactured.[3235]\r\n\r\nJean Bon, that vessels are equipped and crews drilled.\r\n\r\nCarnot, to draw up campaign plans and direct the march of armies: the\r\ndispatch of so many bags of grain during the coming fortnight to this\r\nor that town, or warehouse in this or that district; the making up of so\r\nmany weekly rations, to be deported during the month to certain\r\nplaces on the frontier; the transformation of so many fishermen into\r\nartillerymen or marines, and to set afloat so many vessels in three\r\nmonths; to expedite certain Corps of Cavalry, infantry and artillery, so\r\nas to arrive by such and such roads at this or that pass--\r\n\r\nThese are precise combinations which purge the brain of dogmatic\r\nphrases, which force revolutionary jargon into the background and keep a\r\nman sensible and practical; and all the more because three of them, Jean\r\nBon, former captain of a merchantman, Prieur and Carnot, engineering\r\nofficers, are professional men and go to the front to put their\r\nshoulders to the wheel on the spot. Jean Bon, always visiting the\r\ncoasts, goes on board a vessel of the fleet leaving Brest to save the\r\ngreat American convoy; Carnot, at Watignies, orders Jourdan to make\r\na decisive move, and, shouldering his musket, marches along with the\r\nattacking column.[3236] Naturally, they have no leisure for speechmaking\r\nin the Jacobin club, or for intrigues in the Convention: Carnot lives in\r\nhis own office and in the committee-room; he does not allow himself time\r\nenough to eat with his wife, dines on a crust of bread and a glass of\r\nlemonade, and works sixteen and eighteen hours a day;[3237] Lindet, more\r\novertasked than any body else, because hunger will not wait, reads every\r\nreport himself, and passes days and nights at it;\"[3238] Jean Bon, in\r\nwooden shoes and woolen vest, with a bit of coarse bread and a glass of\r\nbad beer,[3239] writes and dictates until his strength fails him, and he\r\nhas to lie down and sleep on a mattress on the floor.--Naturally, again,\r\nwhen interfered with, and the tools in their hands are broken, they are\r\ndissatisfied; they know well the worth of a good instrument, and for\r\nthe service, as they comprehend it, good tools are essential, competent,\r\nfaithful employees, regular in attendance at their offices, and not at\r\nthe club. When they have a subordinate of this kind they defend him,\r\noften at the risk of their lives, even to incurring the enmity of\r\nRobespierre. Cambon,[3240] who, on his financial committee, is also a\r\nsort of sovereign, retains at the Treasury five or six hundred employees\r\nunable to procure their certificate of civism, and whom the Jacobins\r\nincessantly denounce so as to get their places. Carnot saves and employs\r\neminent engineers, D'Arcon, de Montalembert, d'Obenheim, all of them\r\nnobles, and one of them an anti-Jacobin, without counting a\r\nnumber of accused officers whom he justifies, replaces, or\r\nmaintains.[3241]--Through these courageous and humane acts, they solace\r\nthemselves for their scruples, at least partially and for the time\r\nbeing; moreover, they are statesmen only because the occasion and\r\nsuperior force makes it imperative, more led by others than leading,\r\nterrorists through accident and necessity, rather than through system\r\nand instinct. If, in concert with ten others, Prieur and Carnot order\r\nwholesale robbery and murder, if they sign orders by twenties and\r\nhundreds, amounting to assassinations, it is owing to their forming\r\npart of a body. When the whole committee deliberates, they are bound,\r\nin important decrees, to submit to the preponderating opinion of\r\nthe majority, after voting in the negative. In relation to secondary\r\ndecrees, in which there has been no preliminary discussion in common,\r\nthe only responsible member is the one whose signature stands first; the\r\nfollowing signatures affixed, without reading the document, are simply\r\na \"formality which the law requires,\" merely a visa, necessarily\r\nmechanical; with \"four or five hundred business matters to attend to\r\ndaily,\" it is impossible to do otherwise. To read all and vote in every\r\ncase, would be \"a physical impossibility.\"[3242]--Finally, as things\r\nare, \"is not the general will, at least the apparent general\r\nwill, that alone on which the government can decide, itself\r\nultra-revolutionary?\"[3243] In other words, should not the five or six\r\nrascals in a State who vociferate, be listened to, rather than a hundred\r\nhonest folks who keep their mouths shut? With this sophism, gross as\r\nit is, but of pure Jacobin manufacture, Carnot ends by hoodwinking his\r\nhonor and his conscience; otherwise intact, and far more so than\r\nhis colleagues, he likewise undergoes moral and mental mutilation;\r\nconstrained by the duties of his post and the illusions of his creed,\r\nhe succeeded in an inward decapitation of the two noblest of human\r\nfaculties, common-sense, the most useful, and the moral sense, the most\r\nexalted of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Statesmen.\r\n\r\n     Billaud-Varennes, Collot d'Herbois, Robespierre, Couthon and\r\n     Saint-Just.--Conditions of this rule.--Dangers to which they\r\n     are subject.--Their dissensions.--Pressure of Fear and\r\n     Theory.\r\n\r\nIf such are the ravages which are made in an upright, firm and healthy\r\npersonality, what must be the havoc in corrupt or weak natures, in which\r\nbad instincts already predominate!--And note that they are without the\r\nprotection provided by a pursuit of some specific and useful objective.\r\nThey are \"government men,\" also \"revolutionaries\" or \"the people in\r\ntotal control;\"[3244] they are in actual fact men with an overall\r\nconcept of things, also direct these. The creation, organization and\r\napplication of Terror belongs wholly to them; they are the constructors,\r\nregulators and engineers of the machine,[3245] the recognized heads of\r\nthe party, of the sect and of the government, especially Billaud and\r\nRobespierre, who never serve on missions,[3246] nor relax their hold for\r\na moment on the central motor. The former, an active politician,\r\nwith Collot for his second, is charged with urging on the constituted\r\nauthorities, the districts, the municipalities, the national agents,\r\nthe revolutionary committees, and the representatives on mission in the\r\ninterior.[3247] The latter, a theologian, moralist, titular doctor and\r\npreacher, is charged with ruling the Convention and indoctrinating\r\nthe Jacobins with sound principles; behind him stands Couthon, his\r\nlieutenant, with Saint-Just, his disciple and executor of works of\r\ngreat importance; in their midst, Barère, the Committee's mouthpiece, is\r\nmerely a tool, but indispensable, conveniently at hand and always ready\r\nto start whatever drum-beating is required on any given theme in honor\r\nof the party which stuffs his brain. Below these comes the Committee of\r\nGeneral Security, Vadier, Amar, Vouland, Guffroy, Panis, David, Jagot\r\nand the rest, those who undertook, reported on, and acted in behalf of\r\nuniversal proscription. All these bear the imprint of their service;\r\nthey could be recognized by \"their pallid hue, hollow and bloodshot\r\neyes,\"[3248] habits of omnipotence stamped \"on their brows, and on\r\ntheir deportment, something indescribably haughty and disdainful. The\r\nCommittee of General Security reminded one of the former lieutenants of\r\npolice, and the Committee of Public Safety, of the former ministers of\r\nstate.\" In the Convention, \"it is considered an honor to talk with them,\r\nand a privilege to shake hands with them; one seems to read one's duty\r\non their brows.\" On the days on which their orders are to be converted\r\ninto laws \"the members of the Committee and the reporter of the bill,\r\nkeep people waiting, the same as the heads and representatives of the\r\nformer sovereign power; on their way to the Assembly hall, they are\r\npreceded by a group of courtiers who seem to announce the masters of the\r\nworld.\"[3249]--In fact, they reign--but observe on what conditions.\r\n\r\n\"Make no complaints,\" said Barère,[3250] to the composer of an opera,\r\nthe performance of which had just been suspended: \"as times go, you must\r\nnot attract public attention. Do we not all stand at the foot of the\r\nguillotine, all, beginning with myself?\" Again, twenty years later, in a\r\nprivate conversation, on being interrogated as to the veritable object,\r\nthe secret motive of the Committee of Public Safety, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"As we were animated by but one sentiment,[3251] my dear sir, that\r\nof self-preservation, we had but one desire, that of maintaining an\r\nexistence which each of us believed to be menaced. You had your neighbor\r\nguillotined to prevent your neighbor from guillotining you.\"[3252]\r\n\r\nThe same apprehension exists in stouter souls, although there may have\r\nbeen, along with fear, motives of a less debased order.\r\n\r\n\"How many times,\" says Carnot,[3253] \"we undertook some work that\r\nrequired time, with the conviction that we should not be allowed to\r\ncomplete it!\"--\"It was uncertain[3254] whether, the next time the clock\r\nstruck the hour, we should not be standing before the revolutionary\r\nTribunal on our way to the scaffold without, perhaps, having had time to\r\nbid adieu to our families.... We pursued our daily task so as not to let\r\nthe machine stand still, as if a long life were before us, when it was\r\nprobable that we should not see the next day's sun.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to count on one's life, or that of another, for\r\ntwenty-four hours; should the iron hand which holds one by the throat\r\ntighten its grasp, all will be over that evening.\r\n\r\n\"There were certain days so difficult that one could see no way\r\nto control circumstances; those who were directly menaced resigned\r\nthemselves wholly to chance.\"[3255]--\"The decisions for which we are\r\nso much blamed,\" says another,[3256] \"were not generally thought of\r\ntwo days, or one day, beforehand; they sprung out of the crisis of the\r\nmoment. We did not desire to kill for the sake of killing... but to\r\nconquer at all hazards, remain masters, and ensure the sway of our\r\nprinciples.\"--That is true,--they are subjects as well as despots. At\r\nthe Committee table, during their nocturnal sessions, their sovereign\r\npresides, a formidable figure, the revolutionary Idea which confers on\r\nthem the right to slay, on condition of exercising it against everybody,\r\nand therefore on themselves. Towards two o'clock, or three o'clock in\r\nthe morning, exhausted, out of words and ideas, not knowing where to\r\nslay, on the right or on the left, they anxiously turn to this figure\r\nand try to read its will in its fixed eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Who shall fall to-morrow?\"--\r\n\r\nEver the same reply steadily expressed on the features of the impassable\r\nphantom: \"the counter-revolutionaries,\" under which name is comprised\r\nall who by act, speech, thought or inmost sentiment, either through\r\nirritation or carelessness, through humanity or moderation, through\r\negoism or nonchalance, through passive, neutral or indifferent feeling,\r\nserve well or ill the Revolution.[3257]--All that remains is to add\r\nnames to this horribly comprehensive decree. Shall Billaud do it?\r\nShall Robespierre do it? Will Billaud put down Robespierre's name, or\r\nRobespierre put down Billaud's, or each the name of the other, with\r\nthose he chooses to select from among the two Committees? Osselin,\r\nChabot, Bazire, Julien de Toulouse, Lacroix, Danton, were on them, and\r\nwhen they left, their heads fell.[3258] Hérault-Séchelles, again, was on\r\nthem, maintained in office with honor through the recent approbation\r\nof the Convention,[3259] one of the titular twelve, and on duty when\r\nan order issued by the other eleven suddenly handed him over to the\r\nrevolutionary Tribunal for execution.--Whose turn is it now among the\r\neleven? Seized unawares, the docile Convention unanimously applauding,\r\nafter three days of a judicial farce, the cart will bear him to the\r\nPlace de la Révolution; Samson will tie him fast, shouters at thirty\r\nsous a day will clap their hands, and, on the following morning, the\r\npopular politicians will congratulate each other on seeing the name of a\r\ngreat traitor on the bulletin of the guillotined.[3260] To this end, to\r\nenable this or that king of the day to pass from the national Almanac\r\nto the mortuary list, merely required an understanding among his\r\ncolleagues, and, perhaps, this is already arrived at. Among whom and\r\nagainst whom?--It is certain that, as this idea occurs to the eleven,\r\nseated around the table, they eye each other with a shudder they\r\ncalculate the chances and turn things over in their minds; words have\r\nbeen uttered that are not forgotten. Carnot often made this\r\ncharge against Saint-Just: \"You and Robespierre are after a\r\ndictatorship.\"[3261] Robespierre replied to Carnot: \"I am ready for you\r\non the first defeat.\"[3262] On another occasion, Robespierre, in a rage,\r\nexclaimed: \"The Committee is conspiring against me!\" and, turning to\r\nBillaud, \"I know you, now!\" Billaud retorted, \"I know you too, you are\r\na counter-revolutionary!\"[3263] There are conspirators and\r\ncounter-revolutionaries, then, on the committee itself; what can be done\r\nto avoid this appellation, which is a sentence of death?--Silently, the\r\nfatal phantom enthroned in their midst, the Erinyes[3264] through which\r\nthey rule, renders his oracle and all take it to heart:\r\n\r\n\"All who are unwilling to become executioners are conspirators and\r\ncounter-revolutionaries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Official Jacobin organs.\r\n\r\n     Official Jacobin organs.--Reports by Saint-Just are Barère.\r\n     --Quality of reports and reporters.\r\n\r\nThus do they march along during twelve months, goaded on by the two\r\nsharp thongs of theory and fear, traversing the red pool which they have\r\ncreated, and which is daily becoming deeper and deeper, all together\r\nand united, neither of them daring to separate from the group, and each\r\nspattered with the blood thrown in his face by the others' feet. It is\r\nnot long before their eyesight fails them; they no longer see their\r\nway, while the degradation of their language betrays the stupor of\r\ntheir intellect.--When a government brings to the tribune and moves the\r\nenactment of important laws, it confronts the nation, faces Europe,\r\nand takes a historical position. If it cares for its own honor it will\r\nselect reporters of bills that are not unworthy, and instruct them\r\nto support these with available arguments, as closely reasoned out as\r\npossible; the bill, discussed and adopted in full council, will show\r\nthe measure of its capacity, the information it possesses and its\r\ncommon-sense.\r\n\r\nTo estimate all this, read the bills put forth in the name of the\r\nCommittee; weigh the preambles, remark the tone, listen to the\r\ntwo reporters usually chosen, Saint-Just, who draws up the acts of\r\nproscription, special or general, and Barère, who draws up all acts\r\nindifferently, but particularly military announcements and decrees\r\nagainst the foreigner; never did public personages, addressing France\r\nand posterity, use such irrational arguments and state falsehoods with\r\ngreater impudence.[3265]\r\n\r\nThe former, stiff in his starched cravat, posing \"like the Holy Ghost,\"\r\nmore didactic and more absolute than Robespierre himself, comes and\r\nproclaims to Frenchmen from the tribune, equality, probity, frugality,\r\nSpartan habits, and a rural cot with all the voluptuousness of\r\nvirtue;[3266] this suits admirably the chevalier Saint-Just, a former\r\napplicant for a place in the Count d'Artois' body-guard, a domestic\r\nthief, a purloiner of silver plate which he takes to Paris, sells and\r\nspends on prostitutes, imprisoned for six months on complaint of his own\r\nmother,[3267] and author of a lewd poem which he succeeds in rendering\r\nfilthy by trying to render it fanciful.--Now, indeed, he is grave; he no\r\nlonger leers; he kills--but with what arguments, and what a style![3268]\r\nThe young Laubardemont as well as the paid informers and prosecutors\r\nof imperial Rome, have less disgraced the human intellect, for these\r\ncreatures of a Tiberius or a Richelieu still used plausible arguments\r\nin their reasoning, and with more or less adroitness. With Saint-Just,\r\nthere is no connection of ideas; there is no sequence or march in his\r\nrhapsody; like an instrument strained to the utmost, his mind plays only\r\nfalse notes in violent fits and starts; logical continuity, the art then\r\nso common of regularly developing a theme, has disappeared; he stumbles\r\nover the ground, piling up telling aphorisms and dogmatic axioms. In\r\ndealing with facts there is nothing in his speech but a perversion\r\nof the truth; impostures abound in it of pure invention, palpable, as\r\nbrazen as those of a charlatan in his booth;[3269] he does not\r\neven deign to disguise them with a shadow of probability; as to\r\nthe Girondists, and as to Danton, Fabre d'Eglantine and his other\r\nadversaries, whoever they may be, old or new, any rope to hang them with\r\nsuffices for him; any rough, knotted, badly-twisted cord he can lay his\r\nhands on, no matter what, provided it strangles, is good enough; there\r\nis no need of a finer one for confirmed conspirators; with the gossip\r\nof the club and an Inquisition catechism, he can frame his bill of\r\nindictment.--Accordingly, his intellect grasps nothing and yields him\r\nnothing; he is a sententious and overexcited declaimer, an artificial\r\nspirit always on the stretch, full of affectations,[3270] his talent\r\nreducing itself down to the rare flashes of a somber imagination, a\r\npupil of Robespierre, as Robespierre himself is a pupil of Rousseau, the\r\nexaggerated scholar of a plodding scholar, always rabidly ultra,\r\nfurious through calculation, deliberately violating both language and\r\nideas,[3271] confining himself to theatrical and funereal paradoxes, a\r\nsort of \"grand vizier\"[3272] with the airs of an exalted moralist and\r\nthe bearing of the sentimental shepherd.[3273] Were one of a mocking\r\nhumor one might shrug one's shoulders; but, in the present state of\r\nthe Convention, there is no room for anything but fear. Launched in\r\nimperious tones, his phrases fall upon their ears in monotonous strokes,\r\non bowed heads, and, after five or six blows from this leaden hammer,\r\nthe stoutest are stretched out stupefied on the ground; discussion is\r\nout of the question; when Saint-Just, in the name of the Convention,\r\naffirms anything, it must be believed; his dissertation is a peremptory\r\ninjunction and not an effort of reason; it commands obedience; it is\r\nnot open to examination; it is not a report which he draws from his coat\r\npocket, but a bludgeon.\r\n\r\nThe other reporter, Barère, is of quite another stamp, a \"patent-right\"\r\nharanguer, an amusing Gascon, alert, \"free and easy,\" fond of a joke,\r\neven on the Committee of Public Safety,[3274] unconcerned in the midst\r\nof assassinations, and, to the very last, speaking of the reign of\r\nTerror as \"the simplest and most innocent thing in the world.\"[3275] No\r\nman was ever less trammeled by a conscience; in truth, he has several,\r\nthat of two days ago, that of the previous day, that of the present day,\r\nthat of the morrow, of the following day, and still others, as many as\r\nyou like, all equally pliant and supple, at the service of the strongest\r\nagainst the weakest, ready to swing round at once on the wind changing,\r\nbut all joined together and working to one common end through physical\r\ninstinct, the only one that lasts in the immoral, adroit and\r\nvolatile being who circulates nimbly about, with no other aim than\r\nself-preservation, and to amuse himself.[3276]--In his dressing-gown,\r\nearly in the morning, he receives a crowd of solicitors, and, with the\r\nways of a \"dandified minister,\" graciously accepts the petitions handed\r\nto him; first, those of ladies, \"distributing gallantries among the\r\nprettiest;\" he makes promises, and smiles, and then, returning to\r\nhis cabinet, throws the papers in the fire: \"There,\" he says, my\r\ncorrespondence is done.\"--He sups twice every decade in his fine house\r\nat Clichy, along with three more than accommodating pretty women; he\r\nis gay, awarding flatteries and attentions quite becoming to an amiable\r\nprotector: he enters into their professional rivalries, their spites\r\nagainst the reigning beauty, their jealousy of another who wears a\r\nblonde wig and pretends \"to set the fashion.\" He sends immediately\r\nfor the National Agent and gravely informs him that this\r\nhead-dress, borrowed from the guillotined, is a rallying point for\r\nanti-revolutionaries, whereupon, the next day, wigs are denounced at\r\nthe Commune-council, and suppressed; \"Barère roared with laughter on\r\nalluding to this piece of fun.\" The humor of an undertaker and the\r\ndexterity of a commercial drummer: he plays with Terror.--In like manner\r\nhe plays with his reports, and at this latter exercise, he improvises;\r\nhe is never embarrassed; it is simply necessary to turn the faucet and\r\nthe water runs. \"Had he any subject to treat, he would fasten himself on\r\nRobespierre, Hérault, Saint-Just, or somebody else, and draw them out;\r\nhe would then rush off to the tribune and spin out their ideas; \"they\r\nwere all astonished at hearing their thoughts expressed as fully as\r\nif reflected in a mirror.\" No individual on the Committee, or in the\r\nConvention, equaled him in promptness and fluency, for the reason that\r\nhe was not obliged to think before he spoke: with him, the faculty of\r\nspeaking, like an independent organ, acted by itself, the empty brain\r\nor indifferent heart contributing nothing to his loquacity. Naturally,\r\nwhatever issues from his mouth comes forth in ready-made bombast, the\r\ncurrent jargon of the Jacobin club, sonorous, nauseous commonplace,\r\nschoolboy metaphors and similes derived from the shambles.[3277] Not\r\nan idea is found in all this rhetoric, nothing acquired, no real mental\r\napplication. When Bonaparte, who employed everybody, even Fouché, were\r\ndisposed to employ Barère, they could make nothing out of him for lack\r\nof substance, except as a low newsmonger, common spy, or agent engaged\r\nto stir up surviving Jacobins; later on, a listener at keyholes, and\r\na paid weekly collector of public rumors, he was not even fit for this\r\nvile service, for his wages were soon stopped Napoleon, who, having no\r\ntime to waste, cut short his driveling verbiage.--It is this verbiage\r\nwhich, authorized by the Committee of Public Safety, now forms the\r\neloquence of France; it is this manufacturer of phrases by the dozen,\r\nthis future informer and prison-spy under the empire, this frolicking\r\ninventor of the blonde-wig conspiracy, that the government sends into\r\nthe tribune to announce victories, trumpet forth military heroism and\r\nproclaim war unto death. On the 7th of Prairial,[3278] Barère, in the\r\nname of the committee, proposes a return to savage law: \"No English or\r\nHanoverian prisoner shall henceforth be made;\" the decree is endorsed by\r\nCarnot and passes the Convention unanimously. Had it been executed, as\r\nreprisals, and according to the proportion of prisoners, there would\r\nhave been for one Englishman shot, three Frenchmen hung: honor and\r\nhumanity would have disappeared from the camps; the hostilities between\r\nChristians would have become as deadly as among savages. Happily, French\r\nsoldiers felt the nobleness of their profession; on the order being\r\ngiven to shoot the prisoners, a decent sergeant replied:\r\n\r\n\"We will not shoot--send them to the Convention. If the representatives\r\ndelight in killing prisoners--let them do it themselves, and eat them,\r\ntoo, savages as they are!\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, an ordinary man, is not on a level with the Committee,\r\nor with Barère; and yet Barère did his best in a bill of indictment of\r\ntwenty-seven pages, full of grand flourishes, every possible ritornello,\r\nglaring falsehood and silly inflation, explaining how \"the Britannic\r\nleopard\" paid assassins to murder the representatives; how the London\r\ncabinet had armed little Cécile Renault, \"the new Corday,\" against\r\nRobespierre; how the Englishman, naturally barbarous, \"is unable to deny\r\nhis origins; how he descends from the Carthaginians and Phenicians, and\r\nformerly dealt in the skins of wild beasts and slaves; how his trading\r\noccupation is not changed; how Cesar, formerly, on landing in the\r\ncountry, found nothing but a ferocious tribe battling with wolves in\r\nthe forest and threatening to burn every vessel which would try to land\r\nthere; and how he still remains like that.\" A lecture from a fairground\r\nsurgeon who, using bombastic words, recommends extensive amputations,\r\na fairground-prospectus so crude that it does not even deceive a poor\r\nsergeant,--such is the exposition of motives by a government for the\r\npurpose of enforcing a decree that might have been drawn up by redskins;\r\nto horrible acts he adds debased language, and employs the inept to\r\njustify their atrocities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Commissars of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n     Representatives on Mission.--Their absolute power.--Their\r\n     perils and their fear.--Fit for their work.--Effect of this\r\n     situation.\r\n\r\nA hundred or so representatives of the Committee of Public Safety, are\r\nsent to the provinces, \"with unlimited power,\" to establish, enforce or\r\nexacerbate the revolutionary government, and their proclamations at\r\nonce explain the nature of this government.[3279]--\"Brave and vigorous\r\nsans-culottes!\" writes a deputy on leaving a mission and announcing\r\nhis successor,[3280] \"You seem to have desired a good b... of a\r\nrepresentative, who has never swerved from his principles, that is to\r\nsay, a regular Montagnard. I have fulfilled your wishes, and you will\r\nhave the same thing in citizen Ingrand. Remember, brave sans-culottes,\r\nthat, with the patriot Ingrand, you can do everything, get anything,\r\ncancel whatever you please, imprison, bring to trial, deport and\r\nguillotine every-body and regenerate society. Don't try to play with\r\nhim; everybody is afraid of him, he overcomes all resistance and\r\nrestores at once the most complete order!\"--The representative arrives\r\nat the center of the department by post, and presents his credentials.\r\nAll the authorities at once bow to the ground. In the evening, in his\r\nsaber and plume, he harangues the popular club, blowing into a flame\r\nthe smoldering embers of Jacobinism. Then, according to his personal\r\nacquaintances, if he has any in the place, or according to the votes of\r\nthe Committee of General Security, if he is a new-comer, he selects five\r\nor six of the \"warmest sans-culottes\" there, and, forming them into\r\na Revolutionary Committee, installs them permanently at his side,\r\nsometimes in the same building, in a room next to his own, where, on\r\nlists or with verbal communications furnished to him, he works with a\r\nwill and without stopping.[3281]\r\n\r\nFirst comes a purification of all the local authorities. They must\r\nalways remember that \"there can be no exaggeration in behalf of the\r\npeople; he who is not imbued with this principle, who has not put it in\r\npractice, cannot remain on an advanced post;\"[3282] consequently, at the\r\npopular club, in the department, in the district, in the municipality,\r\nall doubtful men are excluded, discharged, or incarcerated; if a few\r\nweak ones are retained provisionally, or by favor, they are berated and\r\ntaught their duty very summarily:\r\n\r\n\"They will strive, by a more energetic and assiduous patriotism, to\r\natone for the evil committed by them in not doing all the good they\r\ncould do.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, through a sudden change of scene, the entire administrative\r\nstaff is kicked out so as to give place to a no less complete staff,\r\nwhich the same kick brings up out of the ground. Considering that\r\n\"everything stagnates in Vaucluse, and that a frightful moderation\r\nparalyses the most revolutionary measures,\" Maignet, in one order[3283]\r\nappoints the administrators and secretary of the department, the\r\nnational agent, the administrators and council-general of the district,\r\nthe administrators, council-general and national agent of Avignon, the\r\npresident, public prosecutor and recorder of the criminal court,\r\nmembers of the Tribunal de Commerce, the collector of the district, the\r\npost-master and the head of the squadron of gendarmerie. And the new\r\nfunctionaries will certainly go to work at once, each in his office.\r\nThe summary process, which has brusquely swept away the first set of\r\npuppets, is going to brusquely install the second one. \"Each citizen\r\nappointed to any of the above mentioned offices, shall betake himself\r\nimmediately to his post, under penalty of being declared suspect,\"\r\non the simple notification of his appointment. Universal and passive\r\nobedience of governors, as well as of the governed! There are no more\r\nelected and independent functionaries; all the authorities, confirmed or\r\ncreated by the representative, are in his hands; there is not one among\r\nthem who does not subsist or survive solely through his favor; there is\r\nnot one of them who acts otherwise than according to his approval or\r\nby his order. Directly, or through them, he makes requisitions,\r\nsequestrates or confiscates as he sees fit, taxes, imprisons, transports\r\nor decapitates as he see fit, and, in his circumscription, he is the\r\npasha.\r\n\r\nBut he is a pasha with a chain around his neck, and at short\r\ntether.--From and after December, 1793, he is directed \"to conform to\r\nthe orders of the Committee of Public Safety and report to it every\r\nten days.\"[3284] The circumscription in which he commands is\r\nrigorously \"limited;\" \"he is reputed to be without power in the other\r\ndepartments,\"[3285] while he is not allowed to grow old on his post. \"In\r\nevery magistrature the grandeur and extent of power is compensated by\r\nthe shortness of its duration. Over-prolonged missions would soon be\r\nconsidered as birthrights.\"[3286] Therefore, at the end of two or three\r\nmonths, often at the end of a month, the incumbent is recalled to Paris\r\nor dispatched elsewhere, at short notice, on the day named, in a prompt,\r\nabsolute and sometimes threatening tone, not as a colleague one\r\nhumors, but as a subordinate who is suddenly and arbitrarily revoked\r\nor displaced because he is deemed inadequate, or \"used up.\" For greater\r\nsecurity, oftentimes a member of the Committee, Couthon, Collot,\r\nSaint-Just, or some near relation of a member of the Committee, a Lebas\r\nor young Robespierre, goes personally to the spot to give the needed\r\nimpulsion; sometimes, agents simply of the Committee, taken from outside\r\nthe Convention, and without any personal standing, quite young men,\r\nRousselin, Julien de la Drôme, replace or watch the representative\r\nwith powers equal to his.--At the same time, from the top and from the\r\ncenter, he is pushed on and directed: his local counselors are chosen\r\nfor him, and the directors of his conscience;[3287] they rate him\r\nsoundly on the choice of his agents or of his lodgings;[3288] they force\r\ndismissals on him, appointments, arrests, executions; they spur him\r\non in the path of terror and suffering.--Around him are paid\r\nemissaries,[3289] while others watch him gratis and constantly write to\r\nthe Committees of Public Safety and General Security, often to denounce\r\nhim, always to report on his conduct, to judge his measures and to\r\nprovoke the measures which he does not take.[3290]\r\n\r\nWhatever he may have done or may do, he cannot turn his eyes toward\r\nParis without seeing danger ahead, a mortal danger which, on the\r\nCommittee, in the Convention, at the Jacobin Club, increases or will\r\nincrease against him, like a tempest.--Briez, who, in Valenciennes under\r\nsiege, showed courage, and whom the Convention had just applauded and\r\nadded to the Committee of Public Safety, hears himself reproached for\r\nbeing still alive: \"He who was at Valenciennes when the enemy took it\r\nwill never reply to this question--are you dead?\"[3291] He has nothing\r\nto do now but to declare himself incompetent, decline the\r\nhonor mistakenly conferred on him by the Convention, and\r\ndisappear.--Dubois-Crancé took Lyons, and, as pay for this immense\r\nservice, he is stricken off the roll of the Jacobin Club; because he did\r\nnot take it quick enough, he is accused of treachery; two days after the\r\ncapitulation, the Committee of Public Safety withdraw his powers; three\r\ndays after the capitulation, the Committee of Public Safety has him\r\narrested and sent to Paris under escort.[3292]--If such men after such\r\nservices are thus treated, what is to become of the others? After the\r\nmission of young Julien, then Carrier at Nantes, Ysabeau and Tallien at\r\nBordeaux, feel their heads shake on their shoulders; after the mission\r\nof Robespierre jr. in the East and South, Barras, Fréron and Bernard de\r\nSaintes believe themselves lost.[3293] Fouché, Rovère, Javogue, and how\r\nmany others, compromised by the faction, Hébertists or Dantonists, of\r\nwhich they are, or were belonging. Sure of perishing if their patrons\r\non the Committee succumb; not sure of living if their patrons keep their\r\nplace; not knowing whether their heads will not be exchanged for\r\nothers; restricted to the narrowest, the most rigorous and most constant\r\northodoxy; guilty and condemned should their orthodoxy of to-day become\r\nthe heterodoxy of to-morrow. All of them menaced, at first the hundred\r\nand eighty autocrats who, before the concentration of the revolutionary\r\ngovernment, ruled for eight months boundlessly in the provinces;\r\nnext, and above all, the fifty hard-fisted \"Montagnards,\" unscrupulous\r\nfanatics or authoritarian high livers, who, at this moment, tread human\r\nflesh under foot and spread out in arbitrariness like wild boars in a\r\nforest, or wallow in scandal, like swine in a mud-pool.\r\n\r\nThere is no refuge for them, other than temporary, and temporary refuge\r\nonly in zealous and tried obedience, such as the Committee demands proof\r\nof, that is to say, through rigor.--\"The Committees so wanted it,\"\r\nsays later on Maignet, the arsonist of Bédouin; \"The Committees did\r\neverything..... Circumstances controlled me. ... The patriotic agents\r\nconjured me not to give way.... I did not fully carry out the most\r\nimperative orders.\"[3294] Similarly, the great exterminator of Nantes,\r\nCarrier, when urged to spare the rebels who surrendered of their own\r\naccord:\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me to be guillotined? It is not in my power to save those\r\npeople.\"[3295]\r\n\r\nAnd another time:\r\n\r\n\"I have my orders; I must observe them; I do not want to have my head\r\ncut off!\"\r\n\r\nUnder penalty of death, the representative on mission is a Terrorist,\r\nlike his colleagues in the Convention and on the Committee of Public\r\nSafety, but with a much more serious disturbance of his nervous and his\r\nmoral system; for he does not operate like them on paper, at a distance,\r\nagainst categories of abstract, anonymous and vague beings; his work is\r\nnot merely an effort of the intellect, but also of the senses and the\r\nimagination. If he belongs to the region, like Lecarpentier, Barras,\r\nLebon, Javogue, Couthon, André Dumont and many others, he is well\r\nacquainted with the families he proscribes; names to him are not merely\r\nso many letters strung together, but they recall personal souvenirs\r\nand evoke living forms. At all events, he is the spectator, artisan\r\nand beneficiary of his own dictatorship; the silver-plate and money\r\nhe confiscates passes under his eye, through his hands; he sees the\r\n\"suspects\" he incarcerates march before him; he is in the court-room on\r\nthe rendering of the sentence of death; frequently, the guillotine\r\nhe has supplied with heads works under his windows; he sleeps in the\r\nmansion of an emigré he makes requisitions for the furniture, linen\r\nand wine belonging to the decapitated and the imprisoned,[3296] lies in\r\ntheir beds, drinks their wine and revels with plenty of company at\r\ntheir expense, and in their place. In the same way as a bandit chief who\r\nneither kills nor robs with his own hands, but has murder and robbery\r\ncommitted in his presence, by which he substantially profits, not\r\nby proxy, but personally, through the well-directed blows ordered\r\nby him.--To this degree, and in such proximity to physical action,\r\nomnipotence is a noxious atmosphere which no state of health can resist.\r\nRestored to the conditions which poisoned man in barbarous times or\r\ncountries, he is again attacked by moral maladies from which he was\r\nthenceforth believed to be exempt; he retrogrades even to the strange\r\ncorruptions of the Orient and the Middle Ages; forgotten leprosies,\r\napparently extinct, with exotic pestilences to which civilized lands\r\nseemed closed, reappear in his soul with their issues and tumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Brutal Instincts.\r\n\r\n     Eruption of brutal instincts.--Duquesnoy at Metz.--Dumont at\r\n     Amiens.--Drunkards.--Cusset, Bourbotte, Moustier, Bourdon de\r\n     l'Oise, Dartigoyte.\r\n\r\n\"It seems,\" says a witness who was long acquainted with Maignet, \"that\r\nall he did for these five or six years was simply the delirious phase\r\nof an illness, after which he recovered, and lived on as if nothing had\r\nhappened.\"[3297] And Maignet himself writes \"I was not made for these\r\ntempests.\" That goes for everyone but especially for the coarser\r\nnatures; subordination would have restrained them while dictatorial\r\npower make the instincts of the brute and the mob appear.\r\n\r\nContemplate Duquesnoy, a sort of mastiff, always barking and biting,\r\nwhen gorged he is even more furious. Delegate to the army of the\r\nMoselle, and passing by Metz[3298] he summoned before him Altmayer, the\r\npublic prosecutor, although he had sat down to dinner. The latter waits\r\nthree hours and a half in the ante-chamber, is not admitted, returns,\r\nand, at length received, is greeted with a thundering exclamation:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The public prosecutor,\" he replies.\r\n\r\n\"You look like a bishop--you were once a curé or monk--you can't be\r\na revolutionary.... I have come to Metz with unlimited powers. Public\r\nopinion here is not satisfactory. I am going to drill it. I am going to\r\nset folks straight here. I mean to shoot, here in Metz, as well as in\r\nNancy, five or six hundred every fortnight.\"\r\n\r\nThe same at the house of General Bessières, commandant of the town\r\nencountering there M. Cledat, an old officer, the second in command, he\r\nmeasures him from head to foot:\r\n\r\n\"You look like a muscadin. Where did you come from? You must be a bad\r\nrepublican--you look as if you belonged to the ancient régime.\"\r\n\r\n\"My hair is gray,\" he responds, \"but I am not the less a good\r\nrepublican: you may ask the General and the whole town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be off! Go to the devil, and be quick about it, or I will have you\r\narrested!\"--\r\n\r\nThe same, in the street, where he lays hold of a man passing, on account\r\nof his looks; the justice of the peace, Joly, certifies to the civism of\r\nthis person, and he \"eyes\" Joly:\r\n\r\n\"You too, you are an aristocrat! I see it in your eyes! I never make a\r\nmistake.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, tearing off the Judge's badge, he sends him to\r\nprison.--Meanwhile, a fire, soon extinguished, breaks out in the army\r\nbakery; officers, townspeople, laborers, peasants and even children form\r\na line (for passing water) and Duquesnoy appears to urge them on in his\r\nway: using his fists and his foot, he falls on whoever he meets, on an\r\nemployee in the commissariat, on a convalescent officer, on two men\r\nin the line, and many others. He shouts to one of them, \"You are a\r\nmuscadin!\" To another:\r\n\r\n\"I see by your eyes that you are an aristocrat!\"\r\n\r\nTo another:\r\n\r\n\"You are a bloody beggar, an aristocrat, a rascal,\"\r\n\r\nand he strikes him in the stomach; he seizes a fourth by his collar\r\nand throws him down on the pavement.[3299] In addition to this, all are\r\nimprisoned. The fire being extinguished, an indiscreet fellow, who\r\nstood by looking on, recommends \"the dispenser of blows\" to wipe his\r\nforehead.\" \"You can't see straight--who are you? Answer me, I am the\r\nrepresentative.\" The other replies mildly: \"Representative, nothing\r\ncould be more respectable.\" Duquesnoy gives the unlucky courtier a\r\nblow under the nose: \"You are disputing--go to prison,\" \"which I did\r\nat once,\" adds the docile subject.--That same evening, \"whereas, in the\r\nconflagration, none of the inhabitants in good circumstances offered\r\ntheir services in extinguishing the fire,[32100] and none but\r\nsans-culottes came thereto, from the garrison as well as from the\r\ncommune,\" Duquesnoy orders \"that a tax of 40,000 livres be imposed on\r\nthe commune of Metz, levied on the fortunes of the rich and distributed\r\namong the poor, payable within ten days.\"[32101]--\"Fais-moi f.... dedans\r\ntous ces b... là[32102],\" \"quatre j...f... à raccourcir;\"[32103] At\r\nArras, as at Metz, the lout is ever the ruffian and the butcher.\r\n\r\nOthers are either jolly fellows, or blackguards. A certain André Dumont,\r\nan old village attorney, now king of Picardie, or sultan, as occasion\r\noffers, \"figures as a white Negro,\" sometimes jovial, but generally as\r\na rude hardened cynic, treating female prisoners and petitioners as in\r\na kermesse.[32104]--One morning a lady enters his ante-room, and\r\nwaits amidst about twenty sans-culottes, to solicit the release of her\r\nhusband. Dumont appears in a morning-gown, seats himself and listens to\r\nthe petitioner.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, citoyenne.\"\r\n\r\nHe takes her on his lap, thrusts his hand in her bosom and exclaims:\r\n\r\n\"Who would suppose that the bust of a marchioness would feel so soft to\r\none of the people's representatives.\"\r\n\r\nThe sans-culottes shout with laughter. He sends the poor woman away\r\nand keeps her husband locked up. In the evening he may write to the\r\nConvention that he investigates things himself, and closely examines\r\naristocrats.--If one is to maintain the revolutionary enthusiasm at a\r\nhigh level it is helpful to have a drop too much in one's head, and\r\nmost of them take precautions in this direction. At Lyons,[32105]\r\n\"the representatives sent to ensure the people's welfare, Albitte and\r\nCollot,\" call upon the Committee of Sequestrations to deliver at their\r\nhouse two hundred bottles of the best wine to be found, and five hundred\r\nbottles more of Bordeaux red wine, first quality, for table use.--In\r\nthree months, at the table of the representatives who devastate\r\nla Vendée, nineteen hundred and seventy-four bottles of wine are\r\nemptied,[32106] taken from the houses of the emigrés belonging to the\r\ntown; for, \"when one has helped to preserve a commune one has a right to\r\ndrink to the Republic.\" Representative Bourbotte presides at this\r\nbar; Rossignol touches his glass, an ex-jeweler and then a September\r\nmassacreur, all his life a debauchee and brigand, and now a\r\nmajor-general; alongside of Rossignol, stand his adjutants, Grammont, an\r\nold actor, and Hazard, a former priest; along with them is Vacheron, a\r\ngood républican, who ravishes women and shoots them when they refuse to\r\nsuccumb;[32107] in addition to these are some \"brilliant\" young ladies,\r\nundoubtedly brought from Paris, \"the prettiest of whom share their\r\nnights between Rossignol and Bourbotte,\" whilst the others serve their\r\nsubordinates: the entire band, male and female, is installed in a\r\nHotel de Fontenay, where they begin by breaking the seals, so as t o\r\nconfiscate \"for their own benefit, furniture, jewelry, dresses,\r\nfeminine trinkets and even porcelains.\"[32108] Meanwhile, at Chantonney,\r\nrepresentative Bourdon de l'Oise drinks with General Tunck, becomes\r\n\"frantic\" when tipsy, and has patriotic administrators seized in their\r\nbeds at midnight, whom he had embraced the evening before.--Nearly all\r\nof them, like the latter, get nasty after a few drinks,--Carrier at\r\nNantes, Petit-Jean at Thiers, Duquesnoy at Arras, Cusset at Thionville,\r\nMonestier at Tarbes. At Thionville, Cusset drinks like a \"Lapithe\"\r\nand, when drunk, gives the orders of a \"vizier,\" which orders are\r\nexecuted.[32109] At Tarbes, Monestier \"after a heavy meal and much\r\nexcited,\" warmly harangues the court, personally examines the prisoner,\r\nM. de Lasalle, an old officer, whom he has condemned to death, and signs\r\nthe order to have him guillotined at once. M. de Lasalle is guillotined\r\nthat very evening, at midnight, by torchlight. The following morning\r\nMonestier says to the president of the court: \"Well, we gave poor\r\nLasalle a famous fright last night, didn't we?\" \"How a famous fright? He\r\nis executed!\" Monestier is astonished--he did not remember having issued\r\nthe order.[32110]--With others, wine, besides sanguinary instincts,\r\nbrings out the foulest instincts. At Nîmes; Borie, in the uniform of a\r\nrepresentative, along with Courbis, the mayor, Géret, the justice and\r\na number of prostitutes, dance the farandole around the guillotine. At\r\nAuch, one of the worst tyrants in the South, Dartigoyte, always heated\r\nwith liquor \"vomited every species of obscenity\" in the faces of women\r\nthat came to demand justice; \"he compels, under penalty of imprisonment,\r\nmothers to take their daughters to the popular club,\" to listen to his\r\nfilthy preaching; one evening, at the theatre, probably after an orgy,\r\nhe shouts at all the women between the acts, lets loose upon them his\r\nsmutty vocabulary, and, by way of demonstration, or as a practical\r\nconclusion, ends by stripping himself naked.[32111]--This time, the\r\ngenuine brute appears. All the clothing woven during the past centuries\r\nand with which civilization had dressed him, the last drapery of\r\nhumanity, falls to the ground. Nothing remains but the primitive animal,\r\nthe ferocious, lewd gorilla supposed to be tamed, but which still\r\nsubsists indefinitely and which a dictatorship, joined to drunkenness,\r\nrevives in an uglier guise than in remotest times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Delirium.\r\n\r\n     Approach of madness.--Loss of common-sense.--Fabre, Gaston,\r\n     Guiter, in the army of the Eastern Pyrenees.--Baudot, Lebas,\r\n     Saint-Just, and the predecessors and successors in the army\r\n     of the Rhine.--Furious excitement.--Lebon at Arras, and\r\n     Carrier at Nantes.\r\n\r\nIf intoxication is needed to awaken the brute, a dictatorship suffices\r\nto arouse the madman. The mental equilibrium of most of these new\r\nsovereigns is disturbed; the distance between what the man once was and\r\nwhat he now is, is too great. Formerly he was a petty lawyer, village\r\ndoctor, or schoolmaster, an unknown mover of a resolution in a local\r\nclub, and only yesterday he was one voter in the Convention out of\r\nseven hundred and fifty. Look at him now, the arbiter, in one of the\r\ndepartments, of all fortunes and liberties, and master of five thousand\r\nlives. Like a pair of scales into which a disproportionate weight has\r\nbeen thrown, his reason totters on the side of pride. Some of them\r\nregard their competency unlimited, like their powers, and having\r\njust joined the army, claim the right of being appointed\r\nmajor-generals.[32112] \"Declare officially,\" writes Fabre to the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety,[32113] \"that, in future, generals shall be\r\nsimply the lieutenants of the delegates to the Convention.\" Awaiting the\r\nrequired declaration, they claim command and, in reality, exercise it.\r\n\"I know of neither generals nor privates,\" says Gaston, a former justice\r\nof the peace, to the officers; \"as to the Minister, he is like a bull\r\nin a china shop; I am in command here and must be obeyed.\" \"What are\r\ngenerals good for?\" adds his colleague Guiter; \"the old women in our\r\nfaubourgs know as much as they do. Plans, formal maneuvers, tents,\r\ncamps, redoubts? All this is of no use! The only war suitable to\r\nFrenchmen after this will be a rush with side arms.\" To turn out\r\nof office, guillotine, disorganize, march blindly on, waste lives\r\nhaphazard, force defeat, sometimes get killed themselves, is all they\r\nknow, and they would lose all if the effects of their incapacity and\r\narrogance were not redeemed by the devotion of the officers and the\r\nenthusiasm of the soldiers.--The same spectacle is visible at Charleroy\r\nwhere, through his absurd orders, Saint-Just does his best to compromise\r\nthe army, leaving that place with the belief that he is a great\r\nman.[32114]--There is the same spectacle in Alsace, where Lacoste,\r\nBaudot, Ruamps, Soubrany, Muhaud, Saint-Just and Lebas, through their\r\nexcessive rigor, do their best to break up the army and then boast of\r\nit. The revolutionary Tribunal is installed at headquarters, soldiers\r\nare urged to denounce their officers, the informer is promised money and\r\nsecrecy, he and the accused are not allowed to confront each other,\r\nno investigation, no papers allowed, even to make exception to the\r\nverdict--a simple examination without any notes, the accused arrested\r\nat eight o'clock, condemned at nine o'clock, and shot at ten\r\no'clock.[32115]\r\n\r\nNaturally, under such a system, no one wants to command; already, before\r\nSaint Just's arrival, Meunier had consented to act as Major-General only\r\nad interim; \"every hour of the day\" he demanded his removal; unable\r\nto secure this, he refused to issue any order. The representatives, to\r\nprocure his successor, are obliged to descend down to a depot captain,\r\nCarlin, bold enough or stupid enough to allow himself to take\r\na commission under their lead, which was a commission for the\r\nguillotine.--If such is their presumption in military matters, what\r\nmust it be in civil affairs! On this side there is no external check,\r\nno Spanish or German army capable of at once taking them in flagrante\r\ndelicto, and of profiting by their ambitious incapacity and mischievous\r\ninterference. Whatever the social instrumentality may be--judiciary,\r\nadministration, credit, commerce, manufactures, agriculture--they can\r\ndislocate and destroy it with impunity.--They never fail to do this,\r\nand, moreover, in their dispatches, they take credit to themselves for\r\nthe ruin they cause. That, indeed, is their mission; otherwise, they\r\nwould be regarded as bad Jacobins; they would soon become \"suspects;\"\r\nthey rule only on condition of being infatuated and destructive;\r\nthe overthrow of common-sense is with them an act of State grace,\r\na necessity of the office, and, on this common ground of compulsory\r\nunreason, every species of physical delirium may be set established.\r\n\r\nWith those that we can follow closely, not only is their judgment\r\nperverted, but the entire nervous apparatus is affected; a permanent\r\nover-excitement and a morbid restlessness has begun.--Consider Joseph\r\nLebon, son of a sergeant-at-arms, subsequently, a teacher with the\r\nOratoriens of Beaune, next, curé of Neuville-Vitasse, repudiated as\r\nan interloper by the élite of his parishioners, not respected, without\r\nhouse or furniture, and almost without a flock.[32116] Two years after\r\nthis, finding himself sovereign of his province, his head is\r\nspinning. Lesser events would have made it turn; his is only a\r\ntwenty-eight-year-old head, not very solid, without any inside\r\nballast,[32117] already disturbed by vanity, ambition, rancor, and\r\napostasy, by the sudden and complete volteface which puts him in\r\nconflict with his past educational habits and most cherished affections:\r\nit breaks down under the vastness and novelty of this greatness.--In\r\nthe costume of a representative, a Henry IV hat, tri-color plume, waving\r\nscarf, and saber dragging the ground, Lebon orders the bell to be rung\r\nand summons the villagers into the church, where, aloft in the pulpit in\r\nwhich he had formerly preached in a threadbare cassock, he displays his\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\n\"Who would believe that I should have returned here with unlimited\r\npowers!\"[32118]\r\n\r\nAnd that, before his counterfeit majesty, each person would be humble,\r\nbowed down and silent! To a member of the municipality of Cambray who,\r\nquestioned by him, looked straight at him and answered curtly, and who,\r\nto a query twice repeated in the same terms, dared to answer twice in\r\nthe same terms, he says:\r\n\r\n\"Shut up! You disrespect me, you do not behave properly to the national\r\nrepresentative.\"\r\n\r\nHe immediately commits him to prison.[32119]--One evening, at the\r\ntheater, he enters a box in which the ladies, seated in front,\r\nkeep their places. In a rage, he goes out, rushes on the stage and,\r\nbrandishing his great saber, shouts and threatens the audience, taking\r\nimmense strides across the boards and acting and looking so much like a\r\nwild beast that several of the ladies faint away:\r\n\r\n\"Look there!\" he shouts, at those muscadines who do not condescend to\r\nmove for a representative of twenty-five millions of men! Everybody used\r\nto make way for a prince--they will not budge for me, a representative,\r\nwho am more than a king!\"[32120]\r\n\r\nThe word is spoken. But this king is frightened, and he is one who\r\nthinks of nothing but conspiracy;[32121] in the street, in open\r\ndaylight, the people who are passing him are plotting against him either\r\nby words or signs. Meeting in the main street of Arras a young girl and\r\nher mother talking Flemish,--that seems to him \"suspect.\" \"Where are you\r\ngoing?\" he demands. \"What's that to you?\" replies the child, who\r\ndoes not know him. The girl, the mother and the father are sent to\r\nprison.[32122]--On the ramparts, another young girl, accompanied by her\r\nmother, is taking the air, and reading a book. \"Give me that book,\" says\r\nthe representative. The mother hands it to him; it is the \"History of\r\nClarissa Harlowe.\" The young girl, extending her hand to receive back\r\nthe book, adds, undoubtedly with a smile: \"That is not 'suspect.'\" Lebon\r\ndeals her a blow with his fist on her stomach which knocks her\r\ndown; both women are searched and he personally leads them to the\r\nguard-room.--The slightest expression, a gesture, puts him beside\r\nhimself; any motion that he does not comprehend makes him start, as with\r\nan electric shock. Just arrived at Cambray, he is informed that a woman\r\nwho had sold a bottle of wine below the maximum, had been released after\r\na procès-verbal. On reaching the Hotel-de-ville, he shouts out: \"Let\r\neverybody here pass into the Consistory!\" The municipal officer on duty\r\nopens a door leading into it. Lebon, however, not knowing who he is,\r\ntakes alarm. \"He froths at the mouth,\" says the municipal officer, \"and\r\ncries out as if possessed by a demon. 'Stop, stop, scoundrel, you are\r\nrunning off!' He draws his saber and seizes me by the collar; I am\r\ndragged and borne along by him and his men. 'I have hold of him, I have\r\nhold of him!' he exclaims, and, indeed, he did hold me with his teeth,\r\nlegs, and arms, like a madman. At last, 'scoundrel, monster, bastard,'\r\nsays he, 'are you a marquis?' 'No,' I replied, 'I am a sans-culotte.'\r\n'Ah, well people, you hear what he says,' he exclaims, 'he says that he\r\nis a sans-culotte, and that is the way he greets a denunciation on\r\nthe maximum! I remove him. Let him be kicked in prison!'\"[32123] It\r\nis certain that the King of Arras and Cambray is not far from a raging\r\nfever; with such symptoms an ordinary individual would be sent to an\r\nasylum.\r\n\r\nNot so vain, less fond of parading his royalty, but more savage and\r\nplaced in Nantes amidst greater dangers, Carrier, under the pressure\r\nof more somber ideas, is much more furious and constant in his madness.\r\nSometimes his attacks reach hallucination. \"I have seen him,\" says a\r\nwitness, \"so carried away in the tribune, in the heat of his harangue\r\nwhen trying to overrule public opinion, as to cut off the tops of\r\nthe candles with his saber,\" as if they were so many aristocrats'\r\nheads.[32124] Another time, at table, after having declared that France\r\ncould not feed its too numerous population, and that it was decided to\r\ncut down the excess, all nobles, magistrates, priests, merchants, etc.,\r\nhe becomes excited and exclaims, \"Kill, kill!\" as if he were already\r\nengaged in the work and ordering the operation.[32125] Even when\r\nfasting, and in an ordinary condition, he is scarcely more cooled\r\ndown. When the administrators of the department come to consult with\r\nhim,[32126] they gather around the door to see if he looks enraged, and\r\nis in a condition to hear them. He not only insults petitioners, but\r\nlikewise the functionaries under him who make reports to him, or take\r\nhis orders; his foul nature rises to his lips and overflows in the\r\nvilest terms:\r\n\r\n\"Go to hell and be damned. I have no time.\"[32127]\r\n\r\nThey consider themselves lucky if they get off with a volley of obscene\r\noaths, for he generally draws his saber:\r\n\r\n\"The first bastard that mentions supplies, I will cut his head\r\noff.\"[32128]\r\n\r\nAnd to the president of the military commission, who demands that\r\nverdicts be rendered before ordering executions:\r\n\r\n\"You, you old rascal, you old bastard, you want verdicts, do you! Go\r\nahead! If the whole pen is not emptied in a couple of hours I will have\r\nyou and your colleagues shot!\"\r\n\r\nHis gestures, his look have such a powerful effect upon the mind\r\nthat the other, who is also a \"bruiser,\" dies of the shock a few days\r\nafter.[32129] Not only does he draw his saber, but he uses it; among the\r\npetitioners, a boatman, whom he is about to strike, runs off as fast as\r\nhe can; he draws General Moulins into the recess of a window and gives\r\nhim a cut.[32130]--People \"tremble\" on accosting him, and yet more in\r\ncontradicting him. The envoy of the Committee of Public Safety, Julien\r\nde la Drôme, on being brought before him, takes care to \"stand some\r\ndistance off, in a corner of the room,\" wisely trying to avoid the first\r\nspring; wiser still, he replies to Carrier's exclamations with the only\r\navailable argument:\r\n\r\n\"If you put me out of the way to-day, you yourself will be guillotined\r\nwithin a week!\"[32131]\r\n\r\nOn coming to a stand before a mad dog one must aim the knife straight\r\nat its throat; there is no other way to escape its fangs and slaver.\r\nAccordingly, with Carrier, as with a mad dog, the brain is mastered by\r\nthe steady mechanical reverie, by persistent images of murder and death.\r\nHe exclaims to President Tronjolly, apropos of the Vendean children:\r\n\r\n\"The guillotine, always the guillotine!\"[32132]\r\n\r\nIn relation to the drownings:\r\n\r\n\"You judges must have verdicts; pitch them into the water, which is much\r\nmore simple.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing the popular club of Nantes, he says:\r\n\r\n\"The rich, the merchants, are all monopolizers, all anti-revolutionists;\r\ndenounce them to me, and I will have all their heads under the national\r\nrazor. Tell me who the fanatics are that shut their shops on Sunday and\r\nI will have them guillotined.\" \"When will the heads of those rascally\r\nmerchants fall?\"--\"I see beggars here in rags; you are as big fools at\r\nAncenis as at Nantes. Don't you know that the money, the wealth of these\r\nold merchants, belongs to you, and is not the river there?\" \"My brave\r\nbastards, my good sansculottes your time is come! Denounce them to me!\r\nThe evidence of two good sans-culottes is all I want to make the heads\r\nof those old merchants tumble!\"--\"We will make France a grave-yard\r\nrather than not regenerate it in our own way.\"[32133]--His steady howl\r\nends in a cry of anguish:\r\n\r\n\"We shall all be guillotined, one after the other!\"[32134]--\r\n\r\nSuch is the mental state to which the office of representative on\r\nmission leads. Below Carrier, who is on the extreme verge, the others,\r\nless advanced, likewise turn pale at the lugubrious vision, which is the\r\ninevitable effect of their work and their mandate. Beyond every grave\r\nthey dig, they catch a glimpse of the grave already dug for them. There\r\nis nothing left for the gravedigger but to dig mechanically day after\r\nday, and, in the meantime, make what he can out of his place; he can at\r\nleast render himself insensible by having \"a good time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Vice.\r\n\r\n     The development of vice.--Vanity and the need of gambling.--\r\n     Collot d'Herbois, Ysabeau, Tallien.--The Robbers.--Tallien,\r\n     Javogues, Rovère, Fouché.--Two sources of cruelty.--Need of\r\n     demonstrating one's power.--Saint-Just in the Pas-de-Calais\r\n     department, and in Alsace.--Collot d'Herbois at Lyons.--\r\n     Pressure exercised by the Representatives on the tribunals.\r\n     --Pleasure caused by death and suffering.--Monestier, Fouché,\r\n     Collot d'Herbois, Lebon and Carrier.\r\n\r\nMost of them follow this course, some instinctively and through\r\nlassitude, and others because the display they make adds to their\r\nauthority. \"Dragged along in Carriages with six horses, surrounded by\r\nguards, seated at sumptuous tables set for thirty persons, eating to\r\nthe sound of music along with a Cortege of actors, courtesans and\r\npraetorians,\"[32135] they impress the imagination with an idea of their\r\nomnipotence, and people bow all the lower because they make a grand\r\nshow.--At Troyes, on the arrival of young Rousselin, cannon are\r\ndischarged as if for the entry of a prince. The entire population of\r\nNevers is called upon to honor the birth of Fouché's child; the civil\r\nand military authorities pay their respects to him, and the National\r\nGuards are under arms.[32136] At Lyons, \"The imposing display of Collot\r\nd'Herbois resembles that of the Grand Turk. It requires three successive\r\napplications to obtain an audience; nobody approaches nearer than a\r\ndistance of fifteen feet; two sentinels with muskets stand on each\r\nside of him, with their eyes fixed on the petitioners.\"[32137]--Less\r\nmenacing, but not less imposing, is the pomp which surrounds the\r\nrepresentatives at Bordeaux; to approach them, requires \"a pass from the\r\ncaptain of the guards,\"[32138] through several squads of sentinels.\r\nOne of them, Ysabeau, who, after having guillotined to a considerable\r\nextent, has become almost tractable, allows adulation, and, like a Duc\r\nde Richelieu coming down from Versailles, tries to play the popular\r\npotentate, with all the luxuries which the situation affords. At the\r\ntheaters, in his presence, they give a ballet in which shepherds form\r\nwith garlands of flowers the words \"Ysabeau, Liberty, Equality.\" He\r\nallows his portrait to pass from hand to hand, and condescendingly\r\nsmiles on the artist who inscribes these words at the bottom of\r\nan engraving of the day: \"An event which took place under Ysabeau,\r\nrepresentative of the people.\" \"When he passes in the street people take\r\noff their hats to him, cheer him, and shout 'Hurrah for Ysabeau! Hurrah\r\nfor the savior of Bordeaux, our friend and father!' The children of\r\naristocrats come and apostrophize him in this way, even at the doors\r\nof his carriage; for he has a Carriage, and several of them, with\r\na coachman, horses, and the equipage of a former noble, gendarmes\r\npreceding him everywhere, even on excursions into the country,\" where\r\nhis new courtiers call him \"great man,\" and welcome him with \"Asiatic\r\nmagnificence.\" There is good cheer at his table, \"superb white bread,\"\r\ncalled \"representatives' bread,\" whilst the country folk of the\r\nneighborhood live on roots, and the inhabitants of Bordeaux can scarcely\r\nobtain more than four ounces of musty bread per day.--There is the same\r\nfeasting with the representatives at Lyons, in the midst of similar\r\ndistress. In the reports made by Collot we find a list of bottles of\r\nbrandy at four francs each, along with partridges, capons, turkeys,\r\nchickens, pike, and crawfish, note also the white bread, the other kind,\r\ncalled \"equality bread,\" assigned to simple mortals, offends this august\r\npalate. Add to this the requisitions made by Albitte and Fouché, seven\r\nhundred bottles of fine wine, in one lot, another of fifty pounds\r\nof coffee, one hundred and sixty ells of muslin, three dozen silk\r\nhandkerchiefs for cravats, three dozen pairs of gloves, and four\r\ndozen pairs of stockings: they provide themselves with a good\r\nstock.[32139]--Among so many itinerant tyrants, the most audaciously\r\nsensual is, I believe, Tallien, the Septembriseur at Paris and\r\nguillotineur at Bordeaux, but still more rake and robber, caring mostly\r\nfor his palate and stomach. Son of the cook of a grand seignior, he is\r\ndoubtless swayed by family traditions: for his government is simply a\r\nlarder where, like the head-butler in \"Gil Blas,\" he can eat and turn\r\nthe rest into money. At this moment, his principal favorite is Teresa\r\nCabarrus, a woman of society, or one of the demi-monde, whom he took\r\nout of prison; he rides about the streets with her in an open carriage,\r\n\"with a courier behind and a courier in front,\" sometimes wearing the\r\nred cap and holding a pike in her hand,[32140] thus exhibiting his\r\ngoddess to the people. And this is the sentiment which does him the most\r\ncredit; for, when the crisis comes, the imminent peril of his mistress\r\narouses his courage against Robespierre, and this pretty\r\nwoman, who is good-natured, begs him, not for murders, but for\r\npardons.[32141]--Others, as gallant as he is, but with less taste,\r\nobtain recruits for their pleasures in a rude way, either as fast-livers\r\non the wing, or because fear subjects the honor of women to their\r\ncaprices, or because the public funds defray the expenses of their\r\nguard-room habits. At Blois, for this kind of expenditure, Guimberteau\r\ndischarges his obligations by drafts on the proceeds of the\r\nrevolutionary tax.[32142] Carrier, at Nantes, appropriates to himself\r\nthe house and garden of a private person for \"his seraglio\"; the reader\r\nmay judge whether, on desiring to be a third party in the household, the\r\nhusband would make objections. At other times, in the hotel Henry IV.,\r\n\"with his friends and prostitutes brought under requisition, he has an\r\norgy;\" he allows himself the same indulgence on the galiot during the\r\ndrownings; there at the end of a drunken frolic, he is regaled with\r\nmerry songs, for example, \"la gamelle\":[32143] he needs his amusements.\r\n\r\nSome, who are shrewd, think of the more substantial and look out for\r\nthe future. Foremost among these is Tallien, the king of robbers, but\r\nprodigal, whose pockets, full of holes, are only filled to be at once\r\nemptied; Javogues, who makes the most of Montbrison; Rovère, who, for\r\neighty thousand francs in assignats, has an estate adjudged to him worth\r\nfive hundred thousand francs in coin; Fouché, who, in Nièvre, begins to\r\namass the twelve or fourteen millions which he secures later on;[32144]\r\nand so many others, who were either ruined or impoverished previous to\r\nthe outbreak of the Revolution, and who are rich when it ends: Barras\r\nwith his domain of Gros Bois; André Dumont, with the Hotel de Plouy, its\r\nmagnificent furniture, and an estate worth four hundred thousand livres;\r\nMerlin de Thionville, with his country-houses, equipages, and domain\r\nof Mont-Valérien, and other domains; Salicetti, Reubell, Rousselin,\r\nChateauneuf-Randon, and the rest of the gluttonous and corrupted members\r\nof the Directory. Without mentioning the taxes and confiscations of\r\nwhich they render no account, they have, for their hoard, the ransoms\r\noffered underhandedly by \"suspects\" and their families; what is more\r\nconvenient?[32145] And all the more, because the Committee of General\r\nSecurity, even when informed, let things take their course: to prosecute\r\n\"Montagnards,\" would be \"making the Revolution take a step backward.\"\r\nOne is bound to humor useful servants who have such hard work, like\r\nthat of the September killings, to do. Irregularities, as with these\r\nSeptember people, must be overlooked; it is necessary to allow them a\r\nfew perquisites and give them gratuities.[32146]\r\n\r\nAll this would not suffice to keep them at work if they had not been\r\nheld by an even greater attraction.--To the common run of civilized\r\nmen, the office of Septembriseur is at first disagreeable; but, after a\r\nlittle practice, especially with a tyrannical nature, which, under cover\r\nof the theory, or under the pretext of public safety, can satiate its\r\ndespotic instincts, all repugnance subsides. There is keen delight in\r\nthe exercise of absolute power; one is glad, every hour, to assert one's\r\nomnipotence and prove it by some act, the most conclusive of all acts\r\nbeing some act of destruction. The more complete, radical and prompt\r\nthe destruction is, the more conscious one is of one's strength. However\r\ngreat the obstacle, one is not disposed to recede or stand still;\r\none breaks away all the barriers which men call good sense, humanity,\r\njustice, and the satisfaction of breaking them down is great. To crush\r\nand to subdue becomes voluptuous pleasure, to which pride gives keener\r\nrelish, affording a grateful incense of the holocaust which the despot\r\nconsumes on his own altar; at this daily sacrifice, he is both idol and\r\npriest, offering up victims to himself that he may be conscious of his\r\ndivinity.--Such is Saint-Just, all the more a despot because his title\r\nof representative on mission is supported by his rank on the Committee\r\nof Public Safety: to find natures strained to the same pitch as his, we\r\nmust leave the modern world and go back to a Caligula, or to a caliph\r\nHakem in Egypt in the tenth century.[32147] He also, like these two\r\nmonsters, but with different formulae, regards himself as a God, or\r\nGod's vicegerent on earth, invested with absolute power through Truth\r\nincarnated in him, the representative of a mysterious, limitless and\r\nsupreme power, known as the People; to worthily represent this power,\r\nit is essential to have a soul of steel.[32148] Such is the soul of\r\nSaint-Just, and only that. All other sentiments merely serve to harden\r\nit; all the metallic agencies that compose it--sensuality, vanity,\r\nevery vice, every species of ambition, all the frantic outbursts and\r\nmelancholy vaporings of his youth--are violently commingled and fused\r\ntogether in the revolutionary mold, so that his soul may take the form\r\nand rigidity of trenchant steel. Suppose this an animated blade, feeling\r\nand willing in conformity with its temper and structure; it would\r\ndelight in being brandished, and would need to strike; such is the need\r\nof Saint-Just. Taciturn, impassible, keeping people at a distance,\r\nas imperious as if the entire will of the people and the majesty of\r\ntranscendent reason resided in his person, he seems to have reduced his\r\npassions to the desire of dashing everything to atoms, and to creating\r\ndismay. It may be said of him that, like the conquering Tartars, he\r\nmeasures his self-attributed grandeur by what he fells; no other has so\r\nextensively swept away fortunes, liberties and lives; no other has so\r\nterrifically heightened the effect of his deeds by laconic speech and\r\nthe suddenness of the stroke. He orders the arrest and close confinement\r\nof all former nobles, men and women, in the four departments, in\r\ntwenty-four hours; he orders the bourgeoisie of Strasbourg to pay over\r\nnine millions in twenty-four hours; ten thousand persons in Strasbourg\r\nmust give up their shoes in twenty-four hours; random and immediate\r\ndischarges of musketry on the officers of the Rhine army--such are the\r\nmeasures.[32149] So much the worse for the innocent; there is no time\r\nto discern who they are; \"a blind man hunting for a pin in a dust-heap\r\ntakes the whole heap.\"[32150]--And, whatever the order, even when it\r\ncannot be executed, so much the worse for him to whom it is given, for\r\nthe captain who, directed by the representative to establish this or\r\nthat battery in a certain time, works all night with all his forces,\r\n\"with as many men as the place will hold.\"[32151] The battery not\r\nbeing ready at the hour named, Saint-Just sends the captain to the\r\nguillotine.--The sovereign having once given an order it cannot be\r\ncountermanded; to take back his words would be weakening himself;[32152]\r\nin the service of omnipotence, pride is insatiable, and, to mollify it,\r\nno barbaric act is too great.--The same appetite is visible in Collot\r\nd'Herbois, who, no longer on the stage, plays before the town the\r\nmelo-dramatic tyrant with all becoming ostentation. One morning, at\r\nLyons, he directs the revolutionary Tribunal to arrest, examine and\r\nsentence a youthful \"suspect\" before the day is over. \"Towards six\r\no'clock,[32153] Collot being at table enjoying an orgy with prostitutes,\r\nbuffoons and executioners, eating and drinking to choice music, one of\r\nthe judges of the Tribunal enters; after the usual formalities, he is\r\nled up to the Representative, and informs him that the young man had\r\nbeen arrested and examined, and the strictest inquiries made concerning\r\nhim; he is found irreproachable and the Court decided to set him free.\r\nCollot, without looking at the judge, raises his voice and says to him:\r\n\r\n\"I ordered you to punish that young man and I want him out of the way\r\nbefore night. If the innocent are spared, too many of the guilty will\r\nescape. Go.\"\r\n\r\nThe music and gaiety begin again, and in an hour the young man is\r\nshot.\"--And so in most of the other pachalics; if any head mentally\r\ncondemned by the pacha escapes or does not fall soon enough, the latter\r\nis indignant at the delays and forms of justice, also against the judges\r\nand juries, often selected by himself. Javogues writes an insulting\r\nletter to the commission of Feurs which has dared acquit two former\r\nnobles. Laignelot, Lecarpentier, Michaud, Monestier, Lebon, dismiss,\r\nrecompose, or replace the commissions of Fontenoy, Saint-Malo, and\r\nPerpignan, and the tribunals of Pau, Nîmes, and Arras, whose judgments\r\ndid not please them.[32154] Lebon, Bernard de Saintes, Dartigoyte and\r\nFouché re-arrest prisoners on the same charge, solemnly acquitted by\r\ntheir own tribunals. Bô, Prieur de la Marne, and Lebon, send judges and\r\njuries to prison that do not always vote death.[32155] Barras and Fréron\r\ndispatch, from brigade to brigade, to the revolutionary Tribunal in\r\nParis, the public prosecutor and president of the revolutionary Tribunal\r\nof Marseilles, for being indulgent to anti-revolutionaries, because, out\r\nof five hundred and twenty-eight prisoners, they guillotined only\r\none hundred and sixty-two.[32156]--To contradict the infallible\r\nRepresentative! That of itself is an offense. He owes it to himself to\r\npunish those who are not docile, to re-arrest absolved delinquents, and\r\nto support cruelty with cruelty.\r\n\r\nWhen for a long time someone has been imbibing a strong and nauseating\r\ndrink, not only does the palate get accustomed, but it often acquires a\r\ntaste for it; it soon wants to have it stronger; finally, it swallows\r\nit pure, completely raw, with no admixture or condiment to disguise its\r\nrepulsiveness--Such, to certain imaginations, is the spectacle of human\r\ngore; after getting accustomed to it they take delight in seeing it.\r\nLequinio, Laignelot and Lebon invite the executioner to dine with\r\nthem;[32157] Monestier, \"with his cut-throats, is going himself in\r\nsearch of prisoners in the dungeons, so that he may accompany them to\r\nthe Tribunal and overwhelm them with charges, if they are disposed to\r\ndefend themselves; after their condemnation, he attends in uniform\"\r\nat their execution.[32158] Fouché, lorgnette in hand, looks out of his\r\nwindow upon a butchery of two hundred and ten Lyonnese. Collot, Laporte\r\nand Fouché feast together in a large company on the days when executions\r\nby shooting takes place, and, at each discharge, stand up and cheer\r\nlustily, waving their hats.[32159] At Toulon, Fréron, in person,\r\norders and sees executed, the first grand massacre on the Champ de\r\nMars.[32160]--On the Place d'Arras, M. de Vielfort, already tied and\r\nstretched out on the plank, awaits the fall of the knife. Lebon appears\r\non the balcony of the theatre, makes a sign to the executioner to\r\nstop, opens the newspaper, and, in a loud voice, reads off the recent\r\nsuccesses of the French armies; then, turning to the condemned man,\r\nexclaims: \"Go, wretch, and take the news of our victories to your\r\nbrethren.\"[32161] At Feurs, where the shootings take place at the house\r\nof M. du Rosier, in the great avenue of the park, his daughter, quite a\r\nyoung woman, advances in tears to Javogues, and asks for the release of\r\nher husband. \"Oh, yes, my dear,\" replies Javogues, \"you shall have\r\nhim home to-morrow.\" In effect, the next day, her husband is shot, and\r\nburied in the avenue.[32162]--It is evident that they get to liking\r\nthe business. Like their September predecessors, they find amusement in\r\nmurdering: people around them allude gaily to \"the red theater\" and \"the\r\nnational razor.\" An aristocrat is said to be \"putting his head at the\r\nnational window,\" and \"he has put his head through the cathole.\"[32163]\r\nThey themselves have the style and humor of their trade. \"To-morrow,\r\nat seven o'clock,\" writes Hugues, \"let the sacred guillotine be\r\nerected!\"--\"The demoiselle guillotine,\" writes Lecarlier, \"keeps\r\nsteadily agoing.\"[32164]--\"The relatives and friends of emigrés and of\r\nrefractory priests,\" writes Lebon, \"monopolize the guillotine.. .[32165]\r\nDay before yesterday, the sister of the former Comte de Bethune sneezed\r\nin the sack.\" Carrier loudly proclaims \"the pleasure he has derived\"\r\nfrom seeing priests executed: \"I never laughed in my life as I did at\r\nthe faces they made in dying.\"[32166] This is the extreme perversity\r\nof human nature, that of a Domitian who watches the features of the\r\ncondemned, to see the effect of suffering, or, better still, that of the\r\nsavage who holds his sides with laughter at the aspect of a man being\r\nimpaled. And this delight of contemplating death throes, Carrier finds\r\nit in the sufferings of children. Notwithstanding the remonstrances\r\nof the revolutionary Tribunal and the entreaties of President\r\nPhélippes-Tronjolly,[32167] he signs on the 29th of Frimaire, year II.,\r\na positive order to guillotine without trial twenty-seven persons, of\r\nwhom seven are women, and, among these, four sisters, Mesdemoiselles de\r\nla Metayrie, one of these twenty-eight years old, another twenty-seven,\r\nthe third twenty-six, and the fourth seventeen. Two days before,\r\nnotwithstanding the remonstrances of the same tribunal and the\r\nentreaties of the same president, he signed a positive order to\r\nguillotine twenty-six artisans and farm-hands, among them two boys of\r\nfourteen, and two of thirteen years of age. He was driven \"in a cab to\r\nthe place of execution and he followed it up in detail. He could hear\r\none of the children of thirteen, already bound to the board, but too\r\nsmall and having only the top of the head under the knife, ask the\r\nexecutioner, \"Will it hurt me much?\" What the triangular blade fell\r\nupon may be imagined! Carrier saw this with his own eyes, and whilst the\r\nexecutioner, horrified at himself, died a few days after in consequence\r\nof what he had done, Carrier put another in his place, began again and\r\ncontinued operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3201: Thibaudeau: \"Mémoires,\" I., 47, 70.--Durand-Maillane,\r\n\"Mémoires,\" 183.--Vatel, \"Charlotte Corday et les Girondins,\" II.,\r\n269.

THE RULERS. (continued).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Central Government Administration.\r\n\r\n     The administrative body at Paris.--Composition of the group\r\n     out of which it was recruited.--Deterioration of this\r\n     group.--Weeding-out of the Section Assemblies.--Weeding out\r\n     of the popular clubs.--Pressure of the government.\r\n\r\nTo provide these local sovereigns with the subordinate lieutenants and\r\nagents which they require, we have the local Jacobin population, and we\r\nhave seen the composition of the recruits,[3301]\r\n\r\n* the distressed and the perverted of every class and degree, especially\r\nthe lowest,\r\n\r\n* the castaways,\r\n\r\n* envious and resentful subordinates,\r\n\r\n* small shopkeepers in debt,\r\n\r\n* the migrating, high-living workers,\r\n\r\n* barflies,\r\n\r\n* vagrants,\r\n\r\n* men of the gutters,\r\n\r\n* street-walkers,\r\n\r\n--in short, every species of \"anti-social vermin,\" male and\r\nfemale,[3302] including a few honest crack-brains into which the\r\nfashionable theory had freely found its way; the rest, and by far\r\nthe largest number, are veritable beasts of prey, speculating on the\r\nestablished order of things and adopting the revolutionary faith only\r\nbecause it provides food for their appetites.--In Paris, they number\r\nfive or six thousand, and, after Thermidor, there is about the same\r\nnumber, the same appetites rallying them around the same dogma,[3303]\r\nlevelers and terrorists, \"some because they are poor, others because\r\nthey have broken off the habit of working at their trade,\" furious with\r\n\"the scoundrels who own a coach house, against the rich and the hoarders\r\nof objects of prime necessity.\" Many of them \"having soiled themselves\r\nduring the Revolution, ready to do it again provided the rich rascals,\r\nmonopolists and merchants can all be killed,\" all \"frequenters of\r\npopular clubs who think themselves philosophers, although most of\r\nthem are unable to read,\" at the head of them the remnant of the most\r\nnotorious political bandits,\r\n\r\n* the famous post-master, Drouet, who, in the tribune at the Convention,\r\ndeclared himself a \"brigand,\"[3304]\r\n\r\n* Javogues, the robber of Montbrison and the \"Nero of Ain,\"\r\n\r\n* the drunkard Casset, formerly a silk-worker and later the pasha of\r\nThionville,\r\n\r\n* Bertrand, the friend of Charlier, the ex-mayor and executioner of\r\nLyons,\r\n\r\n* Darthé, ex-secretary of Lebon and the executioner at Arras,\r\n\r\n* Rossignol and nine other Septembriseurs of the Abbaye and the\r\nCarmelites, and, finally, the great apostle of despotic communism,\r\n\r\n* Babeuf, who, sentenced to twenty years in irons for the falsification\r\nof public contracts, and as needy as he is vicious, rambles about Paris\r\nairing his disappointed ambitions and empty pockets along with the\r\nswaggering crew who, if not striving to reach the throne by a new\r\nmassacre,[3305] tramp through the streets slipshod, for lack of money\r\n\"to redeem a pair of boots at the shoemakers,\" or to sell some snuff-box\r\ntheir last resource, for a morning dram.[3306]\r\n\r\nIn this class we see the governing rabble fully and distinctly.\r\nSeparated from its forced adherents and the official robots who serve it\r\nas they would any other power, it stands out pure and unalloyed by\r\nany neutral influx; we recognize here the permanent residue, the deep,\r\nsettled slime of the social sewer. It is to this sink of vice and\r\nignorance that the revolutionary government betakes itself for its\r\nstaff-officers and its administrative bodies.\r\n\r\nNowhere else could they be found. For the daily task imposed upon them,\r\nand which must be done by them, is robbery and murder; excepting the\r\npure fanatics, who are few in number, only brutes and blackguards\r\nhave the aptitudes and tastes for such business. In Paris, as in the\r\nprovinces, it is from the clubs or popular associations in which they\r\ncongregate, that they are sought for.--Each section of Paris contains\r\none of these clubs, in all forty-eight, rallied around the central club\r\nin the Rue St. Honoré, forty-eight district alliances of professional\r\nrioters and brawlers, the rebels and blackguards of the social army, all\r\nthe men and women incapable of devoting themselves to a regular life and\r\nuseful labor,[3307] especially those who, on the 31st of May and 2nd of\r\nJune, had aided the Paris Commune and the \"Mountain\" in violating the\r\nConvention. They recognize each other by this sign that, \"each would\r\nbe hung in case of a counter-revolution,\"[3308] laying it down \"as an\r\nincontestable fact that, should a single aristocrat be spared, all of\r\nthem would mount the scaffold.\"[3309] They are naturally wary and they\r\nstick together: in their clique \"everything is done on the basis of good\r\nfellowship;\"[3310] no one is admitted except on the condition of having\r\nproved his qualifications \"on the 10th of August and 31st of May.\"[3311]\r\nAnd, as they have made their way into the Commune and into the\r\nrevolutionary committees behind victorious leaders, they are able,\r\nthrough the certificates of civism which these arbitrarily grant or\r\nrefuse, to exclude, not only from political life but, again, from civil\r\nlife, whoever is not of their party.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" writes one of Danton's correspondents,[3312] \"the sort of persons\r\nwho easily obtain these certificates,--the Ronsins, the Jourdans, the\r\nMaillards, the Vincents, all bankrupts, keepers of gambling-hells and\r\ncut-throats. Ask these individuals whether they have paid the patriotic\r\ncontribution, whether they regularly pay the usual taxes, whether they\r\ngive to the poor of their sections, to the volunteer soldiers, etc.;\r\nwhether they mount guard or see it regularly done, whether they have\r\nmade a loyal declaration for the forced loan. You will find that they\r\nhave not.... The Commune issues certificates of civism to its satellites\r\nand refuses them to the best citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe monopoly is obvious; they make no attempt to conceal it; six weeks\r\nlater,[3313] it becomes official: several revolutionary committees\r\ndecide not to grant certificates of civism to citizens who are not\r\nmembers of a popular club.\" And strict exclusion goes on increasing\r\nfrom month to month. Old certificates are canceled and new ones imposed,\r\nwhich new certificates have new formalities added to them, a larger\r\nnumber of endorsers being required and certain kinds of guarantees\r\nbeing rejected; there is greater strictness in relation to the requisite\r\nsecurities and qualifications; the candidate is put off until fuller\r\ninformation can be obtained about him; he is rejected at the slightest\r\nsuspicion:[3314] he is only too fortunate if he is tolerated in the\r\nRepublic as a passive subject, if he is content to be taxed and taxed\r\nwhen they please, and if he is not sent to join the \"suspects\" in\r\nprison; whoever does not belong to the band does not belong to the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nAmongst themselves and in their popular club it is worse, for\r\n\r\n\"the eagerness to get any office leads to every one denouncing each\r\nother; \"[3315]\r\n\r\nconsequently, at the Jacobin club in the rue St. Honoré, and in the\r\nbranch clubs of the quarter, there is constant purging, and always in\r\nthe same sense, until the faction is cleansed of all honest or passable\r\nalloy and only a minority remains, which has its own way at every\r\nballoting. One of them announces that, in his club, eighty doubtful\r\nmembers have already been gotten rid of; another that, in his club,\r\none hundred are going to be excluded.[3316] On Ventose 23, in the\r\n\"Bon-Conseil\" club, most of the members examined are rejected: \"they\r\nare so strict that a man who cannot show that he acted energetically in\r\ncritical times, cannot form part of the assembly; he is set aside for\r\na mere trifle.\" On Ventôse 13, in the same club, \"out of twenty-six\r\nexamined, seven only are admitted; one citizen, a tobacco dealer, aged\r\nsixty-eight, who has always performed his duty, is rejected for having\r\ncalled the president Monsieur, and for having spoken in the tribune\r\nbareheaded; two members, after this, insisted on his being a Moderate,\r\nwhich is enough to keep him out.\" Those who remain, consist of the\r\nmost restless and most loquacious, the most eager for office, the\r\nself-mutilated club being thus reduced to a nucleus of charlatans and\r\nscoundrels.\r\n\r\nTo these spontaneous eliminations through which the club deteriorates,\r\nadd the constant pressure through which the Committee of Public Safety\r\nfrightens and degrades it. The lower the revolutionary government sinks,\r\nand the more it concentrates its power, the more servile and sanguinary\r\ndo its agents and employees become. It strikes right and left as\r\na warning; it imprisons or decapitates the turbulent among its own\r\nclients, the secondary demagogues who are impatient at not being\r\nprincipal demagogues, the bold who think of striking a fresh blow in\r\nthe streets, Jacques Roux, Vincent, Momoro, Hébert, leaders of the\r\nCordeliers club and of the Commune. After these, the indulgent who\r\nare disposed to exercise some discernment or moderation in terrorism,\r\nCamille Desmoulins, Danton and their adherents; and lastly, many others\r\nwho are more or less doubtful, compromised or compromising, wearied or\r\neccentric, from Maillard to Chaumette, from Antonelle to Chabot, from\r\nWestermann to Clootz. Each of the proscribed has a gang of followers,\r\nand suddenly the whole gang are obliged to do a volte-face; those who\r\nwere able to show initiative, grovel, while those who could show mercy,\r\nbecome hardened. Henceforth, amongst the subaltern Jacobins, the roots\r\nof independence, humanity, and loyalty, hard to extirpate even in an\r\nignoble and cruel nature, are eradicated even to the last fiber,\r\nthe revolutionary staff, already so debased, becoming more and\r\nmore degraded, until it is worthy of the office assigned to it. The\r\nconfidants of Hébert, those who listen to Chaumette, the comrades of\r\nWestermann, the officers of Ronsin, the faithful readers of Camille,\r\nthe admirers and devotees of Danton, all are bound to publicly repudiate\r\ntheir incarcerated friend or leader and approve of the decree which\r\nsends him to the scaffold, to applaud his calumniators, to overwhelm\r\nhim on trial: this or that judge or juryman, who is one of Danton's\r\npartisans, is obliged to stifle a defense of him, and, knowing him to be\r\ninnocent, pronounce him guilty; one who had often dined with Desmoulins\r\nis not only to guillotine him, but, in addition to this, to guillotine\r\nhis young widow. Moreover, in the revolutionary committees, at the\r\nCommune, in the offices of the Committee of General Safety, in the\r\nbureau of the Central Police, at the headquarters of the armed force, at\r\nthe revolutionary Tribunal, the service to which they are compelled to\r\ndo becomes daily more onerous and more repulsive. To denounce neighbors,\r\nto arrest colleagues, to go and seize innocent persons, known to be\r\nsuch, in their beds, to select in the prisons the thirty or forty\r\nunfortunates who form the daily food of the guillotine, to \"amalgamate\"\r\nthem haphazard, to try them and condemn them in a lot, to escort\r\noctogenarian women and girls of sixteen to the scaffold, even under\r\nthe knife-blade, to see heads dropping and bodies swinging, to contrive\r\nmeans for getting rid of a multitude of corpses, and for removing the\r\ntoo-visible stains of blood. Of what species do the beings consist, who\r\ncan accept such a task, and perform it day after day, with the prospect\r\nof doing it indefinitely? Fouquier-Tinville himself succumbs. One\r\nevening, on his way to the Committee of Public Safety, \"he feels unwell\"\r\non the Pont-Neuf and exclaims: \"I think I see the ghosts of the\r\ndead following us, especially those of the patriots I have had\r\nguillotined!\"[3317] And at another time: \"I would rather plow the ground\r\nthan be public prosecutor. If I could, I would resign.\"--The government,\r\nas the system becomes aggravated, is forced to descend lower still that\r\nit may find suitable instruments; it finds them now only in the lowest\r\ndepths: in Germinal, to renew the Commune, in Floréal, to renew the\r\nministries, in Prairial, to re-compose the revolutionary Tribunal,\r\nmonth after month, purging and re-constituting the committees of\r\neach quarter[3318] of the city. In vain does Robespierre, writing\r\nand re-writing his secret lists, try to find men able to maintain\r\nthe system; he always falls back on the same names, those of unknown\r\npersons, illiterate, about a hundred knaves or fools with four or five\r\nsecond-class despots or fanatics among them, as malevolent and as narrow\r\nas himself.--The purifying crucible has been used too often and for too\r\nlong a time; it has overheated; what was sound, or nearly so, in the\r\nelements of the primitive fluid has been forcibly evaporated; the rest\r\nhas fermented and become acid; nothing remains in the bottom of the\r\nvessel but the lees of stupidity and wickedness, their concentrated and\r\ncorrosive dregs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Subaltern Jacobins.\r\n\r\n     Quality of subaltern leaders.--How they rule in the section\r\n     assemblies.--How they seize and hold office.\r\n\r\nSuch are the subordinate sovereigns[3319] who in Paris, during 14 months\r\ndispose as they please, of fortunes, liberties and lives.--And first,\r\nin the section assemblies, which still maintain a semblance of popular\r\nsovereignty, they rule despotically and uncontested.--\r\n\r\n\"A dozen or fifteen men wearing a red cap,[3320] well-informed or not,\r\nclaim the exclusive right of speaking and acting, and if any other\r\ncitizen with honest motives happens to propose measures which he thinks\r\nproper, and which really are so, no attention is paid to these measures,\r\nor, if it is, it is only to show the members composing the assemblage\r\nof how little account they are. These measures are accordingly rejected,\r\nsolely because they are not presented by one of the men in a red cap, or\r\nby somebody like themselves, initiated in the mysteries of the section.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" says one of the leaders,[3321] \"we find only ten members of\r\nthe club at the general assembly of the section; but there are enough\r\nof us to intimidate the rest. Should any citizen of the section make a\r\nproposition we do not like, we rise and shout that he is an schemer,\r\nor a signer (of former constitutional petitions). In this way we impose\r\nsilence on those who are not in line with the club.\"--\r\n\r\nSince September, 1793, operation is all the easier because the majority,\r\nis now composed of beasts of burden, ruled with an iron hand.\r\n\r\n\"When something has to be effected that depends on intrigue or on\r\nprivate interest,[3322] the motion is always put by one of the members\r\nof the Revolutionary Committee of the section, or by one of those\r\nfanatical patriots who join in with the Committee, and otherwise act\r\nas its spies. Immediately the ignorant men, to whom Danton has allowed\r\nforty sous for each meeting, and who, from now on crowd an assembly,\r\nwhere they never came before, welcome the proposition with loud\r\napplause, shouting and demanding a vote, and the act is passed\r\nunanimously, notwithstanding the contrary opinions of all well-informed\r\nand honest citizens. Should any one dare make an objection, he would run\r\nthe risk of imprisonment as a suspect,[3323] after being treated as an\r\naristocrat or federalist, or at least, refused a certificate of civism,\r\n( a serious matter) if he had the misfortune to need one, did his\r\nsurvival depend on this, either as employee or pensioner.\"--In the\r\nMaison-Commune section, most of the auditory are masons, \"excellent\r\npatriots,\" says one of the clubbists of the quarter:[3324] they\r\nalways vote on our side; we make them do what we want.\" Numbers of\r\nday-laborers, cab-drivers, cartmen and workmen of every class, thus earn\r\ntheir forty sous, and have no idea that anything else might be demanded\r\nfrom them. On entering the hall, when the meeting opens, they write down\r\ntheir names, after which they go out \"to take a drink,\" without thinking\r\nthemselves obliged to listen to the rigmarole of the orators; towards\r\nthe end, they come back, make all the noise that is required of them\r\nwith their lungs, feet and hands, and then go and \"take back their card\r\nand get their money.\"[3325]--With paid applauders of this stamp, they\r\nsoon get the better of any opponents, or, rather, all opposition is\r\nsuppressed beforehand. \"The best citizens keep silent\" in the section\r\nassemblies, or \"stay away;\" these are simply \"gambling-shops\" where\r\n\"the most absurd, the most unjust, the most impolitic of resolutions are\r\npassed at every moment.[3326] Moreover, citizens are ruined there by the\r\nunlimited sectional expenditure, which exceeds the usual taxation and\r\nthe communal expenses, already very heavy. At one time, some carpenter\r\nor locksmith, member of the Revolutionary Committee, wants to construct,\r\nenlarge or decorate a hall, and it is necessary to agree with him.\r\nAgain, a poor speech is made, full of exaggeration and political\r\nextravagance, of which three, four, five and six thousand impressions\r\nare ordered to be printed. Then, to cap the climax, following the\r\nexample of the Commune, no accounts are rendered, or, if this is done\r\nfor form's sake, no fault must be found with them, under penalty of\r\nsuspicion, etc.\"--The twelve leaders, proprietors and distributors of\r\ncivism, have only to agree amongst themselves to share the profits, each\r\naccording to his appetite; henceforth, cupidity and vanity are free\r\nto sacrifice the common weal, under cover of the common interest.--The\r\npasture is vast and it is at the disposal of the leaders. In one of his\r\norders of the day, Henriot says:[3327]\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to announce to my brethren in arms that all the\r\npositions are at the disposal of the government. The actual government,\r\nwhich is revolutionary, whose intentions are pure, and which merely\r\ndesires the happiness of all,.... will search everywhere, even into the\r\nattics for virtuous men,.... poor and genuine sans-culottes.\" And\r\nthere is enough to satisfy them thirty-five thousand places of public\r\nemployment in the capital alone:[3328] it is a rich mine; already,\r\nbefore the month of May, 1793, \"the Jacobin club boasted of having\r\nplaced nine thousand agents in the administration,\"[3329] and since\r\nthe 2nd of June, \"virtuous men, poor, genuine sans-culottes,\" arrive\r\nin crowds from \"their garrets,\" dens and hired rooms, each to grab his\r\nshare.--They besiege and install themselves by hundreds the ancient\r\noffices in the War, Navy and Public-Works departments, in the Treasury\r\nand Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Here they rule, constantly denouncing\r\nall the remaining, able employees thus creating vacancies in order to\r\nfill them.[3330] Then there are twenty new administrative departments\r\nwhich they keep for themselves: commissioners of the first confiscation\r\nof national property, commissioners of national property arising\r\nfrom emigrants and the convicted, commissioners of conscripted\r\ncarriage-horses, commissioners on clothing, commissioners on the\r\ncollecting and manufacturing of saltpeter, commissioners on monopolies,\r\ncivil-commissioners in each of the forty-eight sections, commissioners\r\non propagandas in the departments, Commissioners on provisions, and many\r\nothers. Fifteen hundred places are counted in the single department of\r\nsubsistence in Paris,[3331] and all are salaried. Here, already, are\r\na number of desirable offices.--Some are for the lowest rabble, two\r\nhundred, at twenty sous a day, paid to \"stump-speakers,\" employed to\r\ndirect opinion in the Palais-Royal, also among the Tuileries groups,\r\nas well as in the tribunes of the Convention and of the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville;[3332] two hundred more at four hundred francs per annum,\r\nto waiters in coffee-houses, gambling-saloons and hotels, for watching\r\nforeigners and customers; hundreds of places at two, three, and five\r\nfrancs a day with meals, for the guardians of seals, and for garrisoning\r\nthe domiciles of \"suspects\"; thousands, with premiums, pay, and full\r\nlicense, for brigands who, under Ronsin, compose the revolutionary army,\r\nand for the gunners, paid guard and gendarmes of Henriot.--The principal\r\nposts, however, are those which subject lives and freedom to the\r\ndiscretion of those who occupy them: for, through this more than\r\nregal power, they possess all other power, and such is that of the men\r\ncomposing the forty-eight revolutionary committees, the bureaus of the\r\nCommittee of General Security and of the Commune, and the staff-officers\r\nof the armed force. They are the prime-movers and active incentives\r\nof the system of Terror, all picked Jacobins and tested by repeated\r\nselection, all designated or approved by the Central Club, which claims\r\nfor itself the monopoly of patriotism, and which, erected into a supreme\r\ncouncil of the party, issues no patent of orthodoxy except to its own\r\nhenchmen.[3333]\r\n\r\nThey immediately assume the tone and arrogance of dictatorship. \" Pride\r\nhas reached its highest point:[3334]... One who, yesterday, had no post\r\nand was amiable and honest, has become haughty and insolent because,\r\ndeceived by appearances, his fellow-citizens have elected him\r\ncommissioner, or given him some employment or other.\" Henceforth, he\r\nbehaves like a Turkish agha amongst infidels, and, in command, carries\r\nthings out with a high hand.--On the 20th of Vendémiaire, year II., \"in\r\nthe middle of the night,\" the committee of the Piques section summons\r\nM. Bélanger, the architect. He is notified that his house is wanted\r\nimmediately for a new Bastille.--\"But, said he, 'I own no other, and it\r\nis occupied by several tenants; it is decorated with models of art, and\r\nis fit only for that purpose.'--'Your house or you go to prison!'--'But\r\nI shall be obliged to indemnify my tenants.'--'Either your house or\r\nyou go to prison; as to indemnities, we have vacant lodgings for your\r\ntenants, as well as for yourself, in (the prisons of) La Force, or\r\nSainte-Pélagie.' Twelve sentinels on the post start off at once and take\r\npossession of the premises; the owner is allowed six hours to move\r\nout and is forbidden, henceforth, to return; the bureaus, to which he\r\nappeals, interpret his obedience as 'tacit adhesion,' and, very soon, he\r\nhimself is locked up.\"[3335]--Administrative tools that cut so sharply\r\nneed the greatest care, and, from time to time, they are carefully\r\noiled:[3336] on the 20th of July, 1793, two thousand francs are given to\r\neach of the forty-eight committees, and eight thousand francs to General\r\nHenriot, \"for expenses in watching anti-revolutionary maneuvers;\" on the\r\n7th of August, fifty thousand francs \"to indemnify the less successful\r\nmembers of the forty-eight committees;\" three hundred thousand francs\r\nto Gen. Henriot \"for thwarting conspiracies and securing the triumph of\r\nliberty;\" fifty thousand francs to the mayor, \"for detecting the plots\r\nof the malevolent;\" on the 10th of September, forty thousand francs\r\nto the mayor, president and procureur-syndic of the department, \"for\r\nmeasures of security;\" on the 13th of September, three hundred thousand\r\nfrancs to the mayor \"for preventing the attempts of the malevolent;\" on\r\nthe 15th of November, one hundred thousand francs to the popular\r\nclubs, \"because these are essential to the propagation of sound\r\nprinciples.\"--Moreover, besides gratuities and a fixed salary, there\r\nare the gratifications and perquisites belonging to the office.[3337]\r\nHenriot appoints his comrades on the staff of paid spies and\r\ndenunciators, and, naturally, they take advantage of their position\r\nto fill their pockets; under the pretext of incivism, they multiply\r\ndomiciliary visits, make the master of the house ransom himself, or\r\nsteal what suits them on the premises.[3338]--In the Commune, and on the\r\nrevolutionary-committees, every extortion can be, and is, practiced.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" says Quevremont, \"two citizens who have been put in prison,\r\nwithout being told why, and, at the end of three weeks or a month,\r\nlet out and do you know how? By paying, one of them, fifteen thousand\r\nlivres, and the other, twenty-five thousand.... Gambron, at La Force,\r\npays one thousand five hundred livres a month for a room not to live\r\namongst lice, and besides this, he had to pay a bribe of two thousand\r\nlivres on entering. This happened to many others who, again, dared not\r\nspeak of it, except in a whisper.\"[3339]\r\n\r\nWoe to the imprudent who, never concerning themselves with public\r\naffairs, and relying on their innocence, discard the officious broker\r\nand fail to pay up at once! Brichard, the notary, having refused or\r\ntendered too late, the hundred thousand crowns demanded of him, is to\r\nput his head \"at the red window.\"--And I omit ordinary rapine, the vast\r\nfield open to extortion through innumerable inventories, sequestrations\r\nand adjudications, through the enormities of contractors, through\r\nhastily executed purchases and deliveries, through the waste of two\r\nor three millions given weekly by the government to the Commune for\r\nsupplies for the capital, through the requisitions of grain which give\r\nfifteen hundred men of the revolutionary army an opportunity to clean\r\nout all the neighboring farms, as far as Corbeil and Meaux, and benefit\r\nby this after the fashion of the chauffeurs.[3340]--With such a staff,\r\nthese anonymous thefts cannot surprise us. Babeuf, the falsifier of\r\npublic contracts, is secretary for provisions to the Commune; Maillard,\r\nthe Abbaye Septembriseur, receives eight thousand francs for his\r\ndirection, in the forty-eight sections, of the ninety-six observers and\r\nleaders of public opinion; Chrétien, whose smoking-shop serves as the\r\nrendezvous of rowdies, becomes a juryman at eighteen francs a day in the\r\nrevolutionary Tribunal, and leads his section with uplifted saber;[3341]\r\nDe Sade, professor of crimes, is now the oracle of his quarter, and, in\r\nthe name of the Piques Section, he reads addresses to the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. A Revolutionary Committee.\r\n\r\n     A Minister of Foreign Affairs.--A General in command.--The\r\n     Paris Commune.--A Revolutionary Committee.\r\n\r\nLet us examine some of these figures closely: the nearer they are to the\r\neye and foremost in position, the more the importance of the duty brings\r\ninto light the unworthiness of the potentate.--There is already one of\r\nthem, whom we have seen in passing, Buchot, twice noticed by Robespierre\r\nunder his own hand as \"a man of probity, energetic and capable of\r\nfulfilling the most important functions,\"[3342] appointed by the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety \"Commissioner on External Relations,\" that is\r\nto say, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and kept in this important position\r\nfor nearly six months. He is a school-master from the Jura,[3343]\r\nrecently disembarked from his small town and whose \"ignorance, low\r\nhabits and stupidity surpass anything that can be imagined... The chief\r\nclerks have nothing to do with him; he neither sees nor asks for them.\r\nHe is never found in his office, and when it is indispensable to ask for\r\nhis signature on any legislative matter, the sole act to which he has\r\nreduced his functions, they are compelled to go and force it from him in\r\nthe Café Hardy, where he usually passes his days.\" It must be borne\r\nin mind that he is envious and spiteful, avenging himself for his\r\nincapacity on those whose competency makes him sensible of his\r\nincompetence; he denounces them as Moderates, and, at last, succeeds in\r\nhaving a warrant of arrest issued against his four chief clerks; on the\r\nmorning of Thermidor 9, with a wicked leer, he himself carries the news\r\nto one of them, M. Miot. Unfortunately for him, after Thermidor, he is\r\nturned out and M. Miot is put in his place. With diplomatic politeness,\r\nthe latter calls on his predecessor and \"expresses to him the usual\r\ncompliments.\" Buchot, insensible to compliments, immediately thinks\r\nof the substantial, and the first thing he asks for is to keep\r\nprovisionally his apartment in the ministry. On this being granted, he\r\nexpresses his thanks and tells M. Miot that it was very well to appoint\r\nhim, but \"for myself, it is very disagreeable. I have been obliged to\r\ncome to Paris and quit my post in the provinces, and now they leave me\r\nin the street.\" Thereupon, with astounding impudence, he asks the man\r\nwhom he wished to guillotine to give him a place as ministerial clerk.\r\nM. Miot tries to make him understand that for a former minister to\r\ndescend so low would be improper. Buchot regards such delicacy as\r\nstrange, and, seeing M. Miot's embarrassment, he ends by saying: \"If you\r\ndon't find me fit for a clerk, I shall be content with the place of a\r\nservant.\" This estimate of himself shows his proper value.\r\n\r\nThe other, whom we have also met before, and who is already known by\r\nhis acts,[3344] general in Paris of the entire armed force,\r\ncommander-in-chief of one hundred and ten thousand men, is that former\r\nservant or under-clerk of the procureur Formey, who, dismissed by\r\nhis employer for robbery, shut up in Bicêtre, by turns a runner and\r\nannouncer for a traveling show, barrier-clerk and September assassin,\r\nhas purged the Convention on the 2nd of June--in short, the famous\r\nHenriot, and now simply a brute and a sot. In this latter capacity,\r\nspared on the trial of the Hébertists, he is kept as a tool, for the\r\nreason, doubtless, that he is narrow, coarse and manageable, more\r\ncompromised than anybody else, good for any job, without the slightest\r\nchance of becoming independent, unemployed in the army,[3345] having\r\nno prestige with true soldiers, a general for street parade and an\r\ninterloper and lower than the lowest of the mob; his mansion, his box at\r\nthe Opera-Comique, his horses, his importance at festivals and reviews,\r\nand, above all, his orgies make him perfectly content.--Every\r\nevening, in full uniform, escorted by his aides-de-camp, he gallops to\r\nChoisy-sur-Seine, where, in the domicile of a flatterer named Fauvel,\r\nalong with some of Robespierre's confederates or the local demagogues,\r\nhe revels. They toss off the wines of the Duc de Coigny, smash\r\nthe glasses, plates and bottles, betake themselves to neighboring\r\ndance-rooms and kick up a row, bursting in doors, and breaking benches\r\nand chairs to pieces--in short, they have a good time.--The next\r\nmorning, having slept himself sober, he dictates his orders for the day,\r\nveritable masterpieces in which the silliness, imbecility and credulity\r\nof a numskull, the sentimentality of the drunkard, the clap-trap of\r\na mountebank and the tirades of a cheap philosopher form an unique\r\ncompound, at once sickening and irritating, like the fiery, pungent\r\nmixtures of cheap bars, which suit his audience better because they\r\ncontain the biting, mawkish ingredients that compose the adulterated\r\nbrandy of the Revolution.--He is posted on foreign maneuvers, and\r\nenlarges upon the true reasons for the famine: \"A lot of bread has been\r\nlately found in the privies: the Pitts and Cobourgs and other rascals\r\nwho want to enslave justice and reason, and assassinate philosophy, must\r\nbe called to account for this. Headquarters, etc.\"[3346] He has\r\ntheories on religions and preaches civic modesty to all dissenters: \"The\r\nministers and sectaries of every form of worship are requested not to\r\npractice any further religious ceremonies outside their temples. Every\r\ngood sectarian will see the propriety of observing this order. The\r\ninterior of a temple is large enough for paying one's homage to the\r\nEternal, who requires no rites that are repulsive to every thinking man.\r\nThe wise agree that a pure heart is the sublimest homage that Divinity\r\ncan desire. Headquarters, etc.\"--He sighs for the universal idyllic\r\nstate, and invokes the suppression of the armed force:\r\n\r\n\"I beg my fellow-citizens, who are led to the criminal courts out of\r\ncuriosity, to act as their own police; this is a task which every good\r\ncitizen should fulfill wherever he happens to be. In a free country,\r\njustice should not be secured by pikes and bayonets, but through reason\r\nand philosophy. These must maintain a watchful eye over society; these\r\nmust purify it and proscribe thieves and evil-doers. Each individual\r\nmust bring his small philosophic portion with him and, with these\r\nsmall portions, compose a rational totality that will turn out to be of\r\nbenefit and to the welfare of all. Oh, for the time when functionaries\r\nshall be rare, when the wicked shall be overthrown, when the law shall\r\nbecome the sole functionary in society! Headquarters, etc. \"--Every\r\nmorning, he preaches in the same pontifical strain. Imagine the\r\nscene--Henriot's levee at head-quarters, and a writing table, with,\r\nperhaps, a bottle of brandy on it; on one side of the table, the rascal\r\nwho, while buckling on his belt or drawing on his boots, softens his\r\nhusky voice, and, with his nervous twitchings, flounders through his\r\nhumanitarian homily; on the other side the mute, uneasy secretary, who\r\nmay probably be able to spell, but who dares not materially change the\r\ngrotesque phraseology of his master.\r\n\r\nThe Commune which employs the commanding-general is of about the same\r\nalloy, for, in the municipal sword, the blade and hilt, forged together\r\nin the Jacobin shop, are composed of the same base metal.--Fifty-six,\r\nout of eighty-eight members, whose qualifications and occupations are\r\nknown, are decidedly illiterate, or nearly so, their education being\r\nrudimentary, or none at all.[3347] Some of them are petty clerks,\r\ncounter-jumpers and common scribblers, one among them being a public\r\nwriter; others are small shopkeepers, pastry-cooks, mercers, hosiers,\r\nfruit-sellers and wine-dealers; yet others are simple mechanics or\r\neven laborers, carpenters, joiners, cabinet-makers, locksmiths,\r\nand especially three tailors, four hair-dressers, two masons, two\r\nshoemakers, one cobbler, one gardener; one stone-cutter, one paver,\r\none office-runner, and one domestic. Among the thirty-two who are\r\ninstructed, one alone has any reputation, Paris, professor at the\r\nUniversity and the assistant of Abbé Delille. Only one, Dumetz, an\r\nold engineer, steady, moderate and attending to the supplies, seems a\r\ncompetent and useful workman. The rest, collected from amongst the mass\r\nof unknown demagogues, are six art-apprentices or bad painters, six\r\nbusiness-agents or ex-lawyers, seven second or third-rate merchants, one\r\nteacher, one surgeon, one unfrocked married priest, all of whom, under\r\nthe political direction of Mayor Fleuriot-Lescot and Payen, the national\r\nagent, bring to the general council no administrative ability, but the\r\nfaculty for verbal argumentation, along with the requisite amount of\r\ntalk and scribbling indispensable to a deliberative assembly. And it is\r\ncurious to see them in session. Toward the end of September, 1793,[3348]\r\none of the veterans of liberal philosophy and political economy,\r\nbelonging to the French Academy and ruined by the Revolution, the old\r\nAbbé Morellet, needs a certificate of civism, to enable him to\r\nobtain payment of the small pension of one thousand francs, which the\r\nConstituent Assembly had voted him in recompense for his writings; the\r\nCommune, desiring information about this, selects three of its body\r\nto inquire into it. Morellet naturally takes the preliminary steps. He\r\nfirst writes \"a very humble, very civic note,\" to the president of the\r\nGeneral Council, Lubin Jr., formerly an art-apprentice who had abandoned\r\nart for politics, and is now living with his father a butcher, in the\r\nrue St. Honoré; he calls on this authority, and passes through the\r\nstall, picking his way amongst the slaughterhouse offal; admitted after\r\nsome delay, he finds his judge in bed, before whom he pleads his cause.\r\nHe then calls upon Bernard, an ex-priest, \"built like an incendiary\r\nand ill-looking,\" and respectfully bows to the lady of the house,\r\n\"a tolerably young woman, but very ugly and very dirty.\" Finally, he\r\ncarries his ten or a dozen volumes to the most important of the three\r\nexaminers, Vialard, \"ex-ladies' hair-dresser;\" the latter is almost\r\na colleague, \"for,\" says he, \"I have always liked technicians, having\r\npresented to the Academy of Sciences a top which I invented myself.\"\r\nNobody, however, had seen the petitioner in the streets on the 10th of\r\nAugust, nor on the 2nd of September, nor on the 31st of May; how can a\r\ncertificate of civism be granted after such evidences of lukewarmness?\r\nMorellet, not disheartened, awaits the all-powerful hair-dresser at the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, and accosts him frequently as he passes along. He,\r\n\"with greater haughtiness and distraction than the most unapproachable\r\nMinister of War would show to an infantry lieutenant,\" scarcely listens\r\nto him and walks on; he goes in and takes his seat, and Morellet, much\r\nagainst his will, has to be present at ten or twelve of these meetings.\r\nWhat strange meetings, to which patriotic deputations, volunteers and\r\namateurs come in turn to declaim and sing; where the president, Lubin,\r\n\"decorated with his scarf,\" shouts the Marseilles Hymn five or six\r\ntimes, \"Ca Ira,\" and other songs of several stanzas, set to tunes of\r\nthe Comic Opera, and always \"out of time, displaying the voice, airs\r\nand songs of an exquisite Leander.. . I really believe that, at the\r\nlast meeting, he sung alone in this manner three quarters of an hour\r\nat different times, the assembly repeating the last line of the\r\nverse.\"--\"How odd!\" exclaims a common woman alongside of Morellet, \"how\r\ndroll, passing all their time here, singing in that fashion! Is that\r\nwhat they come here for?\"--Not alone for that: after the circus-parade\r\nis over, the ordinary haranguers, and especially the hair-dresser, come\r\nand propose measures for murder \"in infuriate language and with fiery\r\ngesticulation.\" Such are the good speakers[3349] and men for show. The\r\nothers, who remain silent, and hardly know to write, act and do the\r\nrough work. A certain Chalaudon, member of the Commune,[3350] is one of\r\nthis kind, president of the Revolutionary Committee of the section\r\nof \"L'Homme armé,\" and probably an excellent man-hunter; for \"the\r\ngovernment committees assigned to him the duty of watching the right\r\nbank of the Seine, and, with extraordinary powers conferred on him, he\r\nrules from his back shop one half of Paris. Woe to those he has reason\r\nto complain of, those who have withdrawn from, or not given him, their\r\ncustom! Sovereign of his quarter up to Thermidor 10, his denunciations\r\nare death-warrants. Some of the streets, especially that of Grand\r\nChantier, he \"depopulates.\" And this Marais exterminator is a \"cobbler,\"\r\na colleague in leather, as well as in the Commune, of Simon the\r\nshoemaker, the preceptor and murderer of the young Dauphin.\r\n\r\nStill lower down than this admirable municipal body, let us try\r\nto imagine, from at least one complete example, the forty-eight\r\nrevolutionary committees who supply it with hands.--There is one of them\r\nof which we know all the members, where the governing class, under full\r\nheadway, can be studied on the spot and in action.[3351] This consists\r\nof the underworld, nomadic class which is revolutionary only through\r\nits appetites; no theory and no convictions animate it; during the first\r\nthree years of the Revolution it pays no attention to, or cares for,\r\npublic matters; if, since the 10th of August, and especially since the\r\n2nd of June, it takes any account of these, it is to get a living and\r\ngorge itself with plunder.--Out of eighteen members, simultaneously\r\nor in succession, of the \"Bonnet Rouge,\" fourteen, before the 10th\r\nof August and especially since the 2nd of June, are unknown in this\r\nquarter, and had taken no part in the Revolution. The most prominent\r\namong these are three painters, heraldic, carriage and miniature,\r\nevidently ruined and idle on account of the Revolution, a candle-dealer,\r\na vinegar-dealer, a manufacturer of saltpeter, and a locksmith; while of\r\nthese seven personages, four have additionally enhanced the dignity\r\nof their calling by vending tickets for small lotteries, acting as\r\npawnbrokers or as keepers of a biribi[3352] saloon. Seated along with\r\nthese are two upper-class domestics, a hack-driver, an ex-gendarme\r\ndismissed from the corps, a cobbler on the street corner, a runner on\r\nerrands who was once a carter's boy, and another who, two months before\r\nthis, was a scavenger's apprentice, the latter penniless and in tatters\r\nbefore he became one of the Committee, and since that, well clad, lodged\r\nand furnished. Finally, a former dealer in lottery-tickets, himself a\r\ncounterfeiter by his own admission, and a jail-bird. Four others have\r\nbeen dismissed from their places for dishonesty or swindling, three are\r\nknown drunkards, two are not even Frenchmen, while the ring-leader,\r\nthe man of brains of this select company is, as usual, a seedy, used-up\r\nlawyer, the ex-notary Pigeot, and expelled from his professional body\r\non account of bankruptcy. He is probably the author of the following\r\nspeculation: After the month of September, 1793, the Committee, freely\r\narresting whomsoever it pleased in the quarter, and even outside of it,\r\nmakes a haul of \"three hundred heads of families\" in four months, with\r\nwhom it fills the old barracks it occupies in the rue de Sèvres. In\r\nthis confined and unhealthy tenement, more than one hundred and twenty\r\nprisoners are huddled together, sometimes ten in one room, two in the\r\nsame bed, and, for their keeping, they pay three hundred francs a day.\r\nAs sixty-two francs of this charge are verified, there is of this sum,\r\n(not counting other extortions or concessions which are not official),\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-eight francs profit daily for these 'honest'\r\ncontractors. Accordingly, they live freely and have \"the most\r\nmagnificent dinners\" in their assembly chamber; the contribution of ten\r\nor twelve francs apiece is \"nothing\" for them.--But, in this opulent St.\r\nGermain quarter, so many rich and noble men and women form a herd\r\nwhich must be conveniently stalled, so as to be the more easily milked.\r\nConsequently, toward the end of March, 1794, the Committee, to increase\r\nits business and fill up the pen, hires a large house on the corner of\r\nthe boulevard possessing a court and a garden, where the high society of\r\nthe quarter is assigned lodgings of two rooms each, at twelve francs a\r\nday, which gives one hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum,\r\nand, as the rent is twenty-four hundred francs, the Committee gain one\r\nhundred and forty-seven thousand six hundred livres by the operation;\r\nwe must add to this twenty sorts of profit in money and other\r\nmatters--taxes on the articles consumed and on supplies of every\r\ndescription, charges on the dispatch and receipt of correspondence and\r\nother gratuities, such as ransoms and fees. A penned-up herd refuses\r\nnothing to its keepers,[3353] and this one less than any other; for\r\nif this herd is plundered it is preserved, its keepers finding it too\r\nlucrative to send it to the slaughter-house. During the last six months\r\nof Terror, but two out of the one hundred and sixty boarders of the\r\n\"Bonnet Rouge\" Committee are withdrawn from the establishment and handed\r\nover to the guillotine. It is only on the 7th and 8th of Thermidor that\r\nthe Committee of Public Safety, having undertaken to empty the prisons,\r\nbreaks in upon the precious herd and disturbs the well-laid scheme,\r\nso admirably managed.--It was only too well managed, for it excited\r\njealousy; three months after Thermidor, the \"Bonnet Rouge\" committee\r\nis denounced and condemned; ten are sentenced to twenty years in\r\nirons, with the pillory in addition, and, among others, the clever\r\nnotary,[3354] amidst the jeering and insults of the crowd.--And yet\r\nthese are not the worst; their cupidity had mollified their ferocity.\r\nOthers, less adroit in robbing, show greater cruelty in murdering. In\r\nany event, in the provinces as well as in Paris, in the revolutionary\r\ncommittees paid three francs a day for each member, the quality of\r\none or the other of the officials is about the same. According to the\r\npay-lists which Barère keeps, there are twenty-one thousand five hundred\r\nof these committees in France.[3355]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Provincial Administration.\r\n\r\n     The administrative staff in the provinces.--Jacobinism less\r\n     in the departmental towns than in Paris.--Less in the\r\n     country than in the towns.--The Revolutionary Committees in\r\n     the small communes.--Municipal bodies lukewarm in the\r\n     villages.--Jacobins too numerous in bourgs and small towns.\r\n     --Unreliable or hampered as agents when belonging to the\r\n     administrative bodies of large or moderate-sized towns.\r\n     --Deficiency of locally recruited staff.\r\n\r\nHad the laws of March 21 and September 5, 1793, been strictly enforced,\r\nthere would, instead of 21,500 have been 45,000 of these revolutionary\r\ncommittees. They would have been composed of 540,000 members costing\r\nthe public 591 millions per year.[3356] This would have made the regular\r\nadministrative body, already twice as numerous and twice as costly\r\nas under the ancient régime, an extra corps expending, \"simply in\r\nsurveillance,\" one hundred millions more than the entire taxation of\r\nthe country, the greatness of which had excited the people against the\r\nancient régime.--Happily, the poisonous and monstrous fungal growth was\r\nonly able to achieve half its intended size; neither the Jacobin seed\r\nnor the bad atmosphere it required to make it spread could be found\r\nanywhere. \"The people of the provinces,\" says a contemporary,[3357] \"are\r\nnot up to the level of the Revolution; it opposes old habits and\r\ncustoms and the resistance of inertia to innovations which it does not\r\nunderstand.\" \"The plowman is an estimable man,\" writes a missionary\r\nrepresentative, \"but he is generally a poor patriot.\"[3358] Actually,\r\nthere is on the one hand, less of human sediment in the departmental\r\ntowns than in the great Parisian sink, and, on the other hand, the rural\r\npopulation, preserved from intellectual miasmas, better resists\r\nsocial epidemics than the urban population. Less infested with vicious\r\nadventurers, less fruitful in disordered intellects, the provinces\r\nsupply a corps of inquisitors and terrorists with greater difficulty.\r\n\r\nAnd first, in the thousands of communes which have less than five\r\nhundred inhabitants,[3359] in many other villages of greater population,\r\nbut scattered[3360] and purely agricultural, especially in those in\r\nwhich patois is spoken, there is a scarcity of suitable subjects for a\r\nrevolutionary committee. People make use of their hands too much;\r\nhorny hands do not write every day; nobody desires to take up a pen,\r\nespecially to keep a register that may be preserved and some day or\r\nother prove compromising. It is already a difficult matter to recruit\r\na municipal council, to find a mayor, the two additional municipal\r\nofficers, and the national agent which the law requires; in the small\r\ncommunes, these are the only agents of the revolutionary government, and\r\nI fancy that, in most cases, their Jacobin fervor is moderate. Municipal\r\nofficer, national agent or mayor, the real peasant of that day belongs\r\nto no party, neither royalist nor republican;[3361] his ideas are\r\nrare, too transient and too sluggish, to enable him to form a political\r\nopinion. All he comprehends of the Revolution is that which nettles him,\r\nor that which he sees every day around him, with his own eyes; to him\r\n'93 and '94 are and will remain \"the time of bad paper (money) and great\r\nfright,\" and nothing more.[3362] Patient in his habits., he submits to\r\nthe new as he did to the ancient régime, bearing the load put on his\r\nshoulders, and stooping down for fear of a heavier one. He is often\r\nmayor or national agent in spite of himself; he has been obliged to take\r\nthe place and would gladly throw the burden off. For, as times go, it\r\nis onerous; if he executes decrees and orders, he is certain to make\r\nenemies; if he does not execute them, he is sure to be imprisoned; he\r\nhad better remain, or go back home \"Gros-Jean,\" as he was before. But he\r\nhas no choice; the appointment being once made and confirmed, he cannot\r\ndecline, nor resign, under penalty of being a \"suspect;\" he must be the\r\nhammer in order not to become the anvil. Whether he is a wine-grower,\r\nmiller, ploughman or quarry-man, he acts reluctantly, \"submitting a\r\npetition for resignation,\" as soon as the Terror diminishes, on the\r\nground that \"he writes badly,\" that \"he knows nothing whatever about law\r\nand is unable to enforce it;\" that \"he has to support himself with his\r\nown hands;\" that \"he has a family to provide for, and is obliged to\r\ndrive his own cart\" or vehicle; in short, entreating that he \"may be\r\nrelieved of his charge.\"[3363]--These involuntary recruits are evidently\r\nnothing more than common laborers; if they drag along the revolutionary\r\ncart they do it like their horses, because they are pressed into the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAbove the small communes, in the large villages possessing a\r\nrevolutionary committee, and also in certain bourgs, the horses in\r\nharness often pretend to draw and do not, for fear of crushing some\r\none.--At this epoch, a straggling village, especially when isolated, in\r\nan out-of-the-way place and on no highway, is a small world in itself,\r\nmuch more secluded than now-a-days, much less accessible to Parisian\r\nverbiage and outside pressure; local opinion here preponderates;\r\nneighbors support each other; they would shrink from denouncing a worthy\r\nman whom they had known for twenty years; the moral sway of honest\r\nfolks suffices for keeping down \"blackguards.\"[3364] If the mayor is\r\nrepublican, it is only in words, perhaps for self-protection, to\r\nprotect his commune, and because one must howl along with the other\r\nwolves.---Moreover, in other bourgs, and in the small towns, the\r\nfanatics and rascals are not sufficiently numerous to fill all the\r\noffices, and, in order to fill the vacancies, those who are not\r\ngood Jacobins have been pushed forward or admitted into the new\r\nadministrative corps, lukewarm, indifferent, timid or needy men, who\r\ntake the place as an asylum or ask for it as a means of subsistence.\r\n\"Citizens,\" one of the recruits, more or less under restraint, writes\r\nlater on,[3365] \"I was put on the Committee of Surveillance of Aignay by\r\nforce, and installed by force.\" Three or four madmen on it ruled, and\r\nif one held any discussion with them, \"it was always threats.... Always\r\ntrembling, always afraid,--that is the way I passed eight months doing\r\nduty in that miserable place.\"--Finally, in medium-sized or large\r\ntowns, the dead-lock produced by collective dismissals, the pell-mell\r\nof improvised appointments, and the sudden renewal of an entire set of\r\nofficials, threw into the administration, willingly or not, a lot of\r\npretended Jacobins who, at heart, are Girondists or Feuillantists,\r\nbut who, having been excessively long-winded, are assigned offices on\r\naccount of their stump-speeches, and who thenceforth sit alongside\r\nof the worst Jacobins, in the worst employment. \"Members of the Feurs\r\nRevolutionary Committee--those who make that objection to me,\" wrote a\r\nlawyer in Clermont,[3366] \"are persuaded that those only who secluded\r\nthemselves, felt the Terror. They are not aware, perhaps, that nobody\r\nfelt it more than those who were compelled to execute its decrees.\r\nRemember that the handwriting of Couthon which designated some citizen\r\nfor an office also conveyed a threat, and in case of refusal, of being\r\ndeclared 'suspect,' a threat which promised in perspective the loss\r\nof liberty and the sequestration of property! Was I free, then, to\r\nrefuse?\"--Once installed, the man must act, and many of those who do\r\nact let their repugnance be seen in spite of themselves: at best, they\r\ncannot be got to do more than mechanical service.\r\n\r\n\"Before going to court,\" says a judge at Cambray, \"I swallowed a big\r\nglass\r\n\r\nof spirits to give me strength enough to preside.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaves his house with no other intention than to finish the job, and,\r\nthe sentence once pronounced, to return home, shut himself up, and close\r\nhis eyes and ears.\r\n\r\n\"I had to pronounce judgment according to the jury's declaration--what\r\ncould I do?\"[3367]\r\n\r\nNothing, but remain blind and deaf: \"I drank. I tried to ignore\r\neverything, even the names of the accused.\"--It is plain enough that,\r\nin the local official body, there are too many agents who are weak, not\r\nzealous, without any push, unreliable, or even secretly hostile; these\r\nmust be replaced by others who are energetic and reliable, and the\r\nlatter must be taken wherever they can be found.[3368] This reservoir\r\nin each department or district is the Jacobin nursery of the principal\r\ntown; from this, they are sent into the bourgs and communes of the\r\nconscription. The central Jacobin nursery for France is in Paris, from\r\nwhence they are dispatched to the towns and departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Jacobins sent to the Provinces.\r\n\r\n     Importation of a staff of strangers.--Paris Jacobins sent\r\n     into the provinces.--Jacobins of enthusiastic towns deported\r\n     to moderate ones.--The Jacobins of a district headquarters\r\n     spread through the district.--Resistance of public opinion.\r\n     --Distribution and small number of really Jacobin agents.\r\n\r\nConsequently, swarms of Jacobin locusts spread from Paris out over\r\nthe provinces, and from the local country-towns over the surrounding\r\ncountry.--In this cloud of destructive insects, there are various\r\nfigures of different sizes: in the front rank, are the representatives\r\non mission, who are to take command in the departments; in the second\r\nrank, \"the political agents,\" who, assigned the duty of watching the\r\nneighboring frontier, take upon themselves the additional duty of\r\nleading the popular club of the town they reside in, or of urging on\r\nits administrative body.[3369] Besides that, there issue from the Paris\r\nheadquarters in the rue St. Honoré, select sans-culottes who, authorized\r\nor delegated by the Committee of Public Safety, proceed to Lyons,\r\nMarseilles, Bordeaux, Tonnerre, Rochefort and elsewhere, to act as\r\nmissionaries among the too inert population, or form the committees\r\nof action and the tribunals of extermination that are recruited with\r\ndifficulty on the spot.[3370]--Sometimes also, when a town has a bad\r\nrecord, the popular club of a sounder-minded city sends its delegates\r\nthere, to bring it into line; thus, four deputies of the Metz club\r\narrive without notice in Belfort, catechize their brethren, associate\r\nwith them on the local Revolutionary Committee, and, suddenly, without\r\nconsulting the municipality, or any other legal authority, draw up\r\na list of \"moderates, fanatics and egoists,\" on whom they impose an\r\nextraordinary tax of one hundred and thirty-six thousand six hundred and\r\nseventeen livres;[3371] in like manner, sixty delegates from the club\r\nof Côte-d'Or, Haute-Marne, Vosges, Moselle, Saone-et-Loire and\r\nMont-Terrible, all \"tempered by the white heat of Pére Duchesne,\"\r\nproceed to Strasbourg at the summons of the representatives, where,\r\nunder the title of \"propagandists,\" they are to regenerate the town.--At\r\nthe same time, in each department, the Jacobins of the principal town\r\nare found scattered along the high ways, that they may inspect their\r\ndomain and govern their subjects. Sometimes, it is the representative\r\non mission, who, personally, along with twenty \"hairy devils,\" makes\r\nhis round and shows off his traveling dictatorship; again, it is his\r\nsecretary or delegate who, in his place and in his name, comes to a\r\nsecond-class town and draws up his documents.[3372] At another time, it\r\nis \"a committee of investigation and propaganda\" which, \"chosen by\r\nthe club and provided with full powers,\" comes, in the name of the\r\nrepresentatives, to work up for a month all the communes of the\r\ndistrict.[3373] Again, finally, it is the revolutionary committee of\r\nthe principal town, which,\" declared central for the whole\r\ndepartment,\"[3374] delegates one or the other of its members to\r\ngo outside the walls, and purge and recompose suspected\r\nmunicipalities.--Thus does Jacobinism descend and spread itself, story\r\nafter story, from the Parisian center to the smallest and remotest\r\ncommune: throughout provincial France, whether colorless or of uncertain\r\ncolor, the imposed or imported administration imposes its red stigma.\r\n\r\nBut the stamp is only superficial; for the sans-culottes, naturally, are\r\nnot disposed to confer offices on any but men of their sort, while in\r\nthe provinces, especially in the rural districts, such men are rare. As\r\none of the representatives says: there is a \"dearth of subjects.\"--At\r\nMâcon, Javogues tries in vain;[3375] he finds in the club only\r\n\"disguised federalists;\" the people, he says, \"will not open their\r\neyes it seems to me that this blindness is due to the physique of the\r\ncountry, which is very rich.\" Naturally, he storms and dismisses; but,\r\neven in the revolutionary committee, none but dubious candidates are\r\npresented to him for selection; he does not know how to manage in order\r\nto renew the local authorities. \"They play into each others' hands,\" and\r\nhe ends by threatening to transfer the public institutions of the\r\ntown elsewhere, if they persist in proposing to him none but bad\r\npatriots.--At Strasbourg,[3376] Couturier, and Dentzel, on mission,\r\nreport that: \"owing to an unexampled coalition among all the capable\r\ncitizens, obstinately refusing to take the office of mayor, in order,\r\nby this course, to clog the wheels, and subject the representatives to\r\nrepeated and indecent refusals,\" he is compelled to appoint a young\r\nman, not of legal age, and a stranger in the department.--At Marseilles,\r\nwrite the agents,[3377] \"in spite of every effort and our ardent desire\r\nto republicanize the Marseilles people, our pains and fatigues are\r\nnearly all fruitless.... Public spirit among owners of property,\r\nmechanics and journey-men is everywhere detestable.... The number of\r\ndiscontented seems to increase from day to day. All the communes in Var,\r\nand most of those in this department are against us.... they constitute\r\na race to be destroyed, a country to be colonized anew....\r\n\r\n\"I repeat it, the only way to work out the Revolution in the federalized\r\ndepartments, and especially in this one, is to deport all the indigenous\r\npopulation who are able to bear arms, scatter them through the armies\r\nand put garrisons in their places, which, again, will have to be changed\r\nfrom time to time.\"--At the other extremity of the territory, in Alsace,\r\n\"republican sentiments are still in the cradle; fanaticism is extreme\r\nand incredible; the spirit of the inhabitants in general is in no\r\nrespect revolutionary... Nothing but the revolutionary army and the\r\nvenerated guillotine will cure them of their conceited aristocracy. The\r\nexecution of the laws depends on striking off the heads of the guilty,\r\nfor nearly all the rural municipalities are composed only of the rich,\r\nof clerks of former bailiffs, almost always devoted to the ancient\r\nrégime.\"[3378]--And in the rest of France, the population, less\r\nrefractory, is not more Jacobin; here where the people appear \"humble\r\nand submissive\" as in Lyons and Bordeaux, the inspectors report that\r\nit is wholly owing to terror;[3379] there, where opinion seems\r\nenthusiastic, as at Rochefort and Grenoble, they report that it is\r\n\"artificial heat.\"[3380] At Rochefort, zeal is maintained only \"by the\r\npresence of five or six Parisian Jacobins.\" At Grenoble, Chépy, the\r\npolitical agent and president of the club, writes that \"he is knocked\r\nup, worn out, and exhausted, in trying to keep up public spirit and\r\nmaintain it on a level with events,\" but he is \"conscious that, if he\r\nshould leave, all would crumble.\"--There are none other than Moderates\r\nat Brest, at Lille, at Dunkirk; if this or that department, the Nord,\r\nfor instance, hastened to accept the \"Montagnard\" constitution, it is\r\nonly a pretense: \"an infinitely small portion of the population answered\r\nfor the rest.\"[3381]--At Belfort, where \"from one thousand to twelve\r\nhundred fathers of families alone are counted,\" writes the agent,[3382]\r\n\"one popular club of thirty or forty members, at the most, maintains and\r\nenforces the love of liberty.\"--In Arras, \"out of three or four hundred\r\nmembers composing the popular club\" the weeding-out of 1793 has spared\r\nbut \"sixty-three, one tenth of whom are absent.\"[3383] At Toulouse, \"out\r\nof about fourteen hundred members\" who form the club, only three or four\r\nhundred remain after the weeding-out of 1793,[3384] \"mere machines,\r\nfor the most part,\" and \"whom ten or a dozen intriguers lead as they\r\nplease.\"--The same state of things exists elsewhere, a dozen or two\r\ndetermined Jacobins-twenty-two at Troyes, twenty-one at Grenoble, ten\r\nat Bordeaux, seven at Poitiers, as many at Dijon-constitute the active\r\nstaff of a large town:[3385] the whole number might sit around one\r\ntable.--The Jacobins, straining as they do to swell their numbers, only\r\nscatter their band; careful as they are in making their selections, they\r\nonly limit their number. They remain what they always have been, a\r\nsmall feudality of brigands superposed on conquered France.[3386] If\r\nthe terror they spread around multiplies their serfs, the horror they\r\ninspire diminishes their proselytes, while their minority remains\r\ninsignificant because, for their collaborators, they can have only those\r\njust like themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Quality of staff thus formed.\r\n\r\n     Quality of staff thus formed.--Social state of the agents.\r\n     --Their unfitness and bad conduct.--The administrators in\r\n     Seine-et-Marne.--Drunkenness and feasting.--Committees and\r\n     Municipalities in the Côte-d'Or.--Waste and extortions.\r\n     --Traffickers in favors at Bordeaux.--Seal breakers at Lyons.\r\n     --Monopolizers of national possessions.--Sales of personal\r\n     property.--Embezzlements and Frauds.-A procès-verbal in the\r\n     office of the mayor of Strasbourg.--Sales of real-estate.\r\n     --Commissioners on declarations at Toulouse.--The\r\n     administrative staff and clubs of buyers in Provence.--The\r\n     Revolutionary Committee of Nantes.\r\n\r\nBut when we regard the final and last set of officials of the\r\nrevolutionary government closely, in the provinces as well as at Paris,\r\nwe find among them we hardly anyone who is noteworthy except in vice,\r\ndishonesty and misconduct, or, at the very least, in stupidity and\r\ngrossness.--First, as is indicated by their name, they all must be, and\r\nnearly all are, sans-culottes, that is to say, men who live from day to\r\nday on their daily earnings, possessing no income from capital, confined\r\nto subordinate places, to petty trading, to manual services, lodged\r\nor encamped on the lowest steps of the social ladder, and therefore\r\nrequiring pay to enable them to attend to public business;[3387] it is\r\non this account that decrees and orders allow them wages of three,\r\nfive, six, ten, and even eighteen francs a day.--At Grenoble, the\r\nrepresentatives form the municipal body and the revolutionary committee,\r\nalong with two health-officers, three glovers, two farmers, one\r\ntobacco-merchant, one perfumer, one grocer, one belt-maker, one\r\ninnkeeper, one joiner, one shoemaker, one mason, while the official\r\norder by which they are installed, appoints \"Teyssière, licoriste,\"\r\nnational agent.[3388]--At Troyes,[3389] among the men in authority we\r\nfind a confectioner, a weaver, a journeyman-weaver, a hatter, a hosier,\r\na grocer, a carpenter, a dancing-master, and a policeman, while the\r\nmayor, Gachez, formerly a private soldier in the regiment of Vexin, was,\r\nwhen appointed, a school-teacher in the vicinity.--At Toulouse,[3390]\r\na man named Terrain, a pâté dealer, is installed as president of the\r\nadministration; the revolutionary committee is presided over by Pio,\r\na journeyman-barber; the inspiration, \"the soul of the club,\" is a\r\nconcierge, that of the prison.--The last and most significant trait is\r\nfound at Rochefort,[3391] where the president of the popular club is the\r\nexecutioner.--If such persons form the select body of officials in the\r\nlarge towns, what must they be in the small ones, in the bourgs and\r\nin the villages?\" Everywhere they are of the meanest\"[3392] cartmen,\r\nsabot--(wooden shoe) makers, thatchers, stone-cutters, dealers in\r\nrabbit-skins, day laborers, unemployed craftsmen, many without any\r\npursuit, or mere vagabonds who had already participated in riots or\r\njacqueries, bar flies, having given up work and designated for a public\r\ncareer only by their irregular habits and incompetence to follow\r\na private career.--Even in the large towns, it is evident that\r\ndiscretionary power has fallen into the hands of nearly raw barbarians;\r\none has only to note in the old documents, at the Archives, the\r\northography and style of the committees empowered to grant or refuse\r\ncivic cards, and draw up reports on the opinions and pursuits of\r\nprisoners. \"His opinions appear insipid (Ces opignons paroisse\r\ninsipide)[3393].... He is married with no children.\" (Il est marie cent\r\n(sans) enfants).... Her profession is wife of Paillot-Montabert, she is\r\nliving on her income, his relations are with a woman we pay no\r\nattention to; we presume her opinions are like her husband's.\"[3394] The\r\nhandwriting, unfortunately, cannot be represented here, being that of a\r\nchild five years old.[3395]\r\n\r\n\"As stupid as they are immoral,\"[3396] says Representative Albert,\r\nof the Jacobins he finds in office at Troyes. Low, indeed, as their\r\ncondition may be, their feeling and intelligence are yet lower because,\r\nin their professions or occupations, they are the refuse instead of\r\nthe élite, and, especially on this account, they are turned out after\r\nThermidor, some, it is true, as Terrorists, but the larger number as\r\neither dolts, scandalous or crazy, simply intruders, or mere valets.--At\r\nRheims, the president of the district is[3397] \"a former bailiff, on\r\nfamiliar terms with the spies of the Robespierre régime, acting in\r\nconcert with them, but without being their accomplice, possessing none\r\nof the requisite qualities for administration.\" Another administrator\r\nis likewise \"a former bailiff, without means, negligent in the\r\nhighest degree and a confirmed drunkard.\" Alongside of these sit \"a\r\nhorse-dealer, without any means, more fit for shady dealings than\r\ngoverning, moreover a drunkard, a dyer, lacking judgment, open to all\r\nsorts of influences, pushed ahead by the Jacobin faction, and having\r\nused power in the most arbitrary manner, rather, perhaps, through\r\nignorance than through cruelty, a shoemaker, entirely uninstructed,\r\nknowing only how to sign his name,\" and others of the same character. In\r\nthe Tribunal, a judge is noted as\r\n\r\n\"true in principle, but whom poverty and want of resources have driven\r\nto every excess, a turncoat according to circumstances in order to get\r\na place, associated with the leaders in order to keep the place, and\r\nyet not without sensibility, having, perhaps, acted criminally merely to\r\nkeep himself and his family alive.\"\r\n\r\nIn the municipal body, the majority is composed of an incompetent lot,\r\nsome of them being journeymen-spinners or thread twisters, and others\r\nsecond-hand dealers or shopkeepers, \"incapable,\" \"without means,\" with a\r\nfew crack-brains among them: one, \"his brain being crazed, absolutely\r\nof no account, anarchist and Jacobin;\" another, \"very dangerous through\r\nlack of judgment, a Jacobin, over-excited;\" a third, \"an instrument of\r\ntyranny, a man of blood capable of every vice, having assumed the\r\nname of Mutius Scoevola, of recognized depravity and unable to\r\nwrite.\"--Similarly, in the Aube districts, we find some of the heads\r\nfeverish with the prevailing epidemic, for instance, at Nogent,\r\nthe national agent, Delaporte, \"who has the words 'guillotine' and\r\n'revolutionary tribunal' always on his lips, and who declares that if\r\nhe were the government he would imprison doctor, surgeon and lawyer,\r\nwho delights in finding people guilty and says that he is never content\r\nexcept when he gets three pounds' weight of denunciations a day.\" But,\r\napart from these madcaps, most of the administrators or judges are\r\neither people wholly unworthy of their offices, because they are\r\n\"inept,\" \"too uneducated,\" \"good for nothing,\" \"too little familiar\r\nwith administrative forms,\" \"too little accustomed to judicial action,\"\r\n\"without information,\" \"too busy with their own affairs,\" \"unable to\r\nread or write,\" or, because \"they have no delicacy,\" are \"violent,\"\r\n\"agitators,\" \"knaves,\" \"without public esteem,\" and more or less\r\ndishonest and despised.[3398]--As an example a fellow from Paris, who\r\nwas at first at Troyes, a baker's apprentice,[3399] and afterwards a\r\ndancing-master; then he appeared at the Club, making headway, doubtless,\r\nthrough his Parisian chatter, until he stood first and soon became a\r\nmember of the district. Appointed an officer in the sixth battalion of\r\nAube, he behaved in such a manner in Vendée that, on his return, \"his\r\nbrethren in arms\" broke up the banner presented to him, \"declaring him\r\nunworthy of such an honor, because he cowardly fled before the enemy.\"\r\nNevertheless, after a short plunge, he came back to the surface and,\r\nthanks to his civil compeers, was reinstated in his administrative\r\nfunctions; during the Terror, he was intimate with all the Terrorists,\r\nbeing one of the important men of Troyes.--The mayor of the town,\r\nGachez, an old soldier and ex-schoolmaster, is of the same stuff as\r\nthis baker's apprentice. He, likewise, was a Vendéan hero; only, he was\r\nunable to distinguish himself as much as he liked, for, after enlisting,\r\nhe failed to march; having pocketed the bounty of three hundred livres,\r\nhe discovered that he had infirmities and, getting himself invalidated,\r\nhe served the nation in a civil capacity. \"His own partisans admit that\r\nhe is a drunkard and that he has committed forgery.\" Some months after\r\nThermidor he is sentenced to eight years imprisonment and put in the\r\npillory for this crime. Hence, \"almost the entire commune is against\r\nhim; the women in the streets jeer him, and the eight sections meet\r\ntogether to request his withdrawal.\" But Representative Bô reports that\r\nhe is every way entitled to remain, being a true Jacobin, an admirable\r\nterrorist and \"the only sans-culotte mayor which the commune of Troyes\r\nhas to be proud of.\"[33100]\r\n\r\nIt would be awarding too much honor to men of this stamp, to suppose\r\nthat they had convictions or principles; they were governed by\r\nanimosities and especially by their appetites,[33101] to satiate which\r\nthey[33102] made the most of their offices.--At Troyes, \"all provisions\r\nand foodstuffs are drawn upon to supply the table of the twenty-four\"\r\nsans-culottes[33103] to whom Bô entrusted the duty of weeding-out the\r\npopular club; before the organization of \"this regenerating nucleus\"\r\nthe revolutionary committee, presided over by Rousselin, the civil\r\ncommissioner, carried on its \"gluttony\" in the Petit-Louvre\r\ntavern, \"passing nights bozing\" and in the preparation of lists of\r\nsuspects.[33104] In the neighboring provinces of Dijon, Beaune, Semur\r\nand Aignayle-Duc, the heads of the municipality and of the club always\r\nmeet in taverns and bars. At Dijon, we see \"the ten or twelve Hercules\r\nof patriotism traversing the town, each with a chalice under his\r\narm:\"[33105] this is their drinking-cup; each has to bring his own\r\nto the Montagnard inn; there, they imbibe copiously, frequently, and\r\nbetween two glasses of wine \"declare who are outlaws.\" At Aignay-le-Duc,\r\na small town with only half a dozen patriots \"the majority of whom can\r\nscarcely write, most of them poor, burdened with families, and living\r\nwithout doing anything, never quit the bars, where, night and day,\r\nthey revel;\" their chief, a financial ex-procureur, now \"concierge,\r\narchivist, secretary and president of the popular club,\" holds municipal\r\ncouncil in the tavern. \"Should they go out it was to chase female\r\naristocrats,\" and one of them declares \"that if the half of Aignay were\r\nslaughtered the other half would be all the better for it.\"--There\r\nis nothing like drinking to excite ferocity to the highest pitch. At\r\nStrasbourg the sixty mustachioed propagandist lodged in the college in\r\nwhich they are settled fixtures, have a cook provided for them by the\r\ntown, and they revel day and night \"on the choice provisions put\r\nin requisition,\" \"on wines destined to the defenders of the\r\ncountry.\"[33106] It is, undoubtedly, when coming out from one of these\r\norgies that they proceed, sword in hand, to the popular club,[33107]\r\nvote and force others to vote \"death to all prisoners confined in the\r\nSeminary to the number of seven hundred, of every age and of both sexes,\r\nwithout any preliminary trial.\" For a man to become a good cut-throat,\r\nhe must first get intoxicated;[33108] such was the course pursued\r\nin Paris by those who did the work in September: the revolutionary\r\ngovernment being an organized, prolonged and permanent Septembrisade,\r\nmost of its agents are obliged to drink hard.[33109]--For the same\r\nreasons when the opportunity, as well as the temptation, to steal,\r\npresents itself, they steal.--At first, during six months, and up to the\r\ndecree assigning them pay, the revolutionary committees \"take their pay\r\nthemselves;\"[33110] they then add to their legal salary of three and\r\nfive francs a day about what they please: for it is they who assess the\r\nextraordinary taxes, and often, as at Montbrison, \"without making any\r\nlist or record of collections.\" On Frimaire 16, year II., the financial\r\ncommittee reports that \"the collection and application of extraordinary\r\ntaxes is unknown to the government; that it was impossible to supervise\r\nthem, the National treasury having received no sums whatever arising\r\nfrom these taxes.\"[33111] Two years after, four years after, the\r\naccounts of revolutionary taxation of forced loans, and of pretended\r\nvoluntary gifts, still form a bottomless pit; out of forty billions of\r\naccounts rendered to the National Treasury only twenty are found to be\r\nverified; the rest are irregular and worthless. Besides, in many cases,\r\nnot only is the voucher worthless or not forthcoming, but, again, it\r\nis proved that the sums collected disappeared wholly or in part. At\r\nVillefranche, out of one hundred and thirty-eight thousand francs\r\ncollected, the collector of the district deposited but forty-two\r\nthousand; at Baugency, out of more than five hundred thousand francs\r\ncollected, there were only fifty thousand deposited; at la Réole, out\r\nof at least five hundred thousand francs collected, there were but\r\ntwenty-two thousand six hundred and fifty deposited. \"The rest,\"\r\nsays the collector at Villefranche, \"were wasted by the Committee\r\nof Surveillance.\" \"The tax-collectors,\" writes the national-agent at\r\nOrleans, \"after having employed terror gave themselves up to orgies and\r\nare now building palaces.\"[33112]--As to the expenses which they claim,\r\nthey almost always consist of \"indemnities to members of revolutionary\r\ncommittees, to patriots, and to defray the cost of patriotic missions,\"\r\nto maintaining and repairing the meeting-rooms of the popular clubs, to\r\nmilitary expeditions, and to succoring the poor, so that three or four\r\nhundred millions in gold or silver, extorted before the end of 1793,\r\nhundreds of millions of assignats extorted in 1793 and 1794, in short,\r\nalmost the entire product of the total extraordinary taxation[33113]\r\nwas consumed on the spot and by the sans-culottes. Seated at the\r\npublic banqueting table they help themselves first, and help themselves\r\ncopiously.\r\n\r\nA second windfall, equally gross. Enjoying the right to dispose\r\narbitrarily of fortunes, liberties and lives, they can traffic in these,\r\nwhile no traffic can be more advantageous, both for buyers and sellers.\r\nAny man who is rich or well-off, in other words, every man who is likely\r\nto be taxed, imprisoned or guillotined, gladly consents \"to compound,\"\r\nto redeem himself and those who belong to him. If he is prudent, he\r\npays, before the tax, so as not to be over-taxed; he pays, after the\r\ntax, to obtain a diminution or delays; he pays to be admitted into the\r\npopular club. When danger draws near he pays to obtain or renew his\r\ncertificate of civism, not to be declared \"suspect,\" not to be\r\ndenounced as a conspirator. After being denounced, he pays to be allowed\r\nimprisonment at home rather than in the jail, to be allowed imprisonment\r\nin the jail rather than in the general prison, to be well treated if he\r\ngets into this, to have time to get together his proofs in evidence,\r\nto have his record (dossier) placed and kept at the bottom of the file\r\namong the clerk's registers, to avoid being inscribed on the next batch\r\nof cases in the revolutionary Tribunal. There is not one of these favors\r\nthat is not precious; consequently, ransoms without number are tendered,\r\nwhile the rascals[33114] who swarm on the revolutionary committees, need\r\nbut open their hands to fill their pockets. They run very little risk,\r\nfor they are held in check only by their own kind, or are not checked at\r\nall. In any large town, two of them suffice for the issue of a warrant\r\nof arrest save a reference to the Committee within twenty-four hours,\r\nwith the certainty that their colleagues will kindly return the\r\nfavor.[33115] Moreover, the clever ones know how to protect themselves\r\nbeforehand. For example, at Bordeaux, where one of these clandestine\r\nmarkets had been set up, M. Jean Davilliers, one of the partners in a\r\nlarge commercial house, is under arrest in his own house, guarded by\r\nfour sans-culottes; on the 8th of Brumaire, he is taken aside and\r\ntold \"that he is in danger if he does not come forward and meet\r\nthe indispensable requirements of the Revolution in its secret\r\nexpenditures.\" An important figure, Lemoal, member of the revolutionary\r\ncommittee and administrator of the district, had spoken of these\r\nrequirements and thought that M. Davilliers should contribute the sum of\r\none hundred and fifty thousand livres. Upon this, a knock at the door\r\nis heard; Lemoal enters and all present slip out of the room, and Lemoal\r\npronounces these words only: \"Do you consent?\"--\"But I cannot thus\r\ndispose of my partners' property.\"--\"Then you will go to prison.\" At\r\nthis threat the poor man yields and gives his note to Lemoal at twenty\r\ndays, payable to bearer, for one hundred and fifty thousand livres, and,\r\nat the end of a fortnight, by dint of pushing his claims, obtains his\r\nfreedom. Thereupon, Lemoal thinks the matter over, and deems it prudent\r\nto cover up his private extortion by a public one. Accordingly, he sends\r\nfor M. Davilliers: \"It is now essential for you to openly contribute\r\none hundred and fifty thousand livres more for the necessities of the\r\nRepublic. I will introduce you to the representatives to whom you should\r\nmake the offer.\" The chicken being officially plucked in this way,\r\nnobody would suppose that it had been first privately plucked, and,\r\nmoreover, the inquisitive, if there were any, would be thrown off\r\nthe scent by the confusion arising from two sums of equal amount. M.\r\nDavilliers begs to be allowed to consult his partners, and, as they are\r\nnot in prison, they refuse. Lemoal, on his side, is anxious to receive\r\nthe money for his note, while poor Davilliers, \"struck with terror by\r\nnocturnal arrests,\" and seeing that Lemoal is always on the top of the\r\nladder, concludes to pay; at first, he gives him thirty thousand livres,\r\nand next, the charges, amounting in all to forty-one thousand livres,\r\nwhen, being at the end of his resources, he begs and entreats to have\r\nhis note returned to him. Lemoal, on this, considering the chicken as\r\nentirely stripped, becomes mollified, and tears off in presence of his\r\ndebtor \"the signature in full of the note,\" and, along with this, his\r\nown receipts for partial payments underneath. But he carefully preserves\r\nthe note itself, for, thus mutilated, it will show, if necessary, that\r\nhe had not received anything, and that, through patriotism, he had\r\nundoubtedly wished to force a contribution from a merchant, but,\r\nfinding him insolvent, had humanely canceled the written\r\nobligation.[33116]--Such are the precautions taken in this business.\r\nOthers, less shrewd, rob more openly, among others the mayor, the seven\r\nmembers of the military commission surnamed \"the seven mortal sins,\"\r\nand especially their president, Lacombe, who, by promising releases,\r\nextracts from eight or nine captives three hundred and fifty-nine\r\nthousand six hundred livres.[33117] \"Through such schemes,\" writes\r\na rigid Jacobin,[33118] \"many of those who had been declared outlaws\r\nreturned to Bordeaux by paying; of the number who thus redeemed their\r\nlives, some did not deserve to lose it, but, nevertheless, they were\r\nthreatened with execution if they did not consent to everything. But\r\nmaterial proofs of this are hard to obtain. These men now keep silent,\r\nfor fear, through open denunciation, of sharing in the penalty of the\r\ntraffickers in justice, and being unwilling to expose (anew) the life\r\nthey have preserved.\" In short, the plucked pigeon is mute, so as not\r\nto attract attention, as well as to avoid the knife; and all the more,\r\nbecause those who pluck him hold on to the knife and might, should he\r\ncry out, dispatch him with the more celerity. Even if he makes no noise,\r\nthey sometimes dispatch him so as to stifle in advance any possible\r\noutcry, which happened to the Duc du Chatelet and others. There is but\r\none mode of self-preservation[33119] and that is, \"to settle with such\r\nmasters by installments, to pay them monthly, like wet nurses, on a\r\nscale proportionate to the activity of the guillotine.\"--In any event,\r\nthe pirates are not disturbed, for the trade in lives and liberties\r\nleaves no trace behind it, and is carried on with impunity for two\r\nyears, from one end of France to the other, according to a tacit\r\nunderstanding between sellers and buyers.\r\n\r\nThere is a third windfall, not less large, but carried on in more\r\nopen sunshine and therefore still more enticing.--Once the \"suspect is\r\nincarcerated, whatever he brings to prison along with him, whatever\r\nhe leaves behind him at home, becomes plunder; for, with the\r\nincompleteness, haste and irregularity of papers,[33120] with the lack\r\nof surveillance and known connivance, the vultures, great and small,\r\ncould freely use their beaks and talons.--At Toulouse, as in Paris and\r\nelsewhere, commissioners take from prisoners every object of value and,\r\naccordingly, in many cases, all gold, silver, assignats, and jewelry,\r\nwhich, confiscated for the Treasury, stop half-way in the hands of those\r\nwho make the seizure.[33121] At Poitiers, the seven scoundrels who\r\nform the ruling oligarchy, admit, after Thermidor, that they stole the\r\neffects of arrested parties.[33122] At Orange, \"Citoyenne Riot,\" wife of\r\nthe public prosecutor, and \"citoyennes Fernex and Ragot,\" wives of two\r\njudges, come in person to the record-office to make selections from the\r\nspoils of the accused, taking for their wardrobe silver shoe-buckles,\r\nlaces and fine linen.[33123]--But all that the accused, the imprisoned\r\nand fugitives can take with them, amounts to but little in comparison\r\nwith what they leave at home, that is to say, under sequestration. All\r\nthe religious or seignorial chateaux and mansions in France are in\r\nthis plight, along with their furniture, and likewise most of the fine\r\nbourgeois mansions, together with a large number of minor residences,\r\nwell-furnished and supplied through provincial economy; besides these,\r\nnearly every warehouse and store belonging to large manufacturers and\r\nleading commercial houses; all this forms colossal spoil, such as was\r\nnever seen before, consisting of objects one likes to possess, gathered\r\nin vast lots, which lots are distributed by hundreds of thousands over\r\nthe twenty-six thousand square miles of territory. There are no owners\r\nfor this property but the nation, an indeterminate, invisible personage;\r\nno barrier other than so many seals exists between the spoils and the\r\ndespoilers, that is to say, so many strips of paper held fast by two\r\nill-applied and indistinct stamps. Bear in mind, too, that the guardians\r\nof the spoil are the sans-culottes who have made a conquest of it; that\r\nthey are poor; that such a profusion of useful or precious objects makes\r\nthem feel the bareness of their homes all the more; that their wives\r\nwould like to lay in a stock of furniture; moreover, has it not held\r\nout to them from the beginning of the Revolution, that \"forty-thousand\r\nmansions, palaces and chateaux, two-thirds of the property of France,\r\nwould be the reward of their valor?\"[33124] At this very moment, does\r\nnot the representative on mission authorize their greed? Are not Albitte\r\nand Collot d'Herbois at Lyons, Fouché at Nevers, Javogues at Montbrison,\r\nproclaiming that the possessions of anti-revolutionaries and a surplus\r\nof riches form \"the patrimony of the sans-culottes?\"[33125] Do they not\r\nread in the proclamations of Monestier,[33126] that the peasants \"before\r\nleaving home may survey and measure off the immense estates of their\r\nseigneurs, choose, for example, on their return, whatever they want\r\nto add to their farm.. .. tacking on a bit of field or rabbit-warren\r\nbelonging to the former count or marquis?\" Why not take a portion of\r\nhis furniture, any of his beds or clothes-presses--It is not surprising\r\nthat, after this, the slip of paper which protects sequestrated\r\nfurniture and confiscated merchandise should be ripped off by gross and\r\ngreedy hands! When, after Thermidor, the master returns to his own roof\r\nit is generally to an empty house; in this or that habitation in the\r\nMorvan,[33127] the removal of the furniture is so complete that a bin\r\nturned upside down serves for a table and chairs, when the family sit\r\ndown to their first meal.\r\n\r\nIn the towns the embezzlements are often more brazenly carried out than\r\nin the country. At Valenciennes, the Jacobin chiefs of the\r\nmunicipality are known under the title of \"seal-breakers and patriotic\r\nrobbers.\"[33128] At Lyons, the Maratists, who dub themselves \"the\r\nfriends of Chalier,\" are, according to the Jacobins' own admission,\r\n\"brigands, thieves and rascals.\"[33129] They compose, to the number\r\nof three or four hundred, the thirty-two revolutionary committees; one\r\nhundred and fifty of leaders, \"all of them administrators,\" form the\r\npopular club; in this town of one hundred and twenty thousand souls they\r\nnumber, as they themselves state, three thousand, and they firmly rely\r\non \"sharing with each other the wealth of Lyons. This huge cake belongs\r\nto them; they do not allow that strangers, Parisians, should have a\r\nslice,[33130] and they intend to eat the whole of it, at discretion,\r\nwithout control, even to the last crumb. As to their mode of operations,\r\nit consists in \"selling justice, in trading on denunciations, in holding\r\nunder sequestration at least four thousand households,\" in putting seals\r\neverywhere on dwellings and warehouses, in not summoning interested\r\nparties who might watch their proceedings, in expelling women, children\r\nand servants who might testify to their robberies, in not drawing up\r\ninventories, in installing themselves as \"guardians at five francs a\r\nday,\" themselves or their boon companions, and in \"general squandering,\r\nin league with the administrators.\" It is impossible to stay their\r\nhands or repress them, even for the representatives. Take them in the\r\nact,[33131] and you must shut your eyes or they will all shout at the\r\noppression of patriots; they do this systematically so that nobody may\r\nbe followed up.\r\n\r\nWe passed an order forbidding any authority to remove seals without our\r\nconsent, and, in spite of the prohibition, they broke into a storehouse\r\nunder sequestration,.... forced the locks and pillaged, under our own\r\neyes, the very house we occupy. And who are these devastators? Two\r\ncommissioners of the Committee who emptied the storehouse without our\r\nwarrant, and even without having any power from the Committee.\"--It is\r\na sack in due form, and day after day; it began on the 10th of October,\r\n1793; it continued after, without interruption, and we have just seen\r\nthat, on Floréal 28, year II., that is to say, April 26, 1794, after one\r\nhundred and twenty-three days, it is still maintained.\r\n\r\nThe last mad scramble and the most extensive of all.--In spite of the\r\nsubterfuges of its agents, the Republic, having stolen immensely, and\r\nalthough robbed in its turn, could still hold on to a great deal; and\r\nfirst, to articles of furniture which could not be easily abstracted,\r\nto large lots of merchandise, also to the vast spoil of the palaces,\r\nchateaux and churches; next, and above all, to real estate, fixtures and\r\nbuildings. To meet its expenses it put all that up for sale, and whoever\r\nwants anything has only to come forward as a buyer, the last bidder\r\nbecoming the legal owner and at a cheap rate. The wood cut down in one\r\nyear very often pays for a whole forest.[33132] Sometimes a chateau can\r\nbe paid for by a sale of the iron-railings of the park, or the lead\r\non the roof.--Here are found chances for a good many bargains, and\r\nespecially with objects of art. \"The titles alone of the articles\r\ncarried off, destroyed or injured, would fill volumes.\"[33133] On the\r\none hand, the commissioners on inventories and adjudications, \"having\r\nto turn a penny on the proceeds of sales,\" throw on the market all\r\nthey can, \"avoiding reserving\" objects of public utility and sending\r\ncollections and libraries to auction with a view to get their\r\npercentages. On the other hand, nearly all these commissioners are\r\nbrokers or second-hand dealers who alone know the value of rarities,\r\nand openly depreciate them in order to buy them in themselves, \"and thus\r\nensure for themselves exorbitant profits.\" In certain cases the official\r\nguardians and purchasers who are on the look-out take the precaution\r\nto disfigure \"precious articles\" so as to have them bought by their\r\nsubstitutes and accomplices: \"for instance, they convert sets of books\r\ninto odd volumes, and take machines to pieces; the tube and object-glass\r\nof a telescope are separated, which pieces the rogues who have bought\r\nthem cheap know how to put together again.\" Often, in spite of the\r\nseals, they take in advance antiques, pieces of jewelry, medals,\r\nenamels and engraved stones;\" nothing is easier, for \"even in Paris in\r\nThermidor, year II., agents of the municipality use anything with which\r\nto make a stamp, buttons, and even large pennies, so that whoever has\r\na sou can remove and re-stamp the seals as he pleases;\" having been\r\nsuccessful, \"they screen their thefts by substituting cut pebbles\r\nand counterfeit stones for real ones.\" Finally, at the auction sales,\r\n\"fearing the honesty or competition of intelligent judges, they offer\r\nmoney (to these) to stay away from the sales; one case is cited where\r\nthey have knocked a prospective bidder down.\" In the meantime, at the\r\nclub, they shout with all their might; this, with the protection of a\r\nmember of the municipality or of the Revolutionary Committee, shelters\r\nthem from all suspicion. As for the protector, he gets his share without\r\ncoming out into the light. Accuse, if you dare, a republican functionary\r\nwho secretly, or even openly, profits by these larcenies; he will show\r\nclean hands.--Such is the incorruptible patriot, the only one of his\r\nspecies, whom the representatives discover at Strasbourg, and whom they\r\nappoint mayor at once. On the 10th of Vendémiaire, year III.,[33134]\r\nthere is found \"in his apartments\" a superb and complete assortment of\r\necclesiastical objects, \"forty-nine copes and chasubles, silk or satin,\r\ncovered with gold or silver; fifty-four palles of the same description;\"\r\na quantity of \"reliquaries, vases and spoons, censers, laces, silver and\r\ngold fringe, thirty-two pieces of silk,\" etc. None of these fine things\r\nbelong to him; they are the property of citizen Mouet, his father. This\r\nprudent parent, taking his word for it, \"deposited them for safe keeping\r\nin his son's house during the month of June, 1792 (old style);\"--could a\r\ngood son refuse his father such a slight favor? It is very certain that,\r\nin '93 and '94, during the young man's municipal dictatorship, the\r\nelder did not pay the Strasbourg Jew brokers too much, and that they did\r\nbusiness in an off-hand way. By what right could a son and magistrate\r\nprevent his father, a free individual, from looking after \"his own\r\naffairs\" and buying according to trade principles, as cheap as he could?\r\n\r\nIf such are the profits on the sale of personal property, what must they\r\nbe on the sale of real estate?--It is on this traffic that the fortunes\r\nof the clever terrorists are founded. It accounts for the \"colossal\r\nwealth peaceably enjoyed,\" after Thermidor, of the well-known \"thieves\"\r\nwho, before Thermidor, were so many \"little Robespierres,\" each in his\r\nown canton, \"the patriots\" who, around Orleans, \"built palaces,\" who,\r\n\"exclusives\" at Valenciennes, \"having wasted both public and private\r\nfunds, possess the houses and property of emigrants, knocked down to\r\nthem at a hundred times less than their value.\"[33135] On this side,\r\ntheir outstretched fingers shamelessly clutch all they can get hold of;\r\nfor the obligation of each arrested party to declare his name, quality\r\nand fortune, as it now is and was before the Revolution, gives local\r\ncupidity a known, sure, direct and palpable object.--At Toulouse, says a\r\nprisoner,[33136] \"the details and value of an object were taken down as\r\nif for a succession,\" while the commissioners who drew up the statement,\r\n\"our assassins, proceeded, beforehand and almost under our eyes, to take\r\ntheir share, disputing with each other on the choice and suitableness\r\nof each object, comparing the cost of adjudication with the means of\r\nlessening it, discussing the certain profits of selling again and of the\r\ntransfer, and consuming in advance the pickings arising from sales and\r\nleases.\"--In Provence, where things are more advanced and corruption\r\nis greater than elsewhere, where the purport and aims of the Revolution\r\nwere comprehended at the start, it is still worse. Nowhere did Jacobin\r\nrulers display their real character more openly, and nowhere, from\r\n1789 to 1799, was this character so well maintained. At Toulon, the\r\ndemagogues in the year V., as in the year II., are[33137] \"former\r\nworkmen and clerks in the Arsenal who had become 'bosses' by acting as\r\ninformers and through terrorism, getting property for nothing, or at an\r\ninsignificant price, and plotting sales of national possessions, petty\r\ntraders from all quarters with stocks of goods acquired in all sorts of\r\nways, through robberies, through purchases of stolen goods from servants\r\nand employees in the civil, war and navy departments, and through\r\nabandoned or bought-up claims; in a word, men who, having run away from\r\nother communes, pass their days in coffee-houses and their nights in\r\nhouses of ill-fame.\"--At Draguignan, Brignolles, Vidauban, Fréjus,\r\nat Marseilles, after Thermidor, the intermittent returns to Terrorism\r\nalways restore the same quarries of the justiciary and the police to\r\noffice.[33138] \"Artisans, once useful, but now tired of working,\r\nand whom the profession of paid clubbists, idle guardians,\" and paid\r\nlaborers \"has totally demoralized,\" scoundrels in league with each\r\nother and making money out of whatever they can lay their hands on,\r\nlike thieves at a fair, habitually living at the expense of the public,\r\n\"bestowing the favors of the nation on those who share their principles,\r\nharboring and aiding many who are under the ban of the law and calling\r\nthemselves model patriots,[33139] that is, in the pay of gambling hells\r\nand houses of prostitution.\"--In the rural districts, the old bands\r\n\"consisting of hordes of homeless brigands\" who worked so well during\r\nthe anarchy of the Constituent and Legislative assemblies, form anew\r\nduring the anarchy of the Directory; they make their appearance in the\r\nvicinity of Apt \"commencing with petty robberies and then, strong in\r\nthe impunity and title of sans-culottes, break into farm-houses, rob and\r\nmassacre the inmates, strip travelers, put to ransom all who happen\r\nto cross their path, force open and pillage houses in the commune of\r\nGorges, stop women in the streets, tear off their rings and crosses,\"\r\nand attack the hospital, sacking it from top to bottom, while the\r\ntown and military officers, just like them, allow them to go\r\non.[33140]--Judge by this of their performances in the time of\r\nRobespierre, when the vendors and administrators of the national\r\npossessions exercised undisputed control. Everywhere, at that time,\r\nin the departments of Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, and Vaucluse, \"a club of\r\nwould-be patriots\" had long prepared the way for their exactions. It\r\nhad \"paid appraisers for depreciating whatever was put up for sale,\r\nand false names for concealing real purchasers; \"a person not of their\r\nclique, was excluded from the auction-room; if he persisted in coming in\r\nthey would, at one time, put him under contribution for the privilege\r\nof bidding,\" and, at another time, make him promise not to bid above the\r\nprice fixed by the league, while, to acquire the domain, they paid him\r\na bonus. Consequently, \"national property\" was given away \"for\r\nalmost nothing,\" the swindlers who acquired it never being without a\r\nsatisfactory warrant for this in their own eyes. Into whose hands could\r\nthe property of anti-revolutionists better fall than into those of\r\npatriots? According to Marat, the martyr apostle and canonised saint of\r\nthe Revolution, what is the object of the Revolution but to give to\r\nthe lowly the fortunes of the great?[33141] In all national sales\r\neverywhere, in guarding sequestrations, in all revolutionary ransoms,\r\ntaxes, loans and seizures, the same excellent argument prevails;\r\nnowhere, in printed documents or in manuscripts, do I find any\r\nrevolutionary committee which is at once terrorist and honest. Only,\r\nit is rare to find specific and individual details regarding all the\r\nmembers of the same committee.--Here, however, is one case, where, owing\r\nto the lucky accident of an examination given in detail, one can observe\r\nin one nest, every variety of the species and of its appetites, the\r\ndozen or fifteen types of the Jacobin hornet, each abstracting what\r\nsuits him from whatever he lights on, each indulging in his favorite\r\nsort of rapine.--At Nantes, \"Pinard, the great purveyor of the\r\nCommittee,[33142] orders everything that each member needs for his daily\r\nuse to be carried to his house.\"--\"Gallou takes oil and brandy,\"\r\nand especially \"several barrels from citizen Bissonneau's\r\nhouse.\"--\"Durassier makes domiciliary visits and exacts contributions;\"\r\namong others \"he compels citizen Lemoine to pay twenty-five hundred\r\nlivres, to save him from imprisonment.\"--\"Naud affixes and removes\r\nseals in the houses of the incarcerated, makes nocturnal visits to\r\nthe dwellings of the accused and takes what suits him.\"--\"Grandmaison\r\nappropriates plate under sequestration, and Bachelier plate given as\r\na present.\"--\"Joly superintends executions and takes all he can find,\r\nplate, jewelry, precious objects.\"--\"Bolognié forces the return of a\r\nbond of twenty thousand livres already paid to him.\"--Perrochaux demands\r\nof citoyenne Ollemard-Dudan \"fifty thousand livres, to prevent her\r\nimprisonment,\" and confiscates for his own benefit sixty thousand\r\nlivres worth of tobacco, in the house of the widow Daigneau-Mallet,\r\nwho, claiming it back, is led off by him to prison under the pretext of\r\ninterceding for her.--Chaux frightens off by terrorism his competitors\r\nat auction sales, has all the small farms on the Baroissière domain\r\nknocked down to him, and exclaims concerning a place which suits him: \"I\r\nknow how to get it! I'll have the owner arrested. He'll be very glad\r\nto let me have his ground to get out of prison.' \"--The collection is\r\ncomplete, and gathered on a table, it offers specimens which can be\r\nfound scattered all over France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. The Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n     The Armed Force, the National Guard and the Gendarmerie.\r\n     --Its purgation and composition.--The Revolutionary Armies in\r\n     Paris and in the departments.--Quality of the recruits.\r\n     --Their employment.--Their expeditions into the countryside\r\n     and the towns.--Their exploits in the vicinity of Paris and\r\n     Lyons.--The company of Maratists, the American Hussars and\r\n     the German Legion at Nantes.--General character of the\r\n     Revolutionary government and of the administrative staff of\r\n     the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\nThe last manipulators of the system remain, the hands which seize, the\r\narmed force which takes bodily hold of men and things.--The first who\r\nare employed for this purpose are the National Guard and the ordinary\r\ngendarmerie. Since 1790, these bodies are of course constantly weeded\r\nout until only fanatics and robots are left;[33143] nevertheless,\r\nthe weeding-out continues as the system develops itself. At\r\nStrasbourg,[33144] on Brumaire 14, the representatives have dismissed,\r\narrested and sent to Dijon the entire staff of the National Guard\r\nto serve as hostages until peace is secured; three days afterwards,\r\nconsidering that the cavalry of the town had been mounted and equipped\r\nat its own expense, they deem it aristocratic, bourgeois, and \"suspect,\"\r\nand seize the horses and put the officers in arrest.--At Troyes,\r\nRousselin, \"National civil commissioner,\" dismisses, for the same\r\nreason, and with not less dispatch, all of the gendarmes at one stroke,\r\nexcept four, and \"puts under requisition their horses, fully\r\nequipped, also their arms, so as to at once mount well known and tried\r\nsans-culottes.\" On principle, the poor sans-culottes, who are true at\r\nheart and in dress, alone have the right to bear arms, and should a\r\nbourgeois be on duty he must have only a pike, care being taken to take\r\nit away from him the moment he finishes his rounds.[33145]\r\n\r\nBut, alongside of the usual armed force, there is still another, much\r\nbetter selected and more effective, the reserve gendarmerie, a special,\r\nand, at the same time, movable and resident body, that is to say, the\r\n\"revolutionary army,\" which, after September 5, 1793, the government\r\nhad raised in Paris and in most of the large towns.--That of Paris,\r\ncomprising six thousand men, with twelve hundred cannoneers, sends\r\ndetachments into the provinces--two thousand men to Lyons, and two\r\nhundred to Troyes;[33146] Ysabeau and Tallien have at Bordeaux a corps\r\nof three thousand men; Salicetti, Albitte and Gasparin, one of two\r\nthousand men at Marseilles; Ysoré and Duquesnoy, one of one thousand men\r\nat Lille; Javogues, one of twelve hundred at Montbrison. Others,\r\nless numerous, ranging from six hundred down to two hundred men,\r\nhold Moulins, Grenoble, Besançon, Belfort, Bourg, Dijon, Strasbourg,\r\nToulouse, Auch and Nantes.[33147] When, on March 27, 1794, the Committee\r\nof Public Safety, threatened by Hébert, has them disbanded for being\r\nHébertists, in any of them are to remain at least as a nucleus, under\r\nvarious forms and names, either as kept by the local administration\r\nunder the title of \"paid guards,\"[33148] or as disbanded soldiers,\r\nloitering about and doing nothing, getting themselves assigned posts of\r\nrank in the National Guard of their town on account of their exploits;\r\nin this way they keep themselves in service, which is indispensable,\r\nfor it is through these that the régime is established and lasts. \"The\r\nrevolutionary army,[33149] say the orders and decrees promulgated, \"is\r\nintended to repress anti-revolutionaries, to execute, whenever it is\r\nfound necessary, revolutionary laws and measures for public safety,\"\r\nthat is to say, \"to guard those who are shut up, arrest 'suspects,'\r\ndemolish chateaux, pull down belfries, ransack vestries for gold and\r\nsilver objects, seize fine horses and carriages,\" and especially \"to\r\nseek for private stores and monopolies,\" in short, to exercise manual\r\nconstraint and strike every one on the spot with physical terror.--We\r\nreadily see what sort of soldiers the revolutionary army is composed of.\r\n\r\nNaturally, as it is recruited by voluntary enlistment, and all\r\ncandidates have passed the purifying scrutiny of the clubs, it comprises\r\nnone but ultra-Jacobins. Naturally, the pay being forty sous a day, it\r\ncomprises none but the very lowest class. Naturally, as the work is as\r\nloathsome as it is atrocious, it comprises but few others[33150] than\r\nthose out of employment and reduced to an enlistment to get a living,\r\n\"hairdressers without customers, lackeys without places, vagabonds,\r\nwretches unable to earn a living by honest labor,\" \"thick and hard\r\nhitters\" who have acquired the habit of bullying, knocking down and\r\nkeeping honest folks under their pikes, a gang of confirmed scoundrels\r\nmaking public brigandage a cloak for private brigandage, inhabitants of\r\nthe slums glad to bring down their former superiors into the mud, and\r\nthemselves take precedence and strut about in order to prove by their\r\narrogance and self-display that they, in their turn, are princes.--\"Take\r\na horse, the nation pays for it!\"[33151] said the sans-culottes\r\nof Bordeaux to their comrades in the street, who, \"in a splendid\r\nprocession,\" of three carriages, each drawn by six horses, escorted by\r\na body on horseback, behind, in front, and each side, conducting Riouffe\r\nand two other \"suspects\" to the Réole prison. The commander of the squad\r\nwho guards prisoners on the way to Paris, and who \"starves them along\r\nthe road to speculate on them,\" is an ex-cook of Agen, having become\r\na gendarme; he makes them travel forty leagues extra, \"purposely to\r\nglorify himself,\" and \"let all Agen see that he has government money to\r\nspend, and that he can put citizens in irons.\" Accordingly, in Agen, \"he\r\nkeeps constantly and needlessly inspecting the vehicle,\" winking at\r\nthe spectators, \"more triumphant than if he had made a dozen Austrians\r\nprisoners and brought them along himself.\" At last, to show the crowd in\r\nthe street the importance of his capture, he summons two blacksmiths\r\nto come out and rivet, on the legs of each prisoner, a cross-bar\r\ncannon-ball weighing eighty pounds.[33152] The more display these\r\nhenchmen make of their brutality, the greater they think themselves. At\r\nBelfort, a patriot of the club dies, and a civic interment takes place;\r\na detachment of the revolutionary army joins the procession; the men are\r\narmed with axes; on reaching the cemetery, the better to celebrate the\r\nfuneral, \"they cut down all the crosses (over the graves) and make\r\na bonfire of them, while the carmagnole ends this ever memorable\r\nday.\"[33153]--Sometimes the scene, theatrical and played by the light\r\nof flambeaux, makes the actors think that they have performed an\r\nextraordinary and meritorious action, \"that they have saved the\r\ncountry.\" \"This very night,\" writes the agent at Bordeaux,[33154] nearly\r\nthree thousand men have been engaged in an important undertaking, with\r\nthe members of the Revolutionary Committee and of the municipality at\r\nthe head of it. They visited every wholesale dealer's store in town and\r\nin the Faubourg des Chartrons, taking possession of their letter-books,\r\nsealing up their desks, arresting the merchants and putting them in\r\nthe Seminiare.... Woe to the guilty!\"--If the prompt confinement of an\r\nentire class of individuals is a fine thing for a town, the seizure of\r\na whole town itself is still more imposing. Leaving Marseilles with\r\na small army,[33155] commanded by two sans-culottes, they surround\r\nMartigne and enter it as if it were a mill. The catch is superb; in this\r\ntown of five thousand souls there are only seventeen patriots; the\r\nrest are Federalists or Moderates. Hence a general disarmament\r\nand domiciliary visits. The conquerors depart, carrying off every\r\nable-bodied boy, \"five hundred lads subject to the conscription, and\r\nleave in the town a company of sans-culottes to enforce obedience.\"\r\nIt is certain that obedience will be maintained and that the garrison,\r\njoined to the seventeen patriots, will do as they like with their\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nIn effect, all, both bodies and goods, are at their disposal, and they\r\nconsequently begin with the surrounding countryside, entering private\r\nhouses to get at their stores, also the farmhouses to have the grain\r\nthreshed, in order to verify the declarations of their owners and see if\r\nthese are correct: if the grain is not threshed out at once it will be\r\ndone summarily and confiscated, while the owner will be sentenced\r\nto twelve months in irons; if the declaration is not correct, he is\r\ncondemned as a monopolist and punished with death. Armed with this\r\norder,[33156] each band takes the field and gathers together not only\r\ngrain, but supplies of every description. \"That of Grenoble, the agent\r\nwrites,[33157] does wonderfully; in one little commune alone, four\r\nhundred measures of wheat, twelve hundred eggs, and six hundred pounds\r\nof butter had been found. All this was quickly on the way to Grenoble.\"\r\nIn the vicinity of Paris, the forerunners of the throng, provided \"with\r\npitchforks and bayonets, rush to the farms, take oxen out of their\r\nstalls, grab sheep and chickens, burn the barns, and sell their booty\r\nto speculators.\"[33158] \"Bacon, eggs, butter and chickens--the peasants\r\nsurrender whatever is demanded of them, and thenceforth have nothing\r\nthat they can take to market. They curse the Republic which has brought\r\nwar and famine on them, and nevertheless they do what they are told:\r\non being addressed, 'Citizen peasant, I require of you on peril of your\r\nhead,'... it is not possible to refuse.\"[33159]--Accordingly, they are\r\nonly too glad to be let off so cheaply. On Brumaire 19, about seven\r\no'clock in the evening, at Tigery, near Corbeil, twenty-five men \"with\r\nsabers and pistols in their belts, most of them in the uniform of the\r\nNational Guards and calling themselves the revolutionary army,\" enter\r\nthe house of Gibbon, an old ploughman, seventy-one years of age, while\r\nfifty others guard all egress from it, so that the expedition may not\r\nbe interfered with. Turlot, captain, and aid-de-camp to General Henriot,\r\nwants to know where the master of the house is.--\"In his bed,\" is the\r\nreply.--\"Wake him up.\"--The old man rises.--Give up your arms.\"--His\r\nwife hands over a fowling-piece, the only arm on the premises. The band\r\nimmediately falls on the poor man, \"strikes him down, ties his hands,\r\nand puts a sack over his head,\" and the same thing is done to his wife\r\nand to eight male and two female servants. \"Now, give us the keys of\r\nyour closets;\" they want to be sure that there are no fleur-de-lys or\r\nother illegal articles. They search the old man's pockets, take his\r\nkeys, and, to dispatch business, break into the chests and seize or\r\ncarry off all the plate, \"twenty-six table-dishes, three soup-ladles,\r\nthree goblets, two snuff-boxes, forty counters, two watches, another\r\ngold watch and a gold cross.\" \"We will draw up a procès-verbal of all\r\nthis at our leisure in Meaux. Now, where's your silver? If you don't say\r\nwhere it is, the guillotine is outside and I will be your executioner.\"\r\nThe old man yields and merely requests to be untied. But it is better\r\nto keep him bound, \"so as to make him 'sing.'\" They carry him into the\r\nkitchen and \"put his feet into a heated brazier.\" He shouts with pain,\r\nand indicates another chest which they break open and then carry off\r\nwhat they find there, \"seventy-two francs in coin and five or six\r\nthousand livres in assignats, which Gibbon had just received for the\r\nrequisitions made on him for corn.\" Next, they break open the cellar\r\ndoors, set a cask of vinegar running, carry wine upstairs, eat the\r\nfamily meal, get drunk and, at last, clear out, leaving Gibbon with his\r\nfeet burnt, and garroted, as well as the other eleven members of his\r\nhousehold, quite certain that there will be no pursuit.[33160]--In the\r\ntowns, especially in federalist districts, however, these robberies are\r\ncomplicated with other assaults. At Lyons, whilst the regular troops\r\nare lodged in barracks, the revolutionary army is billeted on the\r\nhouseholders, two thousand vile, sanguinary blackguards from Paris, and\r\nwhom their general, Ronsin himself, calls \"scoundrels and brigands,\"\r\nalleging, in excuse for this, that \"honest folks cannot be found for\r\nsuch business.\" How they treat their host, his wife and his daughters\r\nmay be imagined; contemporaries glide over these occurrences and,\r\nthrough decency or disgust, avoid giving details.[33161] Some simply use\r\nbrutal force; others get rid of a troublesome husband by the guillotine;\r\nin the most exceptional cases they bring their wenches along with them,\r\nwhile the housekeeper has to arouse herself at one o'clock at night and\r\nlight a fire for the officer who comes in with the jolly company.--And\r\nyet, there are others still worse, for the worst attract each other. We\r\nhave seen the revolutionary committee at Nantes, also the representative\r\non mission in the same city; nowhere did the revolutionary Sabbat rage\r\nso furiously, and nowhere was there such a traffic in human lives. With\r\nsuch band-leaders as Carrier and his tools on the Committee, one may be\r\nsure that the instrumentalists will be worthy.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, several members of the Committee themselves oversee\r\nexecutions and lend a hand in the massacres.--One of these, Goullin, a\r\ncreole from St. Domingo, sensual and nervous, accustomed to treating a\r\nNegro as an animal and a Frenchman as a white Negro, a Septembriseur\r\non principle, chief instigator and director of the \"drownings,\" goes in\r\nperson to empty the prison of Bouffay, and, verifying that death, the\r\nhospital or releases, had removed the imprisoned for him, adds, of\r\nhis own authority, fifteen names, taken haphazard, to reach his\r\nfigures.--Joly, a commissioner on the Committee, very expert in the\r\nart of garroting, ties the hands of prisoners together two and two and\r\nconducts them to the river.[33162]--Grand-maison, another member of\r\nthe Committee, a former dancing-master, convicted of two murders\r\nand pardoned before the Revolution, strikes down with his saber\r\nthe imploring hands stretched out to him over the planks of the\r\nlighter.[33163]--Pinard, another Committee-commissioner, ransoms, steals\r\noff into the country and himself kills, through preference, women and\r\nchildren.[33164] Naturally, the three bands which operate along with\r\nthem, or under their orders, comprise only men of their species. In the\r\nfirst one, called the Marat company, each of the sixty members swears,\r\non joining it, to adopt Marat's principles and carry out Marat's\r\ndoctrine. Goullin,[33165] one of the founders, demands in relation to\r\neach member, \"Isn't there some one still more rascally? For we must have\r\nthat sort to bring the aristocrats to reason!\"[33166] After Frimaire\r\n5 \"the Maratists\" boast of their arms being \"tired out\" with striking\r\nprisoners with the flat of their sabers to make them march to the\r\nLoire,[33167] and we see that, notwithstanding this fatigue, the\r\nbusiness suited them, as their officers tried to influence Carrier to be\r\ndetailed on the \"drowning\" service and because it was lucrative. The men\r\nand women sentenced to death, were first stripped of their clothes down\r\nto the shirt, and even the shift; it would be a pity to let valuable\r\nobjects go to the bottom with their owners, and therefore the drowners\r\ndivide these amongst themselves; a wardrobe in the house of the adjutant\r\nRichard is found full of jewelry and watches.[33168] This company of\r\nsixty must have made handsome profits out of the four or five thousand\r\ndrowned.-The second band, called \"the American Hussars,\" and who\r\noperated in the outskirts, was composed of blacks and mulattos, numerous\r\nenough in this town of privateers. It is their business to shoot women,\r\nwhom they first violate; \"they are our slaves,\" they say; \"we have won\r\nthem by the sweat of our brows.\" \"Those who have the misfortune to be\r\nspared, become in their hands mad in a couple of days; in any event they\r\nare re-arrested shortly afterwards and shot.--The last band, which\r\nis styled \"The German Legion,\" is formed out of German deserters and\r\nmercenaries speaking little or no French. They are employed by the\r\nMilitary Commission to dispatch the Vendeans picked up along the\r\nhighways, and who are usually shot in groups of twenty five. \"I came,\"\r\nsays an eye-witness,[33169] \"to a sort of gorge where there was a\r\nsemi-circular quarry; there, I noticed the corpses of seventy-five women\r\nnaked and lying on their backs.\" The victims of that day consisted of\r\ngirls from sixteen to eighteen years of age. One of them says to her\r\nconductor, \"I am sure you are taking us to die,\" and the German replies\r\nin his broken jargon, probably with a coarse laugh,\" No, it is for a\r\nchange of air. They are placed in a row in front of the bodies of the\r\nprevious day and shot. Those who do not fall, see the guns reloaded;\r\nthese are again shot and the wounded dispatched with the butt ends of\r\nthe muskets. Some of the Germans then rifle the bodies, while others\r\nstrip them and \"place them on their backs.\"--To find workmen for this\r\ntask, it is necessary to descend, not only to the lowest wretches in\r\nFrance but, again, to the brutes of a foreign race and tongue, and yet\r\nlower still, to an inferior race degraded by slavery and perverted by\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nSuch, from the top to the bottom of the ladder, at every stage of\r\nauthority and obedience, is the ruling staff of the revolutionary\r\ngovernment.[33170] Through its recruits and its work, through its morals\r\nand modes of proceeding, it evokes the almost forgotten image of\r\nits predecessors, for there is an image of it in the period from the\r\nfourteenth to the seventeenth century. At that time also, society\r\nwas frequently overcome and ravaged by barbarians; dangerous nomads,\r\nmalevolent outcasts, bandits turned into soldiers suddenly pounced down\r\non an industrious and peaceful population. Such was the case in France\r\nwith the \"Routiers\" and the \"Tard-venus,\" at Rome with the army of the\r\nConstable of Bourbon, in Flanders with the bands of the Duke of Alba\r\nand the Duke of Parma, in Westphalia and in Alsace, with Wallenstein's\r\nveterans, and those of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. They lived upon a town\r\nor province for six months, fifteen months, two years, until the town\r\nor province was exhausted. They alone were armed, master of the\r\ninhabitants, using and abusing things and persons according to their\r\ncaprices. But they were declared bandits, calling themselves scorchers,\r\n(ecorcheurs) riders and adventurers, and not pretending to be\r\nhumanitarian philosophers. Moreover, beyond an immediate and personal\r\nenjoyment, they demanded nothing; they employed brutal force only to\r\nsatiate their greed, their cruelty, their lust.--The latter add\r\nto private appetites a far greater devastation, the systematic and\r\ngratuitous ravages enforced upon them by the superficial theory with\r\nwhich they are imbued.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3301: \"The Revolution,\" II., pp. 298-304, and p. 351.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3302: \"The Revolution,\" II., pp.298-304, and p. 351.

Velu\r\ndoes not notice this and always tells them to go on.--After an hour,\r\ntired out, he comes back: \"All right,\" he says, \"now let me see your\r\nchateau, which is a fine one.\" He had heard about a room where there\r\nwere fantocini, in the attic. He goes up, opens some play-books, and,\r\nseeing on the lists of characters the name of King and Prince, he, says\r\nto me: \"You must scratch those out, and play only republican pieces.\"\r\nThe descent is by a back-stairs. On the way down he encounters a maid\r\nof my wife's, who is very pretty; he stops and, regarding my son, says:\r\n\"You must as a good Republican, sleep with that girl and marry her.\" I\r\nlook at him and reply: \"Monsieur Velu, listen; we are well behaved here,\r\nand such language cannot be allowed. You must respect the young\r\npeople in my house.\" A little disconcerted, he tames down and is quite\r\ndeferential to Madame de Cheverney.--\"You have pen and ink on your\r\ntable,\" he says, \"bring them here.\" \"What for,\" I ask, \"to take my\r\ninventory?\" \"No, but I must make a procès-verbal. You help me; it will\r\nbe better for you, as you can fix it to suit you\" This was not badly\r\ndone, to conceal his want of knowledge.--We go in to dinner. My servants\r\nwaited on the table; I had not yielded to the system of a general table\r\nfor all of us, which would not have pleased my servants any more\r\nthan myself. Curiosity led them all to come in and see us dining\r\ntogether.--\"Brother,\" says Velu to me, \"don't these people eat with\r\nyou?\" (He saw the table set for only four persons.) I reply: \"Brother,\r\nthat would not be any more agreeable to them than to myself. Ask\r\nthem.\"--He ate little, drank like an ogre, and was talkative about his\r\namours; getting carried away he got so close to being naughty that he\r\nupset my wife, without actually going to far. Apropos of the Revolution,\r\nand the danger we incurred, he said innocently: \"Don't I run as much\r\nrisk as anybody? It is my opinion that, in three months, I shall have my\r\nhead off! But we must all take our chance!\"--Now and then, he indulged\r\nin sans-culottisms. He seized the servant's hand, who changed his plate:\r\n\"Brother, I beg you to take my place, and let me wait on you in my\r\nturn \"--He drank the cordials, and finally left, pleased with his\r\nreception.--Returning to the inn, he stays until nine o'clock at night\r\nand stuffs himself, but is not intoxicated. One bottle had no effect on\r\nhim; he could empty a cask and show no signs of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33110: Moniteur, XXII., 425. (Session of Brumaire 13, year\r\nIII.)

THE GOVERNED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE OPPRESSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Revolutionary Destruction.\r\n\r\n     Magnitude of revolutionary destructiveness.--The four ways\r\n     of effecting it.--Expulsion from the country through forced\r\n     emigration and legal banishment.--Number of those expelled.\r\n     --Privation of liberty.--Different sorts of imprisonment.\r\n     --Number and situation of those imprisoned.--Murders after\r\n     being tried, or without trial.--Number of those guillotined\r\n     or shot after trial.--Indication of the number of other\r\n     lives destroyed.--Necessity and plan for wider destruction.\r\n     --Spoliation.--Its extent.--Squandering.--Utter losses.--Ruin\r\n     of individuals and the State.--The Notables the most\r\n     oppressed.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Jacobin, first of all, is the destruction of his\r\nadversaries, avowed or presumed, probable or possible. Four violent\r\nmeasures concur, together or in turn, to bring about the physical or\r\nsocial extermination of all Frenchmen who no longer belong to the sect\r\nor the party.\r\n\r\nThe first operation consists in expelling them from the\r\nterritory.--Since 1789, they have been chased off through a forced\r\nemigration; handed over to jacqueries, or popular uprisings, in the\r\ncountry, and to insurrections in the cities,[4101] defenseless and not\r\nallowed to defend themselves, three-fourths of them have left France,\r\nsimply to escape popular brutalities against which neither the law nor\r\nthe government afforded them any protection. According as the law and\r\nthe administration, in becoming more Jacobin, became more hostile to\r\nthem, so did they leave in greater crowds. After the 10th of August\r\nand 2nd of September, the flight necessarily was more general; for,\r\nhenceforth, if any one persisted in remaining after that date it was\r\nwith the almost positive certainty that he would be consigned to a\r\nprison, to await a massacre or the guillotine. About the same time, the\r\nlaw added to the fugitive the banished, all unsworn priests, almost an\r\nentire class consisting of nearly 40 000 persons.[4102] It is calculated\r\nthat, on issuing from the reign of Terror, the total number of fugitives\r\nand banished) amounted to 150 000[4103] the list would have been still\r\nlarger, had not the frontier been guarded by patrols and one had to\r\ncross it at the risk of one's life; and yet, many do risk their lives\r\nin attempting to cross it, in disguise, wandering about at night, in\r\nmid-winter, exposed to gunshots, determined to escape cost what it will,\r\ninto Switzerland, Italy, or Germany, and even into Hungary, in quest of\r\nsecurity and the right of praying to God as one pleases.[4104]--If any\r\nexiled or deported person ventures to return, he is tracked like a wild\r\nbeast, and, as soon as taken, he is guillotined.[4105] For example,\r\nM. de Choiseul, and other unfortunates, wrecked and cast ashore on the\r\ncoast of Normandy, are not sufficiently protected by the law of nations.\r\nThey are brought before a military commission; saved temporarily through\r\npublic commiseration, they remain in prison until the First Consul\r\nintervenes between them and the homicidal law and consents, through\r\nfavor, to deport them to the Dutch frontier.--If they have taken up arms\r\nagainst the Republic they are cut off from humanity; a Pandour[4106]\r\ntaken prisoner is treated as a man; an émigré made prisoner is treated\r\nlike a wolf--they shoot him on the spot. In some cases, even the\r\npettiest legal formalities are dispensed with. \"When I am lucky enough\r\nto catch 'em,\" writes Gen. Vandamme, \"I do not trouble the military\r\ncommission to try them. They are already tried--my saber and pistols do\r\ntheir business.\"[4107]\r\n\r\nThe second operation consists in depriving \"suspects\" of their liberty,\r\nof which deprivation there are several degrees; there are various ways\r\nof getting hold of people.--Sometimes, the \"suspect\" is \"adjourned,\"\r\nthat is to say, the order of arrest is simply suspended; he lives under\r\na perpetual menace that is generally fulfilled; he never knows in the\r\nmorning that he will not sleep in a prison that night. Sometimes, he is\r\nput on the limits of his commune. Sometimes, he is confined to his house\r\nwith or without guards, and, in the former case, he is obliged to pay\r\nthem. Again, finally, and which occurs most frequently, he is shut up\r\nin this or that common jail.--In the single department of Doubs, twelve\r\nhundred men and women are \"adjourned;\" three hundred put on the limits\r\nof the commune, fifteen hundred confined to their houses, and twenty\r\ntwo hundred imprisoned.[4108] In Paris, thirty-six such prisons and more\r\nthan \"violins\", or temporary jails, soon filled by the revolutionary\r\ncommittees, do not suffice for the service.[4109] It is estimated that,\r\nin France, not counting more than 40,000 provisional jails, twelve\r\nhundred prisons, full and running over, contain each more than two\r\nhundred inmates.[4110] At Paris, notwithstanding the daily void created\r\nby the guillotine, the number of the imprisoned on Floréal 9, year II.,\r\namounts to 7,840; and, on Messidor 25 following, notwithstanding the\r\nlarge batches of 50 and 60 persons led in one day, and every day, to\r\nthe scaffold, the number is still 7,502.[4111] There are more than one\r\nthousand persons in the prisons of Arras, more than one thousand five\r\nhundred in those of Toulouse, more than three thousand in those of\r\nStrasbourg, and more than thirteen thousand in those of Nantes. In the\r\ntwo departments alone of Bouches du-Rhône and Vaucluse, Representative\r\nMaignet, who is on the spot, reports from 12,000 to 15,000\r\narrests.[4112] \"A little before Thermidor,\" says Representative\r\nBeaulieu, \"the number of incarcerated arose to nearly 400,000, as is\r\napparent on the lists and registers then before the Committee of General\r\nSecurity.\"[4113]--Among these poor creatures, there are children, and\r\nnot alone in the prisons of Nantes where the revolutionary searches have\r\ncollected the whole of the rural population; in the prisons of Arras,\r\namong twenty similar cases, I find a coal-dealer and his wife with their\r\nseven sons and daughters, from seventeen down to six years of age; a\r\nwidow with her four children from nineteen down to twelve years of age;\r\nanother noble widow with her nine children, from seventeen down to\r\nthree years of age, and six children, without father or mother, from\r\ntwenty-three down to nine years of age.[4114]--These prisoners of State\r\nwere treated, almost everywhere, worse than robbers and assassins under\r\nthe ancient régime. They began by subjecting them to rapiotage, that\r\nis to say, stripping them naked or, at best, feeling their bodies under\r\ntheir shirts; women and young girls fainted away under this examination,\r\nformerly confined to convicts on entering the bagnio.[4115]--Frequently,\r\nbefore consigning them to their dungeons or shutting them up in their\r\ncells, they would be left two or three nights pell-mell in a lower hall\r\non benches, or in the court on the pavement, \"without beds or straw.\"\r\n\"The feelings are wounded in all directions, every point of sensibility,\r\nso to say, being played upon. They are deprived one after the other\r\nof their property, assignats, furniture, and food, of daylight and\r\nlamp-light, of the assistance which their wants and infirmities demand,\r\nof a knowledge of public events, of all communication, either immediate\r\nor written, with fathers, sons and husbands.\"[4116] They are obliged to\r\npay for their lodgings, their keepers, and for what they eat; they are\r\nrobbed at their very doors of the supplies they send for outside; they\r\nare compelled to eat at a mess-table; they are furnished with scant\r\nand nauseous food, \"spoilt codfish, putrid herrings and meat, rotten\r\nvegetables, all this accompanied with a mug of Seine water colored red\r\nwith some drug or other.\"[4117] They starve them, bully them, and vex\r\nthem purposely as if they meant to exhaust their patience and drive\r\nthem into a revolt, so as to get rid of them in a mass, or, at least, to\r\njustify the increasing rapid strokes of the guillotine. They are huddled\r\ntogether in tens, twenties and thirties, in one room at La Force, \"eight\r\nin a chamber, fourteen feet square,\" where all the beds touch, and many\r\noverlap each other, where two out of the eight inmates are obliged to\r\nsleep on the floor, where vermin swarm, where the closed sky-lights,\r\nthe standing tub, and the crowding together of bodies poisons the\r\natmosphere.--In many places, the proportion of the sick and dying is\r\ngreater than in the hold of a slave-ship. \"Of ninety individuals with\r\nwhom I was shut up two months ago,\" writes a prisoner at Strasbourg,\r\n\"sixty-six were taken to the hospital in the space of eight days.\"[4118]\r\nIn the prisons of Nantes, 3000 out 13,000 prisoners die of typhoid fever\r\nand of the rot in two months.[4119] 400 priests[4120] confined on a\r\nvessel between decks, in the roadstead of Aix, stowed on top of each\r\nother, wasted with hunger, eaten up by vermin, suffocated for lack of\r\nair, half-frozen, beaten, mocked at, and constantly threatened with\r\ndeath, suffer still more than Negroes in a slave-hold; for, through\r\ninterest in his freight, the captain of the slaver tries to keep\r\nhis human consignment in good health, whilst, through revolutionary\r\nfanaticism, the crew of the Aix vessel detests its cargo of\r\n\"black-frocks\" and would gladly send them to the bottom.--According\r\nto this system, which, up to Thermidor 9, grows worse and worse,\r\nimprisonment becomes a torture, oftentimes mortal, slower and more\r\npainful than the guillotine, and to such an extent that, to escape it,\r\nChampfort opens his veins and Condorcet swallows poison.[4121]The third\r\nexpedient consists of murder, with or without trial.--178 tribunals,\r\nof which 40 are ambulatory, pronounce in every part of the territory\r\nsentences of death which are immediately executed on the spot.[4122]\r\nBetween April 6, 1793, and Thermidor 9, year II., (July 27th, 1794)\r\nthat of Paris has 2,625 persons guillotined,[4123] while the provincial\r\njudges do as much work as the Paris judges. In the small town of Orange\r\nalone, they guillotine 331 persons. In the single town of Arras they\r\nhave 299 men and 93 women guillotined. At Nantes, the revolutionary\r\ntribunals and military committees have, on the average, 100 persons\r\na day guillotined, or shot, in all 1,971. In the city of Lyons\r\nthe revolutionary committee admit 1,684, while Cadillot, one of\r\nRobespierre's correspondents, advises him of 6,000.[4124]--The statement\r\nof these murders is not complete, but 17,000 have been enumerated,[4125]\r\n\"most of them effected without any formality, evidence or direct\r\ncharge,\" among others the murder of \"more than 1200 women, several of\r\nwhom were octogenarians and infirm;\"[4126] particularly the murder of 60\r\nwomen or young girls, condemned to death, say the warrants, for having\r\nattended the services of unsworn priests, or for having neglected the\r\nservices of a sworn priest.\r\n\r\n\"The accused, ranged in order, were condemned at sight. Hundreds of\r\ndeath-sentences took about a minute per head. Children of seven, five\r\nand four years of age, were tried. A father was condemned for the son,\r\nand the son for the father. A dog was sentenced to death. A parrot was\r\nbrought forward as a witness. Numbers of accused persons whose sentences\r\ncould not be written out were executed.\"\r\n\r\nAt Angers, the sentences of over four hundred men and three hundred and\r\nsixty women, executed for the purpose of relieving the prisons, were\r\nmentioned on the registers simply by the letters S or G (shot or\r\nguillotined).[4127] At Paris, as in the provinces, the slightest\r\npretext[4128] served to constitute a crime. The daughter of the\r\ncelebrated painter, Joseph Vernet,[4129] was guillotined for being a\r\n\" receiver,\" for having kept fifty pounds of candles in her house,\r\ndistributed among the employees of La Muette by the liquidators of the\r\ncivil list. Young de Maillé,[4130] aged sixteen years, was guillotined\r\nas a conspirator, \"for having thrown a rotten herring in the face of\r\nhis jailer, who had served it to him to eat.\" Madame de Puy-Verin was\r\nguillotined as \"guilty\" because she had not taken away from her deaf,\r\nblind and senile husband a bag of card-counters, marked with the royal\r\neffigy.--In default of any pretext,[4131] there was the supposition of a\r\nconspiracy; blank lists were given to paid emissaries, who undertook\r\nto search the various prisons and select the requisite number of heads;\r\nthey wrote names down on them according to their fancy, and these\r\nprovided the batches for the guillotine.\r\n\r\n\"As for myself,\" said the juryman Vilate, \"I am never embarrassed. I am\r\nalways convinced. In a revolution, all who appear before this tribunal\r\nought to be condemned.\"--\r\n\r\nAt Marseilles, the Brutus Commission,[4132] \"sentencing without public\r\nprosecutor or jurymen, sent to the prisons for those it wished to put\r\nto death. After having demanded their names, professions and wealth they\r\nwere sent down to a cart standing at the door of the Palais de\r\nJustice; the judges then stepped out on the balcony and pronounced the\r\ndeath-sentence.\" The same proceedings took place at Cambrai,\r\nArras, Nantes, Le Mans, Bordeaux, Nîmes, Lyons, Strasbourg, and\r\nelsewhere.--Evidently, the judicial comedy is simply a parade; they\r\nmake use of it as one of the respectable means, among others less\r\nrespectable, to exterminate people whose opinions are not what they\r\nshould be, or who belong to the proscribed classes;[4133] Samson, at\r\nParis, and his colleagues in the provinces, the execution-platoons of\r\nLyons and Nantes, are simply the collaborators of murderers properly so\r\ncalled, while legal massacres complete other massacres pure and simple.\r\n\r\nOf this latter description, the fusillades of Toulon come first, where\r\nthe number of those who are shot largely surpasses one thousand;[4134]\r\nnext the great drownings of Nantes, in which 4,800 men, women and\r\nchildren perished,[4135] the other drownings, for which no figures may\r\nbe given;[4136] then the countless popular murders committed in France\r\nbetween July 14, 1789, and August 10, 1792; the massacre of one 1,300\r\nprisoners in Paris, in September, 1792; the long train of assassinations\r\nwhich, in July, August and September, 1789, extends over the entire\r\nterritory; finally, the dispatch of the prisoners, either shot or\r\nsabered, without trial at Lyons and in the West. Even excepting those\r\nwho had died fighting or who, taken with arms in their hands, were\r\nshot down or sabered on the spot, there were 10,000 persons slaughtered\r\nwithout trial in the province of Anjou alone:[4137] accordingly, the\r\ninstructions of the Committee of Public Safety, also the written\r\norders of Carrier and Francastel, direct generals to \"bleed freely\" the\r\ninsurgent districts,[4138] and spare not a life: it is estimated that,\r\nin the eleven western departments, the dead of both sexes and of all\r\nages exceeded 400,000.[4139]--Considering the program and principles of\r\nthe Jacobin sect this is no great number; they might have killed a good\r\nmany more. But time was wanting; during their short reign they did what\r\nthey could with the instrument in their hands. Look at their machine,\r\nthe gradual construction of its parts, the successive stages of its\r\noperation from its starting up to Thermidor 9, and see how limited the\r\nperiod of its operation was. Organized March 30 and April 6, 1793,\r\nthe Revolutionary Committees and the Revolutionary Tribunal had but\r\nseventeen months in which to do their work. They did not drive ahead\r\nwith all their might until after the fall of the Girondists, and\r\nespecially after September, 1763 that is to say for a period of eleven\r\nmonths. Its loose wheels were not screwed up and the whole was not\r\nin running order under the impulse of the central motor until after\r\nDecember, 1793, that is to say during eight months. Perfected by the law\r\nof Prairial 22, it works for the past two months, faster and better than\r\nbefore, with an energy and rapidity that increase from week to week.--At\r\nthat date, and even before it, the theorists have taken the bearings of\r\ntheir destinies and accepted the conditions of their undertaking. Being\r\nsectarians, they have a faith, and as orthodoxy tolerates no heresy, and\r\nas the conversion of heretics is never sincere or durable, heresy can\r\nbe suppressed only by suppressing heretics. \"It is only the dead,\"\r\nsaid Barère, Messidor 16, \"who never return.\" On the 2nd and 3rd\r\nof Thermidor,[4140] the Committee of Public Safety sends to\r\nFouquier-Tinville a list of four hundred and seventy-eight accused\r\npersons with orders \"to bring the parties named to trial at once.\"\r\nBaudot and Jean Bon St. Andre, Carrier, Antonelle and Guifroy, had\r\nalready estimated the lives to be taken at several millions and,\r\naccording to Collot d' Herbois, who had a lively imagination, \"the\r\npolitical perspiration should go on freely, and not stop until from\r\ntwelve to fifteen million Frenchmen had been destroyed.\"[4141]\r\n\r\nTo make amends, in the fourth and last division of their work, that is\r\nto say, in spoliation, they went to the last extreme: they did all that\r\ncould be done to ruin individuals, families and the State; whatever\r\ncould be taken, they took.--The Constituent and Legislative Assemblies\r\nhad, on their side, begun the business by abolishing tithes and all\r\nfeudal rights without indemnity, and by confiscating all ecclesiastical\r\nproperty; the Jacobin operators continue and complete the job; we have\r\nseen by what decrees and with what hostility against collective and\r\nindividual property, whether they attribute to the State the possession\r\nof all corporations whatever, even laic, such as colleges, schools and\r\nscientific or literary societies, hospitals and communes, or whether\r\nthey despoil individuals, indirectly through assignats and the maximum,\r\nor directly through the forced loan, revolutionary taxes,[4142] seizures\r\nof gold and silver coin, requisitions of common useful utensils,[4143]\r\nsequestrations of prisoners' property, confiscations of the possessions\r\nof emigrants and exiles and of those deported or condemned to death.\r\nNo capital invested in real or personal property, no income in money\r\nor produce, whatever its source, whether leases, mortgages, private\r\ncredits, pensions, agricultural, industrial or commercial gains, the\r\nfruits of economy or labor, from the farmers', the manufacturers' and\r\nthe merchant's stores to the robes, coats, shirts and shoes, even to\r\nthe beds and bed-rooms of private individuals--nothing escapes their\r\nrapacious grasp: in the country, they carry off even seed reserved for\r\nplanting; at Strasbourg and in the Upper Rhine, all kitchen utensils; in\r\nAuvergne and elsewhere, even the shepherd's pots. Every object of\r\nvalue, even those not in public use, comes under requisition: for\r\ninstance,[4144] the Revolutionary Committee of Bayonne seizes a lot of\r\n\"cotton cloth and muslin,\" under the pretext of making \"breeches for\r\nthe country's defenders.\" On useful objects being taken it is not always\r\ncertain that they will be utilized; between their seizure and putting\r\nthem to service, robbery and waste intervene. At Strasbourg,[4145] on\r\na requisition being threatened by the representatives, the inhabitants\r\nstrip themselves and, in a few days, bring to the municipality \"6,879\r\ncoats, breeches and vests, 4,767 pairs of stockings, 16,921 pairs of\r\nshoes, 863 pairs of boots, 1351 cloaks, 20,518 shirts, 4,524 hats,\r\n523 pairs of gaiters, 143 skin vests, 2,673, 900 blankets, besides 29\r\nquintals of lint, 21 quintals of old linen, and a large number of other\r\narticles.\"\r\n\r\nBut \"most of these articles remain piled up in the storehouses, part\r\nof them rotten, or eaten by rats, the rest being abandoned to the\r\nfirst-comer.... The end of spoliation was attained.\"--Utter loss to\r\nindividuals and no gain, or the minimum of a gain, to the State. Such\r\nis the net result of the revolutionary government. After having laid\r\nits hand on three-fifths of the landed property of France; after having\r\nwrested from communities and individuals from ten to twelve billions of\r\nreal and personal estate; after having increased, through assignats and\r\nterritorial warrants, the public debt, which was not five billions\r\nin 1789, to more than fifty billions;[4146] no longer able to pay its\r\nemployees; reduced to supporting its armies as well as itself by forced\r\ncontributions on conquered territories, it ends in bankruptcy; it\r\nrepudiates two-thirds of its debt, and its credit is so low that the\r\nremaining third which it has consolidated and guaranteed afresh, loses\r\neighty-three per cent. the very next day. In its hands, the State has\r\nitself suffered as much as the private individuals.--Of the latter, more\r\nthan 1 200 000 have suffered physically: several millions, all who owned\r\nanything, great or small, have suffered through their property.[4147]\r\nBut, in this multitude of the oppressed, it is the notables who are\r\nchiefly aimed at and who, in their possessions as well as in their\r\npersons, have suffered the most.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Value of Notables in Society.\r\n\r\n     Various kinds and degrees of Notables in 1789.--The great\r\n     social staff.--Men of the world.--Their breeding.--Their\r\n     intellectual culture.--Their humanity and philanthropy.\r\n     --Their moral temper.--Practical men.--Where recruited,--Their\r\n     qualifications.--Their active benevolence.--Scarcity of them\r\n     and their worth to a community.\r\n\r\nOn estimating the value of a forest you begin by dividing its vegetation\r\ninto two classes; on the one hand the full-grown trees, the large or\r\nmedium-sized oaks, beeches and aspens, and, on the other, the saplings\r\nand the undergrowth. In like manner, in estimating society, you divide\r\nthe individuals composing it into two groups, one consisting of its\r\nnotables of every kind and degree, and the other, of the common run of\r\nmen. If the forest is an old one and has not been too badly managed,\r\nnearly the whole of its secular growth is found in its clusters of\r\nfull-grown trees. Nearly all the useful wood is to be found in the\r\nmature forest. A few thousand large handsome trees and the three or four\r\nhundred thousand saplings, young and old, of the reserve, contain more\r\nuseful and valuable wood than the twenty or thirty millions shrubs,\r\nbushes and heathers put together. It is the same in a community which\r\nhas existed for a long time under a tolerably strict system of justice\r\nand police; almost the entire gain of a secular civilization is found\r\nconcentrated in its notables, which, taking it all in all, was the state\r\nof French society in 1789.[4148]\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the most prominent personages.--It is certain,\r\nthat, among the aristocracy, the wealthiest and most conspicuous\r\nfamilies had ceased to render services proportionate to the cost of\r\ntheir maintenance. Most of the seigniors and ladies of the Court, the\r\nworldly bishops, abbés, and parliamentarians of the drawing-room, knew\r\nbut little more than how to solicit with address, make a graceful parade\r\nof themselves and spend lavishly. An ill-understood system of culture\r\nhad diverted them from their natural avocations, and converted them into\r\nshowy and agreeable specimens of vegetation, often hollow, blighted,\r\nsapless and over-pruned, besides being very costly, over-manured and\r\ntoo freely watered; and the skillful gardening which shaped, grouped\r\nand arranged them in artificial forms and bouquets, rendered their\r\nfruit abortive that flowers might be multiplied.--But the flowers were\r\nexquisite, and even in a moralist's eyes, such flowering counts for\r\nsomething. On the side of civility, good-breeding and deportment, the\r\nmanners and customs of high life had reached a degree of perfection,\r\nwhich never, in France or elsewhere, had been attained before, and which\r\nhas never since been revived;[4149] and of all the arts through which\r\nmen have emancipated themselves from primitive coarseness, that which\r\nteaches them mutual consideration is, perhaps, the most precious. The\r\nobservance of this, not alone in the drawing-room, but in the family, in\r\nbusiness, in the street, with regard to relatives, inferiors, servants\r\nand strangers, gives dignity, as well as a charm, to human intercourse.\r\nDelicate regard for what is proper becomes a habit, an instinct, a\r\nsecond nature, which nature, superimposed on the original nature, is the\r\nbest, inasmuch as the internal code which governs each detail of action\r\nand speech, prescribes the standard of behavior and respect for oneself,\r\nas well as respect and refined behavior towards others.--To this merit,\r\nadd mental culture. Never was there an aristocracy so interested in\r\ngeneral ideas and refinement of expression; it was even too much so;\r\nliterary and philosophical preoccupation excluded all others of the\r\npositive and practical order; they talked, instead of acting. But, in\r\nthis limited circle of speculative reason and of pure literary forms, it\r\nexcelled; writings and how to write furnished the ordinary entertainment\r\nof polite society; every idea uttered by a thinker caused excitement\r\nin the drawing-room: the talent and style of authors were shaped by its\r\ntaste;[4150] it was in the drawing-rooms that Montesquieu, Voltaire,\r\nRousseau, d'Alembert, the Encyclopedists, great and little,\r\nBeaumarchais, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Champfort, and Rivarol,\r\ninvoluntarily sought listeners and found them, not merely admirers\r\nand entertainers, but friends, protectors, patrons, benefactors and\r\nfollowers.--Under the instruction of the masters, the disciples had\r\nbecome philanthropists; moreover, the amenities of manners developed\r\nin all souls compassion and benevolence: \"Nothing was more dreaded by\r\nopulent men than to be regarded as insensitive.\"[4151] They concerned\r\nthemselves with children, with the poor, with the peasantry, setting\r\ntheir wits to work to afford them relief; their zeal was aroused against\r\noppression, their pity was excited for every misfortune. Even those\r\nwhose duties compelled them to be rigid tempered their rigidity with\r\nexplanations or concessions.\r\n\r\n\"Ten years before the Revolution,\" says Roederer,[4152] \"the criminal\r\ncourts of France were no longer like before.... Their attitude had\r\nchanged.. . All the young magistrates, and this I can bear witness to,\r\nfor I was one myself, pronounced judgments more in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of Beccaria,[4153] than according to law.\"--\r\n\r\nAs to the men in authority, military administrators and commandants, it\r\nwas impossible to be more patient, more mindful of human blood.\r\nTheir qualities turned also here into defects, for, through excess of\r\nhumanity, they were unable to maintain order, as is evident when facing\r\nthe insurrections that took place between 1789 and 1792. Even with the\r\nforce in their own hands, amidst gross insults and extreme dangers, they\r\ndreaded to make use of it; they could not bring themselves to repressing\r\nbrutes, rascals and maniacs: following the example of Louis XVI., they\r\nconsidered themselves as shepherds of the people, and let themselves be\r\ntrampled upon rather than fire upon their flock.--In reality, they had\r\nnoble, and even generous and big hearts: in the bailiwick assemblies,\r\nin March, 1789, long before the night of August 4, they voluntarily\r\nsurrendered every pecuniary privilege; under severe trials, their\r\ncourage, heightened by polished manners, adds even to their heroism,\r\nelegance, tact and gaiety. The most corrupt, a Duke of Orleans, the most\r\nfrivolous and the most blasé, a Duc de Biron, meet death with stoical\r\ncoolness and disdain.[4154] Delicate women who complain of a draught in\r\ntheir drawing-rooms, make no complaint of a straw mattress in a damp,\r\ngloomy dungeon, where they sleep in their clothes so that they may not\r\nwake up stiffened, and they come down into the court of the Conciergerie\r\nwith their accustomed cheerfulness. Men and women, in prison, dress\r\nthemselves as formerly, with the same care, that they may meet and talk\r\ntogether with the same grace and spirit, in a corridor with an iron\r\ngrating within a step of the revolutionary Tribunal, and on the eve of\r\nthe scaffold.[4155]--This moral temper is evidently of the rarest; if\r\nit errs on either side it is on that of being too refined, bad for use,\r\ngood for ornament.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in the upper class there were associated with two or three\r\nthousand idlers amongst a frivolous aristocracy, as many serious men,\r\nwho, to their drawing-room experience, added experience in business.\r\nAlmost all who held office or had been in the service, were of this\r\nnumber, either ambassadors, general officers or former ministers, from\r\nMarshal de Brogue down to Machaut and Malesherbes; resident bishops,\r\nlike Monseigneur de Durfort, at Besançon;[4156] vicars-general and\r\ncanons who really governed their dioceses on the spot; prelates, like\r\nthose in Provence, Languedoc and Brittany, who, by right, had seats\r\nin the provincial \"Etats\", agents and representatives of the clergy\r\nat Paris; heads of Orders and Congregations; the chief and lieutenant\r\ncommandants of the seventeen military departments, intendants of each\r\ngeneralité head-clerks of each ministry, magistrates of each parliament,\r\nfarmers-general, collectors-general, and, more particularly in each\r\nprovince, the dignitaries and local proprietors of the two first orders,\r\nand all leading manufacturers, merchants, ship-owners, bankers and\r\nprominent bourgeois; in short, that élite of the nobles, clergy, and\r\nThird Estate, which, from 1778 to 1789, constituted the twenty-one\r\nprovincial assemblies, and which certainly formed in France the great\r\nsocial staff.--Not that they were superior politicians: for in those\r\ndays there were none, scarcely a few hundred competent men, almost all\r\nof them being specialists. Nevertheless, it was in these few men that\r\nnearly the entire political capacity, information and common sense of\r\nFrance was to be found. Outside of their heads the other twenty-six\r\nmillions of brains contained but little else than dangerous and barren\r\nformulas; as they alone had commanded, negotiated, deliberated and\r\ngoverned, they were the only ones who understood men and things\r\ntolerably well, and, consequently, the only ones who were not completely\r\ndisqualified for their management. In the provincial Assemblies they\r\nwere seen originating and conducting the most important reforms; they\r\nhad devoted themselves to these effectively and conscientiously, with as\r\nmuch equity and patriotism as intelligence and thoroughness; most of the\r\nheads and sub-heads of the leading public and private branches of the\r\nservice, guided by philosophy and supported by current opinion\r\nfor twenty years, had likewise given evidence of active\r\nbenevolence.[4157]--Nothing is more precious than men of this stamp, for\r\nthey are the life and soul of their respective branches of service,\r\nand are not to be replaced in one lot, at a given moment, by persons\r\nof equal merit. In diplomacy, in the finances, in judicature, in\r\nadministration, in extensive commerce and large manufacturing, a\r\npractical, governing capacity is not created in a day; affairs in all\r\nthese are too vast and too complicated; there are too many diverse\r\ninterests to take into account, too many near and remote contingencies\r\nto foresee; lacking a knowledge of technical details, it is difficult to\r\ngrasp the whole; one tries to make short work of it, one shatters right\r\nand left and ends with the sword, obliged to fall back on systematic\r\nbrutality to complete the work of audacious bungling. Except in war,\r\nwhere apprenticeship takes less time than elsewhere, ten years of\r\npreparatory education plus ten years of practical experience are\r\nrequired for the good government of men and the management of capital\r\nassets. Add to this, against the temptations of power which are strong,\r\na stability of character established through professional honor, and, if\r\nit so happens, by family traditions.\r\n\r\nAfter having directed financial matters for two years, Cambon[4158] is\r\nnot yet aware that the functions of the fermiers-généraux of indirect\r\ntaxes differ from those of the receveurs-géneraux of direct taxes;[4159]\r\naccordingly, he includes, or allows to be included, the forty-eight\r\nreceveurs in the decree which sends the sixty fermiers before the\r\nrevolutionary Tribunal, that is to say, to the guillotine; and, in fact,\r\nall of them would have been sent there had not a man familiar with\r\nthe business, Gaudin, Commissioner of the Treasury, heard the decree\r\nproclaimed in the street and run to explain to the Committee on Finances\r\nthat \"there was nothing in common\" between the two groups of outlaws;\r\nthat the fermiers were holders of leases on probable profits while the\r\nreceveurs were paid functionaries at a fixed salary, and the crimes\r\nof the former, proved or not proved, were not imputable to the latter.\r\nGreat astonishment on the part of these improvised financiers!\"They make\r\nan outcry,\" says Gaudin, \"and assert that I am mistaken. I insist, and\r\nrepeat what I have told the President, Cambon; I affirm on says to one\r\nof the members, 'Since that is so, go to the bureau of procès-verbaux\r\nand scratch out the term receveurs-généraux from the decree passed this\r\nmorning.' my honor and offer to furnish them the proof of it; finally,\r\nthey are satisfied and the President \"--Such are the gross blunders\r\ncommitted by interlopers, and even carried out, when not warned and\r\nrestrained by veterans in the service. Cambon, accordingly, in spite\r\nof the Jacobins, retains in his bureaux all whom he can among veteran\r\nofficials. If Carnot manages the war well, it is owing to his being\r\nhimself an educated officer and to maintaining in their positions\r\nd'Arcon, d'Obenheim, de Grimoard, de Montalembert and Marescot, all\r\neminent men bequeathed to him by the ancient régime.[4160] Reduced,\r\nbefore the 9th of Thermidor, to perfect nullity, the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs is not again to become useful and active until the professional\r\ndiplomats, Miot, Colchen, Otto and Reinhart,[4161] resume their\r\nascendancy and influence. It is a professional diplomat, Barthélemy,\r\nwho, after the 9th of Thermidor, really directs the foreign policy of\r\nthe Convention, and brings about the peace of Basle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The three classes of Notables.\r\n\r\n     The Nobility.--Its physical and moral preparation through\r\n     feats of arms.--The military spirit.--High character.\r\n     --Conduct of officers in 1789-1792.--Service for which these\r\n     nobles were adapted.\r\n\r\nThree classes, the nobles, the clergy and the bourgeoisie, provided\r\nthis superior élite, and, compared with the rest of the nation, they\r\nthemselves formed an élite.--Thirty thousand gentlemen, scattered\r\nthrough the provinces, had been brought up from infancy to the\r\nprofession of arms; generally poor, they lived on their rural estates\r\nwithout luxuries, comforts or curiosity, in the society of wood-rangers\r\nand game-keepers, frugally and with rustic habits, in the open air, in\r\nsuch a way as to ensure robust constitutions. A child, at six years\r\nof age, mounted a horse; he followed the hounds, and hardened himself\r\nagainst inclemencies;[4162] afterwards, in the academies, he rendered\r\nhis limbs supple by exercise and obtained that rugged health which is\r\nnecessary for living under a tent and following a campaign. From early\r\nchildhood, he was imbued with a military spirit; his father and uncles\r\nat table talked of nothing but their perils in war and feats of arms;\r\nhis imagination took fire; he got accustomed to looking upon their\r\npursuits as the only ones worthy of a man of rank and feeling, and he\r\nplunged ahead with a precocity which we no longer comprehend. I have\r\nread many records of the service of gentlemen who were assassinated,\r\nguillotined or emigrés; they nearly always began their careers before\r\nthe age of sixteen, often at fourteen, thirteen and eleven.[4163] M. des\r\nEcherolles,[4164] captain in the Poitou regiment, had brought along with\r\nhim into the army his only son, aged nine, and a dozen little cousins of\r\nthe same age. Those children fought like old soldiers; one of them\r\nhad his leg fractured by a ball; young des Echerolles received a saber\r\nstroke which cut away his cheek from the ear to the upper lip, and\r\nhe was wounded seven times; still young, he received the cross of St.\r\nLouis. To serve the State, seek conflict and expose one's life, seemed\r\nan obligation of their rank, a hereditary debt; out of nine or ten\r\nthousand officers who discharged this debt most of them cared only\r\nfor this and looked for nothing beyond. Without fortune and without\r\ninfluence, they had renounced promotion, fully aware that the higher\r\nranks were reserved for the heirs of great families and the courtiers\r\nat Versailles. After serving fifteen or twenty years, they returned home\r\nwith a captain's commission and the cross of St. Louis, sometimes with\r\na small pension, contented with having done their duty and conscious\r\nof their own honor. On the approach of the Revolution, this old spirit,\r\nillumined by the new ideas, became an almost civic virtue:[4165] we have\r\nseen how they behaved between 1789 and 1792, their moderation, their\r\nforbearance, their sacrifice of self-love, their abnegation and their\r\nstoical impassability, their dislike to strike, the coolness with which\r\nthey persisted in receiving without returning blows, and in maintaining,\r\nif not public order, at least the last semblance of it. Patriots as\r\nmuch as soldiers, through birth, education and conviction, they formed a\r\nnatural, special nursery, eminently worthy of preserving, inasmuch as\r\nit furnished society with ready-made instruments for defense, internally\r\nagainst rascals and brutes, and externally against the enemy. Less\r\ncalm in disposition and more given to pleasure than the rural nobles\r\nof Prussia, under slacker discipline and in the midst of greater\r\nworldliness, but more genial, more courteous and more liberal-minded,\r\nthe twenty-six thousand noble families of France upheld in their sons\r\nthe traditions and prejudices, the habits and aptitudes, those energies\r\nof body, heart and mind[4166] through which the Prussian \"junkers\" were\r\nable to constitute the Prussian army, organize the German army and make\r\nGermany the first power of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Clergy.\r\n\r\n     Where recruited.--Professional inducements.--Independence of\r\n     ecclesiastics.--Their substantial merits.--Their theoretical\r\n     and practical information.--Their distribution over the\r\n     territory.--Utility of their office.--Their conduct in\r\n     1790-1800.--Their courage, their capacity for self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nLikewise in the Church where nearly all its staff, the whole of the\r\nlower and middle-class clergy, curés, vicars, canons and collegiate\r\nchaplains, teachers or directors of schools, colleges and seminaries,\r\nmore than sixty-five thousand ecclesiastics, formed a healthy, well\r\norganized body, worthily fulfilling its duties.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" says de Tocqueville,[4167] \"all in all, and\r\nnotwithstanding the vices of some of its members, if there ever was in\r\nthe world a more remarkable clergy than the Catholic clergy of France\r\nwhen the Revolution took them by surprise, more enlightened, more\r\nnational, less entrenched behind their private virtues, better endowed\r\nwith public virtues, and, at the same time, more strong in the faith.\r\n... I began the study of the old social system full of prejudices\r\nagainst them; I finish it full of respect for them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd first, which is a great point, most of the incumbents in the\r\ntown parishes, in the three hundred collegial churches, in the small\r\ncanonicates of the cathedral chapters, belonged to better families than\r\nat the present day.[4168] Children were then more numerous, not\r\nmerely among the peasants, but among the inferior nobles and the upper\r\nbourgeoisie; each family, accordingly, was glad to have one of its sons\r\ntake orders, and no constraint was necessary to bring this about.\r\nThe ecclesiastical profession then had attractions which it no longer\r\npossesses; it had none of the inconveniences incident to it at the\r\npresent time. A priest was not exposed to democratic distrust and\r\nhostility; he was sure of a bow from the laborer in the street as well\r\nas from the peasant in the country; he was on an equal footing with the\r\nlocal bourgeoisie, almost one of the family, and among the first; he\r\ncould count on passing his life in a permanent situation, honorably and\r\nserenely, in the midst of popular deference and enjoying the good will\r\nof the public.--On the other hand, he was not bridled as in our day. A\r\npriest was not a functionary salaried by the State; his pay, like his\r\nprivate income, earmarked and put aside beforehand, furnished through\r\nspecial appropriations, through local taxes, out of a distinct treasury,\r\ncould never be withheld on account of a préfect's report, or through\r\nministerial caprice, or be constantly menaced by budget difficulties\r\nand the ill-will of the civil powers. In relation to his ecclesiastical\r\nsuperiors he was respectful but independent. The bishop in his diocese\r\nwas not what he has become since the Concordat, an absolute sovereign\r\nfree to appoint and remove at will nine curés out of ten. In three\r\nvacancies out of four, and often in fourteen out of fifteen,[4169]\r\nit was not the bishop who made the appointment; the new incumbent was\r\ndesignated sometimes by the cathedral chapter or corporation; again, by\r\na collegial church or corporation; again, by the metropolitan canon or\r\nby the abbé or prior, the patron of the place; again, by the seignior\r\nwhose ancestors had founded or endowed the Church; in certain cases by\r\nthe Pope, and, occasionally, by the King or commune. Powers were limited\r\nthrough this multiplicity and inter-crossing of authorities. Moreover,\r\nthe canon or curé being once appointed he possessed guarantees; he\r\ncould not be arbitrarily dismissed; in most cases, his removal\r\nor suspension required a previous trial according to prescribed\r\nformalities, accompanied with an examination, pleadings, and arguments\r\nbefore the officialité or ecclesiastical court. He was, in fact,\r\npermanently placed, and very generally his personal merit sufficed to\r\nkeep him in his place.--For, if the highest positions were bestowed\r\naccording to birth and favor, the intermediate positions were reserved\r\nto correct habits and attainments. Many canons and vicars-general, and\r\nalmost all the curés in the towns were doctors of divinity or of canon\r\nlaw, while ecclesiastical studies, very thorough, had occupied eight or\r\nnine years of their youth.[4170] Although the method was out of date,\r\nmuch was learned at the Sorbonne and St. Sulpice; at the very least,\r\none became a good logician through prolonged and scientific intellectual\r\ngymnastics. \"My dear Abbé,\" said Turgot, smiling, to Morellet, \"it is\r\nonly you and I who have taken our degree who can reason closely.\" Their\r\ntheological drill, indeed, was about as valuable as our philosophical\r\ndrill; if it expanded the mind less, it supplied this better with\r\napplicable concepts; less exciting, it was more fruitful. In the\r\nSorbonne of the nineteenth century, the studies consist of the\r\nspeculative systems of a few isolated, divergent intellects who have\r\nexercised no authority over the multitude, while in the Sorbonne of\r\nthe eighteenth century, the studies consisted of the creed, morality,\r\ndiscipline, history and canons of a Church which had already existed\r\nseventeen centuries and which, comprising one hundred and fifty millions\r\nof souls, still sways one-half of the civilized world.--To a theoretical\r\neducation add practical education. A curé and with still more reason, a\r\ncanon, an archdeacon, a bishop, was not a passing stranger, endowed by\r\nthe State, wearing a surplice, as little belonging to his age through\r\nhis ministry as through his dress, and wholly confined to his spiritual\r\nfunctions: he managed the revenues of his dotation, he granted leases,\r\nmade repairs, built, and interested himself in the probabilities of the\r\ncrops, in the construction of a highway or canal, while his experiences\r\nin these matters were equal to those of any lay proprietor. Moreover,\r\nbeing one of a small proprietary corporation, that is to say, a chapter\r\nor local vestry, and one of a great proprietary corporation of the\r\ndiocese and Church of France, he took part directly or indirectly\r\nin important temporal affairs, in assemblies, in deliberations, in\r\ncollective expenditures, in the establishment of a local budget and of\r\na general budget, and hence, in public and administrative matters,\r\nhis competence was analogous and almost equal to that of a mayor,\r\nsub-delegate, farmer-general or intendant. In addition to this he was\r\nliberal: never has the French clergy been more earnestly so, from the\r\nlatest curés back to the first archbishops.[4171]--Lastly, remark the\r\ndistribution of the clergy over the territory. There was a curé or vicar\r\nin the smallest of the forty thousand villages. In thousands of small,\r\npoor, remote communes, he was the only man who could readily read and\r\nwrite; none other than he in many of the larger rural communes,[4172]\r\nexcept the resident seignior and some man of the law or half-way\r\nschoolmaster, was at all learned.[4173] Actually, for a man who had\r\nfinished his studies and knowing Latin, to consent, for six hundred\r\nfrancs or three hundred francs a year, to live isolated, and a celibate,\r\nalmost in indigence, amongst rustics and the poor, he must be a priest;\r\nthe quality of his office makes him resigned to the discomforts of his\r\nsituation. A preacher of the Word, a professor of morality, a minister\r\nof Charity, a guide and dispenser of spiritual life, he taught a theory\r\nof the world, at once consoling and self-denying, which he enforced with\r\na cult, and this cult was the only one adapted to his flock; manifestly,\r\nthe French, especially those devoted to manual and hard labor, could not\r\nregard this world as ideal, except through his formulas; history, the\r\nsupreme judge, had on this point rendered its verdict without appeal;\r\nno heresy, no schism, not the Reformation nor Jansenism, had prevailed\r\nagainst hereditary faith; through infinitely multiplied and deeply\r\npenetrating roots this faith suited national customs, temperament, and\r\npeculiar social imagination and sensibility. Possessing the heart, the\r\nintellect, and even the senses, through fixed, immemorial traditions and\r\nhabits, it had become an unconscious, almost corporeal necessity, and\r\nthe Catholic orthodox curé, in communion with the Pope, was about as\r\nindispensable to the village as the public fountain; he also quenched\r\nthirst, the thirst of the soul; without him, the inhabitants could find\r\nno drinkable water. And, if we keep human weaknesses in mind, it may\r\nbe said that nobleness of character in the clergy corresponded with\r\nnobleness of profession; in all points no one could dispute their\r\ncapacity for self-sacrifice, for they willingly suffered for what they\r\nbelieved to be the truth. If, in 1790, a number of priests took the oath\r\nto the civil constitution of the clergy, it was with reservations, or\r\nbecause they deemed the oath licit; but, after the dismissal of the\r\nbishops and the Pope's disapprobation, many of them withdrew it at the\r\nrisk of their lives, so as not to fall into schism; they fell back into\r\nthe ranks and gave themselves up voluntarily to the brutality of\r\nthe crowd and the rigors of the law. Moreover, and from the start,\r\nnotwithstanding threats and temptations, two-thirds of the clergy would\r\nnot take the oath; in the highest ranks, among the mundane ecclesiastics\r\nwhose skepticism and laxity were notorious, honor, in default of faith,\r\nmaintained the same spirit; nearly the whole of them, great and\r\nsmall, had subordinated their interests, welfare and security to the\r\nmaintenance of their dignity or to scruples of conscience. They had\r\nallowed themselves to be stripped of everything; they let themselves be\r\nexiled, imprisoned, tortured and made martyrs of, like the Christians\r\nof the primitive church; through their invincible meekness, they were\r\ngoing, like the primitive Christians, to exhaust the rage of their\r\nexecutioners, wear out persecutions, transform opinion and compel the\r\nadmission, even with those who survived in the eighteenth century, that\r\nthey were true, deserving and courageous men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The Bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\n     Where recruited.--Difference between the functionary of the\r\n     ancient regime and the modern functionary.--Appointments\r\n     seen as Property.--Guilds.--Independence and security of\r\n     office-holders.--Their ambitions are limited and satisfied.\r\n     --Fixed habits, seriousness and integrity.--Ambition to\r\n     secure esteem.--Intellectual culture.--Liberal ideas.\r\n     --Respectability and public zeal.--Conduct of the bourgeoisie\r\n     in 1789-1791.\r\n\r\nBelow the nobles and the clergy, a third class of notables, the\r\nbourgeoisie, almost entirely confined to the towns,[4174] verged on\r\nthe former classes through its upper circles, while its diverse groups,\r\nranging from the parliamentarian to the rich merchant or manufacturer,\r\ncomprised the remainder of those who were tolerably well educated, say\r\n100 000 families, recruited on the same conditions as the bourgeoisie\r\nof the present day: they were \"bourgeois living nobly,\" meaning by this,\r\nliving on their incomes, large manufacturers and traders, engaged in\r\nliberal pursuits-lawyers, notaries, procureurs, physicians, architects,\r\nengineers, artists, professors, and especially the government officials;\r\nthe latter, however, very numerous, differed from ours in two essential\r\npoints. On the one hand, their office, as nowadays with the notaries'\r\nétude, or a membership of the stock-board, was personal property.\r\nTheir places, and many others, such as posts in the judiciary, in the\r\nfinances, in bailiwicks, in the Présidial, in the Election,[4175] in\r\nthe salt-department, in the customs, in the Mint, in the department of\r\nforests and streams, in presidencies, in councils, as procureurs du roi\r\nin various civil, administrative and criminal courts, holding places\r\nin the treasury, auditors and collectors of the various branches of the\r\nrevenue--all of which offices, and many others, had been alienated for\r\nmore than a century by the State in return for specified sums of ready\r\nmoney; thenceforth, they fell into the hands of special purchasers; the\r\ntitle of each possessor was as good as that of a piece of real property,\r\nand he could legally sell his title, the same as he had bought it, at\r\na given price, on due advertisement![4176] On the other hand, the\r\ndifferent groups of local functionaries in each town formed their\r\nown associations, similar to our notarial chambers, or those of our\r\nstock-brokers; these small associations had their own by-laws, meetings\r\nand treasury, frequently a civil status and the right of pleading,\r\noften a political status and the right of electing to the municipal\r\ncouncil;[4177] consequently, besides his personal interests, each\r\nmember cherished the professional interests of his guild. Thus was\r\nhis situation different from what it now is, and, through a natural\r\nreaction, his character, manners and tastes were different. First, he\r\nwas much more independent; he was not afraid of being discharged\r\nor transferred elsewhere, suddenly, unawares, on the strength of an\r\nintendant's report, for political reasons, to make room for a deputy's\r\ncandidate or a minister's tool. This would have cost too much it would\r\nhave required first of all a reimbursement of the sum paid for his\r\noffice, and at a rate of purchase ten times, at least, the revenue of\r\nthe office.[4178] Besides, in defending himself, in protesting against\r\nand forestalling his disgrace, he would have been supported by his\r\nentire professional guild, oftentimes by other similar bodies, and\r\nfrequently by the whole town, filled with his relations, clients and\r\ncomrades. The entire hive protected the bee against the caprices\r\nof favoritism and the brutalities of despotism. At Paris, a certain\r\nprocureur, supported by his colleagues, is known to have imposed on a\r\nnoble who had insulted him, the most humiliating atonement.[4179]\r\nIn fact, under the ancient régime, it was almost impossible for a\r\nfunctionary to be removed; hence, he could fulfill his duties securely\r\nand with dignity, without being obliged to keep daily watch of the\r\ncapital, of going to Paris to see how the official wind blew, to look\r\nafter all the influences in his favor, to nurse his relations with the\r\ngovernment and live like a bird on a branch.--In the second place, there\r\nwas a limit to his ambition; he did not keep constantly thinking of\r\nmounting a step higher in the hierarchy; or how to pass from a small\r\ntown to a large one and hold on to his title; this would have been a too\r\ntroublesome and complicated matter; he would first have had to find\r\na purchaser and then sell his place, and next find a seller and buy\r\nanother at a higher price; a stock broker at Bordeaux, a notary at\r\nLyons, is not an aspirant for the post of stock broker or notary at\r\nParis.--Nothing then bore any resemblance to the itinerant groups of\r\nfunctionaries of the present day which, in obedience to orders from\r\nabove, travels about governing each of our towns, strangers on the wing,\r\nwith no personal standing, without local landed property, interests\r\nor means, encamped in some hired apartment, often in a furnished room,\r\nsometimes stopping at a hotel, eternal nomads awaiting a telegram,\r\nalways prepared to pack up and leave for another place a hundred leagues\r\noff in consideration of a hundred crowns extra pay, and doing the same\r\ndetached work over again. Their predecessor, belonging to the country,\r\nwas a stable fixture and contented; he was not tormented by a craving\r\nfor promotion; he had a career within the bounds of his corporation and\r\ntown; cherishing no wish or idea of leaving it, he accommodated himself\r\nto it; he became proud of his office and professional brethren, and\r\nrose above the egoism of the individual; his self-love was bent on\r\nmaintaining every prerogative and interest belonging to his guild.\r\nEstablished for life in his native town, in the midst of old colleagues,\r\nnumerous relatives and youthful companions, he esteemed their good\r\nopinion. Exempt from vexatious or burdensome taxes, tolerably well off,\r\nowning at least his own office, he was above sordid preoccupations\r\nand common necessities. Used to old fashioned habits of simplicity,\r\nsoberness and economy, he was not tormented by a disproportion between\r\nhis income and expenses, by the requirements of show and luxury, by the\r\nnecessity of annually adding to his revenue.--Thus guided and free, the\r\ninstincts of vanity and generosity, the essence of French character,\r\ntook the ascendant; the councilor or comptroller, the King's agent,\r\nregarded himself as a man above the common run, as a noble of the\r\nThird-Estate; he thought less of making money than of gaining esteem;\r\nhis chief desire was to be honored and honorable; \"he passed life\r\ncomfortably and was looked up to,... in the discharge of his duty,...\r\nwith no other ambition than to transmit to his children.... along with\r\ntheir inheritance an unsullied reputation.\"[4180] Among the other groups\r\nof the bourgeoisie the same corporate system, the same settled habits,\r\nthe same security, the same frugality, the same institutions, the same\r\ncustoms,[4181] promoted the growth of nearly the same sentiments, while\r\nthe intellectual culture of these men was not insignificant. Having\r\nleisure, they were given to reading; as they were not overwhelmed with\r\nnewspapers they read books worth reading; I have found in old libraries\r\nin the provinces, in the houses of the descendants of a manufacturer\r\nor lawyer in a small town, complete editions of Voltaire, Rousseau,\r\nMontesquieu, Buffon and Condillac, with marks in each volume showing\r\nthat the volume had been read by someone in the house before the close\r\nof the eighteenth century. Nowhere else, likewise, had all that was\r\nsound and liberal in the philosophy of the eighteenth century found\r\nsuch a welcome; it is from this class that the patriots of 1789 were\r\nrecruited; it had furnished not only the majority of the Constituent\r\nAssembly, but again all the honest men who, from July, 1789 to the end\r\nof 1791 performed their administrative duties so disinterestedly, and\r\nwith such devotion and zeal, amidst so many difficulties, dangers and\r\ndisappointments. Composed of Feuillants or Monarchists, possessing\r\nsuch types of men as Huez of Troyes or Dietrich of Strasbourg, and for\r\nrepresentatives such leaders as Lafayette and Bailly, it comprised\r\nthe superior intelligence and most substantial integrity of the\r\nThird-Estate. It is evident that, along with the nobles and clergy, the\r\nbest fruits of history were gathered in it, and most of the mental\r\nand moral capital accumulated, not only by the century, but, again, by\r\npreceding centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Demi-notables.\r\n\r\n     Where recruited.--Village and trade syndics.--Competency of\r\n     their electors.--Their interest in making good selections.\r\n     --Their capacity and integrity.--The sorting of men under the\r\n     ancient regime.--Conditions of a family's maintenance and\r\n     advancement.--Hereditary and individual right of the Notable\r\n     to his property and rank.\r\n\r\nLike a fire lit on a hilltop overlooking a cold and obscure countryside,\r\na civilization, kept alive with much expense on peaks in a sea of human\r\nbarbarity, radiating while its rays grow dim; its light and warmth\r\nfading just as its gleams reach remoter and deeper strata. Nevertheless,\r\nboth penetrate yet sufficiently far and deep before wholly dying out. If\r\nwe want to appraise their power in France at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury we must add to the notables the half-notables of society,\r\nnamely, the men who, like the people, were devoted to manual labor, but\r\nwho, among the people, led the way, say one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nfamilies, consisting of well-to-do farmers, small rural proprietors,\r\nshopkeepers, retailers, foremen and master-workmen, village syndics and\r\nguild syndics,[4182] those who were established and had some capital,\r\nowning a plot of land and a house, with a business or stock of tools,\r\nand a set of customers, that is to say, with something ahead and credit,\r\nnot being obliged to live from hand to mouth, and therefore, beginning\r\nto be independent and more influential, in short, the overseers of\r\nthe great social work-house, the sergeants and corporals of the social\r\narmy.--They, too, were not unworthy of their rank. In the village or\r\ntrade community, the syndic, elected by his equals and neighbors,\r\nwas not blindly nominated; all his electors in relation to him were\r\ncompetent; if peasants, they had seen him turning up the soil; if\r\nblacksmiths or joiners, they had seen him at work in his forge, or at\r\nthe bench. And, as their direct, present and obvious interests were\r\nconcerned, they chose him for the best, not on the strength of a\r\nnewspaper recommendation, in deference to a vague declamatory platform\r\nor sounding, empty phrases, but according to their personal experiences,\r\nand the thorough knowledge they had of him. The man sent by the village\r\nto represent them to the intendant and selected by the guild to sit in\r\nthe town council, was its most capable, and most creditable man, one of\r\nthose, probably, who, through his application, intelligence, honesty and\r\neconomy, had proved the most prosperous, some master-workman or farmer\r\nthat had gained experience through long years of assiduity, familiar\r\nwith details and precedents, of good judgment and repute, more\r\ninterested than anybody else in supporting the interests of the\r\ncommunity and with more leisure than others to attend to public\r\naffairs.[4183] This man, through the nature of things, imposed himself\r\non the attention, confidence, and deference of his peers, and, because\r\nhe was their natural representative, he was their legal representative.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, if, in this old society, the pressure was unequally\r\ndistributed, if the general equilibrium was unstable, if the upper parts\r\nbore down too heavily on the lower ones, the sorting, at least, which\r\ngoes on in every civilized State, constantly separating the wheat from\r\nthe chaff, went on tolerably well; except at the center and at the\r\nCourt, where the winnowing machine had worked haphazard and, frequently,\r\nin an opposite sense for a century, the separation proceeded\r\nregularly, undoubtedly slower, but, perhaps, more equitably than in our\r\ncontemporary democracy. The chance that a notable by right could become\r\na notable de facto was then much greater: it was less difficult, and the\r\ninclination to found, maintain and perpetuate a family or a business\r\nwas much stronger; people looked more often beyond themselves; the eyes\r\nnaturally turned outside the narrow circle of one's personality, looking\r\nbackward as well as beyond this present life. The (later) institution\r\nof an equal partition of property, the (later) system of obligatory\r\npartition and the rule of partition in kind, with other prescriptions\r\nof the (new) civil code, did not split up an heritage and ruin the\r\nhome.[4184] Parental negligence and the children's lack of respect and\r\nconsideration had not yet upset the authority and abolished respect in\r\nthe family. Useful and natural associations were not yet stifled in the\r\ngerm nor arrested in their development by the systematic hostility of\r\nthe law. The ease and cheapness of transportation, the promiscuity of\r\nschools, the excitement of competition, everyone's rush to placement and\r\noffice, the increasing excitement of ambition and greed, had not (yet)\r\nimmeasurably multiplied the class of irresponsible malcontents and\r\nmischievous nomads. In the political order of things, inaptitude, envy,\r\nbrutality were not sovereign; universal suffrage did not exclude from\r\npower the men, born, bred and qualified to exercise it; countless public\r\nposts were not offered as a prey to charlatanism and to the intrigues\r\nof politicians. France was not then, as now-a-days, on a way to become\r\na vast lodging-house administered by casual managers, condemned to\r\nperiodical failures, inhabited by anonymous residents, indifferent\r\nto each other, lacking local ties, lacking engagements and having no\r\ncorporate loyalties, merely tenants and passing consumers, placed in\r\nnumerical order around a common mess-table where each thinks only of\r\nhimself, gets served quickly, consumes what he can lay his hands on, and\r\nends by finding out that, in a place of this sort, the best condition,\r\nthe wisest course, is to put all one's property into an annuity and live\r\na bachelor.--Formerly, among all classes and in all the provinces, there\r\nwere a large number of families that had taken root on the spot, living\r\nthere a hundred years and more. Not only among the nobles, but among\r\nthe bourgeoisie and the Third-Estate, the heir of any enterprise was\r\nexpected to continue his calling. This was so with the seignorial\r\nchateau and extensive domain, as with the bourgeois dwelling and\r\npatrimonial office, the humble rural domain, farm, shop and factory, all\r\nwere transmitted intact from one generation to another.[4185] Great or\r\nsmall, the individual was not exclusively interested in himself; his\r\nthoughts also traveled forward to the future and back to the past, on\r\nthe side of ancestors and on that of descendants, along the endless\r\nchain of which his own life was but a link; he possessed traditions,\r\nhe felt bound to set examples. Under this twofold title, his domestic\r\nauthority was uncontested;[4186] his household and all his employees\r\nfollowed his instructions without swerving and without resistance. When,\r\nby virtue of this domestic discipline, a family had maintained itself\r\nupright and respected on the same spot for a century, it could easily\r\nadvance a degree; it could introduce one of its members into the upper\r\nclass, pass from the plow or trade to petty offices, and from these to\r\nthe higher ones and to parliamentary dignities, from the four thousand\r\nposts that ennoble to the legalized nobility, from the lately made\r\nnobles to the old nobility. Apart from the two or three thousand gilded\r\ndrones living on the public honey at Versailles, apart from the court\r\nparasites and their valets, three or four hundred thousand notables\r\nand half-notables of France thus acquired and kept their offices,\r\nconsideration and fortune; they were therefore their legitimate\r\npossessors. The peasant-proprietor and master-artisan had risen from\r\nfather to son, at four o'clock in the morning, toiled all day and never\r\ndrank. From father to son, the trader, notary, lawyer and office-holder,\r\nhad been careful, economical, skillful and attentive to business,\r\ncorrect in their papers, precise in their accounts. From father to\r\nson, the nobleman had served bravely, the parliamentarian had judged\r\nequitably, as a point of honor, with a salary inferior to the interest\r\nof the sum paid by him to acquire his rank or post. Each of these men\r\nreceived no more than his due; his possessions and his rank were the\r\nsavings of his ascendants, the price of social services rendered by\r\nthe long file of deserving dead, all that his ancestors, his father and\r\nhimself had created or preserved of any stable value; each piece of\r\ngold that remained in the hereditary purse represented the balance of\r\na lifetime, the enduring labor of some one belonging to his line,\r\nwhile among these gold pieces, he himself had provided his share.--For,\r\npersonal services counted, even among the upper nobility; and all the\r\nmore among the lower class, in the Third-Estate, and among the people.\r\nAmong the notables of every degree just described, most of them,\r\nin 1789, were fully grown men, many of them mature, a goodly number\r\nadvanced in years, and some quite aged; consequently, in justification\r\nof his rank and emoluments, or of his gains and his fortune, each could\r\nallege fifteen, twenty, thirty and forty years of labor and honorability\r\nin private or public situations, the grand-vicar of the diocese as well\r\nas the chief-clerk of the ministry, the intendant of the généralité as\r\nwell as the president of the royal tribunal, the village curé, the\r\nnoble officer, the office-holder, the lawyer, the procureur, the large\r\nmanufacturer, the wholesale dealer, as well as the well-to-do farmer,\r\nand the well-known handicraftsman.--Thus, not only were they an élite\r\ncorps, the most valuable portion of the nation, the best timber of the\r\nforest, but again, the wood of each branch belonged to that trunk; it\r\ngrew there, and was the product of its own vegetation; it sprung out\r\nof the trunk wholly through the unceasing and spontaneous effort of the\r\nnative sap, through time-honored and recent labor, and, on this account,\r\nit merited respect.--Through a double onslaught, at once against\r\neach human branch and against the entire French forest, the Jacobin\r\nwood-choppers seek to clear the ground. Their theory results in this\r\nprecept, that not one of the noble trees of this forest, not one\r\nvaluable trunk from the finest oak to the smallest sapling, should be\r\nleft standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Principle of socialist Equality.\r\n\r\n     All superiorities of rank are illegitimate.--Bearing of this\r\n     principle.--Incivique benefits and enjoyments.--How\r\n     revolutionary laws reach the lower class.--Whole populations\r\n     affected in a mass.--proportion of the lowly in the\r\n     proscription lists. How the revolutionary laws specially\r\n     affect those who are prominent among the people.\r\n\r\nNot that the ravages which they make stop there! The principle extended\r\nfar beyond that. The fundamental rule, according to Jacobin maxims,\r\nis that every public or private advantage which any citizen enjoys and\r\nwhich is not enjoyed by another citizen, is illegitimate.--On Ventôse\r\n19, year II., Henriot, general in command, having surrounded the\r\nPalais Royal and made a sweep of \"suspects,\" renders an account of his\r\nexpedition as follows:[4187] \"One hundred and thirty muscadins have been\r\narrested.... These gentlemen are transferred to the Petits-Pêres. Being\r\nwell-fed and plump, they cannot be sans-culottes.\" Henriot was right,\r\nfor, to live well is incivique. Whoever lays in stores of provisions is\r\ncriminal, even if he has gone a good ways for them, even if he has not\r\noverpaid the butcher of his quarter, even if he has not diminished by\r\nan ounce of meat the ration of his neighbor; when he is found out, he\r\nis punished and his hoard confiscated. \"A citizen[4188] had a little\r\npig brought to him from a place six leagues from Paris, and killed it\r\nat once. Three hours afterwards, the pig was seized by commissioners and\r\ndistributed among the people, without the owner getting a bit of it;\"\r\nmoreover, the said owner \"was imprisoned.\"--He is a monopolist! To\r\nJacobin people, to empty stomachs, there is no greater crime; this\r\nmisdeed, to their imaginations, explains the arrest of Hébert, their\r\nfavorite: \"It is said at the Halle (the covered Paris market)[4189] that\r\nhe has monopolized a brother of the order of Saint-Antoine[4190] as well\r\nas a pot of twenty-five pounds of Brittany butter,\" which is enough;\r\nthey immediately and \"unanimously consign Père Duchesne to the\r\nguillotine.\" (Note that the Père Duchesne, founded by Hébert, was\r\nthe most radical and revolutionary journal. (SR.)--Of all privileges,\r\naccordingly, that of having a supply of food is the most offensive; \"it\r\nis now necessary for one who has two dishes to give one of them to him\r\nwho has none;\"[4191] every man who manages to eat more than another is\r\na robber; for, in the first place, he robs the community, the sole\r\nlegitimate owner of aliments, and next, he robs, and personally, all who\r\nhave less to eat than he has.\r\n\r\nThe same rule applies to other things of which the possession is\r\neither agreeable or useful: in an equalizing social system, that now\r\nestablished, every article of food possessed by one individual to the\r\nexclusion of others, is a dish abstracted from the common table and held\r\nby him to another's detriment. On the strength of this, the theorists\r\nwho govern agree with the reigning ragamuffins. Whoever has two good\r\ncoats is an aristocrat, for there are many who have only one poor\r\none.[4192] Whoever has good shoes is an aristocrat, for many wear wooden\r\nones, and others go barefoot. Whoever owns and rents lodgings is an\r\naristocrat, for others, his tenants, instead of receiving money, pay it\r\nout. The tenant who furnishes his own rooms is an aristocrat, for many\r\nlodge in boarding-houses and others sleep in the open air. Whoever\r\npossesses capital is an aristocrat, even the smallest amount in money or\r\nin kind, a field, a roof over his head, half-a-dozen silver spoons given\r\nto him by his parents on his wedding-day, an old woollen stocking into\r\nwhich twenty or thirty crowns have been dropped one by one, all one's\r\nsavings, whatever has been laid by or economized, a petty assortment of\r\neatables or merchandise, one's crop for the year and stock of groceries,\r\nespecially if, disliking to give them up and letting his dissatisfaction\r\nbe seen, he, through revolutionary taxation and requisitions, through\r\nthe maximum and the confiscation of the precious metals, is\r\nconstrained to surrender his small savings gratis, or at half their\r\nvalue.--Fundamentally, it is only those who have nothing of their own\r\nthat are held to be patriots, those who live from day to day,[4193] \"the\r\nwretched,\" the poor, vagabonds, and the famished; the humblest laborer,\r\nthe least instructed, the most ill at his ease, is treated as criminal,\r\nas an enemy, as soon as he is suspected of having some resources; in\r\nvain does he show his scarified or callous hands; he escapes neither\r\nspoliation, the prison, nor the guillotine. At Troyes, a poor shop-girl\r\nwho had set up a small business on borrowed money, but who is ruined\r\nby a bankruptcy and completely so by the maximum, infirm, and consuming\r\npiecemeal the rest of her stock, is taxed five hundred livres.[4194] In\r\nthe villages of Alsace, an order is issued to arrest the five, six\r\nor seven richest persons in the commune, even if there are no rich;\r\nconsequently, they seize the least poor, simply because they are so; for\r\ninstance, at Heiligenberg, six \"farmers\" one of whom is a day-laborer,\r\n\"or journey-man,\" \"suspect,\" says the register of the jail, \"because\r\nhe is comfortably off.\"[4195] On this account nowhere are there so many\r\n\"suspects\" as among the people; the shop, the farm and the work-room\r\nharbor more aristocrats than the rectory and the chateau. In effect,\r\naccording to the Jacobins,[4196] \"nearly all farmers are aristocrats;\"\r\n\"the merchants are all essentially anti-revolutionary,\"[4197] and\r\nespecially all dealers in articles of prime necessity, wine-merchants,\r\nbakers and butchers; the latter especially are open \"conspirators,\"\r\nenemies \"of the interior,\" and \"whose aristocracy is insupportable.\"\r\nSuch, already, among the lower class of people, are the many delinquents\r\nwho are punished.\r\n\r\nBut there are still more of them to punish, for, besides the crime\r\nof not being destitute, of possessing some property, of withholding\r\narticles necessary for existence, there is the crime of aristocracy,\r\nnecessarily so called, namely, repugnance to, lack of zeal, or even\r\nindifference for the established régime, regret for the old one,\r\nrelationship or intercourse with a condemned or imprisoned émigré of\r\nthe upper class, services rendered to some outlaw, the resort to some\r\npriest; now, numbers of poor farmers, mechanics, domestics and women\r\nservants, have committed this crime;[4198] and in many provinces and\r\nin many of the large cities nearly the whole of the laboring population\r\ncommits it and persists in it; such is the case, according to Jacobin\r\nreports, in Alsace, Franche-Comté, Provence, Vaucluse, Anjou, Poitou,\r\nVendée, Brittany, Picardie and Flanders, and in Marseilles, Bordeaux\r\nand Lyons. In Lyons alone, writes Collot d'Herbois, \"there are sixty\r\nthousand persons who never will become republicans. They should be dealt\r\nwith, that is made redundant, and prudently distributed all over the\r\nsurface of the Republic.\"[4199]--Finally, add to the persons of the\r\nlower class, prosecuted on public grounds, those who are prosecuted on\r\nprivate grounds. Among peasants in the same village, workmen of the\r\nsame trade and shopkeepers in the same quarter, there is always envy,\r\nenmities and spites; those who are Jacobins become local pashas and are\r\nable to gratify local jealousies with impunity, something they never\r\nfail to do.[41100]\r\n\r\nHence, on the lists of the guillotined, the incarcerated and of emigrés,\r\nthe men and women of inferior condition are in much greater number, far\r\ngreater than their companions of the superior and middle classes all put\r\ntogether. Out of 12,000 condemned to death whose rank and professions\r\nhave been ascertained, 7,545[41101] are peasants, cultivators,\r\nploughmen, workmen of various sorts, innkeepers, wine-dealers, soldiers\r\nand sailors, domestics, women, young girls, servants and seamstresses.\r\nOut of 1,900 emigrés from Doubs, nearly 1,100 belong to the lower class.\r\nTowards the month of April, 1794, all the prisons in France overflow\r\nwith farmers;[41102] in the Paris prisons alone, two months before\r\nThermidor 9, there are 2 000 of them.[41103] Without mentioning the\r\neleven western departments in which four or five hundred square leagues\r\nof territory are devastated and twenty towns and one thousand eight\r\nhundred villages destroyed,[41104] where the avowed purpose of the\r\nJacobin policy is a systematic and total destruction of the country, man\r\nand beast, buildings, crops, and even trees, there are cantons and even\r\nprovinces where the entire rural and working population is arrested or\r\nput to flight. In the Pyrenees, the old Basque populations \"torn from\r\ntheir natal soil, crowded into the churches with no means of subsistence\r\nbut that of charity,\" in the middle of winter, so that sixteen hundred\r\nof those incarcerated die \"mostly of cold and hunger;\"[41105] at\r\nBédouin, a town of two thousand souls, in which a tree of liberty is cut\r\ndown by some unknown persons, four hundred and thirty-three houses are\r\ndemolished or burned, sixteen persons guillotined and forty-seven shot,\r\nwhile the rest of the inhabitants are driven out, reduced to living\r\nlike vagabonds on the mountain, or in holes which they dig in the\r\nground;[41106] in Alsace, fifty thousand farmers who, in the winter of\r\n1793, take refuge with their wives and children on the other side of\r\nthe Rhine.[41107] In short, the revolutionary operation is a complete\r\nprostration of people of all classes, the trunks as well as the saplings\r\nbeing felled, and often in such a way as to clear the ground entirely.\r\n\r\nBut in this ruthless felling, however, the notables of the people,\r\nmaking all due allowances, suffer more than the ordinary people. It\r\nis obvious that the Jacobin wood-chopper persecutes, insistently and\r\nselectively, the veterans of labor and savings, the large cultivators\r\nwho from father to son and for many generations have possessed the same\r\nfarm, the master-craftsmen whose shops are well stocked and who have\r\ngood customers, the respectable, well-patronized retailers, who owe\r\nnothing; the village-syndics and trades-syndics, all those showing more\r\ndeeply and visibly than the rest of their class, the five or six blazes\r\nwhich summon the ax. They are better off, better provided with desirable\r\ncomforts and conveniences, which is of itself an offense against\r\nequality. Having accumulated a small hoard, a few pieces of plate,\r\nsometimes a few crowns,[41108] a store of linen and clothes, a stock of\r\nprovisions or goods, they do not willingly submit to being plundered,\r\nwhich is the offense of egoism. Being egoists, it is presumed that they\r\nare hostile to the system of fraternity, at least indifferent to it, as\r\nwell as lukewarm towards the Republic, that is to say, Moderates, which\r\nis the worst offense of all.[41109] Being the foremost of their class,\r\nthey are haughty like the nobles or the bourgeois and regard themselves\r\nas superior to a poor man, to a vagabond, to a genuine sans-culotte, the\r\nfourth and most inexcusable of all offenses. Moreover, from the fact of\r\ntheir superior condition, they have contracted familiarities and formed\r\nconnections with the proscribed class; the farmer, the intendant, the\r\noverseer is often attached to his noble proprietor or patron;[41110]\r\nmany of the farmers, shopkeepers and craftsmen belonging to old families\r\nare considered as affiliated with the bourgeoisie or the clergy,[41111]\r\nthrough a son or brother who has risen a degree in trade, or by some\r\nindustrial pursuit, or who, having completed his studies, has become a\r\ncuré or lawyer, or else through some daughter, or well-married sister,\r\nor through one who has become a nun: now, this relation, ally, friend\r\nor comrade of a \"suspect \"is himself a \"suspect,\"--the last\r\nanti-revolutionary and decisive barrier. Sober and well-behaved persons,\r\nhaving prospered or maintained themselves under the ancient régime,\r\nmust naturally cherish respect for former institutions; they must\r\ninvoluntarily retain a deep feeling of veneration for the King, and\r\nespecially for religion; they are devout Catholics, and therefore\r\nare chagrined to see the churches shut up, worship prohibited and\r\necclesiastics persecuted, and would again be glad to go to Mass, honor\r\nEaster, and have an orthodox curé who could administer to them available\r\nsacraments, a baptism, an absolution, a marriage-rite, a genuine extreme\r\nunction.[41112]--Under all these headings, they have made personal\r\nenemies of the rascals who hold office; on all these grounds, they are\r\nstruck down; what was once meritorious with them is now disgraceful.\r\nThus, the principal swath consists of the élite of the people,\r\nselected from amongst the people itself; it is against the \"subordinate\r\naristocracy,\" those most capable of doing and conducting manual labor,\r\nthe most creditable workmen, through their activity, frugality and good\r\nhabits, that the Revolution, in its rigor against the inferior class,\r\nrages with the greatest fury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Rigor against the Upper Classes.\r\n\r\n     The rigor of the revolutionary laws increase according to\r\n     the elevation of the class.--The Notables properly so called\r\n     attacked because of their being Notables.--Orders of\r\n     Taillefer, Milhaud, and Lefiot.--The public atonement of\r\n     Montargis.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, as far as the notables, properly so-called, are\r\nconcerned, it bears down still more heavily, not merely on the nobles\r\nbecause of ancient privileges, not merely on ecclesiastics on the score\r\nof being insubordinate Catholics, but on nobles, ecclesiastics and\r\nbourgeois in their capacity of notables, that is to say, born and bred\r\nabove others, and respected by the masses on account of their superior\r\ncondition.--In the eyes of the genuine Jacobin, the notables of the\r\nthird class are no less criminal than the members of the two superior\r\nclasses. \"The bourgeois,[41113] the merchants, the large proprietors,\"\r\nwrites a popular club in the South, \"all have the pretension of the old\r\nset (des ci-dévants).\" And the club complains of \"the law not providing\r\nmeans for opening the eyes of the people with respect to these new\r\ntyrants.\" It is horrible! The stand they take is an offense against\r\nequality and they are proud of it! And what is worse, this stand\r\nattracts public consideration! Consequently, \"the club requests that\r\nthe revolutionary Tribunal be empowered to consign this proud class to\r\ntemporary confinement,\" and then \"the people would see the crime it had\r\ncommitted and recover from the sort of esteem in which they had held\r\nit.\"--Incorrigible and contemptuous heretics against the new creed,\r\nthey are only too lucky to be treated somewhat like infidel Jews in the\r\nmiddle-ages. Accordingly, if they are tolerated, it is on the condition\r\nthat they let themselves be pillaged at discretion, covered with\r\nopprobrium and subdued through fear.--At one time, with insulting irony,\r\nthey are called upon to prove their dubious civism by forced donations.\r\n\"Whereas,\"[41114] says Representative Milhaud, \"all the citizens and\r\ncitoyennes of Narbonne being in requisition for the discharge and\r\ntransport of forage; whereas, this morning, the Representative, in\r\nperson, having inspected the performance of this duty,\" and having\r\nobserved on the canal \"none but sans-culottes and a few young citizens;\r\nwhereas, not finding at their posts any muscadin and no muscadine;\r\nwhereas, the persons, whose hands are no doubt too delicate, even\r\ntemporarily, for the glorious work of robust sans-culottes, have, on the\r\nother hand, greater resources in their fortune, and, desiring to afford\r\nto the rich of Narbonne the precious advantage of being equally useful\r\nto the republic,\" hereby orders that \"the richest citizens of Narbonne\r\npay within twenty-four hours\" a patriotic donation of one hundred\r\nthousand livres, one-half to be assigned to the military hospitals, and\r\nthe other half, on the designation thereof by a \"Committee of Charity,\r\ncomposed of three reliable revolutionary sans-culottes,\" to be\r\ndistributed among the poor of the Commune. Should any \"rich egoist\r\nrefuse to contribute his contingent he is to be immediately transferred\r\nto the jail at Perpignan.\"--Not to labor with one's own hands, to\r\nbe disqualified for work demanding physical strength, is of itself\r\na democratic stain, and the man who is sullied by this draws down on\r\nhimself, not alone an augmentation of pecuniary taxation, but frequently\r\nan augmentation of personal compulsory labor. At Villeneuve, Aveyron,\r\nand throughout the department of Cantal,[41115] Representative Taillefer\r\nand his delegate Deltheil, instruct the Revolutionary Committees to\r\n\"place under military requisition and conscription all muscadins above\r\nthe first class,\" that is to say, all between twenty-five and forty\r\nyears of age who are not reached by the law. \"By muscadins is meant all\r\ncitizens of that age not married, and exercising no useful profession,\"\r\nin other words, those who live on their income. And, that none of the\r\nmiddle or upper class may escape, the edict subjects to special rigor,\r\nsupplementary taxes, and arbitrary arrest, not alone property-holders\r\nand fund-holders, but again all persons designated under the following\r\nheads,--aristocrats, Feuillants, moderates, Girondists, federalists,\r\nmuscadins, the superstitious, fanatics the abettors of royalism,\r\nof superstition and of federation, monopolists, jobbers, egoists,\r\n\"suspects\" of incivism, and, generally, all who are indifferent to the\r\nRevolution, of which local committees are to draw up the lists.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in a town, some steps taken collectively, either a vote or\r\npetition, furnish a ready-made list;[41116] it suffices to read this to\r\nknow who are notables, the most upright people of the place; henceforth,\r\nunder the pretext of political repression, the levellers may give free\r\nplay to their social hatred.--At Montargis, nine days after the attempt\r\nof June 20, 1792,[41117] two hundred and twenty-eight notables sign an\r\naddress in testimony of their respectful sympathy for the King; a year\r\nand nine months later, in consequence of a retroactive stroke, all are\r\nhit, and, with the more satisfaction, inasmuch as in their persons the\r\nmost respected in the town fall beneath the blow, all whom flight\r\nand banishment had left there belonging to the noble, ecclesiastic,\r\nbourgeois or popular aristocracy. Already, \"on the purification of the\r\nconstituted authorities of Montargis, the representative had withdrawn\r\nevery signer from places of public trust and kept them out of all\r\noffices.\" But this is not sufficient; the punishment must be more\r\nexemplary. Four of them, the ex-mayor, an ex-collector, a district\r\nadministrator and a notable are sent to the revolutionary Tribunal in\r\nParis, to be guillotined in deference to principles. Thirty-two former\r\nofficers--chevaliers of St. Louis, mousquetaires, nobles, priests, an\r\nex-procureur-royal, an ex-treasurer of France, a former administrator\r\nof the department, and two ladies, one of them designated as \"calling\r\nherself a former marchioness\"--are confined, until peace is secured, in\r\nthe jail at Montargis. Other former municipal officers and officers in\r\nthe National Guard--men of the law, notaries and advocates, physicians,\r\nsurgeons, former collectors, police commissioners, postmasters,\r\nmerchants and manufacturers, men and women, married or widows and\r\nwidowers--are to make public apology and be summoned to the Temple of\r\nReason to undergo there the humiliation of a public penance on the\r\n20th of Ventôse at three o'clock in the afternoon. They all go, for\r\nthe summons says, \"whoever does not present himself on the day and\r\nhour named will be arrested and confined until peace is declared.\" On\r\nreaching the church, purified by Jacobin adoration, \"in the presence\r\nof the constituted authorities of the popular club and of the citizens\r\nconvoked in general assembly,\" they mount one by one into a tribune\r\nraised three steps above the floor,\" in such a way as to be in full\r\nsight. One by one the national agent, or the mayor, reprimands them in\r\nthe following language:\r\n\r\n\"You have been base enough to sign a fawning address to Louis XVI.,\r\nthe most odious and the vilest of tyrants, an ogre of the human species\r\nguilty of every sort of crime and debauchery. You are hereby censured by\r\nthe people. You are moreover warned that on committing the first act\r\nof incivism, or manifesting any anti-revolutionary conduct, the\r\nsurveillance of the constituted authorities will be extended to you in\r\nthe most energetic manner; the tribunals will show you less leniency and\r\nthe guillotine will insure prompt and imposing justice.\"\r\n\r\nEach, called by name, receives in turn the threatened admonition,\r\nand, descending from the tribune amidst hues and cries, all sign the\r\nprocès-verbal. But shame and guilt are often absent, and some of them do\r\nnot seem to be sufficiently penitent. Consequently, at the close of the\r\nceremony, the National Agent calls the attention of the assembly to\r\n\"the impudence manifested by certain aristocrats, so degraded that\r\neven national justice fails to make them blush;\" and the Revolutionary\r\nCommittee, \"considering the indifference and derisive conduct of four\r\nwomen and three men, just manifested in this assembly; considering the\r\nnecessity of punishing an inveterate aristocracy which seems to make\r\nsport of corrective acts that bear only (sic) on morals, in a most\r\nexemplary manner, decides that the seven delinquents \"shall be put under\r\narrest, and confined in the jail of Sainte-Marie.\" The three who have\r\nshown indifference, are to be confined three months; the four who have\r\nshown derision, are to be confined until peace is restored. Besides\r\nthis, the decree of the National Agent and the minutes of the meeting\r\nare to be printed and six thousand impressions struck off at the expense\r\nof the signers, \"the richest and most 'suspect,' \"--a former treasurer\r\nof France, a notary, a grocer, the wife of the former commandant of the\r\ngendarmerie, a widow and another woman,--all, says the agent, \"of very\r\nsolid wealth and aristocracy.\" \"Bravo!\" shouts the assembly, at this\r\nwitticism; applause is given and it sings \"the national hymn.\" It is\r\nnine o'clock in the evening. This public penitence lasts six hours and\r\nthe Jacobins of Montargis retire, proud of their work; having punished\r\nas a public affront, an old and legal manifestation of respect for the\r\npublic magistrate; having sent either to the scaffold or to prison, and\r\nfined or disgraced the small local élite; having degraded to the level\r\nof prostitutes and felons under surveillance, reputable women and\r\nhonorable men who are, by law, most esteemed under a normal system of\r\ngovernment and who, under the revolutionary system are, by law, the\r\nleast so.[41118]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. The Jacobin Citizen Robot.\r\n\r\n     Two characteristics of the upper class, wealth and\r\n     education.--Each of these is criminal.--Measures against\r\n     rich and well-to-do people.--Affected in a mass and by\r\n     categories.--Measures against cultivated and polite people.\r\n     --Danger of culture and distinction.--Proscription of \"honest\r\n     folks.\"\r\n\r\nTwo advantages, fortune and education, each involving the other, cause\r\na man to be ranked in the upper class; hence, one or the other,\r\nwhether each by itself or both together, mark a man out for spoliation,\r\nimprisonment and death.--In vain may he have demonstrated his\r\nJacobinism, and Jacobinism of the ultra sort. Hérault-Séchelles, who\r\nvoted for murdering the King, who belongs to the Committee of Public\r\nSafety, who, in the Upper-Rhine, has just carried out the worst\r\nrevolutionary ordinances,[41119] but who has the misfortune to be rich\r\nand a man of the world, is led to the scaffold, and those devoted to\r\nthe guillotine readily explain his condemnation: he is no patriot,--how\r\ncould he be, enjoying an income of two hundred thousand livres, and,\r\nmoreover, is he not a general-advocate?[41120] One of these offenses is\r\nsufficient.--Alone and by itself, \"opulence,\" writes Saint-Just, \"is a\r\ndisgrace,\" and, according to him, a man is opulent \"who supports fewer\r\nchildren than he has thousands of livres income; in effect, among the\r\npersons confined as \"rich and egoists\" we find, according to the very\r\ndeclaration of the Revolutionary Committee, persons with incomes of only\r\n4,000, 3,700, 1,500, and even 500 livres.[41121] Moreover, a fortune or\r\na competence, inspires its possessor with anti-revolutionary sentiments;\r\nconsequently, he is for the moment an obstruction; \"You are rich,\" says\r\nCambon, making use of a personification, \"you cherish an opinion, which\r\ncompels us to be on the defensive; pay then, so as to indemnify us and\r\nbe thankful for our indulgence which, precautionary and until peace\r\nis declared, keeps you under bolt and bar.\"[41122] Rich,\r\nanti-revolutionary, and vicious,\" according to Robespierre,[41123]\r\n\"these three traits depend on each other, and, therefore, the possession\r\nof the superfluous is an infallible sign of aristocracy, a visible\r\nmark of incivism\" and, as Fouché says, \"a stamp of reprobation.\" \"The\r\nsuperfluous is an evident and unwarrantable violation of the people's\r\nrights; every man who has more than his wants call for, cannot use, and\r\ntherefore he must only abuse.\"[41124] Whoever does not make over to the\r\nmasses the excess of what is strictly necessary.... places himself\r\nin the rank of 'suspects.' Rich egoists, you are the cause of our\r\nmisfortunes!\"[41125] \"You dared to smile contemptuously on the\r\nappellation of sans-culottes;[41126] you have enjoyed much more than\r\nyour brethren alongside of you dying with hunger; you are not fit to\r\nassociate with them, and since you have disdained to have them eat at\r\nyour table, they cast you out eternally from their bosom and\r\ncondemn you, in turn, to wear the shackles prepared for them by your\r\nindifference or your maneuvers.\" In other words, whoever has a good\r\nroof over his head, or wears good clothes, man or woman, idler or\r\nindustrious, noble or commoner, is available for the prison or the\r\nguillotine, or, at the very least, he is a taxable and workable serf\r\nat pleasure; his capital and accumulations, if not spontaneously\r\nand immediately handed over, form a criminal basis and proof of\r\nconviction.--The orders of arrest are generally issued against him on\r\naccount of his wealth; in order to drain a town of these offenders\r\none by one, all are penned together according to their resources; at\r\nStrasbourg,[41127] 193 persons are taxed, each from 6,000 to 300,000\r\nlivres, in all 9 million livres, payable within twenty-four hours,\r\nby the leading men of each profession or trade, bankers, brokers,\r\nmerchants, manufacturers, professors, pastors, lawyers, physicians,\r\nsurgeons, publishers, printers, upholsterers, glass-dealers,\r\nrope-makers, master-masons, coffee-house and tavern keepers. And let\r\nthere be no delay in responding to these orders within the prescribed\r\ntime! Otherwise the delinquents will be placed in the stocks, on the\r\nscaffold, face to face with the guillotine. \"One of the best citizens\r\nin the commune, who had steadily manifested his attachment to the\r\nRevolution, being unable to realize a sum of 250,000 livres in one day,\r\nwas fastened in the pillory.\"[41128] Sometimes the orders affected an\r\nentire class, not alone nobles or priests, but all the members of any\r\nbourgeois profession or even of any handicraft. At Strasbourg, a little\r\nlater, \"considering that the thirst for gold has always controlled the\r\nbrewers of the commune,\" they are condemned to 250,000 livres fine, to\r\nbe paid in three days under penalty of being declared rebels, with\r\nthe confiscation of their possessions;\" then, upon another similar\r\nconsideration, the bakers and flour dealers are taxed three hundred\r\nthousand livres.[41129] In addition to this, writes Representative\r\nMilhaud, at Guyardin,[41130] \"We have ordered the arrest of all bankers,\r\nstock-brokers and notaries.... All their wealth is confiscated; we\r\nestimate the sums under seal at 2 or 3 millions in coin, and 15 or 16\r\nin assignats.\" There is the same haul of the net at Paris. By order of\r\nLhuillier, procureur of the department, \"seals are placed in the\r\noffices of all the bankers, stock-brokers, silversmiths, etc.,\" and they\r\nthemselves are shut up in the Madelonettes; a few days after, that they\r\nmay pay their drafts, they are let out as a favor, but on condition that\r\nthey remain under arrest in their homes, at their own expense,\r\nunder guard of two good sans-culottes.[41131] In like manner, at\r\nNantes,[41132] Lyons, Marseilles and Bordeaux, the prisons are filled\r\nand the guillotine works according to the categories. At one time they\r\nare \"all of the Grand Théatre,\" or the principal merchants, \"to\r\nthe number of more than 200,\" are incarcerated at Bordeaux in one\r\nnight.[41133] At another time, Paris provides a haul of farmer-generals\r\nor parliamentarians. Carts leave Toulouse conveying its parliamentarians\r\nto Paris to undergo capital punishment. At Aix, writes an agent,[41134]\r\n\r\n\"the guillotine is going to work on former lawyers a few hundred heads\r\nlegally taken off will do the greatest good.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as new crimes require new terms to designate them, they add to\r\n\"incivisme\" and \"moderantisme,\" the term \"negociantisme,\" all of which\r\nare easily stated and widespread crimes.\r\n\r\n\"The rich and the merchants,\" writes an observer,[41135] \"are here, as\r\nelsewhere, born enemies of equality and lovers of hideous federalism,\r\nthe only aristocracy that remains to be crushed out.\"\r\n\r\nBarras, with still greater precision, declares in the tribune that,\r\n\"commerce is usurious, monarchical and anti-revolutionary.\"[41136]\r\nConsidered in itself, it may be defined as an appeal to bad instincts;\r\nit seems a corrupting, incivique, anti-fraternal institution, many\r\nJacobins having proposed either to interdict it to private persons and\r\nattribute it wholly to the State, or suppress it along with the arts\r\nand manufactures which nourish it, in order that only a population of\r\nagriculturists and soldiers may be left in France.[41137]\r\n\r\nThe second advantage and the second crime of the notables is superiority\r\nof education. \"In all respectable assemblages,\" writes a Dutch traveler\r\nin 1795,[41138] \"you may be sure that one-half of those present have\r\nbeen in prison. Add the absent, the guillotined, the exiled, emigrés,\r\nthe deported, and note this, that, in the other favored half, those\r\nwho did not quaff the prison cup had had a foretaste of it for, each\r\nexpected daily to receive his warrant of arrest; \"the worst thing under\r\nRobespierre, as several old gentlemen have told me, was that one never\r\nknew in the morning whether one would sleep in one's own bed at night.\"\r\nThere was not a well-bred man who did not live in dread of this; examine\r\nthe lists of \"suspects,\" of the arrested, of exiles, of those\r\nexecuted, in any town, district or department,[41139] and you will\r\nsee immediately, through their quality and occupations, first, that\r\nthree-quarters of the cultivated are inscribed on it, and next,\r\nthat intellectual culture in itself is suspect. \"They were equally\r\ncriminal,\"[41140] write the Strasbourg administrators, \"whether rich\r\nor cultivated.... The (Jacobin) municipality declared the University\r\nfederalist; it proscribed public instruction and, consequently, the\r\nprofessors, regents, and heads of schools, with all instructors, public\r\nas well as private, even those provided with certificates of civism,\r\nwere arrested;.... every Protestant minister and teacher in the\r\nLower-Rhine department was incarcerated, with a threat of being\r\ntransferred to the citadel at Besançon.\"--Fourcroy, in the Jacobin Club\r\nat Paris, excusing himself for being a savant, for giving lectures on\r\nchemistry, for not devoting his time to the rantings of the Convention\r\nand of the clubs, is obliged to declare that he is poor, that he lives\r\nby his work, that he supports \"his father, a sans-culotte, and his\r\nsans-culotte sisters;\" although a good republican, he barely escapes,\r\nand the same with others like him. All educated men were persecuted,\" he\r\nstates a month after Thermidor 9;[41141] \"to have acquaintances, to be\r\nliterary, sufficed for arrest, as an aristocrat.... Robespierre... with\r\ndevilish ingenuity, abused, calumniated and overwhelmed with gall and\r\nbitterness all who were devoted to serious studies, all who professed\r\nextensive knowledge;... he felt that cultivated men would never bend the\r\nknee to him [41142]..... Instruction was paralyzed; they wanted to\r\nburn the libraries..... Must I tell you that at the very door of your\r\nassembly errors in orthography are seen? Nobody learns how to read or\r\nwrite.\"--At Nantes, Carrier boasts of having \"dispersed the literary\r\nchambers,\" while in his enumeration of the evil-minded he adds \"to\r\nthe rich and merchants,\" \"all gens d'esprit.\"[41143] Sometimes on the\r\nturnkey's register we read that such an one was confined \"for being\r\nclever and able to do mischief,\" another for saying \"good-day,\r\ngentlemen, to the municipal councillors.\"[41144]\r\n\r\nPoliteness has, like other signs of a good education, become a stigma;\r\ngood manners are considered, not only as a remnant of the ancient\r\nrégime, but as a revolt against the new institutions; now, as the\r\ngoverning principle of these is, theoretically, abstract equality and,\r\npractically, the ascendancy of the low class, one rebels against the\r\nestablished order of things when one repudiates coarse companions,\r\nfamiliar oaths, and the indecent expressions of the common workman and\r\nthe soldier. In sum, Jacobinism, through its doctrines and deeds, its\r\ndungeons and executioners, proclaims to the nation over which it holds\r\nthe rod:[41145]\r\n\r\n\"Be rude, that you may become republican, return to barbarism that\r\nyou may show the superiority of your genius; abandon the customs of\r\ncivilized people that you may adopt those of galley slaves; mar your\r\nlanguage with a view to improve it; use that of the populace under\r\npenalty of death. Spanish beggars treat each other in a dignified way;\r\nthey show respect for humanity although in tatters. We, on the contrary,\r\norder you to assume our rags, our patois, our terms of intimacy. Don the\r\ncarmagnole and tremble; become rustics and dolts, and prove your civism\r\nby the absence of all education.\"\r\n\r\nThis is true to the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Education,[41146]\" says another contemporary, \"amiable qualities,\r\ngentle ways, a mild physiognomy, bodily graces, a cultivated mind,\r\nall natural endowments are henceforth the inevitable causes of\r\nproscription.\"\r\n\r\nOne is self-condemned if one has not converted oneself into a\r\nsans-culotte and proletarian, in accordance with affected modes, air,\r\nlanguage and dress. Hence,\r\n\r\n\"through a hypocritical contest hitherto unknown men who were not\r\nvicious deemed it necessary to appear so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd worse still,\r\n\r\n\"one was even afraid to be oneself; one changed one's name, one went in\r\ndisguise, wearing a vulgar and tasteless attire; everybody shrunk from\r\nbeing what he was.\"\r\n\r\nFor, according to the Jacobin program, all Frenchmen must be\r\nrecast[41147] in one uniform mold; they must be taken when small; all\r\nmust be subject to the same enforced education, that of a mechanic,\r\nrustic and soldier's boy. Be warned, ye adults, by the guillotine,\r\nreform yourselves beforehand according to the prescribed pattern!\r\nNo more costly, elegant or delicate crystal or gold vases! All are\r\nshattered or are still being shattered. Henceforth, only common ware is\r\nto be tolerated or ordered to be made, all alike in substance, shape and\r\ncolor, manufactured by thousands at wholesale and in public factories,\r\nfor the common and plain uses of rural and military life; all original\r\nand superior forms are to be rejected.\r\n\r\n\"The masters of the day,\" writes Daunou,[41148] \"deliberately aimed\r\ntheir sword thrusts at superior talent, at energetic characters; they\r\nmowed down as well as they could in so short a time, the flower and hope\r\nof the nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn this respect they were consistent; equality-socialism[41149] allows\r\nnone but automatic citizens, mere tools in the hands of the State, all\r\nalike, of a rudimentary fashion and easily managed, without personal\r\nconscience, spontaneity, curiosity or integrity; whoever has cultivated\r\nhimself, whoever has thought for himself and exercised his own will\r\nand judgment rises above the level and shakes off the yoke; to obtain\r\nconsideration, to be intelligent and honorable, to belong to the\r\nélite, is to be anti-revolutionary. In the popular club of\r\nBourg-en-Bresse,[41150] Representative Javogues declared that,\r\n\r\n\"the Republic could be established only on the corpse of the last of the\r\nrespectable men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. The Governors and the Governed.\r\n\r\n     Prisoners in the rue de Sévres and the \"Croix-Rouge\"\r\n     revolutionary committee.--The young Dauphin and Simon his\r\n     preceptor.--Judges, and those under their jurisdiction.\r\n     --Trenchard and Coffinhal, Lavoisier and André Chénier.\r\n\r\nHere we have, on one side, the élite of France, almost every person\r\nof rank, fortune, family, and merit, those eminent for intelligence,\r\nculture, talent and virtue, all deprived of common rights, in exile, in\r\nprison, under pikes, and on the scaffold. On the other side, those above\r\ncommon law, possessing every office and omnipotent in the irresponsible\r\ndictatorship, in the despotic proconsulships, in the sovereignty\r\nof justice, a horde of the outcasts of all classes, the parvenus of\r\nfanaticism, charlatanism, imbecility and crime. Often, when these\r\npersonalities meet, one sees the contrast between the governed and the\r\ngovernors in such strong relief that one almost regards it as calculated\r\nand arranged beforehand; the colors and brush of the painter, rather\r\nthan words, are necessary to represent it. In the western section of\r\nParis, in the prisons of the rue de Sévres[41151] the prisoners consist\r\nof the most distinguished personages of the Quartier Saint Germain,\r\nprelates, officers, grand-seigniors, and noble ladies,--Monseigneur\r\nde Clermont-Tonnerre, Monseigneur de Crussol d'Amboise, Monseigneur de\r\nHersaint, Monseigneur de Saint Simon, bishop of Agde, the Comtesse de\r\nNarbonne-Pelet, the Duchesse de Choiseul, the Princesse de Chimay, the\r\nComtesse de Raymond-Narbonne and her daughter, two years of age, in\r\nshort, the flower of that refined society which Europe admired and\r\nimitated and which, in its exquisite perfection, equalled or surpassed\r\nall that Greece, Rome and Italy had produced in brilliancy, polish and\r\namiability. Contrast with these the arbiters of their lives and deaths,\r\nthe potentates of the same quarter who issue the warrants of arrest\r\nagainst them, who pen them in to speculate on them, and who revel at\r\ntheir expense and before their eyes: these consist of the members of\r\nthe revolutionary committee of the Croix-Rouge, the eighteen convicted\r\nrogues and debauchees previously described,[41152] ex-cab-drivers,\r\nporters, cobblers, street-messengers, stevedores, bankrupts,\r\ncounterfeiters, former or future jail-birds, all clients of the police\r\nor alms-house riff-raff.--At the other end of Paris, in the east, in the\r\ntower of the Temple, separated from his sister and torn from his mother,\r\nstill lives the little Dauphin: no one in France merits more pity or\r\nrespect than him. For, if France exists, it is owing to the thirty-five\r\nmilitary chiefs and crowned kings of which he is the last direct scion;\r\nwithout their thousand years of hereditary rule and preserving policy\r\nthe intruders into the Tuileries who have just profaned their tombs at\r\nSt. Denis and thrown their bones into a common ditch,[41153] would not\r\nbe Frenchmen. At this moment, were suffrages free, the immense majority\r\nof the people, nineteen Frenchmen out of twenty, would recognize this\r\ninnocent and precious child for their King, the heir of the people of\r\nwhich their nation and country is formed, a child of eight years, of\r\nrare precociousness, as intelligent as he is good, and of a gentle and\r\nwinning expression. Look at the other figure alongside of him, his fist\r\nraised and with insults on his lips, with a hang-dog face, bloated with\r\nbrandy, titular governor, official preceptor, and absolute master of\r\nthis child, the cobbler Simon, malignant, foul-mouthed, mean in every\r\nway, forcing him to become intoxicated, starving him, preventing him\r\nfrom sleeping, thrashing him, and who, obeying orders, instinctively\r\nvisits on him all his brutality and corruption that he may pervert,\r\ndegrade and deprave him.[41154]--In the Palais de Justice, midway\r\nbetween the tower of the Temple and the prison in the rue de Sèvres,\r\nan almost similar contrast, transposing the merits and demerits, daily\r\nbrings together in opposition the innocent with the vile. There are days\r\nwhen the contrast, still more striking, seats criminals on the judges'\r\nbench and judges on the bench of criminals. On the first and second\r\nof Floréal, the old representatives and trustees of liberty under the\r\nmonarchy, twenty-five magistrates of the Paris and Toulouse parliaments,\r\nmany of them being eminent intellects of the highest culture and\r\nnoblest character, embracing the greatest historical names of the French\r\nmagistracy,--Etienne Pasquier, Lefèvre d'Ormesson, Molé de Champlatreux,\r\nDe Lamoignon, de Malesherbes,--are sent to the guillotine[41155] by the\r\njudges and juries familiar to us, assassins or brutes who do not take\r\nthe trouble, or who have not the capacity, to give proper color to their\r\nsentences. M. de Malesherbes exclaims, after reading his indictment, \"If\r\nthat were only common-sense!\"--In effect those who pronounce judgment\r\nare, by their own admission, \"substantial jurymen, good sans-culottes,\r\nnatural people.\" And such a nature! One of these, Trenchard, an\r\nAuvergnat carpenter, portrays himself accurately in the following note\r\naddressed to his wife before the trial comes on:\r\n\r\n\"If you are not alone, and the companion can work, you may come, my\r\ndear, and see the twenty-four gentlemen condemned, all of them former\r\npresidents or councillors in the parliaments of Toulouse and Paris. I\r\nrecommend you to bring something along with you (to eat), it will\r\nbe three hours before we finish. I embrace you, my dear friend and\r\nwife.\"[41156]\r\n\r\nIn the same court, Lavoisier, the founder and organizer of chemistry,\r\nthe great discoverer, and condemned to death, asks for a reprieve of his\r\nsentence for a fortnight to complete an experiment, and the president,\r\nCoffinhal, another Auvergnat, replies,\r\n\r\n\"The Republic has no need of savants.\"[41157]\r\n\r\nAnd it has no need of poets. The first poet of the epoch, André\r\nChénier, the delicate and superior artist who reopens antique sources\r\nof inspiration and starts the modern current, is guillotined; we possess\r\nthe original manuscript indictment of his examination, a veritable\r\nmaster-piece of gibberish and barbarism, of which a full copy\r\nis necessary to convey an idea of its \"turpitudes of sense and\r\northography.\"[41158] The reader may there see, if he pleases, a man\r\nof genius delivered up to brutes, coarse, angry, despotic animals, who\r\nlisten to nothing, who comprehend nothing, who do not even understand\r\nterms in common use, who stumble through their queries, and who, to ape\r\nintelligence, draggle their pens along in supreme stupidity.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow is complete. France, subject to the Revolutionary\r\nGovernment, resembles a human being forced to walk with his head down\r\nand to think with his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4101: Cf. \"The Revolution,\" book I., ch. 3, and book III.,\r\nchs. 9 and 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4102: Grégoire, \"Memoires,\" II., 172. \"About eighteen thousand\r\necclesiastics are enumerated among the émigrés of the first epoch.

I happen to have known the details of two or\r\nthree small provincial towns, one of about six thousand inhabitants\r\nwhere, before 1800, nearly all the notables, forty families, were\r\nrelations; to-day all are scattered. The more one studies documents, the\r\nmore does Montesquieu's definition of the incentive of society under\r\nthe ancient régime seem profound and just, this incentive consisting of\r\nhonor. In the bourgeoisie who were confounded with the nobility, namely\r\nthe Parliamentarians, their functions were nearly gratuitous; the\r\nmagistrate received his pay in deference. (Moniteur, V., 520. Session\r\nof August 30, 1790, speech by d'Espremenil.) \"Here is what it cost a\r\nCouncillor; I take myself as an example. He paid fifty thousand livres\r\nfor his place, and ten thousand more for the tax of the 'marc d'or.'\r\nHe received three hundred and eighty-nine livres ten sous salary,\r\nfrom which three hundred and sixty-seven livres 'capitation' had to be\r\ndeducted. The King allowed us forty-five livres for extra service of 'La\r\nTournelle'. How about the fees? is asked. The (grande chambre) superior\r\ncourt, asserted to have received the largest amount, was composed of one\r\nhundred and eighty members; the fees amounted to two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand livres, which were not a burden on the nation, but on the\r\nlitigants. M. Thouret, who practiced in the Rouen parliament, will\r\nbear witness to this. I appeal to him to say conscientiously what sum\r\na Councillor derived from his office--not five hundred livres... When\r\na judgment cost the litigant nine hundred livres the King's portion was\r\nsix hundred livres... To sum up, the profits of an office were seven\r\nlivres ten sous.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4181: Albert Babeau, \"La Ville,\" ch. II., and \"Histoire de\r\nTroyes,\" I., ch. 1. At Troyes, fifty merchants, notables, elected the\r\njudge-consul and two consuls; the merchants' guild possessed its own\r\nhall and had its own meetings. At Paris, the drapers, mercers, grocers,\r\nfurriers, hatters and jewelers formed the six bodies of merchants.\r\nThe merchants' guild everywhere took precedence of other industrial\r\ncommunities and enjoyed special privileges. \"The merchants,\" says\r\nLoyseau, \"hold rank (qualité d'honneur), being styled honorable men,\r\nhonest persons and bourgeois of the towns, qualifications not attributed\r\nto husbandmen, nor to sergeants, nor to artisans, nor to manual\r\nlaborers.\"--On paternal authority and domestic discipline in these old\r\nbourgeois families see the History of Beaumarchais and his father.

The edicts of 1776 reduced them to forty-four at\r\nParis, and to twenty as the maximum for the principal towns within the\r\njurisdiction of the Paris parliament.--\"Each guild formed a city within\r\na city... Like the communes, it had its special laws, its selected\r\nchiefs, its assemblies, its own building or, at least, a chamber in\r\ncommon, its banner, coat-of-arms and colors.\"--Ibid., \"Histoire\r\nde Troyes Pendant la Revolution,\" I., 13, 329.

FOOD AND PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Economical Complexity of Food Chain.\r\n\r\n     Complexity of the economical operation by which articles of\r\n     prime necessity reach the consumer.--Conditions of the\r\n     operation.--Available resources.--Cases in which these are\r\n     not available.--Case of the holder of these being no longer\r\n     disposed to make them.\r\n\r\nSuppose a man forced to walk with his feet in the air and his head\r\ndownward. By using extremely energetic measures he might, for a while,\r\nbe made to maintain this unwholesome attitude, and certainly at the\r\nexpense of a bruised or broken skull; it is very probable, moreover,\r\nthat he would use his feet convulsively and kick terribly. But it is\r\ncertain that if this course were persisted in, the man would experience\r\nintolerable pain and finally sink down; the blood would stop circulating\r\nand suffocation would ensue; the trunk and limbs would suffer as much\r\nas the head, and the feet would become numb and inert.--Such is more\r\nor less the history of France under its Jacobin pedagogues; their rigid\r\ntheory and persistent brutality impose on the nation an attitude against\r\nnature; consequently she suffers, and each day suffers more and more;\r\nthe paralysis increases; the functions get out of order and cease to\r\nact, while the last and principal one,[4201] the most urgent, namely,\r\nphysical support and the daily nourishment of the living individual,\r\nis so badly accomplished, against so many obstacles, interruptions,\r\nuncertainties and deficiencies, that the patient, reduced to extreme\r\nwant, asks if to-morrow will not be worse than to-day, and whether his\r\nsemi-starvation will not end in complete starvation.\r\n\r\nNothing, apparently, is simpler, and yet really more complex, than\r\nthe physiological process by which, in the organized body, the proper\r\nrestorative food flows regularly to the spot where it is needed, among\r\nthe innumerably diverse and distant cells. In like manner, nothing is\r\nsimpler at the first glance, and yet more complex, than the economical\r\nprocess by which, in the social organism, provisions and other articles\r\nof prime necessity, flow of themselves to all points of the territory\r\nwhere they are needed and within reach of each consumer. It is owing to\r\nthis that, in the social body as in the organized body, the terminal act\r\npresupposes many others anterior to and co-ordinate with it, a series\r\nof elaborations, a succession of metamorphoses, one elimination and\r\ntransportation after another, mostly invisible and obscure, but all\r\nindispensable, and all of them carried out by infinitely delicate\r\norgans, so delicate that, under the slightest pressure, they get out\r\nof order, so dependent on each other that an injury to one affects the\r\noperations of the rest, and thus suppresses or perverts the final result\r\nto which, nearly or remotely, they all contribute.\r\n\r\nConsider, for a moment, these precious economical organs and their mode\r\nof operation. In any tolerably civilized community that has lasted for\r\nany length of time, they consist, first in rank, of those who possess\r\nwealth arising from the accumulation of old and recent savings, that\r\nis to say, those who possess any sort of security, large or small,\r\nin money, in notes, or in kind, whatever its form, whether in lands,\r\nbuildings or factories, in canals, shipping or machinery, in cattle or\r\ntools, as well as in every species of merchandise or produce.--And see\r\nwhat use they make of these: each person, reserving what he needs for\r\ndaily consumption, devotes his available surplus to some enterprise,\r\nthe capitalist his ready money, the real-estate owner his land and\r\ntenements, the farmer his cattle, seed and farming implements, the\r\nmanufacturer his mills and raw material, the common-carrier his vessels,\r\nvehicles and horses, the trader his warehouses and stock of goods for\r\nthe year, and the retailer his shop and supplies for a fortnight.\r\nTo which everybody, the agriculturist, merchant and manufacturer,\r\nnecessarily adds his cash on hand, the deposits in his bank for paying\r\nthe monthly salaries of his clerks, and at the end of the week, the\r\nwages of his workmen.--Otherwise, it would be impossible to till the\r\nsoil, to build, to fabricate, to transport, to sell; however useful\r\nthe work might be, it could not be perfected, or even begun, without a\r\npreliminary outlay in money or in kind. In every enterprise, the crop\r\npresupposes labor and seed corn. If I want to dig a hole I am obliged\r\nto hire a pick and the arms to wield it, or, in other terms, to make\r\ncertain advances. But these advances are made only on two conditions:\r\nfirst, that he who makes them is able to make them, that is to say, that\r\nhe is the possessor of an available surplus; and next, being the owner\r\nof this surplus, that he desires to make them, with this proviso that\r\nhe may gain instead of losing by the operation.--If I am wholly or\r\npartially ruined, if my tenants and farmers do not pay their rent,[4202]\r\nif my lands or goods do not bring half their value in the market, if\r\nthe net proceeds of my possessions are threatened with confiscation or\r\npillage, not only have I fewer securities to dispose of, but, again,\r\nI become more and more uneasy about the future; over and above my\r\nimmediate consumption I have to provide for a prospective consumption; I\r\nadd to my reserve stores especially of coin and provisions; I hold on to\r\nthe remnant of my securities for myself and those who belong to me; they\r\nare no longer available and I can no longer make loans or enter upon my\r\nenterprise. And, on the other hand, if the loan or enterprise, instead\r\nof bringing me a profit, brings me loss; if the law is powerless or\r\nfails to do me justice and adds extra to ordinary risks; if my work once\r\nperfected is to become the prey of the government, of brigands or of\r\nwhoever pleases to seize it; if I am compelled to surrender my wares and\r\nmerchandise at one-half their cost; if I cannot produce, put in store,\r\ntransport or sell except by renouncing all profit and with the certainty\r\nof not getting back my advances, I will no longer make loans or enter\r\nupon any under-taking whatever.\r\n\r\nSuch is the disposition and situation of people able to make advances\r\nin anarchical times, when the State falters and no longer performs its\r\ncustomary service, when property is no longer adequately protected\r\nby the public force, when jacqueries overspread the country and\r\ninsurrections break out in the towns, when chateaux are sacked, archives\r\nburnt, shops broken into, provisions carried off and transportation is\r\nbrought to a halt, when rents and leases are no longer paid, when the\r\ncourts dare no longer convict, when the constable no longer dares serve\r\na warrant, when the gendarmerie holds back, when the police fails to\r\nact, when repeated amnesties shield robbers and incendiaries, when\r\na revolution brings into local and central power dishonest and\r\nimpoverished adventurers hostile to every one that possesses property\r\nof any kind.--Such is the disposition and situation of all who are in\r\npossession of the means to initiate projects in socialistic times\r\n\r\n* when the usurping State, instead of protecting private property,\r\ndestroys or seizes it;\r\n\r\n* when it takes for itself the property of many of the great\r\ncorporations;\r\n\r\n* when it suppresses legally established credits without indemnity;\r\n\r\n* when, by dint of expenditure and the burdens this creates, it becomes\r\ninsolvent;\r\n\r\n* when, through its paper-money and forced circulation, it annuls\r\nindebtedness in the hands of the creditor, and allows the debtor to go\r\nscot-free;\r\n\r\n* when it arbitrarily seizes current capital;\r\n\r\n* when it makes forced loans and requisitions;\r\n\r\n* when its tax on productions surpasses the cost of production and on\r\nmerchandise the profit on its sale;\r\n\r\n* when it constrains the manufacturer to manufacture at a loss and the\r\nmerchant to sell at a loss;\r\n\r\n* when its principles, judged by its acts, indicate a progression from\r\npartial to a universal confiscation.--\r\n\r\nIneluctably every phase of disease engenders the evil which follows:\r\nit is like a poison the effects of which spread or pass onwards. Each\r\nfunction, affected by the derangement of the adjacent one, becoming\r\ndisturbed in its turn. The perils, mutilation and suppression of\r\nproperty diminish available securities as well as the courage that risks\r\nthem, that is to say, the mode of, and disposition to, make advances.\r\nThrough a lack of funds, useful enterprises languish, die out or are\r\nnot undertaken. Consequently, the production, supply, and sale of\r\nindispensable articles slacken, become interrupted and cease altogether.\r\nThere is less soap and sugar and fewer candles at the grocery, less wood\r\nand coal in the wood-yard, fewer oxen and sheep in the markets, less\r\nmeat at the butcher's, less grain and flour at the corn-exchange, and\r\nless bread at the bakeries. As articles of prime necessity are scarce\r\nthey become dear; as people contend for them their dearness increases;\r\nthe rich man ruins himself in the struggle to get hold of them,\r\nwhile the poor man never gets any, and the bare necessities become\r\nunattainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Conditions in 1793. A Lesson in Market Economics.\r\n\r\n     Economical effect of the Jacobin policy from 1789 to 1793.\r\n     --Attacks on property.--Direct attacks.--Jacqueries, effective\r\n     confiscations and proclamation of the socialist creed.\r\n     --Indirect attacks.--Bad administration of the public funds.\r\n     --Transformation of taxation and insignificance of the\r\n     returns.--Increased expenditures.--The War-budget and\r\n     subsistence after 1793.--Paper money.--Enormous issues of\r\n     it.--Credit of the Assignats run down.--Ruin of Public\r\n     creditors and of all private credit.--Rate of interest\r\n     during the Revolution.--Stoppage of trade and industry.--Bad\r\n     management of new land-owners.--Decrease of productive\r\n     labor.--Only the small rural land-owner works\r\n     advantageously.--Why he refuses Assignats.--He is no longer\r\n     obliged to sell his produce at once.--High cost of food.--It\r\n     reaches a market with difficulty and in small quantities.\r\n     --The towns buy at a high price and sell at a low one.--Food\r\n     becomes dearer and famine begins.--Prices during the first\r\n     six months of 1793.\r\n\r\nSuch is the hardship in France at the moment when the Jacobin conquest\r\nhas been completed, a misery of which the Jacobins are the cause due to\r\nthe systematic war they have waged against property during the preceding\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nFrom below, they have provoked, excused, amnestied, or tolerated\r\nand authorized all the popular attacks on property,[4203] countless\r\ninsurrections, seven successive jacqueries, some of them so extensive\r\nas to cover eight or ten departments at the same time. The last one let\r\nloose on all France a universal and lasting brigandage, the arbitrary\r\nrule of paupers, vagabonds and ruffians; every species of robbery,\r\nfrom a refusal to pay rents and leases to the sacking of chateaux and\r\nordinary domiciles, even to the pillage of markets and granaries. Free\r\nscope was given to mobs which, under a political pretext, tax and ransom\r\nthe \"suspects\" of all classes at pleasure, not alone the noble and the\r\nrich but the peaceable farmer and well-to-do artisan. In short, the\r\ncountry reverted back to a natural state, the sovereignty of appetites,\r\ngreed and lust, to mankind's return to a savage, primitive life in\r\nthe forests. Only a short time before, in the month of February, 1793,\r\nthrough Marat's recommendation, and with the connivance of the Jacobin\r\nmunicipality, the Paris riff-raff had broken into twelve hundred\r\ngroceries and divided on the spot, either gratis or at the price it\r\nfixed, sugar, soap, brandy and coffee.\r\n\r\nFrom above, they had undertaken, carried out and multiplied the worst\r\nassaults on property, vast spoliations of every sort; the suppression\r\nof hundreds of millions of incomes and the confiscation of billions of\r\ncapital; the abolition without indemnity of tithes and quitrents; the\r\nexpropriation of the property of the clergy, of emigrés, that of\r\nthe order of Malta, that of the pious, charitable and educational\r\nassociations and endowments, even laic; seizures of plate, of the sacred\r\nvessels and precious ornaments of the churches. And, because they have\r\nthe power, others still more vast. After August 10, their newspapers in\r\nParis and their commissioners in the departments,[4204] have preached\r\n\r\n\"the agrarian law, the holding of all property in common, the leveling\r\nof fortunes, the right of each fraction of the sovereign people\" to help\r\nitself by force to all food and stores at the expense of the owner,\r\nto hunt down the rich, proscribe \"land-owners, leading merchants,\r\nfinanciers and all men in possession of whatever is superfluous.\"\r\n\r\nRousseau's dogma that \"the fruit belongs to everybody and the soil to\r\nno one\" is established at an early date as a maxim of State in the\r\nConvention, while in the deliberations of the sovereign assembly\r\nsocialism, openly avowed, becomes ascendant, and, afterwards, supreme.\r\nAccording to Robespierre,[4205]\r\n\r\n\"whatever is essential to preserve life is common property to society\r\nat large. It is only the excess which may be given up to individuals and\r\nsurrendered to commercial enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nWith still greater solemnity, the pontiff of the sect, in the\r\nDeclaration of Rights which, unanimously adopted by the all-powerful\r\nJacobin club, is to serve as the corner-stone of the new institutions,\r\npens the following formula heavy with their consequences:[4206]\r\n\r\n\"Society must provide for the support of all its members. The aid\r\nrequired by indigence is a debt of the rich to the poor. The right of\r\nproperty is limited, and applies only to that portion which the law\r\nguarantees. Every ownership, any trade, which bears prejudicially on the\r\nexistence of our fellow-creatures is necessarily illicit and immoral.\"\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this is more than clear: the Jacobin populace, having\r\ndecided that the possession of, and trade in, groceries was prejudicial\r\nto its existence, the grocers' monopoly is, therefore, immoral and\r\nillicit, and consequently, it pillages their shops. Under the rule of\r\nthe populace and of the \"Mountain,\" the Convention applies the theory,\r\nseizes capital wherever it can be found, and notifies the poor, in its\r\nname,\r\n\r\n\"that they will find in the pocket-books of the rich whatever they need\r\nto supply their wants.\"[4207]\r\n\r\nOver and above these striking and direct attacks, an indirect and hidden\r\nattack, even more significant, which slowly undermines the basis of all\r\npresent and future property. State affairs are everybody's affairs, and,\r\nwhen the State ruins itself, everybody is ruined along with it. For, it\r\nis the country's greatest debtor and its greatest creditor, while there\r\nis no debtor so free of seizure and no creditor so absorbing, since,\r\nmaking the laws and possessing the force, it can, firstly, repudiate\r\nindebtedness and send away the fund-holder with empty hands, and next,\r\nincrease taxation and empty the taxpayer's pocket of his last\r\npenny. There is no greater menace to private fortunes than the bad\r\nadministration of the public fortune. Now, under the pressure of Jacobin\r\nprinciples and of the Jacobin faction, the trustees of France have\r\nadministered the country as if they purposely meant to ruin their ward;\r\nevery known means for wasting a fortune have been brought into play by\r\nthem.--In the first place, they have deprived him of three-fourths of\r\nhis income. To please the people and enforce the theory, the taxes on\r\narticles consumed, on salt, with the excise subsidies and the octroi\r\nduties on liquors, meat, tobacco, leather and gunpowder, have been\r\nabolished, while the new imposts substituted for the old ones, slowly\r\nfixed, badly apportioned and raised with difficulty have brought in no\r\nreturns. On the 1st of February, 1793,[4208] the Treasury had received\r\non the real and personal taxation of 1791, but one hundred and fifty\r\nmillions instead of three hundred millions. On the same taxes for 1792,\r\ninstead of three hundred millions it had obtained nothing at all.\r\nAt this date, and during the four years of the Revolution, the total\r\narrears of taxation amounted to six hundred and thirty-two millions--a\r\nbad debt that can hardly be recovered, and, in fact, it is already\r\nreduced one-half, since, even if the debtor could and was disposed to\r\npay, he would pay in assignats, which, at this time, were at a discount\r\nof fifty per cent.--In the second place, the new managers had quadrupled\r\nthe public expenditure.[4209] What with the equipment and excursions of\r\nthe National Guards federations, patriotic festivals and parades,\r\nthe writing, printing and publication of innumerable documents,\r\nreimbursements for suppressed offices, the installation of new\r\nadministrations, aid to the indigent and to its charity workshops,\r\npurchases of grain, indemnities to millers and bakers, it was under\r\nthe necessity of providing for the cost of the universal demolition\r\nand reconstruction. Now, the State had, for the most part, defrayed all\r\nthese expenses. At the end of April, 1793, it had already advanced to\r\nthe city of Paris alone, one hundred and ten million francs, while the\r\nCommune, insolvent, kept constantly extorting fresh millions.[4210] By\r\nthe side of this gulf, the Jacobins had dug another, larger still, that\r\nof the war. For the first half of the year 1793 they threw into this\r\npit first, one hundred and forty millions, then one hundred and sixty\r\nmillions, and then one hundred and ninety million francs; in the second\r\nsix months of 1793 the war and provisions swallowed up three hundred\r\nmillion francs per month, and the more they threw into the two gulfs the\r\ndeeper they became.[4211]\r\n\r\nNaturally, when there is no collecting a revenue and expenses go on\r\nincreasing, one is obliged to borrow on one's resources, and piecemeal,\r\nas long as these last. Naturally, when ready money is not to be had on\r\nthe market, one draws notes and tries to put them in circulation; one\r\npays tradesmen with written promises in the future, and thus exhausts\r\none's credit. Such is paper money and the assignats, the third and most\r\nefficient way for wasting a fortune and which the Jacobins did not fail\r\nto make the most of.--Under the Constituent Assembly, through a remnant\r\nof good sense and good faith, efforts were at first made to guarantee\r\nthe fulfillment of written promises the holders of assignats were almost\r\nsecured by a first mortgage on the national possessions, which had been\r\ngiven to them coupled with an engagement not to raise more money on this\r\nguarantee, as well as not to issue any more assignats.[4212] But they\r\ndid not keep faith. They rendered the security afforded by this mortgage\r\ninoperative and, as all chances of re-payment disappeared, its value\r\ndeclined. Then, on the 27th of April, 1792, according to the report\r\nof Cambon, there begins an unlimited issue; according to the Jacobin\r\nfinanciers, nothing more is necessary to provide for the war than to\r\nturn the wheel and grind out promises to pay: in June, 1793, assignats\r\nto the amount of four billion three hundred and twenty millions have\r\nalready been manufactured, and everybody sees that the mill must grind\r\nfaster. This is why the guarantee, vainly increased, no longer suffices\r\nfor the monstrous, disproportionate mortgage; it exceeds all limits,\r\ncovers nothing, and sinks through its own weight. At Paris, the assignat\r\nof one hundred francs is worth in specie, in the month of June, 1791,\r\neighty-five francs, in January, 1792, only sixty-six francs, in March,\r\n1792, only fifty. three francs; rising in value at the end of the\r\nLegislative Assembly, owing to fresh confiscations, it falls back to\r\nfifty-five francs in January, 1793, to forty-seven francs in April, to\r\nforty francs in June, to thirty-three francs in July.[4213]--Thus\r\nare the creditors of the State defrauded of a third, one-half, and\r\ntwo-thirds of their investment, and not alone the creditors of the State\r\nbut every other creditor, since every debtor has the right to discharge\r\nhis obligations by paying his debts in assignats. Enumerate, if\r\npossible, all who are defrauded of private claims, all money-lenders\r\nand stockholders who have invested in any private enterprise, either\r\nmanufacturing or mercantile, those who have loaned money on Contracts of\r\nlonger or shorter date, all sellers of real estate, with stipulations\r\nin their deeds for more or less remote payment, all landowners who have\r\nleased their grounds or buildings for a term of years, all holders of\r\nannuities on private bond or on an estate, all manufacturers, merchants\r\nand farmers who have sold their wares, goods and produce on time, all\r\nclerks on yearly salaries and even all other employees, underlings,\r\nservants and workmen receiving fixed salaries for a specified term.\r\nThere is not one of these persons whose capital, or income payable in\r\nassignats, is not at once crippled in proportion to the decline in\r\nvalue of assignats, so that not only the State falls into bankruptcy\r\nbut likewise every creditor in France, legally bankrupt along with it\r\nthrough its fault.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation how can any enterprise be commenced or maintained?\r\nWho dares take a risk, especially when disbursements are large and\r\nreturns remote? Who dares lend on long credits--? If loans are still\r\nmade they are not for a year but for a month, while the interest which,\r\nbefore the Revolution was six, five or even four per cent. per annum, is\r\nnow two per cent. a month on securities.\" It soon runs up higher and,\r\nat Paris and Strasbourg we see it rising, as in India and the Barbary\r\nStates, to four, five, six and even seven per cent. a month.[4214]\r\n\r\nWhat holder of raw material, or of manufactured goods, would dare make\r\nentries on his books as usual and allow his customer the indispensable\r\ncredit of three months? What large manufacturer would presume to make\r\ngoods up, what wholesale merchant would care to make shipments, what man\r\nof wealth or with a competence would build, drain and construct dams\r\nand dykes, repair, or even maintain them with the positive certainty of\r\ndelays in getting back only one-half his outlays and with the increasing\r\ncertainty of getting nothing?\r\n\r\nDuring a few years the large establishments collapsed in droves:\r\n\r\n* After the ruin of the nobles and the departure of wealthy foreigners,\r\nevery craft dependent on luxurious tastes, those of Paris and Lyons,\r\nwhich were the standard for Europe, all the manufactories of rich\r\nfabrics and furniture, and other artistic, elegant and fashionable\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n* After the insurrection of the blacks in St. Domingo, and other\r\ntroubles in the West Indies, the great colonial trade and remarkable\r\nprosperity of Nantes and Bordeaux, including all the industrial\r\nenterprises by which the production, transportation and circulation of\r\ncotton, sugar and coffee were affected;[4215]\r\n\r\n* After the declaration of war with England, the shipping interest;\r\n\r\n* After the declaration of war with all Europe, the commerce of the\r\ncontinent.[4216]\r\n\r\nFailure after failure, an universal crash, utter cessation of\r\nextensively organized and productive labor: instead of productive\r\nindustries, I see none now but destructive industries, those of the\r\nagricultural and commercial vermin, those of dealers in junk and\r\nspeculators who dismantle mansions and abbeys, and who demolish chateaux\r\nand churches so as to sell the materials as cheap as dirt, who bargain\r\naway national possessions, so as to make a profit on the transaction.\r\nImagine the mischief a temporary owner, steeped in debt, needy and urged\r\non by the maturity of his engagements, can and must do to an estate held\r\nunder a precarious title and of suspicious acquirement, which he has no\r\nidea of keeping, and from which, meanwhile, he derives every possible\r\nbenefit:[4217] not only does he put no spokes in the mill-wheel,\r\nno stones in the dyke, no tiles on the roof, but he buys no manure,\r\nexhausts the soil, devastates the forest, alienates the fields, and\r\ndismembers the entire farm, damaging the ground and the stock of tools\r\nand injuring the dwelling by selling its mirrors, lead and iron, and\r\noftentimes the window-shutters and doors. He turns all into cash, no\r\nmatter how, at the expense of the domain, which he leaves in a run-down\r\ncondition, unfurnished and for a long time unproductive. In like manner,\r\nthe communal possessions, ravaged, pillaged and then pieced out\r\nand divided off, are so many organisms which are sacrificed for the\r\nimmediate relief of the village poor, but of course to the detriment of\r\ntheir future productiveness and an abundant yield.[4218]\r\n\r\nAlone, amongst these millions of men who have stopped working, or work\r\nthe wrong way, the petty cultivator labors to advantage; free of taxes,\r\nof tithes and of feudal imposts, possessing a scrap of ground which he\r\nhas obtained for almost nothing or without stretching his purse strings,\r\nhe works in good spirits.[4219] He is sure that henceforth his crop will\r\nno longer be eaten up by the levies of the seignior, of the décimateur\r\nand of the King, that it will belong to him, that it will be wholly his,\r\nand that the worse the famine in the towns, the dearer he will sell his\r\nproduce. Hence, he has ploughed more vigorously than ever; he has even\r\ncleared waste ground; getting the soil gratis, or nearly so, and\r\nhaving to make but few advances, having no other use for his advances,\r\nconsisting of seed, manure, the work of his cattle and of his own\r\nhands, he has planted, reaped and raised grain with the greatest energy.\r\nPerhaps other articles of consumption will be scarce; it may be that,\r\nowing to the ruin of other branches of industry, it will be hard to get\r\ndry-goods, shoes, sugar, soap, oil, candles, wine and brandy; it\r\nmay happen that, owing to the bungling way in which agricultural\r\ntransformations have been effected, all produce of the secondary order,\r\nmeat, vegetables, butter and eggs, may become scarce. In any event,\r\nFrench foodstuffs par excellence is on hand, standing in the field or\r\nstored in sheaves in the barns; in 1792 and 1793, and even in 1794,\r\nthere is enough grain in France to provide every French inhabitant with\r\nhis daily bread.[4220]\r\n\r\nBut that is not enough. In order that each Frenchman may obtain his bit\r\nof bread every day, it is still essential that grain should reach the\r\nmarkets in sufficient quantities, and that the bakers should every day\r\nhave enough flour to make all the bread that is required; moreover, the\r\nbread offered for sale in the bakeries should not exceed the price which\r\nthe majority of consumers can afford to pay. Now, in fact, through\r\na forced result of the new system, neither of these conditions is\r\nfulfilled.--In the first place, wheat, and hence bread, is too dear.\r\nEven at the old rate, these would still be too dear for the innumerable\r\nempty or half-empty purses, after so many attacks on property, industry\r\nand trade, now that so many hundreds of workmen and employees are out of\r\nwork, now that so many land-owners and bourgeois receive no rents, now\r\nthat incomes, profits, wages and salaries have diminished by hundreds of\r\nthousands. But wheat, and, consequently, bread, has not remained at\r\nold rates. Formerly a sack of wheat in Paris was worth 50 francs. In\r\nFebruary, 1793, it is worth sixty-five francs; in May, 1793, one hundred\r\nfrancs and then one hundred and fifty; and hence bread, in Paris, early\r\nin 1793, instead of being three sous the pound, costs six sous, in many\r\nof the southern departments seven and eight sous, and in other places\r\nten and twelve sous.[4221] The reason is, that, since August 10, 1792,\r\nafter the King's fall and the wrenching away of the ancient keystone of\r\nthe arch which still kept the loosened stones of the social edifice in\r\nplace, the frightened peasant would no longer part with his produce; he\r\ndetermined not to take assignats, not to let his grain go for anything\r\nbut ringing coin. To exchange good wheat for bad, dirty paper rags\r\nseemed to him a trick, and justly so, for, on going to town every month\r\nhe found that the dealers gave him less merchandise for these rags.\r\nBeing distrustful and a hoarder, he must have good, old fashioned\r\ncrowns, with the ancient effigy, so as to lay them away in a jar or old\r\nwoollen stocking; give him specie or he will keep his grain. For he is\r\nnot, as formerly, obliged to part with it as soon as it is cut, to pay\r\ntaxes and rent; the bailiff and sheriff are no longer there to constrain\r\nhim; in these times of disorder and demagoguism, under impotent or\r\npartial authorities, neither the public nor the private creditor has\r\nthe power to compel payment, while the spurs which formerly impelled the\r\nfarmer to seek the nearest market are blunted or broken. He therefore\r\nstays away, and he has excellent reasons for so doing. Vagabonds and the\r\nneedy stand by the roadside and at the entrances of the towns to stop\r\nand pillage the loaded carts; in the markets and on the open square,\r\nwomen cut open bags of grain with their scissors and empty them, or the\r\nmunicipality, forced to do it by the crowd, fixes the price at a reduced\r\nrate.[4222]--The larger a town, the greater the difficulty in supplying\r\nits market; for its provisions are drawn from a distance; each\r\ndepartment, each canton, each village keeps its own grain for itself\r\nby means of legal requisitions or by brutal force; it is impossible\r\nfor wholesale dealers in grain to make bargains; they are styled\r\nmonopolists, and the mob, breaking into their storehouses, hangs them\r\nout of preference.[4223] As the government, accordingly, has proclaimed\r\ntheir speculations \"crimes,\" it is going to interdict their trade and\r\nsubstitute itself for them.[4224]--But this substitution only increases\r\nthe penury still more; in vain do the towns force collections, tax\r\ntheir rich men, raise money on loan, and burden themselves beyond their\r\nresources;[4225] they only make the matter worse. When the municipality\r\nof Paris expends twelve thousand francs a day for the sale of flour at\r\na low price in the markets, it keeps away the flour-dealers, who cannot\r\ndeliver flour at such low figures; the result is that there is not flour\r\nenough in the market for the six hundred thousand mouths in Paris; when\r\nit expends seventy-five thousand francs daily to indemnify the bakers,\r\nit attracts the outside population, which rushes into Paris to get\r\nbread cheap, and for the seven hundred thousand mouths of Paris and the\r\nsuburbs combined, the bakers have not an adequate supply. Whoever comes\r\nlate finds the shop empty; consequently, everybody tries to get there\r\nearlier and earlier, at dawn, before daybreak, and then five or six\r\nhours before daybreak in February, 1793, long lines of people are\r\nalready waiting at the bakers' door, these lines growing longer\r\nand longer in April, while in June they are enormously long.[4226]\r\nNaturally, for lack of bread, people fall back on other aliments, which\r\nalso grow dearer; add to this the various contrivances and effects of\r\nJacobin politics which still further increase the dearness of food of\r\nall sorts, and also of every other necessary article: for instance,\r\nthe extremely bad condition of the roads, which renders transportation\r\nslower and more costly; the prohibition of the export of coin and\r\nhence the obtaining of food from abroad; the decree which obliges each\r\nindustrial or commercial association, at present or to come, to \"pay\r\nannually into the national treasury one-quarter of the amount of its\r\ndividends;\" the revolt in Vendée, which deprives Paris of six hundred\r\noxen a week; the feeding of the armies, which takes one-half of the\r\ncattle brought to the Poissy market; shutting off the sea and\r\nthe continent, which ruins manufacturers and extensive commercial\r\noperations; the insurrections in Bordeaux, Marseilles and the South,\r\nwhich still further raise the price of groceries, sugar, soap, oil,\r\ncandles, wine and brandy.[4227]--Early in 1793, a pound of beef in\r\nFrance is worth on the average, instead of six sous twenty sous; in May,\r\nat Paris, brandy which, six months before, cost thirty-five sous, costs\r\nninety-four sous; in July, a pound of veal, instead of five sous, costs\r\ntwenty-two sous. Sugar, from twenty sous, advances to four francs ten\r\nsous; a candle costs seven sous. France, pushed on by the Jacobins,\r\napproaches the depths of misery, entering the first circle of its\r\nInferno; other circles follow down deeper and deeper, narrower still\r\nand yet more somber; under Jacobin impulsion is she to descend to the\r\nlowest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Privation.\r\n\r\n     First and general cause of privations.--The socialist\r\n     principle of the Revolutionary government.--Measures against\r\n     large as well as small properties.--Expropriation of all\r\n     remaining corporations, enormous issues of paper-money.\r\n     forced rates of its circulation, forced loans, requisitions\r\n     of coin and plate, revolutionary taxes, suppression of\r\n     special organs of labor on a large scale.--New measures\r\n     against small proprietorship.--The Maximum, requisitions for\r\n     food and labor.--Situation of the shop-keeper, cultivator\r\n     and laborer.--Effect of the measures on labor on a small\r\n     scale. Stoppage of sales.\r\n\r\nObviously, if the people is not being fed properly and in places not at\r\nall, it is because one of the central and most important fibers of the\r\neconomical machine has been incapacitated. It is evident that this fiber\r\ncontrols the sentiment by which man holds on to his property, fears\r\nto risk it, refuses to depreciate it, and tries to increase it.[4228]\r\nObviously in the real human being, such as he actually is made up,\r\nthis intense sentiment, tenacious, always stirring and active, is the\r\nmagazine of inward energy which provides for three-fourths, almost the\r\nwhole, of that unremitting effort, that calculating attention, that\r\ndetermined perseverance which leads the individual to undergo privation,\r\nto contrive and to exert himself, to turn to profitable account the\r\nlabor of his hands, brain and capital, and to produce, save and create\r\nfor himself and for others various resources and comforts.\r\n\r\n(It is probable that disinterested motives, pure love for one's\r\nneighbor, for humanity, for country, do not form a hundredth part of the\r\ntotal energy that produces human activity. It must not be forgotten that\r\nthe actions of men are alloyed with motives of a lower order, such as\r\nlove of fame, the desire of self-admiration and of self-approval, fear\r\nof punishment and hope of reward beyond the grave, all of these being\r\ninterested motives, and without which disinterested motives would be\r\ninoperative excepting in two or three souls among ten thousand.[4229])\r\n\r\nThus far, in society as a whole, this sentiment has been only partially\r\ntouched, and the injury has mainly been to the well-to-do or rich\r\nclasses. At first only one-half of its useful energy has been destroyed\r\nsince only those services rendered by the rich and wealthy classes\r\nhave been dispensed with. Little else than the labor of the capitalist,\r\nproprietor or contractor has been suppressed, whose far-reaching,\r\ncombined, comprehensive labor, the rewards of which consist of objects\r\nof luxury and convenience, ensure for society that abundant supplies\r\nare always on hand, through ready and spontaneous distribution of\r\nindispensable commodities. There remains (for the Jacobins) to crush\r\nout what is left of this laborious and nutritive fiber; the remnant\r\nof useful energy has to be destroyed down to its extirpation among the\r\npeople. Here there must be a suppression, as far as possible, of all\r\nmanual, rude labor even on a small scale, and of its rudimentary\r\nfruits; the discouragement of the insignificant shopkeeper, mechanic\r\nand ploughman must be effected; the corner-grocer must be prevented from\r\nselling his sugar and candles, and the cobbler from mending shoes: the\r\nmiller must think of giving up his mill and the wagoner of abandoning\r\nhis cart; the farmer must be convinced that the best thing he can do\r\nis to get rid of his horses, eat his pork himself,[4230] let his oxen\r\nfamish and leave his crops to rot on the ground.--The Jacobins are to do\r\nall this, for it is the inevitable result of the theory that they have\r\nproclaimed and which they apply. According to this theory the stern,\r\nstrong, deep-seated instinct through which the individual stubbornly\r\nholds on to what he has, to what he makes for himself and for those that\r\nbelong to him, is just the unwholesome fiber that must be rooted out\r\nor paralyzed at any cost; its true name is \"egoism, incivism,\" and\r\nits operations consist of outrages on the community, which is the sole\r\nlegitimate proprietor of property and products, and, yet more, of all\r\npersons and services. Body and soul, all belongs to the State, nothing\r\nto individuals, and, if need be, the State has the right to take not\r\nonly lands and capital, but, again, to claim and tax at whatever rate\r\nit pleases all corn and cattle, all vehicles and the animals that draw\r\nthem, all candles and sugar; it has the right to appropriate to itself\r\nand tax at whatever rate it pleases, the labor of shoemaker, tailor,\r\nmiller, wagoner, ploughman, reaper and thrasher. The seizure of men and\r\nthings is universal, and the new sovereigns do their best at it; for, in\r\npractice, necessity urges them on; insurrection thunders at their door;\r\ntheir supporters, all crackbrains with empty stomachs, the poor and the\r\nidle, and the Parisian populace, listen to no reason and blindly insist\r\non things haphazard; they are bound to satisfy their patrons at once, to\r\nissue one on top of the other all the decrees they call for, even when\r\nimpracticable and mischievous to starve the provinces so as to feed\r\nthe city, to starve the former to-morrow so as to feed the latter\r\nto-day.--Subject to the clamors and menaces of the street they dispatch\r\nthings rapidly; they cease to care for the future, the present being all\r\nthat concerns them; they take and take forcibly; they uphold violence by\r\nbrutality, they support robbery with murder; they expropriate persons\r\nby categories and appropriate objects by categories, and after the\r\nrich they despoil the poor.--During fourteen months the revolutionary\r\ngovernment thus keeps both hands at work, one hand completing the\r\nconfiscation of property, large and medium, and the other proceeding to\r\nthe entire abolition of property even on a small scale.\r\n\r\nAgainst large or medium properties it suffices to extend and aggravate\r\nthe decrees already passed.--The spoliation of the last of existing\r\ncorporations must be effected: the government, confiscates the\r\nproperty of hospitals, communes, and all scientific or literary\r\nassociations.[4231]\r\n\r\nTo this we must add the spoliation of State credits and all other\r\ncredits: it issues in fourteen months 5 100 millions of assignats,\r\nat one time and with one decree 1,400 million and another time 2,000\r\nmillions. It thus condemns itself to complete future bankruptcy. It also\r\ncalls in the 1,500 million of assignats bearing the royal stamp (à face\r\nroyale) and thus arbitrarily converts and reduces the public debt on\r\nthe Grand Ledger, which is already, in fact, a partial and declared\r\nbankruptcy. Six months imprisonment for whoever refuses to accept\r\nassignats at par, twenty years in irons if the offence is repeated and\r\nthe guillotine if there is an incivique intention or act, which suffices\r\nfor all other creditors.[4232]\r\n\r\nThe spoliation of individuals, a forced loan of a billion on the rich,\r\nrequisitions for coin against assignats at par, seizures of plate and\r\njewels in private houses, revolutionary taxes so numerous as not only to\r\nexhaust the capital, but likewise the credit, of the person taxed,[4233]\r\nand the resumption by the State of the public domain pledged to private\r\nindividuals for the past three centuries. How many years of labor\r\nare requisite to bring together again so much available capital, to\r\nreconstruct in France and to refill once again those private reservoirs\r\nwhich are to contain the accumulated savings essential for the out-flow\r\nrequired to drive the great wheel of each general enterprise? Take into\r\naccount, moreover, the enterprises which are directly destroyed,\r\nroot and branch, by revolutionary executions, enforced against the\r\nmanufacturers and traders of Lyons, Marseilles and Bordeaux, proscribed\r\nin a mass,[4234] guillotined, imprisoned, or put to flight, their\r\nfactories stopped, their storehouses put under sequestration, with their\r\nstocks of brandy, soap, silk, muslins, leather, paper, serges, cloth,\r\ncanvas, cordage and the rest; the same at Nantes under Carrier, at\r\nStrasbourg under Saint-Just, and everywhere else.[4235]--\"Commerce\r\nis annihilated,\" writes a Swiss merchant,[4236] from Paris, and the\r\ngovernment, one would say, tries systematically to render it impossible.\r\nOn the 27th of June, 1793, the Convention closes the Bourse; on the 15th\r\nof April, 1794, it suppresses \"financial associations\" and \"prohibits\r\nall bankers, merchants and other persons from organizing any\r\nestablishment of the said character under any pretext or title\r\nwhatsoever.\" On the 8th of September, 1793, the Commune places seals\r\n\"in all the counting-houses of bankers, stockbrokers, agents and\r\nsilver-dealers,\"[4237] and locks up their owners; as a favor,\r\nconsidering that they are obliged to pay the drafts drawn on them, they\r\nare let out, but provisionally, and on condition that they remain under\r\narrest at home, \"under the guard of two good citizens,\" at their own\r\nexpense. Such is the case in Paris and in other cities, not alone with\r\nprominent merchants, but likewise with notaries and lawyers, with whom\r\nfunds are on deposit and who manage estates; a sans-culotte with his\r\npike stands in their cabinet whilst they write, and he accompanies them\r\nin the street when they call on their clients. Imagine the state of\r\na notary's office or a counting-room under a system of this sort! The\r\nmaster of it winds up his business as soon as he can, no matter how,\r\nmakes no new engagements and does as little as possible. Still\r\nmore inactive than he, his colleagues, condemned to an indefinite\r\nlistlessness, under lock and key in the common prison, no longer attend\r\nto their business.--There is a general, total paralysis of those natural\r\norgans which, in economic life, produce, elaborate, receive, store,\r\npreserve, exchange and transmit in large quantities; and as an after\r\neffect, embarrass, saturate, or weaken all the lesser subordinate organs\r\nto which the superior ones no longer provide outlets, intermediary\r\nagencies or aliment.\r\n\r\nIt is now the turn of the small enterprises. Whatever their sufferings\r\nmay be they are ordered to carry their work out as in normal times, and\r\nthey will be forced to do this. The Convention, pursuing its accustomed\r\nrigid logical course with its usual shortsightedness, lays on them its\r\nviolent and inept hands; they are trodden down, trampled upon and mauled\r\nfor the purpose of curing them. Farmers are forbidden to sell their\r\nproduce except in the markets, and obliged to bring to these a quota of\r\nso many sacks per week, military raids compelling them to furnish their\r\nquotas.[4238] Shopkeepers are ordered \"to expose for sale, daily and\r\npublicly, all goods and provisions of prime necessity\" that they have\r\non hand, while a maximum price is established, above which no one shall\r\nsell \"bread, flour and grain, vegetables and fruits, wine, vinegar,\r\ncider, beer and brandy, fresh meat, salt meat, pork, cattle, dried,\r\nsalted, smoked or pickled fish, butter, honey, sugar, sweet-oil,\r\nlamp-oil, candles, firewood, charcoal and other coal, salt, soap,\r\nsoda, potash, leather, iron, steel, castings, lead, brass, hemp, linen,\r\nwoolens, canvas and woven stuffs, sabots, shoes and tobacco.\" Whoever\r\nkeeps on hand more than he consumes is a monopolist and commits a\r\ncapital crime; the penalty, very severe, is imprisonment or the pillory,\r\nfor whoever sells above the established price:[4239] such are the simple\r\nand direct expedients of the revolutionary government, and such is the\r\ncharacter of its inventive faculty, like that of the savage who\r\nhews down a tree to get at its fruit.--Consequently, after the first\r\napplication of the \"maximum\" the shopkeeper is no longer able to carry\r\non business; his customers, attracted by the sudden depreciation in\r\nprice of his wares, flock to his shop and empty it in a few days;[4240]\r\nhaving sold his goods for half what they cost him,[4241] he has got back\r\nonly one-half of his advances; therefore, he can only one-half renew his\r\nassortment, less than a half, since he has not paid his bills, and his\r\ncredit is declining, the (Jacobin) representatives on mission having\r\ntaken all his coin, plate and assignats. Hence, during the following\r\nmonth, buyers find on his unfurnished counters nothing but rubbish and\r\nrefuse.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, after the proclamation of the maximum,[4242] the peasant\r\nrefuses to bring his produce to market, while the revolutionary army is\r\nnot everywhere on hand to take it from him by force: he leaves his crop\r\nunthrashed as long as he can, and complains of not finding the men to\r\nthrash it. If necessary, he hides it or feeds it out to his animals. He\r\noften barters it away for wood, for a side of bacon or in payment for\r\na day's work. At night, he carts it off six leagues to a neighboring\r\ndistrict, where the local maximum is fixed at a higher rate. He\r\nknows who, in his own vicinity, still has specie in his pocket and he\r\nunderhandedly supplies him with his stores. He especially conceals his\r\nsuperabundance and, as formerly, pretends to be poor and suffering.\r\nHe is on good terms with the village authorities, with the mayor and\r\nnational agent who are as interested as he is in evading the law, and,\r\non a bribe being necessary, he gives it. At last, he allows himself\r\nto be sued, and his property attached; he goes to prison and tires the\r\nauthorities out with his obstinacy. Hence, from week to week, less flour\r\nand grain and fewer cattle come to market, while meat becomes scarcer\r\nat the butcher's, and bread at the baker's.--Having thus paralyzed\r\nthe lesser organs of supply and demand the Jacobins now have only to\r\nparalyze labor itself, the skilled hands, the active and vigorous arms.\r\nThis is simply done by replacing the independent private workshop by the\r\ncompulsory national workshop in this way replacing piece-work by work by\r\nthe day, and the attentive, energetic workman who minds his business and\r\nexpects to earn money in return by inattentive apathic workmen pressed\r\ninto a poorly paid service but paid even when they botch the job or laze\r\nabout.--This is what the Jacobins do by forcibly commanding the services\r\nof all sorts of laborers,[4243] \"all who help handle, transport and\r\nretail produce and articles of prime necessity,\" \"country people who\r\nusually get in the crops,\" and, more particularly, thrashers, reapers,\r\ncarters, rafts men, and also shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths and the\r\nrest.--At every point of the social organism, the same principle\r\nis applied with the same result. Substitute everywhere an external,\r\nartificial and mechanical constraint for the inward, natural and\r\nanimating stimulant, and you get nothing but an universal atrophy.\r\nDeprive people of the fruits of their labor, and yet more, force them\r\nto produce by fear, confiscate their time, their painstaking efforts and\r\ntheir persons, reduce them to the condition of fellahs, create in them\r\nthe sentiments of fellahs, and you will have nothing but the labor\r\nand productions of fellahs, that is to say, a minimum of labor and\r\nproduction, and hence, insufficient supplies for sustaining a very dense\r\npopulation, which, multiplied through a superior and more productive\r\ncivilization, will not long subsist under a barbarous, inferior and\r\nunproductive régime. When this systematic and complete expropriation\r\nterminates we see the final result of the system, no longer a dearth,\r\nbut famine, famine on a large scale, and the destruction of lives\r\nby millions.--Among the Jacobins,[4244] some of the maddest who are\r\nclear-sighted, on account of their fury, Guffroy, Antonelle, Jean Bon\r\nSaint-André, Collot d'Herbois, foresee the consequences and accept them\r\nalong with the principle. Others, who avoid seeing it, are only the more\r\ndetermined in the application of it. However, they all work together\r\nwith all their might to aggravate the misery of which the lamentable\r\nspectacle is so vainly exposed under their eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Hunger.\r\n\r\n     Famine.--In the provinces.--At Paris.--People standing in\r\n     lines under the Revolutionary government to obtain food.\r\n     --Its quality.--Distress and chagrin.\r\n\r\nCollot d'Herbois wrote from Lyons on November 6, 1793: \"There is not\r\ntwo days' supply of provisions here.\" On the following day: \"The present\r\npopulation of Lyons is one hundred and thirty thousand souls at least,\r\nand there is not sufficient subsistence for three days.\" Again the day\r\nafter: \"Our situation in relation to food is deplorable.\" Then, the next\r\nday: \"Famine is beginning.\"[4245]--Near by, in the Montbrison district,\r\nin February, 1794, \"there is no food or provisions left for the people;\"\r\nall has been taken by requisition and carried off, even seed for\r\nplanting, so that the fields lie fallow.[4246]--At Marseilles, \"since\r\nthe maximum, everything is lacking; even the fishermen no longer go out\r\n(on the sea) so that there is no supply of fish to live on.\"[4247]--At\r\nCahors, in spite of multiplied requisitions, the Directory of Lot and\r\nRepresentative Taillefer[4248] state that \"the inhabitants, for\r\nmore than eight days, are reduced wholly to maslin bread composed of\r\none-fifth of wheat and the rest of barley, barley-malt and millet.\"--At\r\nNîmes,[4249] to make the grain supply last, which is giving out, the\r\nbakers and all private persons are ordered not to sift the meal, but to\r\nleave the bran in it and knead and bake the \"dough such as it is.\"--At\r\nGrenoble,[4250] \"the bakers have stopped baking; the country people no\r\nlonger bring wheat in; the dealers hide away their goods, or put them in\r\nthe hands of neighborly officials, or send them off.\"--\"It goes from bad\r\nto worse,\" write the agents of Huningue;[4251] one might say even, that\r\nthey would give this or that article to their cattle rather than sell\r\nit in conformity with the tax.\"--The inhabitants of towns are everywhere\r\nput on rations, and so small a ration as to scarcely keep them from\r\ndying with hunger. \"Since my arrival in Tarbes,\" writes another\r\nagent,[4252] \"every person is limited to half a pound of bread a day,\r\ncomposed one-third of wheat and two-thirds of corn meal.\" The next day\r\nafter the fête in honor of the tyrant's death there was absolutely none\r\nat all. \"A half-pound of bread is also allowed at Evreux,[4253] \"and\r\neven this is obtained with a good deal of trouble, many being obliged\r\nto go into the country and get it from the farmers with coin.\" And even\r\n\"they have got very little bread, flour or wheat, for they have been\r\nobliged to bring what they had to Evreux for the armies and for Paris.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worse at Rouen and at Bordeaux: at Rouen, in Brumaire, the\r\ninhabitants have only one quarter of a pound per head per diem of bread;\r\nat Bordeaux, \"for the past three months,\" says the agent,[4254] \"the\r\npeople sleep at the doors of the bakeries, to pay high for bread which\r\nthey often do not get... There has been no baking done to-day, and\r\nto-morrow only half a loaf will be given to each person. This bread is\r\nmade of oats and beans... On days that there is none, beans, chestnuts\r\nand rice are distributed in very small quantities,\" four ounces of\r\nbread, five of rice or chestnuts. \"I, who tell you this, have already\r\neaten eight or ten meals without bread; I would gladly do without it\r\nif I could get potatoes in place of it, but these, too, cannot be had.\"\r\nFive months later, fasting still continues, and it lasts until after the\r\nreign of Terror, not alone in the town, but throughout the department.\r\n\"In the district of Cadillac, says Tallien,[4255] \"absolute dearth\r\nprevails; the citizens of the rural districts contend with each other\r\nfor the grass in the fields; I have eaten bread made of dog-grass.\"\r\nHaggard and worn out, the peasant, with his pallid wife and children,\r\nresorts to the marsh to dig roots, while there is scarcely enough\r\nstrength in his arms to hold the plough.--The same spectacle is visible\r\nin places which produce but little grain, or where the granaries\r\nhave been emptied by the revolutionary drafts. \"In many of the Indre\r\ndistricts,\" writes the representative on missions,[4256] \"food\r\nis wanting absolutely. Even in some of the communes, many of the\r\ninhabitants are reduced to a frightful state of want, feeding on acorns,\r\nbran and other unhealthy food.... The districts of Châtre and Argenton,\r\nespecially, will be reduced to starvation unless they are promptly\r\nrelieved.... The cultivation of the ground is abandoned; most of the\r\npersons in the jurisdiction wander about the neighboring departments\r\nin search of food.\"--And it is doubtful whether they find it. In the\r\ndepartment of Cher, \"the butchers can no longer slaughter; the dealers'\r\nstores are all empty.\" In Allier, \"the slaughterhouses and markets are\r\ndeserted, every species of vegetable and aliment having disappeared;\r\nthe inns are closed.\" In one of the Lozère districts, composed of five\r\ncantons, of which one produces an extra quantity of rye, the people live\r\non requisitions imposed on Gard and the Upper Loire; the extortions of\r\nthe representatives in these two departments \"were distributed among the\r\nmunicipalities, and by these to the most indigent: many entire families,\r\nmany of the poor and even of the rich, suffered for want of bread during\r\nsix or eight days, and this frequently.\"[4257] Nevertheless they do not\r\nriot; they merely supplicate and stretch forth their hands \"with tears\r\nin their eyes. \"--Such is the diet and submission of the stomach in\r\nthe provinces. Paris is less patient. For this reason, all the rest is\r\nsacrificed to it,[4258] not merely the public funds, the Treasury from\r\nwhich it gets one or two millions per week,[4259] but whole districts\r\nare starved for its benefit, six departments providing grain, twenty six\r\ndepartments providing pork,[4260] at the rate of the maximum, through\r\nrequisitions, through the prospect of imprisonment and of the scaffold\r\nin case of refusal or concealment, under the predatory bayonets of the\r\nrevolutionary army. The capital, above all, has to be fed. Let us see,\r\nunder this system of partiality, how people live in Paris and what they\r\nfeed on.\r\n\r\n\"Frightful crowds\" at the doors of the bakeries, then at the doors of\r\nthe butchers and grocers, then at the markets for butter, eggs, fish and\r\nvegetables, and then on the quay for wine, firewood and charcoal--such\r\nis the steady refrain of the police reports.[4261]--And this lasts\r\nuninterruptedly during the fourteen months of revolutionary government:\r\nlong lines of people waiting in turn for bread, meat, oil, soap and\r\ncandles, \"queues for milk, for butter, for wood, for charcoal, queues\r\neverywhere!\"[4262] \"There was one queue beginning at the door of\r\na grocery in the Petit Carreau stretching half way up the rue\r\nMontorgueil.\"[4263] These queues form at three o'clock in the morning,\r\none o'clock and at midnight, increasing from hour to hour. Picture to\r\nyourself, reader, the file of wretched men and women sleeping on the\r\npavement when the weather is fine[4264] and when not fine, standing up\r\non stiff tottering legs; above all in winter, \"the rain pouring on their\r\nbacks,\" and their feet in the snow, for so many weary hours in dark,\r\nfoul, dimly lighted streets strewed with garbage; for, for want of oil,\r\none half of the street lamps are extinguished, and for lack of money,\r\nthere is no repaving, no more sweeping, the offal being piled up against\r\nthe walls.[4265] The crowd draggles along through it, likewise,\r\nnasty, tattered and torn, people with shoes full of holes, because the\r\nshoemakers do no more work for their customers, and in dirty shirts,\r\nbecause no more soap can be had to wash with, while, morally as well\r\nas physically, all these forlorn beings elbowing each other render\r\nthemselves still fouler.--Promiscuousness, contact, weariness, waiting\r\nand darkness afford free play to the grosser instincts; especially in\r\nsummer, natural bestiality and Parisian mischievousness have full play.\r\n\"Lewd women\"[4266] pursue their calling standing in the row; it is\r\nan interlude for them; \"their provoking expressions, their immoderate\r\nlaughter,\" is heard some distance off and they find it a convenient\r\nplace: two steps aside, on the flank of the row, are \"half open doors\r\nand dark alleys\" which invite tête-à-tête; many of these women who have\r\nbrought their mattresses \"sleep there and commit untold abominations.\"\r\nWhat an example for the wives and daughters of steady workmen, for\r\nhonest servants who hear and see! Men stop at each row and choose their\r\ndulcinea, while others, less shameless, pounce on the women like bulls\r\nand kiss them one after the other.\" Are not these the fraternal kisses\r\nof patriotic Jacobins? Do not Mayor Pache's wife and daughter go to the\r\nclubs and kiss drunken sans-culottes? And what says the guard?--It has\r\nenough to do to restrain another blind and deaf animal instinct, aroused\r\nas it is by suffering, anticipation and deception.\r\n\r\nOn approaching each butcher's stall before it opens \"the porters,\r\nbending under the weight of a side of beef, quicken their steps so as\r\nnot to be assailed by the crowd which presses against them, seeming to\r\ndevour the raw meat with their eyes.\" They force a passage, enter the\r\nshop in the rear, and it seems as if the time for distributing the meat\r\nhad come; the gendarmes, spurring their horses to a gallop, scatter the\r\ngroups that are too dense; \"rascals, in pay of the Commune,\" range the\r\nwomen in files, two and two, \"shivering\" in the cold morning air of\r\nDecember and January, awaiting their turn. Beforehand, however, the\r\nbutcher, according to law, sets aside the portion for the hospitals,\r\nfor pregnant women and others who are confined, for nurses, and\r\nbesides, notwithstanding the law, he sets aside another portion for the\r\nrevolutionary committee of the section, for the assistant commissioner\r\nand superintendent, for the pashas and semi pashas of the quarter, and\r\nfinally for his rich customers who pay him extra.[4267] To this end,\r\n\"porters with broad shoulders form an impenetrable rampart in front of\r\nthe shop and carry away whole oxen;\" after this is over, the women find\r\nthe shop stripped, while many, after wasting their time for four mortal\r\nhours,\" go away empty handed.--With this prospect before them the daily\r\nassemblages get to be uneasy and the waves rise; nobody, except those\r\nat the head of the row, is sure of his pittance those that are behind\r\nregard enviously and with suppressed anger the person ahead of them.\r\nFirst come outcries, then jeering and then scuffling; the women rival\r\nthe men in struggling and in profanity,[4268] and they hustle each\r\nother. The line suddenly breaks; each rushes to get ahead of the other;\r\nthe foremost place belongs to the most robust and the most brutal, and\r\nto secure it they have to trample down their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThere are fisticuffs every day. When an assemblage remains quiet the\r\nspectators take notice of it. In general \"they fight,[4269] snatch bread\r\nout of each other's hands; those who cannot get any forcing whoever gets\r\na loaf weighing four pounds to share it in small pieces. The women yell\r\nfrightfully.... Children sent by their parents are beaten,\" while the\r\nweak are pitched into the gutter. \"In distributing the meanest portions\r\nof food[4270] it is force which decides,\" the strength of loins and\r\narms; \"a number of women this morning came near losing their lives in\r\ntrying to get four ounces of butter.--More sensitive and more violent\r\nthan men, \"they do not, or will not, listen to reason,[4271] they pounce\r\ndown like harpies\" on the market wagons; they thrash the drivers, strew\r\nthe vegetables and butter on the ground, tumble over each other and are\r\nsuffocated through the impetuosity of the assault; some, \"trampled upon,\r\nalmost crushed, are carried off half dead.\" Everybody for himself. Empty\r\nstomachs feel that, to get anything, it is important to get ahead, not\r\nto await for the distribution, the unloading or even the arrival of\r\nthe supplies.--\"A boat laden with wine having been signaled, the crowd\r\nrushed on board to pillage it and the boat sunk,\" probably along with a\r\ngood many of its invaders.[4272] Other gatherings at the barriers\r\nstop the peasants' wagons and take their produce before they reach the\r\nmarkets. Outside the barriers, children and women throw stones at the\r\nmilkmen, forcing them to get down from their carts and distribute milk\r\non the spot. Still further out, one or two leagues off on the highways,\r\ngangs from Paris go at night to intercept and seize the supplies\r\nintended for Paris. \"This morning,\" says a watchman, \"all the Faubourg\r\nSt. Antoine scattered itself along the Vincennes road and pillaged\r\nwhatever was on the way to the city; some paid, while others carried off\r\nwithout paying.... The unfortunate peasants swore that they would not\r\nfetch anything more,\" the dearth thus increasing through the efforts to\r\nescape it.\r\n\r\nIn vain the government makes its requisitions for Paris as if in a\r\nstate of siege, and fixes the quantity of grain on paper which\r\neach department, district, canton, and commune, must send to the\r\ncapital.--Naturally, each department, district, canton and commune\r\nstrives to retain its own supplies, for charity begins at home.[4273]\r\nEspecially in a village, the mayor and members of a municipality,\r\nthemselves cultivators, are lukewarm when the commune is to be starved\r\nfor the benefit of the capital. They declare a less return of grain\r\nthan there really is; they allege reasons and pretexts. They mystify or\r\nsuborn the commissioner on provisions, who is a stranger, incompetent\r\nand needy; they make him drink and eat, and, now and then, fill his\r\npocket book. He slips over the accounts, he gives the village receipts\r\non furnishing three-quarters or a half of the demand, often in spoilt or\r\nmixed grain or poor flour, while those who have no rusty wheat get it\r\nof their neighbors. Instead of parting with a hundred quintals they part\r\nwith fifty, while the quantity of grain in the Paris markets is not\r\nonly insufficient, but the grain blackens or sprouts and the flour grows\r\nmusty. In vain the government makes clerks and depositaries of butchers\r\nand grocers, allowing them five or ten per cent. profit on retail sales\r\nof the food it supplies them with at wholesale, and thus creates in\r\nParis, at the expense of all France, an artificial drop in prices.\r\nNaturally, the bread[4274] which, thanks to the State, costs three sous\r\nin Paris, is furtively carried out of Paris into the suburbs, where six\r\nsous are obtained for it. There is the same furtive leakage for other\r\nfood furnished by the State on the same conditions to other dealers; the\r\ntax is a burden which forces them to go outside their shops. Food finds\r\nits level like water, not alone outside of Paris, but in Paris itself.\r\n\r\n* Naturally, \"the grocers peddle their goods\" secretly, \"sugar, candles,\r\nsoap, butter, dried vegetables, meat pies and the rest,\" amongst private\r\nhouses, in which these articles are bought at any price.\r\n\r\n* Naturally, the butcher keeps his large pieces of beef and choice\r\nmorsels for the large eating houses, and for rich customers who pay him\r\nwhatever profit he asks.\r\n\r\n* Naturally, whoever is in authority, or has the power, uses it to\r\nsupply himself first, largely, and in preference; we have seen the\r\nlevies of the revolutionary committees, superintendents and agents; as\r\nsoon as rations are allotted to all mouths, each potentate will have\r\nseveral rations delivered for his mouth alone; in the meantime[4275] the\r\npatriots who guard the barriers appropriate all provisions that arrive,\r\nand the next morning, should any scolding appear in the orders of the\r\nday, it is but slight.\r\n\r\nSuch are the two results of the system: not only is the food which is\r\nsupplied to Paris scant and poor, but the regular consumers of it, those\r\nwho take their turn to get it, obtain but a small portion, and that\r\nthe worst.[4276] A certain inspector, on going to the corn market for\r\na sample of flour, writes \"that it cannot be called flour;[4277] it is\r\nground bran,\" and not a nutritive substance; the bakers are forced to\r\ntake it, the markets containing for the most part no other supply than\r\nthis flour.\"--Again, three weeks later, \"Food is still very scarce and\r\npoor in quality. The bread is disagreeable to the taste and produces\r\nmaladies with which many citizens are suffering, like dysentery and\r\nother inflammatory ailments.\" The same report, three months later during\r\nthe month of Nivôse: \"Complaints are constantly made of the poor quality\r\nof flour, which, it is said, makes a good many people ill; it causes\r\nsevere pain in the intestines, accompanied with a slow fever.--During\r\nVentôse, \"the scarcity of every article is extremely great,\"[4278]\r\nespecially of meat. Some women in the Place Maubert, pass six hours in\r\na line waiting for it, and do not get the quarter of a pound; in many\r\nstalls there is none at all, not \"an ounce\" being obtainable to make\r\nbroth for the sick. Workmen do not get it in their shops and do without\r\ntheir soup; they live on \"bread and salted herrings.\" A great many\r\npeople groan over \"not having eaten bread for a fortnight;\" women say\r\nthat \"they have not had a dish of meat and vegetables (pot au feu) for\r\na month.\" Meanwhile \"vegetables are astonishingly scarce and excessively\r\ndear.... two sous for a miserable carrot, and as much for two small\r\nleeks.\" Out of two thousand women who wait at the central market for a\r\ndistribution of beans, only six hundred receive any. Potatoes increase\r\nin price in one week from two to three francs a bushel, and oatmeal and\r\nground peas triple in price. \"The grocers have no more brown sugar,\r\neven for the sick,\" and sell candles and soap only by the half pound.--A\r\nfortnight later candles are wholly wanting in certain quarters, except\r\nin the section storehouse, which is almost empty, each person being\r\nallowed only one. A good many households go to rest at sundown for lack\r\nof lights and do not cook any dinner for lack of coal. Eggs, especially,\r\nare \"honored as invisible divinities,\" while the absent butter \"is a\r\ngod.\"[4279] \"If this lasts,\" say the workmen, \"we shall have to cut each\r\nother's throats, since there is nothing left to live on.\"[4280] \"Sick\r\nwomen,[4281] children in their cradles, lie outstretched in the sun,\" in\r\nthe very heart of Paris, in rue Vivienne, on the Pont-Royal, and remain\r\nthere \"late in the night, demanding alms of the passers-by.\" \"One is\r\nconstantly stopped by beggars of both sexes, most of them healthy and\r\nstrong,\" begging, they say, for lack of work. Without counting\r\nthe feeble and the infirm who are unable to stand in a line, whose\r\nsufferings are visible, who gradually waste away and die without\r\na murmur at home, \"one encounters in the streets and markets\" only\r\nfamished and eager visages, \"an immense crowd of citizens running\r\nand dashing against each other,\" crying out and weeping, \"everywhere\r\npresenting an image of despair.\"[4282]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Revolutionary Remedies.\r\n\r\n     Revolutionary remedies.--Rigor against the refractory.\r\n     --Decrees and orders rendering the State the only depositary\r\n     and distributor of food.--Efforts made to establish a\r\n     conscription of labor.--Discouragement of the Peasant.--He\r\n     refuses to cultivate.--Decrees and orders compelling him to\r\n     harvest.--His stubbornness.--Cultivators imprisoned by\r\n     thousands.--The Convention is obliged to set them at\r\n     liberty.--Fortunate circumstances which save France from\r\n     extreme famine.\r\n\r\nThis penury only exists, say the Jacobins, because the laws against\r\nmonopoly, and sales above the \"maximum\" prices are not being obeyed to\r\nthe letter of the law. The egoism of the cultivator and the cupidity of\r\ndealers are not restrained by fear and delinquents escape too frequently\r\nfrom the legal penalty. Let us enforce this penalty rigorously; let us\r\nincrease the punishment against them and their instruments; let us\r\nscrew up the machine and give them a new wrench. A new estimate and\r\nverification of the food supply takes place, domiciliary searches,\r\nseizures of special stores regarded as too ample,[4283] limited rations\r\nfor each consumer, a common and obligatory mess table for all prisoners,\r\nbrown, égalité bread, mostly of bran, for every mouth that can chew,\r\nprohibition of the making of any other kind, confiscation of boulters\r\nand sieves,[4284] the \"individual,\" personal responsibility of every\r\nadministrator who allows the people he directs to resist or escape\r\nproviding the demanded supplies, the sequestration of his property,\r\nimprisonment, fines, the pillory and the guillotine to hurry up\r\nrequisitions, or stop free trading,--every terrifying method is driven\r\nto the utmost against the farmers and cultivators of the soil.\r\n\r\nAfter April, 1794,[4285] crowds of this class are found filling the\r\nprisons to overflowing; the Revolution has struck them also. They stroll\r\nabout in the court yard, and wander through the corridors with a sad,\r\nstupefied expression, no longer comprehending the way things are going\r\non in the world. In vain are efforts made to explain to them that\r\n\"their crops are national property and that they are simply its\r\ndepositaries;\"[4286] never had this new principle entered into, nor will\r\nit enter, their rude brains; always, through habit and instinct, will\r\nthey work against it.--Let them be spared the temptation. Let us (the\r\nJacobins) relieve them from, and, in fact, take their crops; let the\r\nState in France become the sole depositary and distributor of grain;\r\nlet it solely buy and sell grain at a fixed rate. Consequently, at\r\nParis,[4287] the Committee of Public Safety first puts \"in requisition\r\nall the oats that can be found in the Republic; every holder of oats\r\nis required to deposit his stock on hand within eight days, in the\r\nstorehouse indicated by the district administration \"at the maximum\"\r\nprice; otherwise he is \"a 'suspect' and must be punished as such.\" In\r\nthe meantime, through still more comprehensive orders issued in the\r\nprovinces, Paganel in the department of Tarn, and Dartigoyte in those\r\nof Gers and the Upper-Garonne,[4288] enjoin each commune to establish\r\npublic granaries. \"All citizens are ordered to bring in whatever produce\r\nthey possess in grain, flour, wheat, maslin, rye, barley, oats, millet,\r\nbuckwheat\" at the \"maximum\" rate. Nobody shall keep on hand more than\r\none month's supply, fifty pounds of flour or wheat for each person;\r\nin this way, the State, which holds in its hands the keys of the\r\nstorehouses, may \"carry out the salutary equalization of provisions\"\r\nbetween department and department, district and district, commune and\r\ncommune, individual and individual. A storekeeper will look after each\r\nof these well filled granaries; the municipality will itself deliver\r\nrations and, moreover, \"take suitable steps to see that beans and\r\nvegetables, as they mature, be economically distributed under its\r\nsupervision,\" at so much per head, and always at the rate of the\r\n\"maximum.\" Otherwise, dismissal, imprisonment and prosecution \"in the\r\nextraordinary criminal tribunal. \"-This being accomplished, and the\r\nfruits of labor duly allotted, there remains only the allotment of labor\r\nitself. To effect this, Maignet,[4289] in Vaucluse, and in the Bouches\r\ndu Rhône, prescribes for each municipality the immediate formation\r\nof two lists, one of day laborers and the other of proprietors. \"All\r\nproprietors in need of a cultivator by the day,\" are to appear and ask\r\nfor one at the municipality, which will assign the applicant as many as\r\nhe wants, \"in order on the list,\" with a card for himself and numbers\r\nfor the designated parties. The laborer who does not enter his name\r\non the list, or who exacts more than the \"maximum\" wages, is to be\r\nsentenced to the pillory with two years in irons. The same sentence with\r\nthe addition of a fine of three hundred livres, is for every proprietor\r\nwho employs any laborer not on the list or who pays more than the\r\n\"maximum rate of wages.\r\n\r\nAfter this, nothing more is necessary, in practice, than to\r\n\r\n* draw up and keep in sight the new registries of names and figures\r\nmade by the members of thirty thousand municipal boards, who cannot keep\r\naccounts and who scarcely know how to read and write;\r\n\r\n* build a vast public granary, or put in requisition three or four barns\r\nin each commune, in which half dried and mixed grain may rot;\r\n\r\n* pay two hundred thousand incorruptible storekeepers and measurers\r\nwho will not divert anything from the depots for their friends or\r\nthemselves;\r\n\r\n* add to the thirty five thousand employees of the Committee on\r\nProvisions,[4290] five hundred thousand municipal scribes disposed\r\nto quit their trades or ploughs for the purpose of making daily\r\ndistributions gratuitously; but more precisely, to maintain four or five\r\nmillions of perfect gendarmes, one in each family, living with it, to\r\nhelp along the purchases, sales and transactions of each day and to\r\nverify at night the contents of the locker.\r\n\r\nIn short, to set one half of the French people as spies on the other\r\nhalf.--These are the conditions which secure the production and\r\ndistribution of food, and which suffice for the institution throughout\r\nFrance of a conscription of labor and the captivity of grain.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the peasant does not understand this theory, but he\r\nunderstands business; he makes close calculations, and the\r\npositive, patent, vulgar facts on which he reasons lead to other\r\nconclusions:[4291]\r\n\r\n\"In Messidor last they took all my last years' oats, at fourteen francs\r\nin assignats, and, in Thermidor, they are going to take all this year's\r\noats, at eleven francs in assignats. At this rate I shall not sow at\r\nall. Besides, I do not need any for myself, as they have taken my horses\r\nfor the army wagons. To raise rye and wheat, as much of it as formerly,\r\nis also working at a loss; I will raise no more than the little I want\r\nfor myself, and again, I suppose that this will be put in requisition,\r\neven my supplies for the year! I had rather let my fields lie fallow.\r\nJust see now, they are taking all the live three months' pigs! Luckily,\r\nI killed mine be forehand and it is now in the pork barrel. But they are\r\ngoing to claim all salt provisions like the rest. The new grabbers\r\nare worse than the old ones. Six months more, and we shall all die\r\nof hunger. It is better to cross one's arms at once and go to prison;\r\nthere, at least, we shall be fed and not have to work.\"\r\n\r\nIn effect, they allow themselves to be imprisoned, the best of the small\r\ncultivators and proprietors by thousands, and Lindet,[4292] at the head\r\nof the Commission on Provisions, speaks with dismay of the ground being\r\nno longer tilled, of cattle in France being no more abundant than the\r\nyear before, and of nothing to be had to cut this year.\r\n\r\nFor a strange thing has happened, unheard of in Europe, almost\r\nincredible to any one familiar with the French peasant and his love of\r\nwork. This field which he has ploughed, manured, harrowed and reaped\r\nwith his own hands, its precious crop, the crop that belongs to him and\r\non which he has feasted his eyes for seven months, now that it is ripe,\r\nhe will not take the trouble to gather it; it would be bothering himself\r\nfor some one else. As the crop that he sees there is for the government,\r\nlet the government defray the final cost of getting it in; let it do the\r\nharvesting, the reaping, the putting it in sheaves, the carting and\r\nthe thrashing in the barn.--Thereupon, the representatives on mission\r\nexclaim, each shouting in a louder or lower key, according to his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the cultivators,\" writes Dartigoyte,[4293] \"affect a supreme\r\nindifference for this splendid crop. One must have seen it, as I have,\r\nto believe how great the neglect of the wheat is in certain parts,\r\nhow it is smothered by the grass.... Draft, if the case requires it, a\r\ncertain number of inhabitants in this or that commune to work in another\r\none.... Every man who refuses to work, except on the 'decade' day, must\r\nbe punished as an ill-disposed citizen, as a royalist.\"--\r\n\r\n\"Generous friends of nature,\" writes Ferry,[4294] introduce amongst you,\r\nperpetuate around you, the habit of working in common and begin with the\r\npresent crop. Do not spare either indolent women or indolent men, those\r\nsocial parasites, many of whom you doubtless have in your midst. What!\r\nallow lazy men and lazy women where we are! Where should we find a\r\nRepublican police?... Immediately on the reception of this present order\r\nthe municipal officers of each commune will convoke all citoyennes in\r\nthe Temple of the Eternal and urge them, in the name of the law, to\r\ndevote themselves to the labors of harvesting. Those women who fail in\r\nthis patriotic duty, shall be excluded from the assemblies, from the\r\nnational festivals, while all good citoyennes are requested to repel\r\nthem from their homes. All good citizens are requested to give to this\r\nrural festivity that sentimental character which befits it.\"\r\n\r\n--And the programme is carried out, here in idyllic shape and there\r\nunder compulsion. Around Avignon,[4295] the commanding officer, the\r\nbattalions of volunteers, and patriotic ladies, \"the wives and daughters\r\nof patriots,\" inscribe themselves as harvesters. Around Arles, \"the\r\nmunicipality drafts all the inhabitants; patrols are sent into the\r\ncountry to compel all who are engaged on other work to leave it and do\r\nthe harvesting.\" The Convention, on its side, orders[4296] the\r\nrelease, \"provisionally, of all ploughmen, day-laborers, reapers, and\r\nprofessional artisans and brewers, in the country and in the market\r\ntowns and communes, the population of which is not over twelve hundred\r\ninhabitants, and who are confined as 'suspects.' \"--In other terms,\r\nphysical necessity has imposed silence on the inept theory; above all\r\nthings, the crop must be harvested, and indispensable arms be restored\r\nto the field of labor. The governors of France are compelled to put on\r\nthe brake, if only for an instant, at the last moment, at sight of the\r\nyawning abyss, of approaching and actual famine; France was then gliding\r\ninto it, and, if not engulfed, it is simply a miracle.\r\n\r\nFour fortunate circumstances, at the last hour, concur to keep her\r\nsuspended on the hither brink of the precipice.--The winter chances\r\nto be exceptionally mild.[4297] The vegetables which make up for the\r\nabsence of bread and meat provide food for April and May, while\r\nthe remarkably fine harvest, almost spontaneous, is three weeks in\r\nadvance.--Another, and the second piece of good fortune, consists in the\r\ngreat convoy from America, one hundred and sixteen vessels loaded with\r\ngrain, which reached Brest on the 8th of June, 1794, in spite of English\r\ncruisers, thanks to the sacrifice of the fleet that protected it and\r\nwhich, eight days previously, had succumbed in its behalf. The third\r\nstroke of fortune is the entry of a victorious army into the enemies\r\ncountry and feeding itself through foreign requisitions, in Belgium,\r\nin the Palatinate and on the frontier provinces of Italy and\r\nSpain.--Finally, most fortunate of all, Robespierre, Saint Just and\r\nCouthon, the Paris commune and the theorist Jacobins, are guillotined\r\non the 23rd of July, and with them falls despotic socialism. Henceforth,\r\nthe Jacobin edifice crumbles, owing to great crevices in its walls. The\r\n\"maximum,\" in fact, is no longer maintained, while the Convention, at\r\nthe end of December, 1794, legally abolishes it. The farmers now sell as\r\nthey please and at two prices, according as they are paid in assignats\r\nor coin; their hope, confidence and courage are restored; in October and\r\nNovember, 1794, they voluntarily do their own plowing and planting, and\r\nstill more gladly will they gather in their own crops in July, 1795.\r\nNevertheless, we can judge by the discouragement into which they had\r\nbeen plunged by four months of the system, the utter prostration into\r\nwhich they would have fallen had the system lasted an indefinite time.\r\nIt is very probable that cultivation at the end of one or two years\r\nwould have proved unproductive or have ceased altogether. Already,\r\nsubject to every sort of exhortation and threat, the peasant had\r\nremained inert, apparently deaf and insensible, like an overloaded beast\r\nof burden which, so often struck, grows obstinate or sinks down and\r\nrefuses to move. It is evident that he would have never stirred again\r\ncould Saint-Just, holding him by the throat, have bound him hand and\r\nfoot, as he had done at Strasbourg, in the multiplied knots of his\r\nSpartan Utopia. We should have seen what labor and the stagnation\r\nit produces comes to, when managed through State maneuvers by\r\nadministrative manikins and humanitarian automatons. This experiment\r\nhad been tried in China, in the eleventh century, and according to\r\nprinciples, long and regularly, by a well manipulated and omnipotent\r\nState, on the most industrious and soberest people in the world, and men\r\ndied in myriads like flies. If the French, at the end of 1794 and during\r\nthe following years did not die like flies, it was because the Jacobin\r\nsystem was relaxed too soon.[4298]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Relaxation.\r\n\r\n     Relaxation of the Revolutionary system after Thermidor.\r\n     --Repeal of the Maximum.--New situation of the peasant.--He\r\n     begins to cultivation again.--Requisition of grain by the\r\n     State.--The cultivator indemnifies himself at the expense of\r\n     private persons.--Multiplication and increasing decline of\r\n     Assignats. The classes who have to bear the burden.--Famine\r\n     and misery during year III, and the first half of year IV.\r\n     --In the country.--In the small towns.--In large towns and\r\n     cities.\r\n\r\nBut, if the Jacobin system, in spite of its surviving founders,\r\ngradually relaxes after Thermidor; if the main ligature tied around the\r\nman's neck, broke just as the man was strangling, the others that still\r\nbind him hold him tight, except as they are loosened in places; and, as\r\nit is, some of the straps, terribly stiffened, sink deeper and deeper\r\ninto his flesh.--In the first place, the requisitions continue there is\r\nno other way of provisioning the armies and the cities; the gendarme is\r\nalways on the road, compelling each village to contribute its portion\r\nof grain, and at the legal rate. The refractory are subject to keepers,\r\nconfiscations, fines and imprisonment; they are confined and kept in the\r\ndistrict lock ups \"at their own expense,\" men and women, twenty two on\r\nPluviôse 17, year III., in the district of Bar-sur-Aube; forty five,\r\nGerminal 7, in the district of Troyes; forty-five, the same day, in the\r\ndistrict of Nogent-sur-Seine, and twenty others, eight days later, in\r\nthe same district, in the commune of Traine alone.[4299]--The condition\r\nof the cultivator is certainly not an easy one, while public authority,\r\naided by the public force, extorts from him all it can at a rate of its\r\nown; moreover, it will soon exact from him one half of his contributions\r\nin kind, and, it must be noted, that at this time, the direct\r\ncontributions alone absorb twelve and thirteen sous on the franc of the\r\nrevenue. Nevertheless, under this condition, which is that of laborers\r\nin a Muslim country, the French peasant, like the Syrian or Tunisian\r\npeasant, can keep himself alive; for, through the abolition of the\r\n\"maximum,\" private transactions are now free, and, to indemnify himself\r\non this side, he sells to private individuals and even to towns,[42100]\r\nby agreement, on understood terms, and as dear as he pleases; all the\r\ndearer because through the legal requisitions the towns are half empty,\r\nand there are fewer sacks of grain for a larger number of purchasers;\r\nhence his losses by the government are more than made up by his gains\r\non private parties; he gains in the end, and that is why he persists in\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\nThe weight, however, of which he relieves himself falls upon the\r\noverburdened buyer, and this weight, already excessive, goes on\r\nincreasing, through another effect of the revolutionary institution,\r\nuntil it becomes ten-fold and even a hundred-fold.--The only money, in\r\nfact, which private individuals possess melts away in their hands,\r\nand, so to say, destroys itself. When the guillotine stops working, the\r\nassignat, losing its official value, falls to its real value. In August,\r\n1794, the loss on it is sixty six per cent., in October, seventy two per\r\ncent., in December, seventy eight per cent., in January, 1795, eighty\r\none per cent., and after that date the constant issues of enormous\r\namounts, five hundred millions, then a billion, a billion and a half,\r\nand, finally, two billions a month, hastens its depreciation.[42101]\r\nThe greater the depreciation of the assignats the greater the amount the\r\ngovernment is obliged to issue to provide for its expenses, and the more\r\nit issues the more it causes their depreciation, so that the decline\r\nwhich increases the issue increases the depreciation, until, finally,\r\nthe assignat comes down to nothing. On March II, 1795, the louis d'or\r\nbrings two hundred and five francs in assignats, May 11, four hundred\r\nfrancs, June 12, one thousand francs, in the month of October, one\r\nthousand seven hundred francs, November 13, two thousand eight hundred\r\nand fifty francs, November 21 three thousand francs, and six months\r\nlater, nineteen thousand francs. Accordingly, an assignat of one hundred\r\nfrancs is worth in June, 1795, four francs, in August three francs,\r\nin November fifteen sous, in December ten sous, and then five sous.\r\nNaturally, all provisions rise proportionately in price. A pound of\r\nbread in Paris, January 2, 1796, costs fifty francs, a pound of meat\r\nsixty francs, a pound of candles one hundred and eighty francs, a bushel\r\nof potatoes two hundred francs, a bottle of wine one hundred francs.\r\nThe reader may imagine, if he can, the distress of people with small\r\nincomes, pensioners and employees, mechanics and artisans in the towns\r\nout of work,[42102] in brief, all who have nothing but a small package\r\nof assignats to live on, and who have nothing to do, whose indispensable\r\nwants are not directly supplied by the labor of their own hands in\r\nproducing wine, candles, meat, potatoes and bread.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the abolition of the \"maximum,\"[42103] the cry of\r\nhunger increases. From month to month its accents become more painful\r\nand vehement in proportion to the increased dearness of provisions,\r\nespecially in the summer of 1795, as the harvesting draws near, when\r\nthe granaries, filled by the crop of 1794, are getting empty. And these\r\nhungering cries go up by millions: for a good many of the departments in\r\nFrance do not produce sufficient grain for home consumption, this\r\nbeing the case in fertile wheat departments, and likewise in certain\r\ndistricts; cries also go up from the large and small towns, while in\r\neach village numbers of peasants fast because they have no land\r\nto provide them with food, or because they lack strength, health,\r\nemployment and wages. \"For a fortnight past,\" writes a municipal body in\r\nSeine-et-Marne,[42104] \"at least two hundred citizens in our commune are\r\nwithout bread, grain and flour; they have had no other food than bran\r\nand vegetables. We see with sorrow children deprived of nourishment,\r\ntheir nurses without milk, unable to suckle them; old men falling down\r\nthrough inanition, and young men in the fields too weak to stand up to\r\ntheir work.\" And other communes in the district \"are about in the same\r\ncondition.\" The same spectacle is visible throughout the Ile-de-France,\r\nNormandy, and in Picardy. Around Dieppe, in the country,[42105]\r\nentire communes support themselves on herbs and bran. \"Citizen\r\nrepresentatives,\" write the administrators, \"we can no longer maintain\r\nourselves. Our fellow citizens reproach us with having despoiled them of\r\ntheir grain in favor of the large communes.\"--\"All means of subsistence\r\nare exhausted,\" writes the district of Louviers;[42106] \"we are reduced\r\nhere for a month past to eating bran bread and boiled herbs, and even\r\nthis rude food is getting scarce. Bear in mind that we have seventy-one\r\nthousand people to govern, at this very time subject to all the horrors\r\nof famine, a large number of them having already perished, some with\r\nhunger and others with diseases engendered by the poor food they live\r\non. \"--In the Caen district,[42107] \"the unripe peas, horse peas, beans,\r\nand green barley and rye are attacked;\" mothers and children go after\r\nthese in the fields in default of other food; \"other vegetables in the\r\ngardens are already consumed; furniture, the comforts of the well to do\r\nclass, have become the prey of the farming egoist; having nothing more\r\nto sell they consequently have nothing with which to obtain a morsel of\r\nbread.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" writes the representative on mission, \"to wait for\r\nthe crop without further aid. As long as bran lasted the people ate\r\nthat; none can now be found and despair is at its height. I have not\r\nseen the sun since I came. The harvest will be a month behind. What\r\nshall we do? What will become of us?\"--\"In Picardy,\" writes the Beauvais\r\ndistrict, \"the great majority of people in the rural communes search the\r\nwoods\" to find mushrooms, berries and wild fruits.[42108] \"They think\r\nthemselves lucky,\" says the Bapaume district, \"if they can get a share\r\nof the food of animals.\" \"In many communes,\" the district of Vervier\r\nreports, \"the inhabitants are reduced to living on herbage.\" \"Many\r\nfamilies, entire communes,\" reports the Laon commissary, \"have been\r\nwithout bread two or three months and live on bran or herbs.... Mothers\r\nof families, children, old men, pregnant women, come to the (members of\r\nthe) Directory for bread and often faint in their arms.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, great as the famine is in the country it is worse in the towns;\r\nand the proof of it is that the starving people flock into the country\r\nto find whatever they can to live on, no matter how, and, generally\r\nspeaking, in vain.--\"Three quarters of our fellow citizens,\" writes\r\nthe Rozoy municipality,[42109] \"are forced to quit work and overrun the\r\ncountry here and there, among the farmers, to obtain bread for specie,\r\nand with more entreaty than the poorest wretches; for the most part,\r\nthey return with tears in their eyes at not being able to find, not\r\nmerely a bushel of wheat, but a pound of bread.\" \"Yesterday,\" writes\r\nthe Montreuil-sur-Mer municipality,[42110] \"more than two hundred of\r\nour citizens set out to beg in the country,\" and, when they get nothing,\r\nthey steal. \"Bands of brigands[42111] spread through the country and\r\npillage all dwellings anywise remote. ... Grain, flour, bread, cattle,\r\npoultry, stuffs, etc., all come in play. Our terrified shepherds are\r\nno longer willing to sleep in their sheep pens and are leaving us.\" The\r\nmost timid dig Carrots at night or, during the day, gather dandelions;\r\nbut their town stomachs cannot digest this food. \"Lately,\" writes the\r\nprocureur--syndic of Saint-Germain,[42112] \"the corpse of a father of a\r\nfamily, found in the fields with his mouth still filled with the grass\r\nhe had striven to chew, exasperates and arouses the spirit of the poor\r\ncreatures awaiting a similar fate.\"\r\n\r\nWhat then, do people in the towns do in order to survive?--In small\r\ntowns or scattered villages, each municipality, using what gendarmes it\r\nhas, makes legal requisitions in its vicinity, and sometimes the commune\r\nobtains from the government a charitable gift of wheat, oats, rice or\r\nassignats. But the quantity of grain it receives is so small, one asks\r\nhow it is that, after two months, six months or a year of such a system,\r\nthat half of the inhabitants are not in the grave yard. I suppose that\r\nmany of them live on what they raise in their gardens, or on their small\r\nfarms; others are helped by their relations, neighbors and companions;\r\nin any event, it is clear that the human body is very resistant, and a\r\nfew mouthfuls suffice to keep it going a long time.--At Ervy,[42113]\r\nin Aube, \"not a grain of wheat has been brought in the last two market\r\ndays.\" \"To morrow,[42114] Prairial 25, in Bapaume, the main town of the\r\ndistrict, there will be only two bushels of flour left (for food of\r\nany sort).\" \"At Boulogne-sur-Mer, for the past ten days, there has been\r\ndistributed to each person only three pounds of bad barley, or maslin,\r\nwithout knowing whether we can again distribute this miserable ration\r\nnext decade.\" Out of sixteen hundred inhabitants in Brionne, \"twelve\r\nhundred and sixty[42115] are reduced to the small portion of wheat they\r\nreceive at the market, and which, unfortunately, for too long a time,\r\nhas been reduced from eight to three ounces of wheat for each person,\r\nevery eight days.\" For three months past, in Seine et Marne,[42116]\r\nin \"the commune of Meaux, that of Laferté, Lagny, Daumartin, and other\r\nprincipal towns of the canton, they have had only half a pound per\r\nhead, for each day, of bad bread.\" In Seine et Oise, \"citizens of the\r\nneighborhood of Paris and even of Versailles[42117] state that they\r\nare reduced to four ounces of bread.\" At Saint-Denis,[42118] with a\r\npopulation of six thousand, \"a large part of the inhabitants, worn\r\nout with suffering, betake themselves to the charity depots. Workmen,\r\nespecially, cannot do their work for lack of food. A good many women,\r\nmothers and nurses, have been found in their houses unconscious, without\r\nany sign of life in them, and many have died with their infants at their\r\nbreasts.\" Even in a larger and less forsaken town, Saint-Germain,[42119]\r\nthe misery surpasses all that one can imagine. \"Half-a-pound of flour\r\nfor each inhabitant,\" not daily, but at long intervals; \"bread at\r\nfifteen and sixteen francs the pound and all other provisions at\r\nthe same rate; a people which is sinking, losing hope and perishing.\r\nYesterday, for the fête of the 9th of Thermidor, not a sign of\r\nrejoicing; on the contrary, symptoms of general and profound depression,\r\ntottering specters in the streets, mournful shrieks of ravaging hunger\r\nor shouts of rage, almost every one, driven to the last extremity of\r\nmisery, welcoming death as a boon.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the aspect of these huge artificial agglomerations, where the\r\nsoil, made sterile by habitation, bears only stones, and where twenty,\r\nthirty, fifty and a hundred thousand suffering stomachs have to obtain\r\nfrom ten, twenty and thirty leagues off their first and last mouthful of\r\nfood. Within these close pens long lines of human sheep huddle together\r\nevery day bleating and trembling around almost empty troughs, and\r\nonly through extraordinary efforts do the shepherds daily succeed\r\nin providing them with a little nourishment. The central government,\r\nstrenuously appealed to, enlarges or defines the circle of their\r\nrequisitions; it authorizes them to borrow, to tax themselves; it lends\r\nor gives to them millions of assignats;[42120] frequently, in cases\r\nof extreme want, it allows them to take so much grain or rice from its\r\nstorehouses, for a week's supply.--But, in truth, this sort of life is\r\nnot living, it is only not dying. For one half, and more than one half\r\nof the inhabitants simply subsist on rations of bread obtained by long\r\nwaiting for it at the end of a string of people and delivered at\r\na reduced price. What rations and what bread!\"It seems,\" says the\r\nmunicipality of Troyes, \"that[42121] the country has anathematized the\r\ntowns. Formerly, the finest grain was brought to market; the farmer kept\r\nthe inferior quality and consumed it at home. Now it is the reverse,\r\nand this is carried still further, for, not only do we receive no wheat\r\nwhatever, but the farmers give us sprouted barley and rye, which they\r\nreserve for our commune; the farmer who has none arranges with those who\r\nhave, so as to buy it and deliver it in town, and sell his good wheat\r\nelsewhere. Half a pound per day and per head, in Pluviôse, to the\r\nthirteen thousand or fourteen thousand indigent in Troyes; then a\r\nquarter of a pound, and, finally, two ounces with a little rice and some\r\ndried vegetables, \"which feeble resource is going to fail us.\"[42122]\r\nHalf a pound in Pluviôse, to the twenty thousand needy in Amiens, which\r\nration is only nominal, for \"it often happens that each individual gets\r\nonly four ounces, while the distribution has repeatedly failed three\r\ndays in succession,'' and this continues. Six months later, Fructidor\r\n7, Amiens has but sixty nine quintals of flour in its market storehouse,\r\n\"an insufficient quantity for distribution this very day; to morrow, it\r\nwill be impossible to make any distribution at all, and the day after\r\nto morrow the needy population of this commune will be brought down\r\nto absolute famine.\"--\"Complete desperation! There are already \"many\r\nsuicides.\"[42123] At other times, rage predominates and there are riots.\r\nAt Evreux,[42124] Germinal 21, a riot breaks out, owing to the delivery\r\nof only two pounds of flour per head and per week, and because three\r\ndays before, only a pound and a half was delivered. There is a riot at\r\nDieppe,[42125] Prairial 14 and 15, because \"the people are reduced here\r\nto three or four ounces of bread.\" There is another at Vervins, Prairial\r\n9, because the municipality which obtains bread at a cost of seven and\r\neight francs a pound, raises the price from twenty-five to fifty\r\nsous. At Lille, an insurrection breaks out Messidor 4, because the\r\nmunicipality, paying nine francs for bread, can give it to the poor only\r\nfor about twenty and thirty sous.--Lyons, during the month of Nivôse,\r\nremains without bread \"for five full days.\"[42126] At Chartres,\r\nThermidor 15,[42127] the distribution of bread for a month is only eight\r\nounces a day, and there is not enough to keep this up until the 20th of\r\nThermidor. On the fifteenth of Fructidor, La Rochelle writes that \"its\r\npublic distributions, reduced to seven or eight ounces of bread, are on\r\nthe point of failing entirely.\" For four months, at Painboeuf, the ration\r\nis but the quarter of a pound of bread.[42128] And the same at Nantes,\r\nwhich has eighty-two thousand inhabitants and swarms with the wretched;\r\n\"the distribution never exceeded four ounces a day,\" and that only\r\nfor the past year. The same at Rouen, which contains sixty thousand\r\ninhabitants; and, in addition, within the past fortnight the\r\ndistribution has failed three times. In other reports, those who are\r\nwell-off suffer more than the indigent because they take no part in the\r\ncommunal distribution, \"all resources for obtaining food being, so\r\nto say, interdicted to them.\"--Five ounces of bread per diem for four\r\nmonths is the allowance to the forty thousand inhabitants of Caen\r\nand its district.[42129] A great many in the town, as well as in the\r\ncountry, live on bran and wild herbs.\" At the end of Prairial, \"there is\r\nnot a bushel of grain in the town storehouses, while the requisitions,\r\nenforced in the most rigorous and imposing style, produce nothing or\r\nnext to nothing.\" Misery augments from week to week: \"it is impossible\r\nto form any idea of it; the people of Caen live on brown bread and the\r\nblood of cattle. ... Every countenance bears traces of the famine...\r\nFaces are of livid hue.... It is impossible to await the new crop, until\r\nthe end of Fructidor.\"--Such are the exclamations everywhere. The object\r\nnow, indeed, is to cross the narrowest and most terrible defile; a\r\nfortnight more of absolute fasting and hundreds of thousands of lives\r\nwould be sacrificed.[42130] At this moment the government half opens the\r\ndoors of its storehouses; it lends a few sacks of flour on condition\r\nof re-payment,--for example, at Cherbourg a few hundreds of quintals\r\nof oats; by means of oat bread, the poor can subsist until the coming\r\nharvest. But above all, it doubles its guard and shows its bayonets.\r\nAt Nancy, a traveler sees[42131] \"more than three thousand persons\r\nsoliciting in vain for a few pounds of flour.\" They are dispersed with\r\nthe butt-ends of muskets.--Thus are the peasantry taught patriotism and\r\nthe townspeople patience. Physical constraint exercised on all in the\r\nname of all; this is the only procedure which an arbitrary socialism can\r\nresort to for the distribution of food and to discipline starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Misery at Paris.\r\n\r\n     Famine and misery at Paris.--Steps taken by the government\r\n     to feed the capital.--Monthly cost to the Treasury.--Cold\r\n     and hunger in the winter of 1794-1795.--Quality of the\r\n     bread.--Daily rations diminished.--Suffering, especially of\r\n     the populace.--Excessive physical suffering, despair,\r\n     suicides, and deaths from exhaustion in 1795.--Government\r\n     dinners and suppers.--Number of lives lost through want and\r\n     war.--Socialism as applied, and its effects on comfort,\r\n     well-being and mortality.\r\n\r\nAnything that a totalitarian government may do to ensure that the\r\ncapital is supplied with food is undertaken and carried out by this\r\none, for here is its seat, and one more degree of dearth in Paris\r\nwould overthrow it. Each week, on reading the daily reports of its\r\nagents,[42132] it finds itself on the verge of explosion; twice, in\r\nGerminal and Prairial, a popular outbreak does overthrow it for a few\r\nhours, and, if it maintains itself, it is on the condition of\r\neither giving the needy a piece of bread or the hope of getting it.\r\nConsequently, military posts are spaced out around Paris, up to eighteen\r\nleagues off, on all the highways; permanent patrols in correspondence\r\nwith each other to urge on the wagoners and draft relays of horses\r\non the spot. Escorts dispatched from Paris to meet convoys;[42133]\r\nrequisition \"all the carts and all the horses whatever to effect\r\ntransportation in preference to any other work or service.\" All communes\r\ntraversed by a highway are ordered to put rubble and manure on the bad\r\nspots and cover the whole way with a layer of soil, so that the horses\r\nmay drag their loads in spite of the slippery road. The national agents\r\nare ordered to draft the necessary number of men to break the ice\r\naround the water-mills.[42134] A requisition is made for \"all the\r\nbarley throughout the length and breadth of the Republic, \"this must be\r\nutilized to produce \"the mixture for making bread,\" while the brewers\r\nare forbidden to use barley in the manufacture of beer; the starch\r\nmakers are forbidden to convert potatoes into starch, with penalty of\r\ndeath against all offenders \"as destroyers of alimentary produce;\" the\r\nbreweries and starch-factories[42135] are to be closed until further\r\nnotice. Paris must have grain, no matter of what kind, no matter how,\r\nand at any cost, not merely in the following week, but to-morrow, this\r\nvery day, because hunger chews and swallows everything, and it will not\r\nwait.--Once the grain is obtained, a price must be fixed which people\r\ncan pay. Now, the difference between the selling and cost price is\r\nenormous; it keeps on increasing as the assignat declines and it is\r\nthe government which pays this. \"You furnish bread at three sous,\"\r\nsaid Dubois-Crancé, Floréal 16, year III,[42136] \"and it costs you four\r\nfrancs. Paris consumes 8,000 quintals of meal daily, which expenditure\r\nalone amounts to 1,200 millions per annum.\" Seven months later, when\r\na bag of flour brings 13,000 francs, the same expenditure reaches\r\n546 millions per month.--Under the ancient régime, Paris, although\r\novergrown, continued to be an useful organism; if it absorbed much, it\r\nelaborated more; its productiveness compensated for what it consumed,\r\nand, every year, instead of exhausting the public treasury it poured\r\n77 millions into it. The new régime has converted it into a monstrous\r\ncanker in the very heart of France, a devouring parasite which, through\r\nits six hundred thousand leeches, drains its surroundings for a distance\r\nof forty leagues, consumes one-half the annual revenue of the State,\r\nand yet still remains emaciated in spite of the sacrifices made by the\r\ntreasury it depletes and the exhaustion of the provinces which supply it\r\nwith food.\r\n\r\nAlways the same alimentary system, the same long lines of people waiting\r\nat, and before, dawn in every quarter of Paris, in the dark, for a long\r\ntime, and often to no purpose, subject to the brutalities of the strong\r\nand the outrages of the licentious! On the 9th of Thermidor, the daily\r\ntrot of the multitude in quest of food has lasted uninterruptedly for\r\nseventeen months, accompanied with outrages of the worst kind because\r\nthere is less terror and less submissiveness, with more obstinacy\r\nbecause provisions at free sale are dearer, with greater privation\r\nbecause the ration distributed is smaller, and with more sombre despair\r\nbecause each household, having consumed its stores, has nothing of its\r\nown to make up for the insufficiencies of public charity.--And to cap\r\nit all, the winter of 1794-1795 is so cold[42137] that the Seine freezes\r\nand people cross the Loire on foot. Rafts no longer arrive and, to\r\nobtain fire-wood, it is necessary \"to cut down trees at Boulogne,\r\nVincennes, Verrières, St. Cloud, Meudon and two other forests in the\r\nvicinity.\" Fuel costs \"four hundred francs per cord of wood, forty sous\r\nfor a bushel of charcoal, twenty sous for a small basket. The needy are\r\nseen in the streets sawing the wood of their bedsteads to cook with and\r\nto keep from freezing.\" On the resumption of transportation by water\r\namongst the cakes of ice \"rafts are sold as fast as the raftsmen can\r\nhaul the wood out of the water, the people being obliged to pass three\r\nnights at the landing to get it, each in turn according to his number.\"\r\n\"On Pluviôse 3 at least two thousand persons are at the Louviers\r\nlanding,\" each with his card allowing him four sticks at fifteen sous\r\neach. Naturally, there is pulling, hauling, tumult and a rush; \"the\r\ndealers take to flight for fear, and the inspectors come near being\r\nmurdered;\" they get away along with the police commissioner and\r\n\"the public helps itself.\" Likewise, the following day, there is \"an\r\nabominable pillage;\" the gendarmes and soldiers placed there to maintain\r\norder, \"make a rush for the wood and carry it away together with the\r\ncrowd.\" Bear in mind that on this day the thermometer is sixteen degrees\r\nbelow zero, that one hundred, two hundred other lines of people likewise\r\nstand waiting at the doors of bakers and butchers, enduring the same\r\ncold, and that they have already endured it and will yet endure it a\r\nmonth and more. Words are wanting to describe the sufferings of these\r\nlong lines of motionless beings, during the night, at daybreak, standing\r\nthere five or six hours, with the blast driving through their rags and\r\ntheir feet freezing.--Ventôse is beginning, and the ration of bread is\r\nreduced to a pound and a half;[42138] Ventôse ends, and the ration of\r\nbread, kept at a pound and a half for the three hundred and twenty-four\r\nlaborers, falls to one pound; in fact, a great many get none at all,\r\nmany only a half and a quarter of a pound. Germinal follows and the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety, finding that its magazines are giving out,\r\nlimits all rations to a quarter of a pound. Thereupon, on the 12th\r\nof Germinal, an insurrection of workmen and women breaks out; the\r\nConvention is invaded and liberated by military force. Paris is declared\r\nin a state of siege and the government, again in the saddle, tightens\r\nthe reins. Thenceforth, the ration of meat served out every four or five\r\ndays, is a quarter of a pound; bread averages every day, sometimes\r\nfive, sometimes six and sometimes seven ounces, at long intervals eight\r\nounces, often three, two and one ounce and a half, or even none at all;\r\nwhile this bread, black and \"making mischief,\" becomes more and more\r\nworthless and detestable.[42139] People who are well off live on\r\npotatoes, but only for them, for, in the middle of Germinal, these cost\r\nfifteen francs the bushel and, towards the end, twenty francs; towards\r\nthe end of Messidor, forty-five francs; in the first month of the\r\nDirectory, one hundred and eighty francs, and then two hundred\r\nand eighty-four francs, whilst other produce goes up at the same\r\nrates.--After the abolition of the \"maximum\" the evil springs not from\r\na lack of provisions, but from their dearness: the shops are well\r\nsupplied. Whoever comes with a full purse gets what he wants[42140]: The\r\nformer rich, the property owners and large capitalists, may eat on the\r\ncondition that they hand their bundles of assignats over, that they\r\nwithdrawing their last louis from its hiding-place, that they sell\r\ntheir jewelry, clocks, furniture and clothes. And the nouveaux rich,\r\nthe speculators, the suppliers, the happy and extravagant robbers, spend\r\nfour hundred, one thousand, three thousand, then five thousand francs\r\nfor their dinner, and revel in the great eating establishments on fine\r\nwines and exquisite cheer: the burden of the scarcity is transferred to\r\nother shoulders.--At present, the class which suffers, and which suffers\r\nbeyond all bounds of patience is, together with employees and people\r\nwith small incomes,[42141] the crowd of workmen, the City plebeians, the\r\nlow Parisian populace\r\n\r\n* which lives from day to day,\r\n\r\n* which is Jacobin at heart,\r\n\r\n* which made the Revolution in order to better itself,\r\n\r\n* which finds itself worse off,\r\n\r\n* which gets up one insurrection more on the 1st of Prairial,\r\n\r\n* which forcibly enters the Tuileries yelling \"Bread and the\r\nConstitution of '93,\"\r\n\r\n* which installs itself as sovereign in the Convention,\r\n\r\n* which murders the Representative Féraud,\r\n\r\n* which decrees a return to Terror, but which, put down by the National\r\nGuard, disarmed and forced back into lasting obedience, has only to\r\nsubmit to the consequences of its own outrages, the socialism it has\r\nitself instituted and the economical system it itself has organized.\r\n\r\nBecause the workers of Paris have been usurpers and tyrants they are\r\nnow beggars. Owing to the ruin brought on proprietors and capitalists by\r\nthem, individuals can no longer employ them. Owing to the ruin they\r\nhave brought on the Treasury, the State can provide them with only the\r\nsemblance of charity, and hence, while all are compelled to go hungry, a\r\ngreat many die, and many commit suicide.\r\n\r\n* On Germinal 6th, \"Section of the Observatory,\"[42142] at the\r\ndistribution, \"forty-one persons had been without bread; several\r\npregnant women desired immediate confinement so as to destroy their\r\ninfants; others asked for knives to stab themselves.\"\r\n\r\n* On Germinal 8th,\" a large number of persons who had passed the night\r\nat the doors of the bakeries were obliged to leave without getting any\r\nbread.\"\r\n\r\n* On Germinal 24th, \"the police commissioner of the Arsenal section\r\nstates that many become ill for lack of food, and that he buries quite\r\na number.... The same day, he has heard of five or six citizens, who,\r\nfinding themselves without bread, and unable to get other food, throw\r\nthemselves into the Seine.\"\r\n\r\n* Germinal 27, \"the women say that they feel so furious and are in such\r\ndespair on account of hunger and want that they must inevitably commit\r\nsome act of violence.... In the section of 'Les Amis de la Patrie,' one\r\nhalf have no bread.... Three persons tumbled down through weakness on\r\nthe Boulevard du Temple.\"\r\n\r\n* Floréal 2, \"most of the workmen in the 'République' section are\r\nleaving Paris on account of the scarcity of bread.\"\r\n\r\n* Floréal 5, \"eighteen out of twenty-four inspectors state that patience\r\nis exhausted and that things are coming to an end.\"\r\n\r\n* Floréal 14, \"the distribution is always unsatisfactory on account of\r\nthe four-ounce ration; two thirds of the citizens do without it. One\r\nwoman, on seeing the excitement of her husband and her four children who\r\nhad been without bread for two days, trailed through the gutter tearing\r\nher hair and striking her head; she then got up in a state of fury and\r\nattempted to drown herself.\"\r\n\r\n* Floréal 20, \"all exclaim that they cannot live on three ounces of\r\nbread, and, again, of such bad quality. Mothers and pregnant women fall\r\ndown with weakness.\"\r\n\r\n* Floréal 21, \"the inspectors state that they encounter many persons in\r\nthe streets who have fallen through feebleness and inanition.\"\r\n\r\n* Floréal 23, \"a citoyenne who had no bread for her child tied it to her\r\nside and jumped into the river. Yesterday, an individual named Mottez,\r\nin despair through want, cut his throat.\"\r\n\r\n* Floréal 25, \"several persons, deprived of any means of existence,\r\ngave up in complete discouragement, and fell down with weakness and\r\nexhaustion.... In the 'Gravilliers' section, two men were found dead\r\nwith inanition.... The peace officers report the decease of several\r\ncitizens; one cut his throat, while another was found dead in his bed.\"\r\nFloréal 28, \"numbers of people sink down for lack of something to eat;\r\nyesterday, a man was found dead and others exhausted through want.\"\r\n\r\n* Prairial 24, \"Inspector Laignier states that the indigent are\r\ncompelled to seek nourishment in the piles of garbage on the corners.\"\r\n\r\n* Messidor 1,[42143] \"the said Picard fell through weakness at ten\r\no'clock in the morning in the rue de la Loi, and was only brought to\r\nat seven o'clock in the evening; he was carried to the hospital on a\r\nhand-barrow.\"\r\n\r\n* Messidor 11, \"There is a report that the number of people trying to\r\ndrown themselves is so great that the nets at St. Cloud scarcely suffice\r\nto drag them out of the water.\"\r\n\r\n* Messidor 19, \"A man was found on the corner of a street just dead with\r\nhunger.\"\r\n\r\n* Messidor 27, \"At four o'clock in the afternoon, Place Maubert, a man\r\nnamed Marcelin, employed in the Jardin des Plantes, fell down through\r\nstarvation and died while assistance was being given to him.\" On the\r\nprevious evening, the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille, a\r\nlaborer on the Pont-au-Change, says \"I have eaten nothing all day.\r\n''Another replies: \"I have not been home because I have nothing to give\r\nto my wife and children, dying with hunger.\" About the same date, a\r\nfriend of Mallet-Dupan writes to him \"that he is daily witness to people\r\namongst the lower classes dying of inanition in the streets; others, and\r\nprincipally women, have nothing but garbage to live on, scraps of refuse\r\nvegetables and the blood running out of the slaughter houses. Laborers,\r\ngenerally, work on short time on account of their lack of strength and\r\nof their exhaustion for want of food.\"[42144]--\r\n\r\nThus ends the rule of the Convention. Well has it looked out for the\r\ninterests of the poor! According to the reports of its own inspectors,\r\n\"famished stomachs on all sides cry vengeance, beat to arms and sound\r\nthe tocsin of alarm[42145].... Those who have to dwell daily on the\r\nsacrifices they make to keep themselves alive declare that there is\r\nno hope except in death.\" Are they going to be relieved by the new\r\ngovernment which the Convention imposes on them with thunders of\r\nartillery and in which it perpetuates itself?[42146]--\r\n\r\n* Brumaire 28, \"Most of the workmen in the 'Temple' and 'Gravilliers'\r\nsections have done no work for want of bread.\"\r\n\r\n* Brumaire 24, \"Citizens of all classes refuse to mount guard because\r\nthey have nothing to eat.\"\r\n\r\n* Brumaire 25, \"In the 'Gravilliers' section the women say that\r\nthey have sold all that they possessed, while others, in the\r\n'Faubourg-Antoine' section, declare that it would be better to be shot\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n* Brumaire 30, \"A woman beside herself came and asked a baker to kill\r\nher children as she had nothing to give them to eat.\"\r\n\r\n* Frimaire 1, 2, 3, and 4, \"In many of the sections bread is given out\r\nonly in the evening, in others at one o'clock in the morning, and of\r\nvery poor quality.... Several sections yesterday had no bread.\"\r\n\r\n* Frimaire 7, the inspectors declare that \"the hospitals soon will not\r\nbe vast enough to hold the sick and the wretched.\"\r\n\r\n* Frimaire 14, At the central market a woman nursing her child sunk down\r\nwith inanition.\" A few days before this, \"a man fell down from weakness,\r\non his way to Bourg l'Abbé.\"\r\n\r\n\"All our reports,\" say the district administrators, \"resound with\r\nshrieks of despair.\" People are infatuated; \"it seems to us that a crazy\r\nspirit prevails universally, we often encounter people in the street\r\nwho, although alone, gesticulate and talk to themselves aloud.\" \"How\r\nmany times,\" writes a Swiss traveller,[42147] who lived in Paris during\r\nthe latter half of 1795, \"how often have I chanced to encounter men\r\nsinking through starvation, scarcely able to stand up against a post,\r\nor else down on the ground and unable to get up for want of strength!\"\r\nA journalist states that he saw \"within ten minutes, along the street,\r\nseven poor creatures fall on account of hunger, a child die on its\r\nmother's breast which was dry of milk, and a woman struggling with a dog\r\nnear a sewer to get a bone away from him.\"[42148] Meissner never leaves\r\nhis hotel without filling his pockets with pieces of the national bread.\r\n\"This bread,\" he says, \"which the poor would formerly have despised,\r\nI found accepted with the liveliest gratitude, and by well educated\r\npersons;\" the lady who contended with the dog for the bone was a former\r\nnun, without either parents or friends and everywhere repulsed.\" \"I\r\nstill hear with a shudder,\" says Meissner, \"the weak, melancholy voice\r\nof a well-dressed woman who stopped me in the rue du Bac, to tell me in\r\naccents indicative both of shame and despair: 'Ah, Sir, do help me! I am\r\nnot an outcast. I have some talent--you may have seen some of my works\r\nin the salon. I have had nothing to eat for two days and I am crazy for\r\nwant of food.'\" Again, in June, 1796, the inspectors state that despair\r\nand despondency have reached the highest point, only one cry being\r\nheard-misery!.... Our reports all teem with groans and complaints.. ..\r\nPallor and suffering are stamped on all faces.... Each day presents a\r\nsadder and more melancholy aspect.\" And repeatedly,[42149] they sum up\r\ntheir scattered observations in a general statement:\r\n\r\n* \"A mournful silence, the deepest distress on every countenance;\r\n\r\n* the most intense hatred of the government in general developed in all\r\nconversations;\r\n\r\n* contempt for all existing authority;\r\n\r\n* an insolent luxuriousness, insulting to the wretchedness of the poor\r\nrentiers who expire with hunger in their garrets, no longer possessing\r\nthe courage to crawl to the Treasury and get the wherewithal to prolong\r\ntheir misery for a few days;\r\n\r\n* the worthy father of a family daily deciding what article of furniture\r\nhe will sell to make up for what is lacking in his wages that he may buy\r\na half-pound of bread;\r\n\r\n* every sort of provision increasing in price sixty times an hour;\r\n\r\n* the smallest business dependent on the fall of assignats;\r\n\r\n* intriguers of all parties overthrowing each other only to get offices;\r\n\r\n* the intoxicated soldier boasting of the services he has rendered\r\nand is to render, and abandoning himself shamelessly to every sort of\r\ndebauchery;\r\n\r\n* commercial houses transformed into dens of thieves;\r\n\r\n* rascals become traders and traders become rascals; the most sordid\r\ncupidity and a mortal egoism--such is the picture presented by\r\nParis.\"[42150]\r\n\r\nOne group is wanting in this picture, that of the governors who preside\r\nover this wretchedness, which group remains in the background; one might\r\nsay that it was so designed and composed by some great artist, a lover\r\nof contrasts, an inexorable logician, whose invisible hand traces human\r\ncharacter unvaryingly, and whose mournful irony unfailingly depicts\r\nside by side, in strong relief, the grotesqueness of folly and the\r\nseriousness of death. How many perished on account of this misery?\r\nProbably more than a million persons.[42151]--\r\n\r\nTry to take in at a glance the extraordinary spectacle presented on\r\ntwenty-six thousand square leagues of territory:\r\n\r\n* The immense multitude of the starving in town and country,\r\n\r\n* the long lines of women for three years waiting for bread in all the\r\ncities,\r\n\r\n* this or that town of twenty-three thousand souls in which one-third of\r\nthe population dies in the hospitals in three months,\r\n\r\n* the crowds of paupers at the poor-houses,\r\n\r\n* the file of poor wretches entering and the file of coffins going out,\r\n\r\n* the asylums deprived of their property, overcrowded with the sick,\r\nunable to feed the multitude of foundlings pining away in their cradles\r\nthe very first week, their little faces in wrinkles like those of old\r\nmen,\r\n\r\n* the malady of want aggravating all other maladies, the long suffering\r\nof a persistent vitality amidst pain and which refuses to succumb, the\r\nfinal death-rattle in a garret or in a ditch.\r\n\r\nContrast this with this the small, powerful, triumphant group of\r\nJacobins which, having understood how to place themselves in the good\r\nplaces, is determined to stay there at any cost.--About ten o'clock in\r\nthe morning,[42152] Cambacérès, president of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety, is seen entering its hall in the Pavillon de l'Egalité. He is\r\na large, cautious and shrewd personage who will, later on, become\r\narch-chancellor of the Empire and famous for his epicurean inventions\r\nand other peculiar tastes revived from antiquity. Scarcely seated, he\r\norders an ample pat-au-feu to be placed on the chimney hearth and, on\r\nthe table, \"fine wine and fine white bread; three articles,\" says a\r\nguest, \"not to be found elsewhere in all Paris.\" Between twelve and two\r\no'clock, his colleagues enter the room in turn, take a plate of soup\r\nand a slice of meat, swallow some wine, and then proceed, each to his\r\nbureau, to receive his coterie, giving this one an office and compelling\r\nanother to pay up, looking all the time after his own special interests.\r\nAt this moment, especially, towards the close of the Convention, there\r\nare no public interests, all interests being private and personal.--In\r\nthe mean time, the deputy in charge of provisions, Roux de la Haute\r\nMarne, an unfrocked Benedictine, formerly a terrorist in the provinces,\r\nsubsequently the protégé and employee of Fouché, with whom he is to be\r\nassociated in the police department, keeps the throng of women in\r\ncheck which daily resorts to the Tuileries to beg for bread. He is well\r\nadapted for this duty, being tall, chubby, ornamental, and with vigorous\r\nlungs. He has taken his office in the right place, in the attic of the\r\npalace, at the top of long, narrow and steep stairs, so that the line\r\nof women stretching up between the two walls, piled one above the other,\r\nnecessarily becomes immovable. With the exception of the two or three at\r\nthe front, no one has her hands free to grab the haranguer by the throat\r\nand close the oratorical stop-cock. He can spout his tirades accordingly\r\nwith impunity, and for an indefinite time. On one occasion, his sonorous\r\njabber rattles away uninterruptedly from the top to the bottom of the\r\nstaircase, from nine o'clock in the morning to five o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. Under such a voluble shower, his hearers become weary and end\r\nby going home.--About nine or ten o'clock in the evening, the Committee\r\nof Public Safety reassembles, but not to discuss business. Danton and La\r\nRévellière preach in vain; each is too egoistic and too worn-out; they\r\nlet the rein slacken on Cambacérès. As to him, he would rather keep\r\nquiet and drag the cart no longer; but there are two things necessary\r\nwhich he must provide for on pain of death.--\"It will not do,\" says he\r\nin plaintive tones, \"to keep on printing the assignats at night which we\r\nwant for the next day. If that lasts, ma foi, we run the risk of being\r\nstrung up at a lantern...Go and find Hourier-Eloi, as he has charge of\r\nthe finances, and tell him that we entreat him to keep us a-going for\r\na fortnight or eighteen days longer, when the executive Directory will\r\ncome in and do what it pleases.\" \"But food--shall we have enough for\r\nto-morrow?\r\n\r\n\"Aha, I don't know--I'll send for our colleague Roux, who will post us\r\non that point.\" Roux enters, the official spokesman, the fat, jovial\r\ntamer of the popular dog. \"Well, Roux, how do we stand about supplying\r\nParis with food?\" \"The supply, citizen President, is just as abundant as\r\never, two ounces per head,--at least for most of the sections.\" \"Go to\r\nthe devil with your abundant supply! You'll have our heads off!\" All\r\nremain silent, for this possible dénouement sets them to thinking. Then,\r\none of them exclaims: \"President, are there any refreshments provided\r\nfor us? After working so hard for so many days we need something to\r\nstrengthen us!\" \"Why, yes; there is a good calf's-tongue, a large\r\nturbot, a large piece of pie and some other things.\" They cheer up,\r\nbegin to eat and drink champagne, and indulge in drolleries.

I.\r\nWherever I have compared the mortality of the Revolution with that of\r\nthe ancient regime I have found the former greater than the latter,\r\neven in those parts of France not devastated by the civil war; and the\r\nincrease of this mortality is enormous, especially in years II. and\r\nIII.--At Troyes, with 25,282 inhabitants (in 1790), during the five\r\nyears of 1786, 1787, 1788, 1789 and 1792 (1790 and 1791 are missing),\r\nthe average annual mortality is 991 deaths, or 39 per thousand\r\ninhabitants; during the years II, III, IV, this average is 1,166 or 47\r\nper thousand inhabitants; the increase is then 7 deaths per year, nearly\r\none fifth. (Documents provided by M. Albert Babeau.)--At Rheims, the\r\naverage mortality from 1780 to 1789 is 1,350, which, for a population of\r\n35,597, (1790), gives 41 deaths per annum to every thousand inhabitants.\r\nIn the year II., there are 1,836 deaths which gives for each of the two\r\nyears 64 deaths to every thousand persons; the increase is 23 deaths\r\na year, that is to say more than one-half above the ordinary rate.\r\n(Statistics communicated by M. Jadart, archiviste at Rheims.)--At\r\nLimoges, the yearly average of mortality previous to 1789 was 825 to\r\n20,000 inhabitants, or at the rate of 41 to a thousand. From January 1,\r\n1792, to September 22, 1794, there are 3,449 deaths, that is to say, a\r\nyearly average of 63 deaths to one thousand inhabitants, that is to say,\r\n22 extra per annum, while the mortality bears mostly on the poor, for\r\nout of 2,073 persons who die between January 17, 1793, and September\r\n22, 1794, over one-half, 1,100, die in the hospital.--(Louis Guibert,\r\n\"Ancien registre des paroisses de Limoges,\" pp. 40, 45, 47.)--At\r\nPoitiers, in year IX., the population is 18,223, and the average\r\nmortality of the past ten years was 724 per annum. But in year\r\nII., there are 2,094 deaths, and in year III. 2,032, largely in the\r\nhospitals. Thus, even on comparing the average mortality of the ten\r\nyears of the Revolution with the mortality of years II. and III., the\r\naverage rate has almost trebled.--The same applies to Loudens, where the\r\naverage death-rate being 151, in year II., it rises to 425. Instead\r\nof the triple for Chatellerault, it is double, where, the average rate\r\nbeing 262, the death-rate rises to 482, principally in the military\r\nhospitals. (\"Statistique de la Vienne,\" by Cochon, préfet, year\r\nIX.)--At Niort, population 11,000, the annual mortality of the ten years\r\npreceding 1793 averaged 423, or 38 per thousand. In year II., there\r\nare 1,872, or 170 per thousand inhabitants, the number being more than\r\nquadrupled. In year III., there are 1,122 deaths, or 122, which is\r\nalmost the triple. (\"Statistique des Deux-Sèvres,\" by Dupin, prefet, 2nd\r\nmemorial, year IX.)--At Strasbourg, (\"Recueil des Pièces Authentiques,\"\r\netc., vol. I., p.32, declaration of the Municipality,) \"twice as\r\nmany died last year (year II.) as during any of the preceding\r\nyears.\"--According to these figures and the details we have read, the\r\nannual mortality during years II. and III. and most of year IV., may\r\nbe estimated as having increased one-half extra. Now, previous to 1789,\r\naccording to Moheau and Necker, (Peuchet, \"Statistique elementaire de la\r\nFrance,\" 1805, p.239,) the yearly mortality in France was one person\r\nto every thirty, that is to say, 866,666 deaths to a population of 26\r\nmillions. One-half in addition to this for two and a half years gives,\r\nconsequently, one million and eighty thousand deaths.]\r\n\r\n2nd. During the whole of the Directory episode, privation lasted and\r\nthe rate of mortality rose very high, especially for sick children,\r\nthe infirm and the aged, because the convention had confiscated the\r\npossessions of the hospitals and public charity was almost null. For\r\nexample, at Lyons, \"The Asylums having been deprived of sisters of\r\ncharity during years II., III. and IV., and most of year V., the\r\nchildren gathered into them could neither be fed nor suckled and\r\nthe number that perished was frightful.\" (\"Statistique du Rhone,\" by\r\nVernier, prefet, year X.)--In Necker's time, there were about eight\r\nhundred asylums, hospitals and charitable institutions, with one hundred\r\nthousand or one hundred and ten thousand inmates. (Peuchet, ibid., 256.)\r\nFor lack of care and food they die in myriads, especially foundlings,\r\nthe number of which increases enormously: in 1790, the figures do not\r\nexceed 23,000; in year IX., the number surpasses 62,000, (Peuchet, 260):\r\n\"It is a 'perfect deluge,'\" say the reports; in the department of Aisne,\r\nthere are 1,097 instead of 400; in that of Lot-et-Garonne, fifteen\r\nhundred, (Statistiques des préfets de l'Aisne, Gers, Lot-et-Garonne),\r\nand they are born only to die. In that of Eure, after a few months, it\r\nis six out of seven; at Lyons, 792 out of 820; (Statistique des Prefets\r\ndu Rhone et de l'Eure). At Marseilles, it is ´600 out of 618; at Toulon,\r\n101 out of 104; in the average, 19 out of 20. (Rocquam, \"Etat de France\r\nau 18e Brumaire,\" p.33. Report of François de Nantes.) At Troyes, out of\r\n164 brought in in year IV., 134 die; out of 147 received in year VII.,\r\n136 die. (Albert Babeau, II., 452.) At Paris, in year IV., out of 3,122\r\ninfants received 2,907 perish. (Moniteur, year V., No. 231.)--The sick\r\nperish the same. \"At Toulon, only seven pounds of meat are given each\r\nday to eighty patients; I saw in the civil Asylum,\" says François de\r\nNantes, \"a woman who had just undergone a surgical operation to whom\r\nthey gave for a restorative a dozen beans on a wooden platter.\" (Ibid.,\r\n16, 31, and passim, especially for Bordeaux, Caen, Alençon, St.\r\nLô, etc.)--As to beggars, these are innumerable: in year IX., it is\r\nestimated that there are 3 or 4,000 by department, at least 300,000 in\r\nFrance. \"In the four Brittany departments one can truly say that a third\r\nof the population live at the expense of the other two-thirds, either by\r\nstealing from them or through compelling assistance.\" (Rocquain, \"Report\r\nby Barbé-Marbois,\" p.93.)]\r\n\r\n3rd. In year IX., the Consells-generaux are called upon to ascertain\r\nwhether the departments have increased or diminished in population since\r\n1789. (\"Analyse des procés-verbaux des Conseils-Generaux de l'an XI.\" In\r\nfour volumes.) Out of 58 which reply, 37 state that the population\r\nwith them has diminished; 12, that it has increased; 9, that it remains\r\nstationary. Of the 22 others, 13 attribute the maintenance or increase\r\nof population, at least for the most part, to the multiplication of\r\nearly marriages in order to avoid conscription and to the large number\r\nof natural children.--Consequently, the average rate of population is\r\nkept up not through preserving life, but through the substitution of new\r\nlives for the old ones that are sacrificed. Bordeaux, nevertheless,\r\nlost one-tenth of its population, Angers one-eighth, Pau one-seventh,\r\nChambery one-fourth, Rennes one-third. In the departments where the\r\ncivil-war was carried on, Argenton-Château lost two-thirds of its\r\npopulation, Bressuire fell from 3,000 to 630 inhabitants; Lyons,\r\nafter the siege, fell from a population of 140,000 thousand to 80,000.\r\n(\"Analyse des procés-verbaux des Conseils-Generaux\" and Statistiques des\r\nPrefets.\")]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42152: Lareveillère-Lepeaux, \"Mémoires.\" I, 248. (He belongs\r\nto the Committee and is an eye-witness.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH. THE END OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Convention.\r\n\r\n     The Convention after Thermidor 9.--Reaction against the\r\n     Terrorists.--Aversion to the Constitutionalists.--The danger\r\n     they run if they lose power.\r\n\r\nNevertheless they too, these glutted sovereigns, are anxious, and very\r\nmuch so, we have just seen why; it's a question of remaining in office\r\nin order to remain alive, and henceforth this is their sole concern.--A\r\ngood Jacobin, up to the 9th of Thermidor, could, by shutting his eyes,\r\nstill believe in his creed.[5101] After the 9th of Thermidor,\r\nunless born blind, like Soubrany, Romme and Goujon, a fanatic whose\r\nintellectual organs are as rigid as the limbs of a fakir, nobody in the\r\nConvention can any longer believe in the Contrat-Social, in a despotic\r\nequalizing socialism, in the merits of Terror, in the divine right of\r\nthe pure. For, to escape the guillotine of the pure, the purest had to\r\nbe guillotined, Saint-Just, Couthon and Robespierre, the high-priest of\r\nthe sect. That very day the \"Montagnards,\" in giving up their doctor,\r\nabandoned their principles, and there is no longer any principle or\r\nman to which the Convention could rally. In effect, before guillotining\r\nRobespierre and his associates as orthodox, it guillotined the\r\nGirondins, Hébert and Danton, as heretics. Now, \"the existence of\r\npopular idols and of head charlatans is irrevocably ended.\"[5102]\r\nEver the same conventional symbol before the empty sanctuary in the\r\nblood-stained temple, and ever the same loud-intoned anthem; but faith\r\nis gone, and only the acolytes remain to drone out the revolutionary\r\nlitany, old train-bearers and swingers of incense, the subaltern\r\nbutchers who, through a sudden stroke, have become pontiffs; in short,\r\nthe valets of the church who have donned the mitres and croziers of\r\ntheir masters after having assassinated them.\r\n\r\nFrom month to month, under the pressure of public opinion, they detach\r\nthemselves from the worship at which they have officiated, for, however\r\nblunted or perverted their consciences, they cannot avoid admitting that\r\nJacobinism, as they have practiced it, was the religion of robbery and\r\nmurder. Previous to Thermidor an official phraseology[5103] drowned with\r\nits doctrinal roar the living truth, while each Conventional sacristan\r\nor beadle, confined to his own chapel, saw clearly only the human\r\nsacrifices in which he himself had taken part. After Thermidor, the\r\nfriends and kindred of the dead, the oppressed, make their voices heard,\r\nand he is forced to see collectively and in detail all the crimes to\r\nwhich, nearly or remotely, he has contributed either through his assent\r\nor through his vote, the same as in Mexico, the priest of Huichilobos\r\nwalks about in the midst of the six hundred thousand skulls amassed in\r\nthe vaults of his temple.--In quick succession, during the whole of year\r\nIII., through the freedom of the press and the great public discussions,\r\nthe truth becomes known. First, comes an account of the funereal\r\njourney of one hundred and thirty-two Nantese, dragged from Nantes to\r\nParis,[5104] and the solemn acquittal, received with transports, of\r\nthe ninety-four who survive. After this, come the trials of the most\r\nprominent terrorists, that of Carrier and the Revolutionary Committee of\r\nNantes, that of Fouquier-Tinville and the old revolutionary Tribunal\r\nof Paris, that of Joseph Lebon,[5105] and, during thirty or forty\r\nconsecutive sessions, hundreds of minute, verified depositions ending\r\nin the most complete and satisfactory testimony.--In the mean time,\r\nrevelations multiply at the tribune of the Convention; these consist of\r\nthe letters of the new representatives on mission and the denunciations\r\nof the towns against their overthrown tyrants; against Maignet,\r\nDartigoyte, Piochefer-Bernard, Levasseur, Crassous, Javogues, Lequinio,\r\nLefiot, Piorry, Pinet, Monestier, Fouché, Laplanche, Lecarpentier,\r\nand many others. Add to these the reports of commissions charged\r\nwith examining into the conduct of old dictators, Collot d'Herbois,\r\nBillaud-Varennes, Barère, Amar, Vouland, Vadier and David, the reports\r\nof the representatives charged with investigating certain details of the\r\nabolished system, that of Grégoire on revolutionary vandalism, that\r\nof Cambon on revolutionary taxes, that of Courtois on Robespierre's\r\npapers.--All these rays combine in a terrible illumination which imposes\r\nitself even on the eyes that turn away from it: It is now but too plain\r\nthat France, for fourteen months, has been devastated by a gang of\r\nbandits. All that can be said in favor of the least perverted and the\r\nleast vile is that they were born so, or had become crazy.[5106]--The\r\nmajority of the Convention cannot evade this growing testimony and the\r\nMontagnards excite its horror; and all the more, because it bears them\r\na grudge: the 73 who were imprisoned and the sixteen who were proscribed\r\nhave resumed their seats, the 400 silent who have for so long held their\r\nseats under the knife, remember the oppression to which they have\r\nbeen subject. They now recover and turn first against the most\r\ntainted scoundrels, and then against the members of the old\r\ncommittees.--Whereupon the \"Mountain,\" as was its custom, launches its\r\ncustomary supporters, the starved populace, the Jacobin rabble, in the\r\nriots of Germinal and Prairial, in year III., and proclaims anew the\r\nreign of Terror; the Convention again sees the knife over its head.\r\nSaved by young men, by the National Guard, it becomes courageous through\r\nfear, and, in its turn, it terrorizes the terrorists. The Faubourg\r\nSaint-Antoine is disarmed, ten thousand Jacobins are arrested,[5107]\r\nand more than sixty Montagnards are decreed under indictment; Collot,\r\nBillaud, Barère and Vadier are to be deported; nine other members\r\nof former committees are to be imprisoned. The last of the veritable\r\nfanatics, Romme, Goujon, Soubrany, Duquesnoy, Bourbotte and Duroy are\r\ncondemned to death, Immediately after the sentence five of them stab\r\nthemselves on the stairs of the tribunal; two of the wounded who survive\r\nare borne, along with the sixth, to the scaffold and guillotined. Two\r\nMontagnards of the same stamp, Rhul and Maure, kill themselves before\r\ntheir sentence.--Henceforth the purged Convention regards itself as\r\npure; its final rigor has expiated its former baseness, the guilty blood\r\nwhich it spills washing away the stains of the innocent blood it had\r\nshed before.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in condemning the terrorists, it pronounced its own\r\ncondemnation; for it has authorized and sanctioned all their crimes. On\r\nits benches, in its committees, often in the president's chair, at\r\nthe head of the ruling coterie, still figure the members of the\r\nrevolutionary government, many of the avowed terrorists like Bourdon\r\nde l'Oise, Bentabolle, Delmas, and Reubell; presidents of the September\r\ncommune like Marie Chénier; those who carried out \"the 31st of May,\"\r\nlike Legendre and Merlin de Douai, author of the decree which created\r\nsix hundred thousand suspects in France; provincial executioners of\r\nthe most brutal and most ferocious sort, the greatest and most\r\ncynical robbers like André Dumont, Fréron, Tallien and Barras. Under\r\nRobespierre, the four hundred mutes \"du ventre\" were the reporters,\r\nthe voters, the claqueurs, and the agents of the worst decrees against\r\nreligion, property and persons. The foundations of Terror were all laid\r\nby the seventy-three in confinement before they were imprisoned, and by\r\nthe sixteen who were proscribed before their proscription. Excepting\r\nten or a dozen who stayed away, the Convention, in a mass, pronounced\r\njudgment against the King and declared him guilty; more than one-half of\r\nthe Convention, the Girondists at the head of them, voted his death.\r\nThe hall does not contain fifty honorable men in whom character sustains\r\nconscience, and who had a right to carry their heads erect.[5108] In no\r\nlaw they passed, good or bad, did the other seven hundred have in view\r\nthe interests of their constituents. In all their laws, good or bad,\r\nthey solely regarded their own interests. So long as the attacks of the\r\n\"Mountain\" and of the rabble affected the public only, they lauded them,\r\ndecreed them and had them executed. If they finally rebelled against\r\nthe \"Mountain,\" and against the rabble, it was at the last moment,\r\nand solely to save their lives. Before, as after the 9th of Thermidor,\r\nbefore, as after the 1st of Prairial, the incentives of the conduct of\r\nthese pusillanimous oppressors or involuntary liberators were baseness\r\nand egoism. Hence, \"the contempt and horror universally poured out\r\nagainst them; only Jacobins could be still more odious!\"[5109] If\r\nfurther support is given to these faithless mandatories, it is because\r\nthey are soon to be put out. On the premature report that the\r\nConvention is going to break up, people accost each other in the street,\r\nexclaiming, \"We are rid of these brigands, they are going at last...\r\nPeople caper and dance about as if they could not repress their joy;\r\nthey talk of nothing but the boy, (Louis XVIII. confined in the Temple),\r\nand the new elections. Everybody agrees on excluding the present\r\ndeputies.... There is less discussion on the crimes which each has\r\ncommitted than on the insignificance of the entire assemblage, while the\r\nepithets of vicious, used up and corrupt have almost wholly given way to\r\nthieves and scoundrels.\"[5110] Even in Paris, during the closing months\r\nof their rule, they hardly dare appear in public: \"in the dirtiest and\r\nmost careless costume which the tricolor scarf and gold fringe makes\r\nmore apparent, they try to escape notice in the crowd[5111] and, in\r\nspite of their modesty, do not always avoid insult and still less the\r\nmaledictions of those who pass them.\"--In the provinces, at home, it\r\nwould be worse for them; their lives would be in danger; in any event,\r\nthey would be dragged through the gutter, and this they know. Save about\r\n\"twenty of them,\" all who are not to succeed in entering the new\r\nCorps Legislatif, will intrigue for offices in Paris and become \"state\r\nmessengers, employees in bureaux, and ushers to ministers;\" in default\r\nof other places they would accept those of \"hall-sweeps.\" Any refuge\r\nfor them is good against the reprobation of the public, which is already\r\nrising and submerging them under its tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Re-election of the Two-thirds.\r\n\r\n     Decrees for the re-election of the Two-thirds.--Small number\r\n     of Voters.--Maneuvers for preventing electors from voting on\r\n     the decrees.--Frauds in the returns of votes.--Maintenance\r\n     of the decrees by force.--Recruiting of the Roughs.--The\r\n     military employed.--The 13th of Vendémaire.\r\n\r\nThere is no other refuge for them except in supreme power, and no other\r\nmeans for maintaining this but in the excesses of despotism, dishonesty,\r\nmendacity and violence. In the Constitution they manufacture, they\r\ndesire to remain the sovereigns of France and they decree[5112] at\r\nonce that, willingly or not, France must select two-thirds of its\r\nnew representatives from amongst them, and, that she may make a good\r\nselection, it is prudent to impose the selection upon her. There is a\r\nshow, indeed, of consulting her in the special decrees which deprive her\r\nof two-thirds of her elective rights but, as in 1792 and in 1793, it\r\nis so contrived that she consents, or seems to consent, to this\r\narrangement.[5113]--In the first place, they relied on the majority of\r\nelectors abstaining from a response. Experience indeed, had shown that,\r\nfor a long time, the masses were disgusted with the plebiscite farces;\r\nmoreover, terror has stifled in individuals all sentiment of a common\r\ninterest;[5114] each cares for himself alone. Since Thermidor, electors\r\nand mayors in the boroughs and in the rural districts are found with a\r\ngood deal of difficulty, even electors of the second degree; people\r\nsaw that it was useless and even dangerous to perform the duties of\r\na citizen; they would have nothing to do with public functions. A\r\nforeigner writes,[5115] after traversing France from Bourg-en-Bresse to\r\nParis: \"Ninety times out of a hundred that I have asked the question,\r\n\r\n'Citizen, what was done in the primary meeting of your canton?'\r\n\r\nthe answer would be:\r\n\r\n'Me, citizen, what have I to do with it? I' faith, they had hard work to\r\nagree!'\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n'What's the use? There were not many there! Honest folks stayed at\r\nhome.'\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, out of at least six million electors convoked, five millions\r\ndo not come near the ballot-box, there being no embarrassment in this\r\nmatter as they do not vote.[5116]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, precautions have been taken to prevent those who\r\ncome to vote on the Constitution from entertaining the idea of voting on\r\nthe decrees. No article of the Constitution, nor in the decrees, calls\r\nupon them to do so; slight inducement is held out to them to come, in\r\na vague style, through an oratorical interrogation, or in a tardy\r\naddress.[5117]--In addition to this, on the printed blanks sent to them\r\nfrom Paris, they find but three columns, one for the number of votes\r\naccepting the Constitution, another for the number rejecting it, and\r\nthe third for \"written observations\" in case there are any. There are no\r\nspecial columns for marking the number of votes accepting or rejecting\r\nthe decrees. Thereupon, many illiterate or ill-informed electors might\r\nthink that they were convoked to vote solely on the Constitution and not\r\nat all on the decrees, which is just what happened, and especially in\r\nthe remote departments, and in the rural assemblies. Moreover, many\r\nassemblies, nearer Paris and in the towns, comprehend that if the\r\nConvention consults them it is only for form's sake; to give a negative\r\nanswer is useless and perilous; it is better to keep silent; as soon as\r\nthe decrees are mentioned they very prudently \"unanimously\" demand the\r\norder of the day.[5118] Hence out of five primary assemblies on the\r\naverage which vote for or against the Constitution, there is only one\r\nwhich votes for or against the decrees.[5119]--Such is the mode of\r\ngetting at the voice of the nation. Apparently, it is induced to speak;\r\nin practice, its silence is ensured.\r\n\r\nThe last and most ingenious expedient of all: when a primary assembly\r\nspeaks too loudly it is taken for granted that it kept silent. In Paris,\r\nwhere the electors are more clear sighted and more decided than in the\r\nprovinces, in eighteen well-known departments, and probably in many\r\nothers, the electors who voted on the decrees almost all voted against\r\nthem; in many cases, even their minutes state that the negative vote was\r\n\"unanimous,\" but the minutes fail to state the exact number of the noes.\r\nOn this, in the total of noes hostile to the decrees, these noes are not\r\ncounted.[5120] Through this trickery, the Convention, in Paris alone,\r\nreduced the number of negatives by 50,000 and the same in the provinces,\r\nafter the fashion of a dishonest steward who, obliged to hand in\r\nan account, falsifies the figures by substituting subtractions for\r\nadditions.-Such is the way, in relation to the decrees, in which, out of\r\nthe 300,000 votes which it accepts, it is able to announce 200,000\r\nyeas and 100,000 noes and thus proclaim that its master, the sovereign\r\npeople, after giving it a general acquittance, a discharge in full,\r\ninvests it anew with its confidence and expressly continues its mandate.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to keep by force this power usurped by\r\nfraud.--Immediately after the suppression of the Jacobin riots the\r\nConvention, menaced on the right, turns over to the left; it requires\r\nallies, persons of executive ability. It takes them wherever it can find\r\nthem, from the faction which decimated it before Thermidor and which,\r\nsince Thermidor, it decimates. Consequently, its executive committee\r\nsuspends all proceedings begun against the principal \"Montagnards;\" a\r\nnumber of terrorists, former presidents of the sections, \"the matadors\r\nof the quarter,\" arrested after Prairial 1, are set free at the end of a\r\nmonth. They have good arms, are accustomed to vigorous striking without\r\ngiving warning, especially when honest folks are to be knocked down or\r\nripped open. The stronger public opinion is against the government the\r\nmore does the government rely on men with bludgeons and pikes, on\r\nthe strikers \"turned out of the primary assemblies,\" on the heroes\r\nof September 2 and May 31, dangerous nomads, inmates of Bicêtre,\r\npaid assassins out of employment, and roughs of the Quinze-Vingts and\r\nfaubourg Saint--Antoine.[5121] Finally on the 11th of Vendémiaire, it\r\ngathers together fifteen or eighteen hundred of them and arms them in\r\nbattalions.[5122] Such brigands are they, that Menon, \"major-general of\r\nthe army of the interior and commandant of the armed force of Paris,\"\r\ncomes the next day with several of his staff-officers and tells the\r\nCommittee of Five that he \"will not have such bandits in his army nor\r\nunder his orders\". \"I will not march with a lot of rascals and assassins\r\norganized in battalions \"under the name of \"patriots of '89.\" Indeed,\r\nthe true patriots of '89 are on the other side, the constitutionalists\r\nof 1791, sincere liberals, \"forty thousand proprietors and merchants,\"\r\nthe elite and mass of the Parisian population,[5123] \"the majority of\r\nmen really interested in public matters,\" and at this moment, the common\r\nwelfare is all that concerns them. Republic or royalty is merely\r\na secondary thought, an idea in the back-ground; nobody dreams of\r\nrestoring the ancient régime; but very few are preoccupied with the\r\nrestoration of a limited monarchy.[5124] \"On asking those most in\r\nearnest what government they would like in place of the Convention, they\r\nreply 'We want that no longer, we want nothing belonging to it; we want\r\nthe Republic and honest people for our rulers.'\"[5125]--That is all;\r\ntheir uprisal is not a political insurrection against the form of the\r\ngovernment, but a moral insurrection against the criminals in office.\r\nHence, on seeing the Convention arm their old executioners, \"the tigers\"\r\nof the Reign of Terror, admitted malefactors, against them, they cannot\r\ncontain themselves.[5126] \"That day,\" says a foreigner, who visited\r\nmany public places in Paris, \"I saw everywhere the deepest despair, the\r\ngreatest expression of rage and fury.... Without that unfortunate order\r\nthe insurrection would probably not have broken out.\" If they take\r\nup arms it is because they are brought back under the pikes of the\r\nSeptembriseurs, and under Robespierre's axe.--But they are only national\r\nguards; most of them have no guns;[5127] they are in want of gunpowder,\r\nthose who have any having only five or six charges; \"the great majority\r\ndo not think of fighting;\" they imagine that \"their presence is merely\r\nneeded to enforce a petition;\" they have no artillery, no positive\r\nleader; it is simply excitement, precipitation, disorder and mistaken\r\nmaneuvers.[5128] On the contrary, on the side of the Convention, with\r\nHenriot's old bullies, there are eight or nine thousand regular troops,\r\nand Bonaparte; his cannon, which rake the rue Saint Honoré and the Quai\r\nVoltaire, mow down five or six hundred sectionists. The rest disperse,\r\nand henceforth the check-mated Parisians are not to take up their guns\r\nagainst the Jacobin faction whatever it does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. A Directory of Regicides.\r\n\r\n     The Directory chosen among the regicides.--It selects agents\r\n     of its own species.--Leading Jacobins are deprived of their\r\n     civic rights.--The Terrorists are set free and restored to\r\n     their civic rights.--Example at Blois of these releases and\r\n     of the new administrative staff.\r\n\r\nSupreme authority is now once more in the hands of the revolutionary\r\nband.--In conformity with its decrees of Fructidor, it first obliges\r\nelectors to take two-thirds of their new representatives from the\r\nConvention. And as, notwithstanding its decrees, the electoral\r\nassemblies have not re-elected a sufficient number of the\r\nConventionalists, it nominates itself, from a list prepared by its\r\nCommittee of Public Safety, the one hundred and four which are lacking:\r\nIn this way, both in the council of the Five Hundred, as well as in the\r\ncouncil of the Ancients, it secures a clear majority in both the houses\r\nof the Legislative Corps. In the executive branch, in the Directory, it\r\nassures itself of unanimity. The Five Hundred, by adroitly preparing the\r\nlists, impose their candidates on the Ancients, selecting the five names\r\nbeforehand: Barras, La Révellière de Lépeaux, Reubell, Letourneur and\r\nSiéyès, and then, on Siéyès refusing, Carnot. All of them are regicides\r\nand, under this terrible qualification, bound at the risk of their\r\nheads, to maintain the regicide faction in power.--Naturally the\r\nDirectory chooses its agents from among their own people,[5129] their\r\nministers and the employees of their departments, ambassadors and\r\nconsuls, officers of all ranks, collectors of taxes direct and indirect,\r\nadministrators of the national domains, commissioners of civil and\r\nCriminal courts, and the commissioners of the departmental and municipal\r\nadministrations. Again, having the right to suspend and dismiss all\r\nelected administrative bodies, it exercises this right. If the local\r\nauthorities of any town, canton, or department seem to be anti-Jacobin,\r\nit sets them aside and, either on its own authority, or with the assent\r\nof the Legislative Corps, replaces them with Jacobins on the spot.[5130]\r\nIn other respects, the Convention has done its best to relieve its\r\nclients of their principal adversaries and most popular rivals. The\r\nnight before its dissolution, it excluded from every \"legislative,\r\nmunicipal, administrative and judicial function,\"[5131] even that of\r\njuryman, not only the individuals who, rightly or wrongly, had been\r\nput on a list of émigrés and not yet stricken off, but likewise their\r\nfathers, sons and grandsons, brothers and brothers-in-law, their\r\nconnections of the same degree, uncles and nephews. In all, probably two\r\nor three hundred thousand Frenchmen, nearly the whole of the élite of\r\nthe nation. To this it adds the rest of this élite, all the honest\r\nand energetic who, in the late primary or electoral assemblies have\r\n\"provoked or signed\" any manifestation against its despotism; if still\r\nin office they are to resign within twenty-four hours, or be sent into\r\nperpetual exile.--Through this legal incapacity of the anti-Jacobins,\r\nthe field is free to the Jacobins. In many places, for lack of\r\ncandidates that please them, most of the electors stay away from the\r\npolls; besides this, the terrorists resort to their old system, that is\r\nto say to brutal violence.[5132] On again obtaining the support of\r\nthe government they have raised their heads and are now the titular\r\nfavorites. The Convention has restored to them the civic rights of which\r\nthey had deprived their adversaries: \"every decree of indictment or\r\narrest\" rendered against them, \"every warrant executed or not,\r\nall proceedings and suits\" begun, every sentence bearing on their\r\nrevolutionary acts, is cancelled. The most \"atrocious\" Montagnards, the\r\nmost sanguinary and foul proconsuls, Dartigoyte and Piochefer-Bernard,\r\nDarthé, Lebon's secretary, Rossignol the great September massacrer,\r\nthe presidents of former revolutionary committees, \"patriotic robbers,\r\nseal-breakers\" and garroters, brazenly promenade the streets of\r\nParis.[5133] Barère himself, who, condemned to transportation,\r\nuniversally execrated as he traverses France, and who, everywhere on his\r\njourney, at Orleans, Tours, Poitiers, Niort, comes near being torn to\r\npieces by the people, Barère is not sent off to Guienne; he is\r\nallowed to escape, to conceal himself and live tranquilly at Bordeaux.\r\nFurthermore, Conventionalists of the worst species, like Monestier and\r\nFoussedoire return to their natal department to govern it as government\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nConsider the effect of these releases and of these appointments in a\r\ntown which, like Blois, has seen the assassins at work, and which, for\r\ntwo months, follows their trial.[5134]--Seven of them, members of the\r\nRevolutionary Committee, commanders of the armed force, members of the\r\ndistrict or department, national agents in Indre-et-Loire, charged with\r\nconducting or receiving a column of eight hundred laborers, peasant\r\nwomen, priests and \"suspects,\" cause nearly six hundred of them to be\r\nshot, sabered, drowned or knocked down on the road, not in self-defense\r\nor to prevent escape, for these poor creatures tied two and two marched\r\nalong like sheep without a murmur, but to set a good revolutionary\r\nexample, so as to keep the people in proper subjection by terror and\r\nenable them to line their pockets.[5135] A minute investigation has\r\nunfolded before the judges, jury and public of Blois a long series of\r\nauthentic facts and proofs, with eight days of pleading and the most\r\ncomplete and glaring evidence; the sentence is about to be pronounced.\r\nSuddenly, two weeks before Vendémiaire 13, a decree annuls the\r\nproceedings, which have already cost over 600,000 livres, and orders a\r\nnew trial in another form. Next, after Vendémiaire 13, a representative\r\narrives at Blois and his first care is to set the butchers free.--About\r\nthirty knaves ruled the town during the reign of Terror, all strangers,\r\nsave four or five, \"all more or less befouled with crime.\" At first, the\r\nprincipal slaughterers:\r\n\r\n* Hézine, Gidouin, and their accomplices of the neighboring districts,\r\n\r\n* Simon and Bonneau the ex-mayor of Blois,\r\n\r\n* Bézard, a former soldier, convicted of peculation and of robbing\r\ncellars which he had put under sequestration,\r\n\r\n* Berger, an ex-monk, and then dragoon who, with pistol in hand, forced\r\nthe superior of his old convent to give up the funds of the community,\r\n\r\n* Giot, formerly a chief-butler of Monsieur (the King's brother), next,\r\na judge in the September massacres and then a quartermaster in the\r\nPyrenees army and a pillager in Spain, then secretary to the Melun\r\ntribunal of which he stole the cash, along with other nomads and\r\noutlaws of the same stamp, most of them sots and roisterers, one\r\nan ex-schoolmaster, another an ex-ladies hair-dresser, another an\r\nex-chair-bearer; all of them a vile lot, chosen by the government for\r\nits agents, and, under new titles, resuming their old positions. At\r\nthe head of the armed force is Gen. Bonnard, who is accompanied by a\r\nprostitute and who passes his time in orgies, pilfering wherever he can,\r\nand so shameless in his thievery as to be condemned, six months later,\r\nto three months in irons.[5136] On arriving at Blois, he organizes \"a\r\npaid guard, composed of all the most abject Jacobins.\"--Elsewhere,\r\nas here,[5137] it is the full staff of the reign of Terror, the petty\r\npotentates dethroned after Thermidor, the political Bohemians restored\r\nto their functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Public Opinon.\r\n\r\n     Resistance of public opinion.--Elections, year IV. at Paris\r\n     and in the provinces.--The Directory threatened by ultra\r\n     Jacobins.--Forced amelioration of the Jacobin\r\n     administration.\r\n\r\nSo, that after Vendémiaire 13, it looks as if the Jacobin band had made\r\nthe conquest of France a second time. This, however not yet so, for,\r\nif it has recovered its authority, it has not yet recovered the\r\ndictatorship.--In vain do Barras and Tallien, Dubois-Crancé, Merlin de\r\nDouai and Marie Chénier, Delmas, Louvet, Siéyès and their corrupt gang,\r\nthe habitués of power, the despotic, unscrupulous theorists, try to\r\npostpone indefinitely the opening of the legislative bodies, to annul\r\nthe elections, to purge the Convention, to restore for their own\r\nadvantage that total concentration of powers which, under the title of\r\nrevolutionary government, has converted France into a pachalic[5138]\r\nin the hands of the old Committee of Public Safety.[5139] But the\r\nConvention has become frightened for its own safety; at the last moment\r\nthe plot is exposed, and the blow frustrated.[5140] The Constitution,\r\ndecreed, is put in operation, and a system of the law has replaced the\r\nsystem of arbitrariness. The Jacobin invasion, through that alone, is\r\nchecked and then arrested. The nation is in a condition to defend itself\r\nand does defend itself. It gradually regains lost ground, even at the\r\ncenter.--At Paris, the electoral body,[5141] which is obliged to take\r\ntwo-thirds of its deputies from the Convention, takes none of the\r\nregicide deputation representing Paris. All who are chosen, Lanjuinais,\r\nLarivière, Fermon, Saladin, Boissy d'Anglas, wished to save the King,\r\nand nearly all were proscribed after the 31st May. The departments show\r\nthe same spirit. The members of the Convention for whom the provinces\r\nshow a decided preference are the most prominent of the anti-Jacobins:\r\nThibaudeau is re-elected by 32 electoral colleges, Pelet de la Lozére\r\nby 71, Boissy d'Anglas by 72, Lanjuinais by 73. As to the 250 of the new\r\nthird, these are liberals of 1789 or moderates of 1791,[5142] most of\r\nthem honorable men and many of them well-informed and of real merit,\r\njurisconsults, officers, administrators, members of the Constitutional\r\nAssembly or Feuillants in the Legislative Assembly, Mathieu\r\nDumas, Vaublanc, Dupont de Nemours, Siméon, Barbé-Marbois and\r\nTronçon-Ducoudray. The capital, especially, chose Dambray, former\r\ngeneral-advocate to the Paris parliament, and Pastoret, former minister\r\nof Louis XVI.. Versailles sends the two celebrated lawyers who defended\r\nthe King before the Convention, Tronchet and De Séze.--Now, previous to\r\nthe 13th Vendémiaire, two hundred members of the Convention had already\r\nheartily sided with the Parisian electors[5143] against the terrorists.\r\nThis creates a strong opposition minority inside the Legislative Corps\r\nwhich function protected by the Constitution. Hidden behind it and\r\nbehind them, the élite and the plurality of Frenchmen wait for better\r\ndays. The Directory is obliged to act cautiously with this large group,\r\nso well supported by public opinion, and, accordingly, not to govern à\r\nla Turk. So they respect, if not the spirit, at least the letter of the\r\nlaw, and not to exercise a too barefaced influence on local elections.\r\nHence most of the local elections remain free, so that the nation,\r\n\r\n* in spite of the decree excluding every relation of an émigré and every\r\nnotorious opponent of the government from present and future offices,\r\n\r\n* in spite of fear, lassitude and disgust,\r\n\r\n* in spite of the small number of votes, the rarity of candidates and\r\nthe frequent refusal of the elected to serve,[5144]\r\n\r\nsubstantially exercises its privilege of electing its administrators\r\nand judges according to its preferences. Consequently, the very\r\nlarge majority of new administrators in the departments, cantons and\r\nmunicipalities, and the very large majority of new civil and criminal\r\njudges and justices of the peace are, like the new third of the\r\nConvention, highly esteemed or estimable men. They are untainted with\r\nexcesses, still preserving their hopes of 1789, but preserved from the\r\noutset against, or soon cured of, the revolutionary fever. Every decree\r\nof spoliation or persecution loses some of its force in their hands.\r\nSupported by the steady and manifest will of their present constituents,\r\nwe see them resisting the commissioners of the Directory, at least\r\nprotesting against their exactions and brutality, gaining time in favor\r\nof the proscribed, dulling the point of, or turning aside, the Jacobin\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the other hand, the government which holds this sword dare\r\nnot, like the Committee of Public Safety, thrust it in up to the hilt.\r\nIf wielded as before it might slip from its grasp. The furious in its\r\nown camp are ready to wrest it away and turn the blade against it. It\r\nmust defend itself against the reviving clubs, against Babeuf and his\r\naccomplices, against the desperadoes who, through a nocturnal attempt,\r\ntry to stir up the Grenelle camp: in Paris, there are four or five\r\nthousand now ready to undertake a \"civic St. Bartholomew,\" with the\r\nold Conventionists who could not get themselves elected, at their\r\nhead,--Drouet, Amar, Vadier, Ricord, Laignelot, Chaudieu, Huguet,\r\nCusset, Javogues. Alongside of them, the friends of Chalier,\r\nRobespierre's and Marat's followers, and the disciples of Saint-Just,\r\nBertrand de Lyon, Buonarotti, Antonelle, Rossignol and Babeuf. Behind\r\nthem, the bandits of the street, those \"who gutted houses during the\r\nRevolution,\" peculators or Septembriseurs out of employment, in short,\r\nthe relics of the terrorist gang or of the revolutionary army. Their\r\nplan, true to their precedents, character and principles, consists not\r\nonly in despatching \"the rascals who keep coaches, the moneyed men and\r\nmonopolisers,\" all the deputies and functionaries who do not resign at\r\nthe first summons, but also, and especially, in killing \"the General of\r\nthe Interior, his staff, the seven ministers and the five 'cocked-hats'\r\n(panachés) of the Luxembourg,\" that is to say, the five Directors\r\nthemselves. Such allies are troublesome. Undoubtedly, the government,\r\nwhich considers them as its forlorn hope, and that it may have need\r\nof them in a crisis, spares them as much as possible.[5145] It allows\r\nDrouet to escape, and lets the trial of the Babouvists drag along, only\r\ntwo of them being guillotined, Babeuf and Darthé; most of the others are\r\nacquitted or escape. Nevertheless, for its own salvation, it is led\r\nto separate from the fiercest Jacobins and draw near to peaceable\r\ncitizens.--Through this internal discord of the ruling faction, honest\r\npeople hold on the offices they occupy on the elections of the year\r\nIV.. No decree comes to deprive them of their legal arms, while, in the\r\nLegislative Corps, as in the administrations and the tribunals, they\r\ncount on carrying new positions in the elections of the year V.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Actual aim of Jacobin Activities: Power and Wealth.\r\n\r\n     Elections of year V.--Character and sentiments of the\r\n     elected.--The new majority in the Corps Legislatif.--Its\r\n     principles and program.--Danger and anxiety of the Jacobin\r\n     minority.--Indecision, division, scruples and weakness of\r\n     the moderate party.--Decision, want of scruples, force and\r\n     modes of procedure of the Jacobin faction.--The 18th of\r\n     Fructidor.\r\n\r\n\"It was a long time,\" writes a small trader of Evreux, \"since so many\r\npeople were seen at the elections.[5146].... The eight electors for the\r\ntown obtained at the first ballot the absolute majority of suffrages....\r\nEverybody went to the polls so as to prevent the nomination of any\r\nelector among the terrorists, who had declared that their reign was\r\ngoing to return.\"--In the environs of Blois, a rural proprietor, the\r\nmost circumspect and most peaceable of men, notes in his journal[5147]\r\nthat \"now is the time to take a personal interest.. .. Every\r\nsound-thinking man has promised not to refuse any office tendered to\r\nhim so as to keep out the Jacobins..... It is reasonably hoped that\r\nthe largest number of the electors will not be terrorists and that the\r\nmajority of the Legislative Corps being all right, the minority of the\r\nfurious, who have only one more year of office, will give way (in 1798)\r\nto men of probity not steeped in crime.. .. In the country, the Jacobins\r\nhave tried in vain: people of means who employed a portion of the\r\nvoters, obtained their suffrages, every proprietor wishing to have\r\norder.... The Moderates have agreed to vote for no matter what\r\ncandidate, provided he is not a Jacobin.... Out of two hundred and\r\nthirty electors for the department, one hundred and fifty are honest and\r\nupright people..... They adhered to the last Constitution as to their\r\nsole palladium, only a very few of them dreaming of re-establishing\r\nthe ancient régime.\" Their object is plain enough; they are for\r\nthe Constitution against the Revolution, for limited power against\r\ndiscretionary power, for property against robbery, for upright men\r\nagainst thieves.--\"Would you prevent, say the administrative authorities\r\nof Aube,[5148] a return to the disastrous laws of the maximum, of\r\nmonopolies, to the resurrection of paper-money?... Would you, as the\r\nprice of a blameless life, be once more humiliated, robbed, imprisoned,\r\ntortured by the vilest, most repulsive and most shameless of tyrants?\r\nYou have only one recourse: do not fail to go to your primary assemblies\r\nand remain there.\" The electors, warned by their late personal and\r\nbloody souvenirs, rush to the polls in crowds and vote according to\r\ntheir consciences, although the government through the oaths it imposes,\r\nits official candidatures, its special commissioners, its intimidation\r\nand its money, bears down with all its weight on the resolutions they\r\nhave taken. Although the Jacobins at Nevers, Mâcon and elsewhere, have\r\nforcibly expelled officers legally elected from their bureaux, and\r\nstained the hall with their blood,[5149] \"out of 84 departments 66\r\nelected a plurality of electors from among the anti-republicans,\r\neight being neither good nor bad, while only ten remained loyal to the\r\nJacobins.\"[5150]--Appointed by such electors, we can divine what the\r\nnew Third will be. \"Of the 250 Conventionalists excluded by the\r\ndraw scarcely five or six have been re-elected; there are but eight\r\ndepartments in which the Jacobins have had any success. \"-Immediately\r\nafter the arrival of the new representatives, the roll of the\r\nLegislative Corps having been checked off, it is found that \"the\r\nGovernment has 70 out of 250 votes among the Ancients, and 200 out of\r\n500 among the Council of the Young,\" and soon less than 200 in this\r\nCouncil,[5151] 130 at the most, who will certainly be excluded at the\r\ncoming renewal of the chambers in elections which are becoming more and\r\nmore anti-Jacobin. One year more, as the rulers themselves admit,\r\nand not one Conventionalist, not one pure Jacobin, will sit in the\r\nLegislative Corps. Consequently, according to the revolutionaries, the\r\ncounter-revolution will have taken place in the year VI.\r\n\r\nThis means that the Revolution is to end in the year VI., and that the\r\npacific reign of law will be substituted for the brutal reign of force.\r\nIn fact, the great majority of the representatives and almost the entire\r\nFrench nation have no other end in view: they wish to rid themselves of\r\nthe social and civil régime to which they have been subject since the\r\n10th of August, 1792, and which, relaxed after Thermidor 9, but renewed\r\nby the 13th of Vendémiaire, has lasted up to the present time, through\r\nthe enforcement of its most odious laws and the maintenance of its\r\nmost disreputable agents. This is all.--Not twenty avowed or decided\r\nroyalists could be found in the two Councils.[5152] There are scarcely\r\nmore than five or six--Imbert-Colomès, Pichegru, Willot, Delarne--who\r\nmay be in correspondence with Louis XVIII. and disposed to raise\r\nthe royal flag. For the other five hundred, the restoration of the\r\nlegitimate King, or the establishment of any royalty whatever, is only\r\nin the background; they regard it only at a distance, as a possible\r\naccompaniment and remote consequence of their present undertaking. In\r\nany event, they would accept only \"the mitigated monarchy,\"[5153] that\r\nwhich the Liberals of 1788 hoped for, that which Mounier demanded after\r\nthe days of October 5 and 6, that advocated by Barnave after the return\r\nfrom Varennes, that which Malouet, Gouverneur Morris, Mallet-Dupan and\r\nall good observers and wise councillors of France, always recommended.\r\nNone of them propose to proclaim divine right and return to aristocratic\r\nfeudalism; each proposes to abrogate revolutionary right and destroy\r\nJacobin feudalism. The principle condemned by them is that which\r\nsustains the theory of anarchy and despotism,\r\n\r\n* the application of the Contrat Social,[5154]\r\n\r\n* a dictatorship established by coups détat, carried on arbitrarily and\r\nsupported by terror,\r\n\r\n* the systematic and dogmatic persistence of assaults on persons,\r\nproperty and consciences,\r\n\r\n* the usurpation of a vicious, fanatical minority which has devastated\r\nFrance for five years and, under the pretext of everywhere setting up\r\nthe rights of man, purposely maintaining a war to propagate its system\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThat which they are really averse to is the Directory and its clique,\r\nBarras with his court of gorged contractors and kept women, Reubell\r\nwith his family of extortioners, stamp of a parvenu and ways of a tavern\r\nkeeper, La Révellière-Lepaux with his hunchback vanity, philosophic\r\npretensions, sectarian intolerance and silly airs of a pedantic dupe.\r\nWhat they demand in the tribune,[5155] is the purification of the\r\nadministration, the suppression of jobbery, an end to persecution and,\r\naccording as they are more or less excited or circumspect, they demand\r\nlegal sentences or simply the removal of Jacobins in office, the\r\nimmediate and entire suppression or partial and careful reform of\r\nthe laws against priests and worship, against émigrés and the\r\nnobles.[5156]--Nobody has any idea of innovation with respect to the\r\ndistribution of public powers, or to the way of appointing central or\r\nlocal authorities. \"I swear on my honor,\" writes Mathieu Dumas, \"that\r\nit has always been my intention to maintain the Republican Constitution,\r\npersuaded as I am that, with a temperate and equitable administration,\r\nit might give repose to France, make liberty known and cherished, and\r\nrepair in time the evils of the Revolution. I swear that no proposals,\r\ndirect or indirect, have ever been made to me to serve, either by my\r\nactions, speech or silence, or cause to prevail in any near or\r\nremote manner, any other interest than that of the Republic and the\r\nConstitution.\"--\"Among the deputies,\" says Camille Jordan, \"several\r\nmight prefer royalty; but they did not conspire, regarding the\r\nConstitution as a deposit entrusted to their honor.. They kept their\r\nmost cherished plans subordinate to the national will; they comprehended\r\nthat royalty could not be re-established without blows and through\r\nthe development of this bill.\"--\"Between ourselves,\" says again\r\nBarbé-Marbois, \"there were disagreements as to the way of getting\r\nalong with the Directory, but none at all as to the maintenance of\r\nthe Constitution.\"[5157] Almost up to the last moment they confined\r\nthemselves strictly to their legal rights, and when, towards the\r\nend, they were disposed to set these aside, it was simply to defend\r\nthemselves against the uplifted saber above their heads.[5158] It is\r\nincontestable that their leaders are \"the most estimable and the ablest\r\nmen in the Republic,\"[5159] the only representatives of free suffrage,\r\nmature opinions and long experience, the only ones at least in whose\r\nhands the Republic, restored to order and justice, would have any chance\r\nof becoming viable, in fact, the only liberals. And this is the reason\r\nwhy the merely nominal Republicans were bound to crush them.\r\n\r\nIn effect, under a government which disavows attacks on persons and on\r\npublic or private property, not only is the Jacobin theory impossible,\r\nbut Jacobin wrongs are condemned. Now, the Jacobins, even if they have\r\nabjured their principles, remember their acts. They become alarmed\r\non the arrival of the first Third, in October, 1795: \"The\r\nConventionalists,\" writes one of the new deputies,[5160] \"look upon us\r\nas men who will one day give them up to justice.\" After the entry of\r\nthe second Third, in May, 1797, their fright increased; the regicides,\r\nespecially, feel that \"their safety depends only on an exclusive and\r\nabsolute dominion.\"[5161] One day, Treilhard, one of their notables,\r\nalone with Mathieu Dumas, says to this old Feuillant and friend of\r\nLafayette, of well known loyalty and moderation: \"You are very honest\r\nand very able men, and I believe that you really desire to maintain the\r\ngovernment as it is, because neither for you nor for us is there any\r\nsure way of substituting another for it. But we Conventionalists cannot\r\nallow you to go on; whether you mean it or not, you are gradually\r\nleading us to our certain ruin; there is nothing in common between\r\nus.\"--\"What guarantee do you then require?\"--\"Only one. After that,\r\nwe'll do all you want--we'll let you relax the springs--give us this\r\nguarantee and we'll follow you blindly!--\"Well, what do you mean by\r\nthat?\"--\r\n\r\n\"Enter the tribune and declare that if you had been a member of the\r\nConvention, you would have voted the death of Louis XVI. as we did!\"-\r\n\"You demand an impossibility. You would not do this in our place. You\r\nsacrifice France to vain terrors.\"--\r\n\r\n\"No, the risk is not equal; our heads are at stake!\"\r\n\r\nTheir heads, perhaps,--but certainly their power, places, fortunes,\r\ncomforts and pleasures, all that in their eyes makes it worth while\r\nto live.--Every morning, seventy Paris newspapers and as many local\r\ngazettes in the large towns of the provinces expose, with supporting\r\ndocuments, details and figures, not merely their former crimes, but,\r\nagain, their actual corruption, their sudden opulence founded on\r\nprevarication and rapine, their bribes and peculations--\r\n\r\n* one, rewarded with a sumptuously furnished mansion by a company of\r\ngrateful contractors;\r\n\r\n* another, son of a bailiwick attorney and a would-be Carthusian, now\r\npossessor of ecclesiastical property, restored by him at a great\r\noutlay for hunting-grounds; another also monopolizes the finest land in\r\nSeine-et-Oise;\r\n\r\n* another, the improvised owner of four chateaux;\r\n\r\n* another, who has feathered his nest with fifteen or eighteen\r\nmillions,[5162]\r\n\r\nWith their loose or arbitrary ways of doing things, their habits\r\nas hoarders or spendthrifts, their display and effrontery, their\r\ndissipations, their courtiers and their prostitutes. How can they\r\nrenounce all this?--And all the more because this is all they have.\r\nThese jaded consciences are wholly indifferent to abstract principles,\r\nto popular sovereignty, to the common weal, to public security; the thin\r\nand brittle coating of sonorous phrases under which they formerly tried\r\nto hide the selfishness and perversity of their lusts, scales off and\r\nfalls to the ground. They themselves confess that it is not the Republic\r\nfor which they are concerned, but for themselves above everything else,\r\nand for themselves alone. So much the worse for the Republic if its\r\ninterest is opposed to their interest; as Siéyès will soon express it,\r\nthe object is not to save the Revolution but the revolutionaries.--Thus\r\ndisabused, unscrupulous, knowing that they are staking their all, and\r\nresolute, like their colleagues of August 10, September 2 and May31\r\nand like the Committee of Public Safety, they are determined to win, no\r\nmatter at what cost or by what means.\r\n\r\nFor this time again, the Moderates do not want to comprehend that the\r\nwar has been declared, and that it is war to the knife. They do not\r\nagree amongst themselves; they want to gain time, they hesitate and take\r\nrefuge in constitutional forms--they do not act. The strong measures\r\nwhich the eighty decided and clear-sighted deputies propose, are\r\nweakened or suspended by the precautions of the three hundred others,\r\nshort-sighted, unreliable or timid.[5163] They dare not even avail\r\nthemselves of their legal arms:\r\n\r\n* annul the military division of the interior,\r\n\r\n* suppress Augereau's commission,\r\n\r\n* and break the sword presented at their throats by the three conspiring\r\nDirectors.\r\n\r\nIn the Directory, they have only passive or neutral allies, Barthélémy,\r\nwho had rather be assassinated than murder, Carnot, the servant of his\r\nlegal pass-word, fearing to risk his Republic, and, moreover, calling\r\nto mind that he had voted for the King's death. Among the \"Five Hundred\"\r\nand the \"Ancients,\" Thibaudeau and Tronçon-Ducoudray, the two leaders\r\n\"du ventre,\" arrest the arms of Pichegru and other energetic men,\r\nprevent them from striking, allow them only to ward off the blow,\r\nand always too late. Three days after the 10th of Fructidor, when, as\r\neverybody knew and saw, the final blow was to be struck, the eighty\r\ndeputies, who change their quarters so as not to be seized in their\r\nbeds, cannot yet make up their minds to take the offensive. On that\r\nday, an eye-witness[5164] came to Mathieu Dumas and told him that,\r\nthe evening before, in Barras' house, they discussed the slaughter or\r\ntransportation to Cayenne of about forty members of the two Councils,\r\nand that the second measure was adopted. On which a commandant of the\r\nNational Guard, having led Dumas at night into the Tuileries garden,\r\nshowed him his men concealed behind the trees, armed and ready to march\r\nat the first signal. He is to possess himself at once of the Luxembourg\r\n(palace)[5165] which is badly guarded, and put an end to Barras and\r\nReubell on the spot: in war one kills so as not to be killed, and, when\r\nthe enemy takes aim, you have the right to fire without waiting. \"Only,\"\r\nsays the commandant, \"promise me that you will state in the tribune that\r\nyou ordered this attack, and give me your word of honor.\"[5166] Mathieu\r\nDumas refuses, simply because he is a man of honor. \"You were a fool,\"\r\nNapoleon afterwards said to him in this connection, \"you know nothing\r\nabout revolutions.\"--In effect, honor, loyalty, horror of blood, respect\r\nfor the law, such are the weak points of the party.\r\n\r\nThe opposite sentiments form the strong points of the other party. On\r\nthe side of the triumvirs nobody knows twinges of conscience, neither\r\nBarras, a condottiere open to the highest bidder, and who understands\r\nthe value of blows, nor Reubell, a sort of bull, who, becoming excited,\r\nsees red, nor Merlin de Douai, the terrible legist, lay inquisitor and\r\nexecutioner in private.[5167] As usual with the Jacobins, these men have\r\nunsheathed the sword and brandished it. In contempt of the constitution,\r\nthey provoked discussions in the army and let the Legislative Corps\r\nsee that, if it did not yield, it would be put out at the point of the\r\nbayonet. They let loose against it, \"as in the good old times,\"[5168]\r\ntheir executive riff-raff, and line the avenues and tribunes with \"their\r\nbandits of both sexes.\" They collect together their gangs of roughs,\r\nfive or six thousand terrorists from Paris and the departments, and two\r\nthousand officers awaiting orders or on half-pay. In default of Hoche,\r\nwhose unconstitutional approach was reported and then prevented, they\r\nhave Augereau, arrived expressly from Italy, and who states publicly,\r\n\"I am sent for to kill the royalists.\" It is impossible to find a more\r\nnarrow-minded and greater military bully; Reubell, himself, on seeing\r\nhim, could not help but exclaim: What a sturdy brigand!\"--On the 18th\r\nof Fructidor this official swordsman, with eight or ten thousand troops,\r\nsurrounds and invades the Tuileries. The representatives are arrested in\r\ntheir committee-rooms or domiciles, or pursued, tracked and hunted down,\r\nwhile the rest of their opponents, notables, officers, heads of bureaux,\r\njournalists, former ministers and directors, Barthélémy and Carnot, are\r\ntreated in the same way. Barbé-Marbois, on demanding by virtue of what\r\nlaw they were arrested,[5169] is told, \"by the law of the saber,\" while\r\nSotin, Minister of the Police, adds with a smile, \"You may be sure that\r\nafter what I have taken on myself, it matters little whether one is more\r\nor less compromised.\"--Thus purged, the two Councils complete themselves\r\ntheir purgation; they cancel, in forty-nine departments, the election of\r\ntheir colleagues; through this decree and transportation, through forced\r\nand voluntary resignations, two hundred and fourteen representatives\r\nare withdrawn from the Legislative Corps, while one hundred and eighty\r\nothers, through fear or disgust, cease to attend its meetings.[5170]\r\nNothing remains of the two Councils, except, as in the English\r\nParliament under Cromwell, a \"rump,\" which rump does business under\r\ndrawn swords. In the Council of the Ancients, which, on the 18th of\r\nFructidor, discussed at midnight[5171] the decree of transportation,\r\n\"groups of grenadiers, with a haggard look, in brusque language, with\r\nthreatening gestures\" and fixed bayonets, surround the amphitheatre,\r\nand, mingled with the soldiers and civil cut-throats, shout out their\r\norders. Such are the supporters of the slanderous tale cooked up by the\r\nDirectory. The voters need such arguments to make themselves believe\r\nin the grand conspiracy which it denounces, to associate Barthélemy,\r\nCarnot, Siméon, Barbé-Marbois, Boissy d'Anglas, Mathieu Dumas, Pastoret,\r\nTronson du Coudray as accomplices with a knot of subordinate intriguers,\r\ncontemptible \"monkeys\" (marmosets), dolts or spies, whose papers have\r\nbeen in the hands of the police for six months, and whom it forces to\r\nspeak under lock and key.[5172] All are enveloped in the same net, all\r\nare confounded together under the same title, all are condemned en masse\r\nwithout evidence or formality. \"Proofs!\" exclaims an orator, \"none\r\nare necessary against the royalist faction. I have my own\r\nconvictions.\"[5173]--\"Formalities!\" exclaims another, \"the enemies of\r\nthe country cannot invoke formalities which they would have despised had\r\nthey triumphed.\"--\"The people are there,\" says a third, pointing to\r\na dozen ill-looking men who are present; \"the whole people ought to\r\nprevail against a few individuals!\"--\"Hurry up!\" shouts a soldier,\r\nwho wants the discussion ended, \"patriots, march, double-quick!\"--The\r\ndebate, nevertheless, drags along, and the Government, growing\r\nimpatient, is obliged to intervene with a message: \"The people,\" says\r\nthe message, \"want to know what has become of the Republic, what\r\nyou have done with it..... The conspirators have agents, even among\r\nyourselves.\" The message is understood, and the representatives now\r\nunderstand that if they do not transport, they themselves will be\r\ndeported. Therefore, \"about fourteen or fifteen stand up for the decree,\r\nwhile seven are against it; the rest remain motionless:\" it is thus that\r\nthe decree to save the Constitution is freely and legally passed. Four\r\nyears before this a similar decree had passed to expel the Girondists,\r\nin just the same manner, with the exception that, at that time, the\r\nMountain made use of the populace, while now the army is employed;\r\nbut save the difference in the figurants, the performance is simply a\r\nrepetition of the same drama that was played on the 2nd of June, and is\r\nnow again played on the 18th of Fructidor.[5174]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Directory.\r\n\r\n     Dictatorship of the Directory.--Its new prerogatives.--Purge\r\n     of the Legislative Corps.--Purification of the\r\n     administrative and judicial authorities.--Military\r\n     commissions in the provinces.--Suppression of newspapers.\r\n     --The right of voting reserved to Jacobins alone.--Despotism\r\n     of the Directory.--Revival of Terror.--Transportation\r\n     substituted for the guillotine.--Treatment of the deported\r\n     on the way, in Guyana, and on the islands of Rhé and\r\n     Oléron.--Restoration of Jacobin feudalism.\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which the government of 1793 is brought back to life:\r\n\r\nThe concentration of all public powers in the hands of an oligarchy, a\r\ndictatorship exercised by about a hundred men grouped around five or six\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nMore independent, more despotic and less provisional than any Committee\r\nof Public Safety, the Directory has arrogated to itself the legal right\r\nof placing a commune in a state of siege, of introducing troops within\r\nthe constitutional circle[5175] in such a way that it may, at its\r\ndiscretion, violate Paris and the Legislative Corps. In this body,\r\nmutilated by it and watched by its hireling assassins,[5176] sit\r\nthe passive mutes who feel themselves \"morally proscribed and\r\nhalf-deported,\"[5177] who abandon debate, and vote with its\r\nstipendiaries and valets.[5178] As a matter of fact, the two councils\r\nhave, as formerly the Convention, become chambers \"of registry\" of\r\nlegislative mechanism charged with the duty of countersigning its\r\norders.--Its sway over the subordinate authorities is still more\r\nabsolute. In forty-nine departments, specially designated by decree,\r\nall the administrators of departments, cantons and municipalities,\r\nall mayors, civil and criminal judges, all justices of the peace, all\r\nelected by popular suffrage, are dismissed en masse,[5179] while the\r\ncleaning out in the rest of France is almost as sweeping. We can judge\r\nby one example: in the department of Doubs, which is not put down among\r\nthose to be purged, five hundred and thirty administrators or municipal\r\nmagistrates are dismissed in 1797, and, in addition, forty-nine others\r\nin 1798. The Directory puts its creatures in their places: suddenly,\r\nthe departmental, cantonal, municipal and judicial system, which was\r\nAmerican, becomes Napoleonic so that the local officials, instead\r\nof being delegates of the people, are government delegates.--Note,\r\nespecially, the most threatening of all usurpations, the way in which\r\nthis government takes justice into its hands and attributes to itself\r\nthe right of life and death over persons: not only does it break up\r\ncommon criminal courts and reorganize them as it pleases, not only does\r\nit renew and select among the purest Jacobins judges of the court of\r\nappeals, but again, in each military division, it institutes a special\r\nand expeditious court without appeal, composed of docile officers,\r\nsub-officers and soldiers, which is to condemn and execute within\r\ntwenty-four hours, under pretext of emigration or priesthood, every man\r\nwho is obnoxious to the ruling factions.--As to the twenty-five millions\r\nof subjects it has just acquired, there is no refuge: it is forbidden\r\neven to complain. Forty-two opposition or \"suspect\" journals are\r\nsilenced at one stroke, their stock plundered, or their presses broken\r\nup; three months after this, sixteen more take their turn, and, in\r\na year, eleven others; the proprietors, editors, publishers and\r\ncontributors, among whom are La Harpe, Fontanes, Fièvé, Michaud and\r\nLacretelle, a large body of honorable or prominent writers, the four or\r\nfive hundred men who compose the staff of the profession, all condemned\r\nwithout trial to banishment,[5180] or to imprisonment, are arrested,\r\ntake flight, conceal themselves, or keep silent. The only voice now\r\nheard in France is the mega-phone of the government.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the faculty of voting is as restricted as the faculty of\r\nwriting, so that the victors of Fructidor, together with the right\r\nto speak, now also monopolize the right of electing.--Right away the\r\ngovernment renewed the decree which the expiring Convention had rendered\r\nagainst allies or relations of émigrés. moreover, it excluded all\r\nrelatives or supporters of the members of the primary assemblies, and\r\nforbade the primary assemblies to choose any of these for electors.\r\nHenceforth, all upright or even peaceful citizens consider themselves as\r\nwarned and stay at home. Voting is the act of a ruler, and therefore a\r\nprivilege of the new sovereigns, which is the view of it entertained\r\nby both sovereigns and subjects:[5181] \"a republican minority operating\r\nlegally must prevail against a majority influenced by royalism.\"[5182]\r\nThey are to see the government on election days, launching forth \"in\r\neach department its commission agents, and controlling votes by threats\r\nand all sorts of promises and seductions,[5183] arresting the electors\r\nand presidents of the primary assemblies,\" even pouncing on refractory\r\nJacobins, invalidating the returns of a majority when not satisfactory\r\nto them, and rendering the choice of a minority valid, if it suited\r\nthem, in short, constituting itself the chief elector of all local\r\nand central authorities.--Finally, all institutions, laws, public and\r\nprivate rights, are down, and the nation, body and soul, again becomes,\r\nas under Robespierre, the property of its rulers with this sole\r\ndifference, that the kings of Terror, postponing their constitution,\r\nopenly proclaim their omnipotence, whilst the others hypocritically rule\r\nunder a constitution which they have themselves destroyed, and reign by\r\nvirtue of a title which interdicts royalty to them.\r\n\r\nThey, too, maintain themselves by Terror; only, like so many Tartuffes,\r\nthey are not disposed to act openly as executioners. The Directory, heir\r\nto the Convention, affects to repudiate its inheritance: \"Woe,\" says\r\nBoulay de la Meurthe, \"to whoever would re-establish scaffolds.\" There\r\nis to be no guillotine; its purveyors have been too strongly denounced;\r\nthey stand too near the red stream and view with too great nervous\r\nhorror those who fed it. It is better to employ death at a distance,\r\nlingering and spontaneous, with no effusion of human blood, \"dry,\" less\r\nrepulsive than the other sort, but more painful and not less certain;\r\nthis shall be imprisonment on the marshes of Rochefort, and, better\r\nstill, transportation to the feverish coasts of Guyanna: there is no\r\ndistinction between the mode used by the Convention and that of\r\nthe Directory, except the distinction between to kill and to cause\r\ndeath.[5184] Moreover, every brutality that can be employed to repress\r\nthe indignation of the proscribed by fear is exhausted on the way.--The\r\nfirst convoy which bears away, with thirteen others, Barthélémy, who\r\nnegotiated the treaty of Basle, Pichegru, the conqueror of Holland,\r\nLafond-Ladébat, president of the council of the Five Hundred,\r\nBarbé-Marbois, president of the council of the Ancients, was at first\r\nprovided with carriages.[5185] An order of the Directory substitutes for\r\nthese the prison van, an iron car with one door bolted and padlocked,\r\nand, overhead, openings through which the rain poured in streams, and\r\nwith common boards for seats. This lumbering machine without springs\r\nrolls along at a fast trot along the ruts in the road, each jolt sending\r\nthe condemned inmates against the hard oak sides and roof; one of these,\r\non reaching Blois, \"shows his black-and-blue elbows.\" The man selected\r\nto command this escort is the vilest and most brutal reprobate in the\r\narmy, Dutertre, a coppersmith foreman before the Revolution, next an\r\nofficer and sentenced to be put in irons for stealing in the La Vendée\r\nwar, and such a natural robber that he again robs his men of their pay\r\non the road; he is evidently qualified for his work. On stopping at\r\nBlois, \"he passes the night in an orgy with his brothers and friends,\"\r\nfellow-thieves and murderers as above described. He curses Madame\r\nBarbé-Marbois who comes to take leave of her husband, dismissing on the\r\nspot the commandant of the gendarmerie who supports her in a swoon, and,\r\nnoticing the respect and attentions which all the inhabitants, even the\r\nfunctionaries, show to the prisoners, he cries out, \"Well, what airs and\r\ngraces for people that will perhaps be dead in three or four days!\" On\r\nthe vessel which transports them, and still in sight of Rochelle, a boat\r\nis observed rowing vigorously to overtake them and they hear a shout\r\nof \"I am Lafond-Ladébat's son! Allow me to embrace my father!\" A\r\nspeaking-trumpet from the vessel replies: \"Keep away or you'll be fired\r\non!\"--Their cabins, on the voyage, are noxious; they are not allowed to\r\nbe on deck more than four at a time, one hour in the morning and an hour\r\nin the evening. The sailors and soldiers are forbidden to speak to them;\r\ntheir food consists of a sailor's ration, and this is spoilt; toward\r\nthe end of the voyage they are starved. In Guyanna they are allowed\r\none candle to a mess, and no table-linen; they lack water, or it is not\r\ndrinkable; out of sixteen taken to Sinnamary only two survive.\r\n\r\nThose who are deported the following year, priests, monks, deputies,\r\njournalists and artisans accused of emigration, fare worse. On all\r\nthe roads leading to Rochefort, sorrowful crowds are seen on carts or\r\ntramping along in files, on foot, the same as former chains of convicts.\r\n\"An old man of eighty-two, Monsieur Dulaurent of Quimper, thus traverses\r\nfour departments,\" in irons which strangle him. Following upon this, the\r\npoor creatures, between the decks of the \"Décade\" and the \"Bayonnaise,\"\r\ncrammed in, suffocated through lack of air and by the torrid heat, badly\r\ntreated and robbed, die of hunger or asphyxia, while Guyanna completes\r\nthe work of the voyage: out of 193 conveyed on board the 'Décade,\" only\r\n39 remain at the end of twenty-two months, and of the 120 brought by the\r\n'Bayonnaise,\" only one is left.--Meanwhile, in France, in the casemates\r\nof the islands of Rhé and Oléron, over twelve hundred priests become\r\nstifled or rot away, while, on all sides, the military commissioners in\r\nthe departments shoot down vigorously. At Paris, and in its environs,\r\nat Marseilles, Lyons, Bordeaux, Rennes, and in most of the large towns,\r\nsudden arrests and clandestine abductions go on multiplying.[5186]\r\n\"Nobody, on retiring to rest, is sure of awaking in freedom the next\r\nmorning.... From Bayonne to Brussels, there is but one sentiment, that\r\nof unbounded consternation. No one dares either to speak to, encounter,\r\nlook at or help one another. Everybody keeps aloof, trembles and hides\r\naway.\"--So that through this third offensive reaction, the Jacobin\r\nConquest is completed, and the conquering band, the new feudalism,\r\nbecomes a fixed installation. \"All who pass here,\" writes a Tours\r\nhabitant, \"state that there is no difference in the country between\r\nthese times and Robespierre's[5187]..... It is certain that the soil\r\nis not tenable, and that the people are continually threatened with\r\nexactions as in a conquered country.... Proprietors are crushed down\r\nwith impositions to such an extent that they cannot meet their daily\r\nexpenses, nor pay the cost of cultivation. In some of my old parishes\r\nthe imposition takes about thirteen out of twenty sous of an income...\r\nThe interest on money amounts to four per cent. a month... Tours, a prey\r\nto the terrorists who devour the department and hold all the offices,\r\nis in the most deplorable state; every family at all well-off, every\r\nmerchant, every trader, is leaving it.\"--The veteran pillagers and\r\nmurderers, the squireens, (hobereaux) of the reign of Terror, again\r\nappear and resume their fiefs. At Toulouse, it is Barrau, a shoemaker,\r\nfamous up to 1792 for his fury under Robespierre, and Desbarreaux,\r\nanother madman of 1793, formerly an actor playing the parts of valet,\r\ncompelled in 1795 to demand pardon of the audience on his knees on the\r\nstage, and, not obtaining it, driven out of the house, and now\r\nfilling the office of cashier in the theatre and posing as department\r\nadministrator. At Blois, we find the ignoble or atrocious characters\r\nwith whom we are familiar, the assassins and robbers Hézine, Giot,\r\nVenaille, Bézard, Berger, and Gidouin.[5188] Immediately after\r\nFructidor, they stirred up their usual supporters against the first\r\nconvoy of the deported, \"the idlers, the rabble of the harbor, and the\r\ndregs of the people,\" who overwhelmed them with insults. On this new\r\ndemonstration of patriotism the government restores to them their\r\nadministrative or judicial \"satrapies, and, odious as they are, they are\r\nendured and obeyed, with the mute and mournful obedience of despair.\"\r\nThe soul sinks[5189] on daily perusing the executions of conscripts\r\nand émigrés, and on seeing those condemned to transportation constantly\r\npassing by.... All who displease the government are set down on\r\nthese lists of the dead, so-called émigrés, this or that curé who is\r\nnotoriously known not to have left the department.\" It is impossible\r\nfor honest people to vote at the primary assemblies; consequently,\r\n\"the elections are frightful. The \"brothers\" and their friends loudly\r\nproclaim that neither nobles, priests, proprietors, merchants, nor\r\njustice are wanted; everything is to be given up to pillage.\" Let France\r\nperish rather than accept their domination. \"The wretches have announced\r\nthat they will not give up their places without overthrowing all,\r\ndestroying palaces and setting Paris on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Enforcement of Pure Jacobinism.\r\n\r\n     Application and aggravation of the laws of the reign of\r\n     Terror.--Measures taken to impose civic religion.--Arrest,\r\n     transportation, and execution of Priests.--Ostracism\r\n     proposed against the entire anti-Jacobin class.--The nobles\r\n     or the ennobled, not émigrés, are declared foreigners.\r\n     --Decrees against émigrés of every class.--Other steps taken\r\n     against remaining proprietors.--Bankruptcy, forced loan,\r\n     hostages.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that with pure Jacobins one notes the re-appearance of\r\nthe pure Jacobinism, the egalitarian and anti-Christian socialism,\r\nthe programme of the funereal year; in short, the rigid, plain,\r\nexterminating ideas which the sect gathers together, like daggers\r\nencrusted with gore, from the cast-off robes of Robespierre,\r\nBillaud-Varennes and Collot d'Herbois.[5190]\r\n\r\nIn the forefront appears the fixed and favorite idea of the\r\nold-fashioned philosophism. By that I mean the consistent and decreed\r\nplan to found a lay religion, and impose the observances and dogmas\r\nof its theories on twenty-six millions of Frenchmen, and, consequently\r\nextirping Christianity, its worship and its clergy. The inquisitors who\r\nhold office multiply, with extraordinary persistence and minuteness,\r\nproscriptions and vigorous measures for the forcible conversion of\r\nthe nation. The aim is to substitute the improvised rites of a logical\r\nabstraction mechanically elaborated in the closet for the tender\r\nemotions nourished by the customs of eighteen centuries.--Never did the\r\ndull imagination of a third-rate scholar and classic poetaster, never\r\ndid the grotesque solemnity of a pedant fond of his phrases, never did\r\nthe irritating hardness of the narrow and stubborn devotee display with\r\ngreater sentimental bombast and more administrative officiousness than\r\nin the decrees of the Legislative Corps,[5191] in the acts passed by\r\nthe Directory and in the instructions issued by the ministers Sotin,\r\nLetourneur, Lambrechts, Duval and François de Neufchateau. War on\r\nSunday, on the old calendar and on fasting, obligatory rest on the\r\ndécadi under penalty of fine and imprisonment,[5192] obligatory fêtes on\r\nthe anniversaries of January 21 and Fructidor 18, participation of\r\nall functionaries with their cult, obligatory attendance of public and\r\nprivate instructors with their pupils of both sexes at civic ceremonies,\r\nan obligatory liturgy with catechisms and programmes sent from\r\nParis, rules for scenic display and for singings, readings, postures,\r\nacclamations and imprecations. One might shrug his shoulders at these\r\nprescriptions of cuistres and these parades of puppets, if, behind the\r\napostles who compose moral allegories, we did not detect the persecutor\r\nwho imprisons, tortures and murders.--By the decree of Fructidor 19, not\r\nonly were all the laws of the reign of Terror against unsworn priests,\r\ntheir harborers and their followers, enforced again, but the Directory\r\narrogated to itself the right of banishing, \"through individual acts\r\npassed for cause,\" every ecclesiastic \"who disturbed the public peace,\"\r\nthat is to say who exercised his ministry and preached his faith;[5193]\r\nand, moreover, the right of shooting down, within twenty-four hours,\r\nevery priest who, banished by the laws of 1792 and 1793, has remained in\r\nor returned to France. Almost all the ecclesiastics, even those who\r\nare sworn, are comprised within the first category; the administration\r\nenumerates 366 in the department of Doubs alone,[5194] and 556 in that\r\nof Hérault. Thousands of ecclesiastics are comprised in the second\r\ncategory; the administration enumerates over 800 who, returned from the\r\nfrontier of Spain alone, still wander about the southern departments.\r\nOn the strength of this the moralists in office proclaim a hunt for the\r\nblack game in certain places, an universal destruction without exception\r\nor reprieve. For instance, in Belgium, recently incorporated with\r\nFrance, the whole of the regular and secular clergy is proscribed en\r\nmasse and tracked for transportation; 560 ecclesiastics in \"Ourthe and\r\nthe forests\", 539 in Escaut, 883 in Jemmapes, 884 in Sambre-et-Meuse,\r\n925 in la Lys, 957 in Deux-Nèthes, 1,043 in Meuse-Inférieure, 1,469 in\r\nDyle, in all 7,260, without counting the missing names.[5195] A number\r\nof them escape abroad or hide away; but the rest are caught, and quite\r\nenough of them to load and fill the carts constantly.--\"Not a day\r\npasses,\" says an inhabitant of Blois,[5196] \"when from seven to twenty\r\nand more are lodged at the Carmelites.\" The next day they set out for\r\nthe casemates of Rhé and Oléron, or for the Sinnamary marshes, where it\r\nis known what becomes of them: after a few months, three-fourths of them\r\nlie in the cemetery.--In the interior, from time to time, some are\r\nshot as an example--seven at Besançon, one at Lyons, three in the\r\nBouches-du-Rhône, while the opponents of fanaticism, the official\r\nphilanthropists, the enlightened deists of Fructidor, use all these\r\ndisguised or declared murders as a basis on which to rear the cult of\r\nReason.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to consolidate the worship of Reason with the reign of\r\nEquality, which is the second article in the Jacobin credo. The object\r\nnow is to mow down all the heads which rise above the common level,\r\nand, this time, to mow them down, not one by one, but in large groups.\r\nSaint-Just himself had only covertly proposed so extensive and so\r\nsweeping an operation. Siéyès, Merlin de Douai, Reubell, Chazal,\r\nChénier, and Boulay de la Meurthe, more openly and decidedly insist on\r\na radical amputation. According to them,[5197] it is necessary \"to\r\nregulate this ostracism,\" by banishing \"all those whose prejudices,\r\npretensions, even existence, in a word, are incompatible with republican\r\ngovernment.\" That is to say, not alone priests, but likewise nobles\r\nand the ennobled, all parliamentarians, those who are well-off and\r\ndistinguished among the bourgeoisie and former notables, about two\r\nhundred thousand property-holders, men and women; in short, all\r\nwho still remained among those oppressed and ruined by the\r\nRevolution.[5198]--The proposal was turned down by the ex-noble Barras\r\nand by the public out-cry \"of merchants and workmen themselves,\" and\r\nbanishment is replaced by civic degradation. Henceforth,[5199] every\r\nnoble or ennobled person, even if he has not left the territory, even if\r\nhe has constantly and punctually obeyed revolutionary laws, even if he\r\nbe not related to, or allied with, any émigré, finds himself deprived\r\nof his quality as a Frenchman. The fact alone of his being ennobled\r\nor noble before 1789, obliged him to be naturalized according to legal\r\nforms and conditions.--As to the 150,000 gentlemen, artisans and farmers\r\nwho have emigrated or who have been accused of emigration, if they\r\nhave returned to, or remain in France, they are to leave Paris and all\r\ncommunes above 20,000 souls within twenty-four hours, and France in\r\nfifteen days. If not, they are to be arrested, brought before the\r\nmilitary commissions and shot on the spot;[51100] in fact, in many\r\nplaces, at Paris, Besançon and Lyons, they are shot.--Now, a large\r\nnumber of pretended emigrants, who had never left France,[51101] nor\r\neven their province, nor even their commune, and whose names have been\r\nput on the lists simply to strip them of their property, find that they\r\nare no longer protected either by the constancy or the notoriety of\r\ntheir residence. The new law is no sooner read than they begin to\r\nimagine the firing squad; the natal soil is too warm for them and they\r\nspeedily emigrate.[51102] On the other hand, once the name is down\r\non the list, rightly or wrongly, it is never removed. The government\r\npurposely refuses to strike it off, while two decrees are applied which\r\nrender its removal impossible;[51103] each name maintained on the list\r\nof spoliation and death relieves the Revolution of a probable adversary,\r\nand places one more domain at its disposal.\r\n\r\nThe Directory renews and aggravates the measures of the Convention\r\nagainst the remainder of the property-holders: there is no longer a\r\ndisguised but a declared bankruptcy. 386,000 fund-holders and pensioners\r\nare deprived of two-thirds of their revenue and of their capital.[51104]\r\nA forced loan of 100 millions is levied progressively, and wholly on\r\n\"the well-off class.\" Finally, there is the law of hostages, this being\r\natrocious, conceived in the spirit of September, 1792, suggested by the\r\nfamous motions of Collot d'Herbois against those in confinement, and\r\nof Billaud-Varennes against the youth, Louis XVII., but extended,\r\nelaborated and drawn up with cool legal acumen, and enforced and applied\r\nwith the foresight of an administrator.--Remark that, without counting\r\nthe Belgian departments, where an extensive insurrection is under way\r\nand spreading, more than one-half of the territory falls under the\r\noperation of this law. for, out of the eighty-six departments of\r\nFrance,[51105] properly so called, forty-five are at this moment,\r\naccording to the terms of the decree,[51106] \"declared to be in a\r\nstate of civil uprising.\" Actually, in these departments, according to\r\nofficial reports, armed mobs of conscripts are resisting the authorities\r\ncharged with recruiting them, bands of two hundred, three hundred and\r\neight hundred men overrun the country, troops of brigands force open\r\nthe prisons, assassinate the gendarmes and set their inmates free; the\r\ntax-collectors are robbed, killed or maimed, municipal officers slain,\r\nproprietors ransomed, estates devastated, and diligences stopped on the\r\nhighways.\" Now, in all these cases, in all the departments, cantons or\r\ncommunes, three classes of persons, at first the relations and allies\r\nof the émigrés, next the former nobles and ennobled, and finally the\r\n\"fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers of persons who, without\r\nbeing ex-nobles or relations of émigrés,\" nevertheless form a part of\r\nthe bands or mobs, are declared \"personally and civilly responsible\" for\r\nthe violent acts committed. Even when these acts are only \"imminent,\"\r\nthe administration of the department must, in its report, give a list\r\nof all the men and women who are responsible; these are to be taken as\r\n\"hostages,\" and kept in confinement at their own expense in the local\r\njail. If they escape, they must be put on the same footing as émigrés,\r\nthat is to say punished with death. If any damage is sustained, they\r\nare to pay costs; if any murder is committed or abduction effected,\r\nfour amongst them must be deported. Observe, moreover, that the local\r\nauthorities are obliged, under severe penalties, to execute the law at\r\nonce. Note that, at this date, they are ultra Jacobin, since to inscribe\r\non the list of hostages, not a noble or a bourgeois, but an honest\r\npeasant or respectable artisan, it suffices for these local sovereigns\r\nto designate his son or grandson, who might either be absent, fugitive\r\nor dead, as being \"notoriously \"insurgent or refractory. The fortunes,\r\nliberties and lives of every individual in easy circumstances are thus\r\nlegally surrendered to the despotism, cupidity and hostility of the\r\nlevelers in office.--Contemporaries estimate that 200,000 persons were\r\naffected by this law.[51107] The Directory, during the three months of\r\nexistence yet remaining to it, enforces it in seventeen departments;\r\nthousands of women and old men are arrested, put in confinement, and\r\nruined, while several are sent off to Cayenne--and this is called\r\nrespect for the rights of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Propaganda and Foreign Conquests.\r\n\r\n     Propaganda and foreign conquests.--Proximity and advantages\r\n     of Peace.--Motives of the Fructidorians for breaking off\r\n     peace negotiations with England, and for abandoning the\r\n     invasion of foreign countries.--How they found new\r\n     republics.--How governed.--Estimate of foreign rapine.\r\n     --Number of French lives sacrificed in the war.\r\n\r\nAfter the system which the Fructidoreans establish in France, we may\r\nconsider the system they impose abroad--always the same contrast,\r\nbetween the name and the thing, the same phrases covering the same\r\nmisdeeds, and, under proclamations of liberty the institution of\r\nbrigandage.--Undoubtedly, in any invaded province which thus passes from\r\nan old to a new despotism, fine words cleverly spoken produce at first\r\nthe intended effect. But, in a few weeks or months, the ransomed,\r\nenlisted and forcibly \"Frenchified\" inhabitants, discover that the\r\nrevolutionary right is much more oppressive, more harassing and more\r\nrapacious than divine right.\r\n\r\nIt is the right of the strongest. The reigning Jacobins know no other,\r\nabroad as well as at home, and, in the use they make of it, they are not\r\nrestrained like ordinary statesmen, by a thorough comprehension of the\r\ninterests of the State, by experience and tradition, by far-reaching\r\nplans, by an estimate of present and future strength. Being a sect, they\r\nsubordinate France to their dogmas, and, with the narrow views, pride\r\nand arrogance of the sectary, they profess the same intolerance,\r\nthe same need of domination and his instincts for propagandas and\r\ninvasion.--This belligerent and tyrannical spirit they had already\r\ndisplayed under the Legislative Assembly, and they are intoxicated with\r\nit under the Convention. After Thermidor,[51108] and after Vendémiaire,\r\nthey remained the same; they became rigid against \"the faction of old\r\nboundaries,\" and against any moderate policy; at first, against the\r\npacific minority, then against the pacific majority, against the\r\nentreaties of all France, against their own military director, \"the\r\norganizer of victory \" Carnot, who, as a good Frenchman, is not desirous\r\nof gratuitously increasing the embarrassments of France nor of taking\r\nmore than France could usefully and surely keep.--If, before Fructidor,\r\nhis three Jacobin colleagues, Reubell, Barras and La Révellière, broke\r\nwith him, it was owing not merely to inside matters, but also to outside\r\nmatters, as he opposed their boundless violent purposes. They were\r\nfurious on learning the preliminary treaty of Leoben, so advantageous\r\nto France; they insulted Carnot, who had effected it;[51109] when\r\nBarthélémy, the ablest and most deserving diplomat in France, became\r\ntheir colleague, his recommendations, so sensible and so well warranted,\r\nobtained from them no other welcome than derision.[51110] They already\r\ndesire, and obstinately, to get possession of Switzerland, lay hands on\r\nHamburg, \"humiliate England,\" and \"persevere in the unlucky system of\r\nthe Committee of Public Safety,\" that is to say, in the policy of war,\r\nconquest and propaganda. Now that the 18th Fructidor is accomplished,\r\nBarthélémy deported, and Carnot in flight, this policy is going to be\r\napplied everywhere.\r\n\r\nNever had peace been so near at hand;[51111] they almost had)it in their\r\ngrasp; conference at Lille it was only necessary to take complete\r\nhold of it. England, the last and most tenacious of her enemies, was\r\ndisarming; not only did she accept the aggrandizement of France, the\r\nacquisition of Belgium and the left bank of the Rhine, the avowed as\r\nwell as the disguised annexations, the great Republic as patron and the\r\nsmaller ones as clients, Holland, Genoa, and the Cis-Alpine country,\r\nbut, again, she restored all her own conquests, all the French colonies,\r\nall the Dutch colonies, except the Cape of Good Hope,[51112] and all the\r\nSpanish colonies except Trinidad. All that amour-propre could demand was\r\nobtained, and they obtained more than could be prudently expected; there\r\nwas not a competent and patriotic statesman in France who would not\r\nhave signed the treaty with the greatest satisfaction.--But the motives\r\nwhich, before Fructidor, animated Carnot and Barthélémy, the motives\r\nwhich, after Fructidor, animated Colchen and Maret, do not animate the\r\nFructidoreans. France is of but little consequence to them; they are\r\nconcerned only for their faction, for power, and for their own persons.\r\nLa Révellière, president of the Directory, through vainglory, \"wanted\r\nto have his name go with the general peace;\" but he is controlled by\r\nBarras, who needs war in order to fish in troubled waters,[51113] and\r\nespecially by Reubell, a true Jacobin in temperament and intellect,\r\n\"ignorant and vain, with the most vulgar prejudices of an uneducated\r\nand illiterate man,\" one of those coarse, violent, narrow\r\nsectarians anchored on a fixed idea and whose \"principles consist\r\nin revolutionizing everything with cannon-balls without examining\r\nwherefore.\"[51114] There is no need of knowing the wherefore; the animal\r\ninstinct of self-preservation suffices to impel the Jacobins onward,\r\nand, for a long time, their clear-sighted men, among them Siéyès, their\r\nthinker and oracle, have told them that \"if they make peace they are\r\nlost.\"[51115]--To exercise their violence within they require peril\r\nwithout; lacking the pretext of public safety they cannot prolong their\r\nusurpation, their dictatorship, their despotism, their inquisition,\r\ntheir proscriptions, their exactions. Suppose that peace is effected,\r\nwill it be possible for the government, hated and despised as it is,\r\nto maintain and elect its minions against public clamor at the coming\r\nelections? Will so many retired generals consent to live on half-pay,\r\nindolent and obedient? Will Hoche, so ardent and so absolute, will\r\nBonaparte, who already meditates his coup-d'état,[51116] be willing to\r\nstand sentry for four petty lawyers or litterateurs without any titles\r\nand for Barras, a street-general, who never saw a regular battle?\r\nMoreover on this skeleton of France, desiccated by five years of\r\nspoliation, how can the armed swarm be fed even provisionally, the\r\nswarm, which, for two years past, subsists only through devouring\r\nneighboring nations? Afterwards, how disband four hundred thousand\r\nhungry officers and soldiers? And how, with an empty Treasury, supply\r\nthe millions which, by a solemn decree, under the title of a national\r\nrecompense, have once more just been promised to them.[51117] Nothing\r\nbut a prolonged war, or designedly begun again, a war indefinitely and\r\nsystematically extended, a war supported by conquest and pillage\r\ncan give armies food, keep generals busy, the nation resigned, the\r\nmaintenance of power of the ruling faction, and secure to the Directors\r\ntheir places, their profits, their dinners and their mistresses.\r\nAnd this is why they, at first, break with England through repeated\r\nexactions, and then with Austria and the Emperor, through premeditated\r\nattacks, and again with Switzerland, Piedmont, Tuscany, Naples, Malta,\r\nRussia and even the Porte.[51118] At length, the veils fall and the\r\ncharacter of the sect stands out nakedly. Defense of the country,\r\ndeliverance of the people, all its grand phrases disappear in the realm\r\nof empty words. It reveals itself just as it is, an association of\r\npirates on a cruise, who after ravaging their own coast, go further off\r\nand capture bodies and goods, men and things. Having eaten France, the\r\nParisian band undertakes to eat all Europe, \"leaf by leaf, like the head\r\nof an artichoke.\"[51119]\r\n\r\nWhy recount the tragic comedy they play at home and which they repeat\r\nabroad? The piece abroad is the same as that played in Paris for the\r\npast eight years,[51120] an absurd, hasty translation in Flemish,\r\nDutch, German, and Italian, a local adaptation, just as it happens, with\r\nvariations, elisions and abbreviations, but always with the same\r\nending, a shower of blows with gun and sword on all property-owners,\r\ncommunities, and individuals, compelling the surrender of their purses\r\nand valuables of every description, and which they gave up, even to\r\nremaining without a sou or even a shirt. As a rule, the nearest general,\r\nor resident titulary in every small state which has to be turned to\r\naccount, stirs up malcontents against the established authorities,\r\nnever lacking under the ancient régime, especially all social outcasts,\r\nadventurers, coffee-house ranters and young hot-heads, in short the\r\nJacobins of the country; these, to the French representative, are\r\nhenceforth the people of the country, if only a knot of the vilest sort.\r\nThe legal authorities are forbidden to repress them, or punish them;\r\nthey are inviolable. Employing threats or main force, he interferes in\r\ntheir support, or to sanction their assaults; he breaks up, or\r\nobliges them to break up, the vital organ of society; here, royalty or\r\naristocracy, there, the senate and the magistracy, everywhere the old\r\nhierarchy, all cantonal, provincial and municipal statutes and secular\r\nfederation or constitutions. He then inaugurates on this cleared ground\r\nthe government of Reason, that is to say, some artificial imitation\r\nof the French constitution; he himself, to this end, appoints the new\r\nmagistrates. If he allows them to be elected, it is by his clients and\r\nunder his bayonets; this constitutes a subject republic under the name\r\nof an ally, and which commissioners dispatched from Paris manage to\r\nthe beat of the drum. The revolutionary régime with anti-Christian\r\ndespoiling and leveling laws, is despotically applied. The 18th of\r\nFructidor is carried out over and over again; the constitution is\r\nrevised according to the last Parisian pattern, while the Legislative\r\nCorps and Directory are repeatedly purged in military fashion.[51121]\r\nOnly valets are tolerated at the head of it: its army is added to the\r\nFrench army; twenty thousand Swiss are drafted in Switzerland and made\r\nto fight against the Swiss and the friends of Switzerland. Belgium,\r\nincorporated with France, is subjected to the conscription. National and\r\nreligious sentiment suppressed, exploited, offended, to the extend of\r\nstirring up insurrections,[51122] religious and national. Five or six\r\nrural and lasting Vendées take place in Belgium, Switzerland, Piedmont,\r\nVenetia, Lombardy, the Roman States and Naples, while fire, pillaging\r\nand shooting are employed to repress them. Any description of this would\r\nbe feeble; statements in figures are necessary and I can give but two.\r\n\r\nOne of them is the list of robberies committed abroad,[51123] and this\r\ncomprises only the rapine executed according to order; it omits private\r\nplunderings without any orders by officers, generals, soldiers and\r\ncommissaries; these are enormous, but cannot be estimated. The only\r\napproximate total which can be arrived at, is the authentic list of\r\nrobberies which the Jacobin corsair, authorized by letters of marque,\r\nhad already committed in December, 1798, outside of France, on public\r\nor on private parties; exactions in coin imposed in Belgium, Holland,\r\nGermany and Italy, amounting to 655 millions; seizure and removal of\r\ngold and silver objects, plate, jewels, works of art and other precious\r\nobjects, 305 millions; requisitions of provisions, 361 millions;\r\nconfiscations of the property, real estate and movables, of deposed\r\nsovereigns, that of the regular and secular clergy, that of corporations\r\nand associations even laic, of absent or fugitive proprietors, 700\r\nmillions; in all, in three years 2 billion livres.--If we closely\r\nexamine this monstrous sum, we find, as in the coffers of an Algerian\r\npirate, a booty which up to this time, belligerent Christians,\r\ncommanders of regular armies, would have shrunk from taking, and on\r\nwhich the Jacobin chiefs incontinently and preferably lay hands:\r\n\r\n* the plate and furniture of churches in the Netherlands, in Liège, and\r\nin the Electoral sections of the Lower Rhine, 25 millions;\r\n\r\n* the plate and furniture of churches in Lombardy, in the three\r\nLegations, in the State of Venice, in Modena, and the States of the\r\nChurch, 65 millions;\r\n\r\n* diamonds, plate, gold crosses and other depots of the Monts.de-piété\r\nat Milan, Bologna, Ravenna, Modena, Venice and Rome, 56 millions;\r\n\r\n* furniture and works of art at Milan and in other towns, 5 millions;\r\n\r\n* furniture and works of art in the Venetian towns and palaces of\r\nBrenta, 6, 500,000;\r\n\r\n* the spoils of Rome sacked, as formerly by the mercenaries of the Duc\r\nde Bourbon, collections of antiques, pictures, bronzes, statues, the\r\ntreasures of the Vatican and of palaces, jewels, even the pastoral ring\r\nof the Pope, which the Directorial commissary himself wrests from the\r\nPope's finger, 43 millions,\r\n\r\nand all this without counting analogous articles, and especially\r\ndirect assessments levied on this or that individual as rich or a\r\nproprietor,[51124] veritable ransoms, similar to those demanded by the\r\nbandits of Calabria and Greece, extorted from any traveler they surprise\r\non the highway.--\r\n\r\nNaturally operations of this kind cannot be carried on without\r\ninstruments of constraint; the Parisian manipulators must have military\r\nautomatons, \"saber hilts\" in sufficient numbers. Now, through constant\r\nslashing, a good many hilts break, and the broken ones must be replaced;\r\nin October, 1798, 200,000 new ones are required, while the young men\r\ndrafted for the purpose fail to answer the summons and fly, and even\r\nresist with arms, especially in Belgium,[51125] by maintaining a\r\nrevolt for many months, with this motto: \"Better die here than\r\nelsewhere.\"[51126] To compel their return, they are hunted down and\r\nbrought to the depot with their hands tied. If they hide away, soldiers\r\nare stationed in their parents' houses. If the conscript or drafted man\r\nhas sought refuge in a foreign country, even in an allied country as in\r\nSpain, he is officially inscribed on the list of émigrés, and therefore,\r\nin case of return, shot within twenty-four hours; meanwhile, his\r\nproperty is sequestrated and likewise that of \"his father, mother and\r\ngrandparents.\"[51127]--\"Formerly,\" says a contemporary, \"reason and\r\nphilosophy thundered against the rigors of punishment inflicted on\r\ndeserters; but, since French reason has perfected Liberty it is no\r\nlonger the small class of regular soldiers whose evasion is punished\r\nwith death, but an entire generation. An extreme penalty no longer\r\nsuffices for these legislative philanthropists: they add confiscation,\r\nthey despoil parents for the misdemeanors of their children, and render\r\neven women responsible for a military and personal offence.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the admirable calculation of the Directory--that, if it loses\r\na soldier it gains a patrimony, and if the patrimony fails, it recovers\r\nthe soldier: in any event, it fills its coffers and its ranks, while\r\nthe faction, well supplied with men, may continue turning all Europe to\r\naccount, wasting, in the operation, as many French lives as it pleases;\r\nrequiring more than one hundred thousand men per annum, which, including\r\nthose which the Convention has squandered, makes nearly nine hundred\r\nthousand in eight years.[51128] At this moment the five Directors\r\nand their minions are completing the mowing down of the virile, adult\r\nstrength of the nation,[51129] and we have seen through what motives\r\nand for what object. I do not believe that any civilized nation was ever\r\nsacrificed in the same way, for such a purpose and by such rulers: the\r\ncrippled remnant of a faction and sect, some hundreds of preachers\r\nno longer believing in their creed, usurpers as despised as they are\r\ndetested, second-rate parvenus raised their heads not through their\r\ncapacity or merit, but through the blind upheavals of a revolution,\r\nswimming on the surface for lack of weight, and, like foul scum, borne\r\nalong to the crest of the wave-such are the wretches who strangle France\r\nunder the pretence of setting her free, who bleed her under the pretence\r\nof making her strong, who conquer populations under the pretence of\r\nemancipating them, who despoil people under the pretence of regenerating\r\nthem, and who, from Brest to Lucerne, from Amsterdam to Naples, slay and\r\nrob wholesale, systematically, to strengthen the incoherent dictatorship\r\nof their brutality, folly and corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. National Disgust.\r\n\r\n     National antipathy to the established order of things.\r\n     --Paralysis of the State.--Internal discords of the Jacobin\r\n     party.--Coup d'État of Floréal 22, year VI.--Coup d'État of\r\n     Prairial 30, year VII.--Impossibility of establishing a\r\n     viable government.--Plans of Barras and Siéyès.\r\n\r\nOnce again has triumphant Jacobinism shown its anti-social nature, its\r\ncapacity for destruction, its impotence to re-construct.--The nation,\r\nvanquished and discouraged, no longer resists, but, if it submits it\r\nis as to a pestilence, while its transportations, its administrative\r\npurifications, its decrees placing towns in a state of siege, its daily\r\nviolence, only exasperate the mute antipathy.\r\n\r\n\"Everything has been done,\" says an honest Jacobin,[51130] \"to alienate\r\nthe immense majority of citizens from the Revolution and the Republic,\r\neven those who had contributed to the downfall of the monarchy...\r\nInstead of seeing the friends of the Revolution increase as we have\r\nadvanced on the revolutionary path.... we see our ranks thinning out and\r\nthe early defenders of liberty deserting our cause.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the Jacobins to rally France and reconcile her\r\nto their ways and dogmas, and on this point their own agents leave no\r\nillusion.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" writes the Troyes agent,[51131] \"public spirit not only needs\r\nto be revived, but it needs to be re-created. Scarcely one-fifth of the\r\ncitizens side with the government, and this fifth is hated and despised\r\nby the majority.... Who attend upon and celebrate the national fêtes?\r\nPublic functionaries whom the law summons to them, and many of these\r\nfêtes often dispense with them. It is the same public spirit which does\r\nnot allow honest folks to take part in them and in the addresses made at\r\nthem, and which keeps those women away who ought to be their principal\r\nornament.... The same public spirit looks only with indifference and\r\ncontempt on the republican, heroic actions given on the stage, and\r\nwelcomes with transport all that bears any allusion to royalty and the\r\nancient régime. The parvenus themselves of the Revolution, the generals,\r\nthe deputies, dislike Jacobin institutions;[51132] they place children\r\nin the chapel schools and send them to the confessional, while the\r\ndeputies who, in '92 and '93, showed the most animosity to priests,\r\ndo not consider their daughter well brought up unless she has made her\r\nfirst communion. \"--\r\n\r\nThe little are still more hostile than the great.\r\n\r\n\"A fact unfortunately too true,\" writes the commissary of a rural\r\ncanton,[51133] \"is that the people en masse seem not to want any of our\r\ninstitutions.... It is considered well-bred, even among country folks,\r\nto show disdain for everything characteristic of republican usages...\r\nOur rich farmers, who have profited most by the Revolution, are the\r\nbitterest enemies of its forms: any citizen who depended on them for the\r\nslightest favor and thought it well to address them as citizen, would be\r\nturned out of their houses.\"\r\n\r\nTo call someone Citizen is an insult, and patriot a still greater one;\r\nfor this term signifies Jacobin, partisan, murderer, robber[51134]\r\nand, as they were then styled, \"man-eaters.\" What is worse is that a\r\nfalsification of the word has brought discredit on the thing.--Nobody,\r\nsay the reports, troubles himself about the general interest;[51135]\r\nnobody will serve as national guard or mayor.\r\n\r\n\"Public spirit has fallen into such a lethargic slumber as to make one\r\nfear its complete collapse. Our successes or our failures excite neither\r\nuneasiness nor pleasure.[51136] It seems, on reading the accounts of\r\nbattles, as if it were the history of another people. The changes that\r\ntake place within our borders no longer excite any emotion; one asks\r\nout of curiosity, one is answered without any interest, one learns with\r\nindifference.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pleasures of Paris[51137] are not disturbed a moment by any the\r\nCrises which succeed each other, nor by those which are feared. Never\r\nwere the theatres and public entertainments more frequented. At the\r\n'Tivoli,' it is said that it is going to be worse than ever; the country\r\n(patrie) is called la patraque, and dancing goes on.\"\r\n\r\nThis is understandable enough; how can one interest one's self in the\r\npublic weal when there is none, when the common patrimony of all has\r\nbecome the private property of a gang, when this gang is devouring\r\nor wasting all in the interior and outside the frontier, where it is\r\nplaying heads or tails? The Jacobins, through their final victory,\r\nhave dried patriotism up, that is to say, the deep inward spring which\r\nsupplies the substance, the vitality and the force of the State.--In\r\nvain do they multiply rigorous decrees and imperious prescriptions;\r\neach energetic blow is absorbed by the general and mute resistance of\r\nintentional passivity and of insurmountable disgust. They do not obtain\r\nfrom their subjects any of that unconscious obedience, that degree\r\nof passive co-operation, without which the law remains a dead\r\nletter.[51138] Their Republic, so young,\r\n\r\n\"is attacked by that nameless malady which commonly attacks only old\r\ngovernments, a species of senile consumption to which one can give no\r\nother definition than that of the difficulty of living; nobody strives\r\nto overthrow it, although it seems to have lost the power of standing\r\nerect.\"[51139]\r\n\r\nNot only does their domination paralyze instead of animating the State,\r\nbut, with their own hands, they undermine the order they themselves have\r\nestablished. Whether legal or extra-legal, it makes no difference: under\r\ntheir rule, no constitution, made and remade, no government, not even\r\nthat of their leaders, can survive. Once masters of France, they quarrel\r\nover it amongst themselves, each claiming for himself the whole of the\r\nprey. Those who are in office want to stay there; those who are out want\r\nto get in. Thus is formed two factions, while each repeats against the\r\nother the coup d'état which both have together carried out against the\r\nnation.--According to the ruling clique, its adversaries are simply\r\n\"anarchists,\" former Septembriseurs, Robespierre's confederates, the\r\naccomplices of Babeuf, eternal conspirators. Now, as in the year VI.,\r\nthe five regents still keep the saber-hilt firm in their grasp, and can\r\ntherefore make the Legislative Corps to vote as they please. On the 22nd\r\nof Floréal, the government cancels, in whole or in part, in forty-five\r\ndepartments, the new elections, not alone those of representatives, but\r\nagain those of judges, public prosecutors, and the grand-jurymen.\r\nThen it dismisses the terrorist administrations in the departments and\r\ntowns.[51140]--According to their adversaries (la coterie gouvernée),\r\nthe Directory and its agents are false patriots, usurpers, oppressors,\r\ndespisers of the law, squanderers and inept politicians. As all this\r\nis true, and as the Directory, in the year VIII., used up through\r\nits twenty-one months of omnipotence, out of credit on account of its\r\nreverses, despised by its generals, hated by the beaten and unpaid army,\r\ndares no longer and can no longer raise the sword, the ultra Jacobins\r\nresume the offensive, have themselves elected through their kith and\r\nkin, re-conquer the majority in the Legislative Corps, and, in their\r\nturn, purge the Directory on the 30 of Prairial. Treilhard, Merlin de\r\nDouai, and La Revellière-Lepaux are driven out; narrow fanatics replace\r\nthem, Gohier, Moulins and Roger Ducos. Ghosts from the period of the\r\nTerror install themselves in the ministries, Robert Lindet in the\r\nTreasury, Fouché in the Police. Everywhere, in the departments, they put\r\nin or restore \"the exclusives,\" that is to say, the resolute scoundrels\r\nwho have proved their capacity.[51141] The Jacobins re-open their Club\r\nunder its old name in the hall of the Manége. Two directors and one\r\nhundred and fifty members of the Legislative Corps fraternize with\r\n\"all that the dregs of the people provide that is vilest and most\r\ndisgusting.\" Eulogies are here pronounced on Robespierre and on Babeuf\r\nhimself; they demand the levy en masse and the disarming of \"suspects.\"\r\nJourdan exclaims in a toast, \"Here's to the resurrection of pikes! May\r\nthey in the people's hands crush out all its enemies!\" In the council\r\nof the Five Hundred, the same Jourdan proposes in the tribune to declare\r\nthe \"country in danger,\" while the gang of shouting politicians, the\r\nbull-dogs of the streets and tribunes, gather around the hesitating\r\nrepresentatives and howl and threaten as in 1793.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, the régime of 1793 which is about to be set up in\r\nFrance?--Not even that one. Immediately after the victory, the victors\r\n30 of Prairial separated and formed two camps of enemies, watching each\r\nother with arms in hand, entrenched and making sorties on each other:\r\n\r\nOn one side are the simple bandits and the lowest of the populace, the\r\nfollowers of Marat, incorrigible monomaniacs, headstrong, conceited\r\nspirits proud of their crimes and disposed to repeat them rather than\r\nadmit their guilt, the dogmatic simpletons who go ahead with their eyes\r\nshut and who have forgotten everything and learnt nothing. On the other\r\nside, men still possessing common sense, and who have profited somewhat\r\nby experience, who know what a government of clubs and pikes leads to,\r\nwho fear for themselves and are unwilling to begin again, step by step,\r\nthe mad course on which at each stage, they have come near perishing.\r\n\r\nOn one side two members of the Directory, the minority of the Ancients,\r\nthe majority of the Five Hundred, and the vilest of the Parisian rabble.\r\nOn the other, the majority of the Ancients, the minority of the Five\r\nHundred and three members of the Directory, the latter supported by\r\ntheir executive staff.[51142]--\r\n\r\nWhich of the two troops will crush the other? Nobody knows; for most\r\nof them are ready to pass from one to the other camp according as the\r\nchances for success appear more or less great. And, from day to day,\r\nany defection amongst the Five Hundred, amongst the Ancients or in the\r\nDirectory, foreseen or not, may change a minority into a majority. Where\r\nwill the majority be to-morrow? From which side is the next coup d'état\r\nto come--Who will make it? Will it be the ultra Jacobins, and, through\r\nanother 9th of Thermidor, will they declare the mitigated Jacobins\r\n\"outlaws?\" Will it be the mitigated Jacobins, and, through another 18th\r\nof Fructidor, will they put the ultras under lock and key? If one or the\r\nother of these blows is struck, will it succeed? And if it succeeds will\r\na stable government be at last established? Siéyès well knows that\r\nit will not; he is farseeing in his acts, although chimerical in his\r\ntheories. In power himself, titular Director, counselor and guardian of\r\nthe intelligent republic against the stupid republic, he well knows that\r\nall of them, so long as they are republicans of both bands, take a road\r\nwithout an issue.[51143] Barras is of the same opinion, and taking time\r\nby the forelock, turns around and promises Louis XVIII. his co-operation\r\nin restoring the legitimate monarchy in exchange he receives letters\r\npatent granting him full pardon, exemption from all future prosecution\r\nand a promise of twelve millions.--Siéyès, more sagacious, seeks force\r\nwhere it exists, in the army; he prepares Joubert, sounds Moreati,\r\nthinks of Jourdan, of Bernadotte and of Macdonald, before surrendering\r\nhimself to Bonaparte; \"he requires a sword.\" Boulay de la Meurthe,\r\ncomparing in a pamphlet the English revolution with the French\r\nrevolution, announces and brings on the establishment of a military\r\nprotectorate.--\"The Constitution of the year III. will not work,\" said\r\nBaudin, one of the Five Hundred, to Cornet, one of the Ancients, \"only I\r\ndo not see where to find the executive arm.\" The Jacobin republic\r\nstill lives, and its servants, its doctors, already speak aloud of its\r\ninterment the same as strangers and heirs in the room of a dying man\r\nwho has become unconscious, like Tiberius when sinking in his palace\r\nat Misene.[51144]--If the expiring man does not go fast enough some one\r\nwill help him. The old monster, borne down with crimes and rotten\r\nwith vices, rattles in his throat on his purple cushions; his eyes are\r\nclosed, his pulse is feeble, and he gasps for breath. Here and there,\r\naround is bed, stand groups of those who minister to his debauches at\r\nCapri and his murders at Rome, his minions and executioners who publicly\r\ntake part in the new reign; the old one is finished; one need no longer\r\nbe circumspect and mute before corpse. Suddenly the dying man opens his\r\neyes, speaks and asks for food. The military tribune, \" the executive\r\narm,\" boldly clears the apartment; he throws a pile of bedclothes over\r\nthe old man's head and quickens the last sigh. Such is the final blow;\r\nan hour later and breathing stops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. Contrast between Civil and Military France.\r\n\r\n     Anti-social character of the sect and the faction.--Contrast\r\n     between civil and military France.--Elements of\r\n     reorganization in institutions, habits, and in military\r\n     sentiments.--Character of the régime instituted on the 18th\r\n     of Brumaire, year VIII.\r\n\r\nIf the Jacobin Republic dies, it is not merely on account of decay,\r\nnor because of its murders, but, and above all, because it is not\r\nborn viable: at the outset it harbored within itself a principle of\r\ndissolution an innate mortal poison, not alone for others but for\r\nitself.--That which maintains a political society is the mutual respect\r\nof its members, especially the respect of the governed for its rulers\r\nand of the rulers for the governed, and, therefore, habits of mutual\r\ntrust and confidence. On the part of the governed, a well-grounded\r\ncertainty that the rulers will not attack private rights, and, on the\r\npart of the rulers, a well-founded certainty that the governed will not\r\nattack public powers; both inwardly recognizing that these rights, more\r\nor less broad or restricted, are inviolable; that these powers, more\r\nor less ample or limited, are legitimate. Finally, each being convinced\r\nthat, in case of conflict, the trial will be conducted according to\r\nforms which law or custom provide; that pending the discussion, the\r\nstrongest will not abuse his strength, and that, when the discussion is\r\nover, the successful party will not wholly sacrifice the loser. Only on\r\nthis condition can there be harmony between governors and the governed,\r\nparticipation of all in the common work, internal tranquility, and,\r\naccordingly, stability, security, well-being and force. Without this\r\ndeep and persistent disposition of minds and hearts, the bond of union\r\namong men is absent. It constitutes the brightest of social sentiments;\r\nit may be said that this is the soul of which the State is the\r\nbody.--Now, in the Jacobin State, this soul has perished; it has not\r\ndied out through unforeseen accidents, but through a forced result of\r\nthe system, through a practical effect of the speculative theory, which,\r\nconverting each man into an absolute sovereign, sets every man warring\r\nagainst other men, and which, under the pretence of regenerating\r\nthe human species, lets loose, authorizes and consecrates the worst\r\ninstincts of human nature, all the lusts of license, tyranny and\r\ndomination.--In the name of a non-existent ideal people whom it declares\r\nsovereign, the Jacobins have violently usurped all public powers,\r\nbrutally abolished all private rights, regarding the actual living\r\npeople as a beast of burden, and yet worse, as a robot, subjecting\r\ntheir human machine to the cruelest restraints in order to mechanically\r\nmaintain it in the unnatural, rigid posture, which, according to\r\nprinciples, they inflict upon it. Thenceforth, all ties are sundered\r\nbetween them and the nation; to prey upon, bleed and starve this nation,\r\nto re-conquer it after it bad escaped them, to repeatedly enchain\r\nand gag it--all this they could well do; but to reconcile it to their\r\ngovernment, never!--Between them, and for the same reason, through\r\nanother consequence of the same theory, and another effect of the same\r\nlusts, no bond between them would hold. Each faction inside of the\r\nparty, having forged its ideal people according to its own logical\r\nprocess and necessities, exercised the orthodox privilege of claiming\r\nthe monopoly of sovereignty.[51145] To secure the benefits of\r\nomnipotence, it has combated its rivals with falsified, annulled or\r\nconstrained elections, with plots and mendacity, with ambushes and\r\nsudden assaults, with the pikes of the rabble and with the bayonets of\r\nsoldiers. It has then massacred, guillotined, shot, and deported the\r\nvanquished as tyrants, traitors or rebels, and survivors do not forget\r\nthis. They have learnt what their so called eternal constitutions amount\r\nto; they know how to estimate their proclamations and oaths, their\r\nrespect for law, justice, their humanity; they understand them and\r\nknow that they are all so many fraternal Cains,[51146] all more or less\r\ndebased, dangerous, soiled and depraved by their work; the distrust is\r\nirremediable. They can still turn out manifests, decrees and cabals, and\r\nget up revolutions, but they can no longer agree amongst themselves and\r\nheartily defer to the justified ascendancy and recognized authority\r\nof any one or among their own body.--After ten years of mutual assault\r\nthere is not one among the three thousand legislators who have sat in\r\nthe sovereign assemblies that can count on the deference and loyalty\r\nof a hundred Frenchmen. The social body is disintegrated; amongst the\r\nmillions of disconnected atoms not a nucleus of spontaneous cohesion\r\nand stable co-ordination remains. It is impossible for civil France to\r\nreconstruct itself; as impossible as it would be to build a Notre Dame\r\nof Paris, or a St. Peter's of Rome out of the slime of the streets or\r\nthe dust of the highways.\r\n\r\nWith military France it is otherwise. Here, men have made trial of each\r\nother, and are devoted to each other, subordinates to their leaders, and\r\nall to one great work. The sentiments are strong and healthy which\r\nbind human wills in a cluster of mutual sympathy, trust, esteem and\r\nadmiration, and all these super abound, while the free companionship\r\nwhich still subsists between inferior and superior,[51147] that gay\r\nunrestrained familiarity so dear to the French, draws the knot still\r\ncloser. In this world unsullied by political defilements and ennobled by\r\nhabits of abnegation,[51148] there is all that constitutes an organized\r\nand visible society, a hierarchy, not external and veneered, but moral\r\nand deep-seated, with uncontested titles, recognized superiorities, an\r\naccepted subordination, rights and duties stamped on all consciences, in\r\nbrief, what has always been wanting in revolutionary institutions, the\r\ndiscipline of sentiments and emotions. Give to these men a countersign\r\nand they do not discuss; provided it is legal, or seems so, they act\r\naccordingly, not merely against strangers, but against Frenchmen: thus,\r\nalready on the 13th Vendémiaire they mowed down the Parisians, and on\r\nthe 18th of Fructidor they purged the Legislative Corps. Let a famous\r\ngeneral appear, and provided he respects formalities, they will follow\r\nhim and once more repeat the operation.--One does appear, one who for\r\nthree years has thought of nothing else, but who on this occasion\r\nwill repeat the operation only for his own advantage. He is the most\r\nillustrious of all, and precisely the conductor or promoter of the two\r\nprevious ones, the very same who personally brought about the 13th of\r\nVendémiaire, and likewise, at the hands of his lieutenant, Augereau, the\r\n18th of Fructidor.--Let him be authorized by the semblance of a decree,\r\nlet him be appointed major-general of the armed force by a minority of\r\none of the Councils, and the army will march behind him.--Let him issue\r\nthe usual proclamations, let him summon \"his comrades\" to save the\r\nRepublic and clear the hall of the Five Hundred; his grenadiers will\r\nenter with fixed bayonets and even laugh at the sight of the deputies,\r\ndressed as for the opera, scrambling off precipitately out of the\r\nwindows.[51149]--Let him manage the transitions, let him avoid the\r\nill-sounding name of dictator, let him assume a modest and yet classic\r\nrevolutionary Roman title, let him along with two others be simple\r\nconsuls; the soldiers, who have neither time nor leisure to be\r\npublicists and who are only skin-deep republicans, will ask nothing\r\nmore. They regard their system as a very good one for the French people,\r\nthe despotic system without which there can be no army, that which\r\nplaces the absolute command in the hands of one individual.--Let him put\r\ndown other Jacobins, let him revoke their late decrees on hostages\r\nand the forced loan, let him restore safety and security to persons,\r\nproperty and consciences; let him bring back order, economy and\r\nefficiency to the administrations; let him provide for public services,\r\nhospitals, roads and schools, the whole of civil France will welcome its\r\nliberator, protector and restorer.[51150]--In his own words, the system\r\nhe brings is that of \"the alliance of Philosophy with the Sword,\"\r\nphilosophy meaning, as it was then understood, the application of\r\nabstract principles to politics, the logical construction of a State\r\naccording to general and simple notices with a social plan, uniform and\r\nrectilinear. Now as we have seen,[51151] two of these plans square\r\nwith this theory, one anarchical and the other despotic; naturally, the\r\nmaster adopts the latter, and, like a practical man, he builds according\r\nto that theory a substantial edifice, with sand and lime, habitable\r\nand well suited to its purposes. All the masses of the great\r\nwork-civil code, university, Concordat, prefectoral and centralized\r\nadministration-all the details of its arrangement and distribution of\r\nplaces, tend to one general effect, which is the omnipotence of the\r\nState, the omnipresence of the government, the abolition of local and\r\nprivate initiative, the suppression of voluntary free association, the\r\ngradual dispersion of small spontaneous groupings, the preventive ban\r\nof prolonged hereditary works, the extinction of sentiments by which the\r\nindividual lives beyond himself in the past or in the future. Never\r\nwere finer barracks constructed, more symmetrical and more decorative\r\nin aspect, more satisfactory to superficial views, more acceptable\r\nto vulgar good sense, more suited to narrow egoism, better kept and\r\ncleaner, better adapted to the discipline of the average and low\r\nelements of human nature, and better adapted to dispersing or perverting\r\nthe superior elements of human nature. In this philosophical barracks we\r\nhave lived for eighty years.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n(written in 1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5101: Gaudin, Duc de Gaëte, \"Memoires,\" I., 28.
