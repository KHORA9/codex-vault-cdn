No one can have turned over a bookseller’s catalogue of local\r\nhistorical publications without observing how few they are in comparison\r\nwith the extent and importance of the particular district in view.  The\r\nfact is, that most of the productions of the early authors are either\r\nvery scarce or are entirely out of print.  No city or county can boast of\r\nso many industrious topographers and antiquarians as Norwich and Norfolk.\r\nIf we arrange them in alphabetical order, we have:—Ames, Beatniffe,\r\nBlomefield, P. Browne, Brettingham, Sir Thomas Browne, Chambers, Cory,\r\nCotman, Dixon, Eldridge, Sir Richard Elles, Forby, Sir John Fenn, Sir\r\nAndrew Fountaine, R. Fitch, Gibson, Gillingwater, Hudson Gurney, Green,\r\nGunn, Gurdon, Harrod, Ives, Kent, J. Kirkpatrick, Le Neve, Lawrence,\r\nMackerell, Manship (both father and son), Marshall, Tom Martin, Matchett,\r\nNeville, Nashe, Parkin, Prideaux, Quarles, Richards, Sir H. Spelman, Sir\r\nJohn Spelman, Clement Spelman, Swinden, Dawson Turner, Wilkins, Watts,\r\nWilkinson, and the Woodwards (father and son).  Most of these, however,\r\nwere antiquarians, and contributed more to archæology and topography than\r\nto history.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Kirkpatrick, in the early part of the eighteenth century, was the\r\nfirst who formed the plan of a regular historical narrative.  He spent\r\nthe greater part of his life in making researches and collecting\r\nmaterials for a history of Norwich; and he wrote an immense quantity of\r\nmatter in thick folio volumes, the whole of which he left in MS. to the\r\nold corporation.  They comprised—\r\n\r\nNo. 1.  A thick folio volume of the Early History and Jurisdiction of the\r\nCity; date 1720.\r\n\r\nNo. 2.  A similar folio volume, being an account of the Military State of\r\nthe City, its walls, towers, ponds, pits, wells, pumps, &c.; date 1722.\r\n\r\nNo. 3.  A thick quarto.\r\n\r\nNo. 4.  Several large bundles, foolscap folio; Annals of Norwich.\r\n\r\nNo. 5.  A fasciculus, foolscap folio; Origin of Charities, and Wills\r\nrelating thereto, in each parish.\r\n\r\nNo. 6.  Memorandum books of Monuments.\r\n\r\nNo. 7.  Ditto of Merchants’ Marks.\r\n\r\nNo. 8.  Ditto of Plans of Churches.\r\n\r\nNo. 9.  Paper containing Drawings of the City Gates, and a plan of\r\nNorwich.\r\n\r\nNo. 10.  Drawings of all the Churches.\r\n\r\nNo. 11.  An immense number of pieces of paper containing notes of the\r\ntenure of each house in Norwich.\r\n\r\nNo. 12.  A MS. quarto volume of 258 pages; the first sixty devoted to\r\nnotes upon the Castle at Norwich, the remainder to an account of\r\nReligious Orders and Houses, and the Hospitals of the City.\r\n\r\nAfter the new corporation was constituted, all Kirkpatrick’s MSS. were\r\ndispersed into different hands.  The late Hudson Gurney, Esq., obtained\r\npossession of some of them, and published a very limited number of copies\r\nof those relating to the castle and to religious houses.  Mr. Dawson\r\nTurner edited the last-named MS. (No. 12), and it was printed in 1845.\r\nHe says that all the other MSS. had disappeared, but that they were safe\r\nin the custody of the old corporation, thirty years before (1815), when\r\nMr. De Hague held the office of town clerk.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mr. Kirkpatrick was the contemporary of the Rev. F.\r\nBlomefield, the historian of Norfolk, who appreciated his researches, and\r\nbore this testimony to his merits:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Kirkpatrick was a most laborious antiquary and made great\r\n    collections for the city of Norwich, of which he published a large\r\n    prospectus.  In pursuing his studies, he worked with Peter Le Neve,\r\n    Norroy; and as they were very intimate, they mutually exchanged their\r\n    collections for this place, Mr. Kirkpatrick giving all his draughts\r\n    to Mr. Le Neve, and Mr. Le Neve giving his to Mr. Kirkpatrick.  To\r\n    the labours of both these gentlemen I am exceedingly obliged, and did\r\n    I not acknowledge my obligations in this public manner, I should\r\n    inwardly condemn myself as guilty of the highest ingratitude.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blomefield was, indeed, indebted to his deceased friend for the most\r\nvaluable parts of his History of Norwich, published in 1742.  It is the\r\nonly part of his work which can be properly called history, the rest\r\nconsisting of topographical descriptions of different hundreds and\r\nparishes in Norfolk.  Mr. Blomefield began to print his “History of\r\nNorfolk” at his own press in his own house at Fersfield, in 1739, by\r\nsubscription, and intended to publish a list of his subscribers when the\r\nwhole was finished.  During his life the History came out in monthly\r\nfolio numbers; but he died when he had proceeded as far as page 678 of\r\nthe third volume.  This volume was completed by the Rev. Charles Parkin,\r\nrector of Oxburgh, Suffolk; and after his death was printed in 1769 by\r\nWhittingham, bookseller at Lynn, by whom the “Continuation” was published\r\nin two more volumes in 1777, these two volumes being very inferior to the\r\nprevious three.  Blomefield’s work is of course the chief source of\r\ninformation respecting Norwich, and it has been republished in many\r\nabridged forms, the best edition being that printed by J. Crouse for M.\r\nBooth, bookseller, in 1781, in ten vols., the last relating to Norwich.\r\nMany smaller abridgements have also been published, carrying on the\r\nnarrative to a later date.\r\n\r\nThe most reliable authority for the whole of the eighteenth century is\r\nthe “Norfolk Remembrancer,” compiled with great care by Mr. Matchett.  R.\r\nFitch, Esq., published a very full and accurate account of the Old Walls\r\nand Gates from J. Kirkpatrick’s MSS., illustrated with views by the late\r\nJohn Ninham.  B. B. Woodward, Esq., F.S.A., librarian of the royal\r\nlibrary at Windsor Castle, has also been a contributor to the history of\r\nthe old city, but as yet we have only brief reports of his lectures “On\r\nNorwich in the Olden Time,” as published in the local journals.  He\r\ndirected attention to the purely fictitious accounts of the origin of the\r\ncity to be found in the early historians, who drew in all good faith on\r\ntheir fertile imaginations.  He gave a much more probable account, and\r\ndescribed the progress of the city at different periods, as quoted in the\r\nfollowing pages.  Mr. Harrod, too, has contributed a good deal to more\r\naccurate views of early periods, especially in relation to the\r\nearth-works of the castle, and to the monasteries.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on the “Rise and Progress of Nonconformists in Norwich” in\r\nthis history, are the first given in any work of the kind, and supply\r\ninformation which will readily account for the political condition of the\r\ncity.  From a few hundreds in the seventeenth century, the Nonconformists\r\nhave so greatly increased that now they number many thousands, and have\r\nat the same time attained to considerable wealth and influence.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on Trade and Commerce supply a new feature in Norwich\r\nhistory, and are very important to men of business.  The information on\r\nthis head, including the history of the Manufactures and of the Wholesale\r\nTrade of the city, is for the most part taken from Essays, by the\r\ncompiler, to which the prizes were awarded at the Norwich Industrial\r\nExhibition of 1867.\r\n\r\nThe great length of the secular narrative must suffice as an apology for\r\nthe brevity of the ecclesiastical details, which occupy the greater\r\nportion of Blomefield’s work.  A full history of the churches in Norwich\r\nwould fill many volumes; indeed, Kirkpatrick’s account of the Old\r\nReligious Houses occupies as many as 300 pages.  But the general reader\r\nwould not be interested by such details.\r\n\r\nA full history of Norwich, up to the latest date, has long been wanted,\r\nand the present compiler has availed himself of all sources of\r\ninformation, but he has been obliged to compress a great deal into a\r\nsmall compass.  He has introduced many notices of eminent citizens of\r\nevery period, including bishops and ministers of all denominations, who\r\nexercised much influence in their day and generation.\r\n\r\nAccurate views of local history afford the clearest insight into the\r\nstate of society at different periods.  Thus the records of Norwich\r\nCastle prove that nearly all the land in the country was either assigned\r\nto bear, or was chargeable with, the castle guard of some castle or other\r\nin ancient times.  The castles being fortresses were the centres around\r\nwhich large towns arose, and where people most congregated for protection\r\nin lawless ages.  The whole island was one vast camp during the feudal\r\nperiod.  Monasteries were the only places of refuge for travellers, or\r\nfor the destitute poor, and when the religious houses were dissolved, an\r\nentire change took place in the state of society.\r\n\r\nLocal history, properly understood, is not a dry register of events, but\r\nleads from particular conclusions to higher generalisations.  The\r\npredominance of certain ideas at different times produced all the events\r\nof those periods.  Norwich men took an active part in all the great\r\nmovements of the day,—in the Reformation, the Civil Wars, the\r\nCommonwealth, and all the agitations of more modern times.  Therefore,\r\nthe story of the city is interesting and important in every period, and\r\nit is identified with the whole course of events in East Anglia.  Indeed,\r\nit is difficult to separate the history of Norwich, the capital of East\r\nAnglia, from that of the whole district.\r\n\r\n                        [Picture: Decorative mark]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                               PART I.\r\n                                                                 PAGES\r\nSURVEY OF NORWICH.

Before the dawn of authentic history, it is in vain to expect\r\nfull information on this point; but the natural changes that have taken\r\nplace may be traced with tolerable clearness.  Geologists inform us that\r\nthe whole area of Norfolk, including Norwich, was in remote ages under\r\nthe sea; that by the slow accumulation of alluvial matter islands were\r\nformed in this estuary; and that the waters were divided into several\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nWe may speculate as to the causes of these changes of the level of land\r\nand water, but we cannot doubt the fact of such changes having taken\r\nplace.  When or why the great body of waters retired to its great\r\nreservoir in the bed of the ocean is unknown; but whatever the causes, it\r\nis certain that between the first and the eleventh century the waters did\r\ngradually recede till the river assumed a narrower appearance.  The\r\nhigher part of the city from Ber Street up to Lakenham was probably, 2000\r\nyears ago, like an island surrounded by water flowing up the valley of\r\nthe Taas on that side, and over the valley of the Wensum on the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe existence of Norwich as a city during the Roman period from B.C. 50\r\ntill A.D. 400 or 500 is very doubtful.  Camden says that its name occurs\r\nnowhere till the Danish wars.  If it did exist, it was only a fishing\r\nstation, for then a broad arm of the sea flowed up the valley of the\r\nYare, and covered a great part of the north side of the present city.\r\nIndeed, for centuries after the Christian era this arm of the sea may\r\nhave flowed over the greater part of the ground on which the north side\r\nof the city now stands.  In the course of time, however, the arm of the\r\nsea gradually silted up and left only the present narrow river Wensum\r\nflowing into the Yare.\r\n\r\nTradition has handed down this couplet:\r\n\r\n    “Caister was a city when Norwich was none,\r\n    And Norwich was built of Caister stone.”\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no evidence that Caister was ever more than a village\r\non the banks of the Taas, where the Romans built a camp to overawe the\r\nneighbourhood; while all the old Roman roads have always radiated from\r\nNorwich, proving that it was a place of importance in the Roman period.\r\nThe _Iceni_ called it _Caer Gwent_, altered by the Romans into _Venta_,\r\nso that it was the _Venta Icenorum_ of the Romans, who probably threw up\r\nthe mound on which a castle was afterwards built, in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNorwich very likely took its rise after the departure of the Romans,\r\nabout A.D. 418, on account of the distracted state of the empire.  Then,\r\nthe camp or station at Caister being almost deserted, the few remaining\r\nRomans joined with the natives, and they became one people; and the\r\nsituation of Norwich being thought preferable to that of Caister, many\r\nretired hither for the facility of fishing and the easier communication\r\nwith the country.  Caister, however, though almost deserted, kept up some\r\nreputation, till the river becoming so shallow, cut off all intercourse\r\nwith it by water and reduced it to a place of no importance.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Romans, the Angles from the opposite coast\r\nmade themselves masters of this part of the island, and to them is\r\nchiefly owing the further progress of the city and its present name.\r\n“Northwic” signifies a northern station on a winding river, and may have\r\nbeen so called because of its being situated north of the ancient station\r\nat Caister.\r\n\r\nNorwich Castle was probably built in the reign of Uffa, the first king of\r\nthe East Angles, soon after the year 575.  About 642 it became a royal\r\ncastle, and one of the seats of Anna, king of the East Angles, whose\r\ndaughter Ethelfred, on her marriage with Tombert, a nobleman or prince of\r\nthe Girvii (a people inhabiting the fenny parts of Norfolk), had this\r\nCastle, with the lands belonging to it, given her by her father.  About\r\n677, this Tombert and his wife granted to the monastery of Ely, which\r\nthey had founded, certain lands held of Norwich Castle, by Castle guard,\r\nto which service they must have been liable before the grant, for, by the\r\nlaws of the Angles, lands granted to the church were not liable to\r\nsecular service, unless they were at first subject thereto whilst in\r\nsecular hands, which proves that this was a Royal Castle in the time of\r\nKing Anna.\r\n\r\nThe Danes soon came over in such large numbers and so frequently, that\r\nthey at last got possession of the whole of East Anglia, and became the\r\nparent-stock of the inhabitants of parts of Norfolk and Suffolk.  In\r\n1003, Sweyn or Swaine, King of Denmark, came over with his forces and, in\r\nrevenge for the massacre of the Danes in the previous year, burnt Norwich\r\nand its Castle, as well as many other places.  They afterwards rebuilt\r\nthe city and castle, and came hither in such large numbers, that Norwich\r\nbecame a Danish city, with a Danish Castle, about 1011.  After the\r\nrestoration of the Anglo-Saxon dynasty, the city entered on a new career\r\nof prosperity, and according to the Domesday Book of Edward the\r\nConfessor, it contained 25 churches, and 1320 burgesses, besides the\r\nserfs or labourers.  It was still the capital of East Anglia, with a few\r\nhundred houses, but the greater part of the area round the Castle\r\npresented only marshes and green fields.  Two broad arms of the sea still\r\nflowed up the valleys on each side of the city.  The whole district all\r\naround consisted of marsh, and moor, and woods, and yet uncultivated\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn 1094, Herbert de Losinga, then Bishop of Thetford, removed the See\r\nhither, and began to build the Cathedral, from which time the city\r\nincreased yearly in wealth and trade.  Domesday Book (1086) contains an\r\naccount of all the lands and estates in England, and also of all the\r\ntowns.  Norwich was then next in size to York, and contained 738\r\nfamilies.  Thetford had at the same time 720 burgesses, and 224 houses\r\nempty.  Thetford, therefore, was decaying and Norwich was rising.  In\r\n1377, a census was taken of several great towns in England, and Norwich\r\nwas found to contain 5300 people, for a migration hither of Flemings and\r\nWalloons, who introduced the manufacture of woollen and worstead fabrics,\r\nhad increased the population.  In 1575, the muster roll of men delivered\r\nto the government capable of bearing arms contained 2120 names, which\r\nwould be the proportion for 15,000 people.  The population in 1693\r\namounted to 28,881 inhabitants.  In 1752 it had increased to 36,241, and\r\nin 1786 to 40,051.  In 1801 it had decreased to 36,832.  In 1811 the\r\nnumber was 37,256, and during the next ten years so large was the\r\nincrease that in 1821 the number was 50,288.  In 1831, when the census\r\nwas taken, Norwich contained 61,116; in 1841, 61,796; in 1851, 68,713; in\r\n1861, 74,414.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the continued succession of wars from the revolution in\r\n1688 to the conclusion of the peace in 1763, the city continued to\r\nprosper, and its trade had become very great, extending all over Europe,\r\nand Norwich manufactures were in demand in every town on the continent.\r\nIndeed, the period of war, from 1743 to 1763, was the most prosperous era\r\nin Norwich history.  The prosperity continued till the disputes arose\r\nbetween the government and the North American colonies, which commenced\r\nin 1765 and became serious in 1774, and were not terminated till 1783,\r\nwhen the independence of the United States was acknowledged.  During this\r\nperiod, in fact, the trade of the place was so good, that great numbers\r\nof people came from the surrounding villages and obtained employment in\r\nthe factories.  After the passing of the paving act in 1806, the new\r\npaving of the city commenced, and proceeded very slowly.  This necessary\r\nwork was interrupted at intervals from the want of money, and the\r\nCommissioners got deep in debt.  In forty years they spent £300,000, and\r\nleft Norwich the worst paved town in England.  The drainage was very\r\ndefective, and the hamlets were not drained at all.  The supply of water\r\nwas altogether insufficient, and in the hamlets was obtained from wells.\r\nThe Board of Health was established in 1851, under the powers of the\r\nPublic Health Acts, and since then its provisions have been carried out.\r\nThe sanitary condition of Norwich has subsequently greatly improved and\r\nthe rate of mortality decreased, owing to the wise and judicious measures\r\nwhich have been adopted of late years.  A fuller description of “the\r\nAncient City” will be found under the head of “Norwich Antiquities.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Modern City.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE modern city, with all its improvements and extensions, presents a\r\nvery different aspect to what it did in former times, when it was\r\nenclosed by high walls and gates.  It stands for the most part on the\r\nsummit and sloping sides of a rising ground, running parallel with the\r\nriver Wensum on the southern side, above its confluence with the Yare.\r\nIts greatest extent from St. Clement’s Hill (north) to Hartford Bridges\r\n(south) is four and a quarter miles; and following the zigzag line of\r\nboundary it is about seventeen miles in circumference, comprising 6630\r\nacres of land.  Within its jurisdiction, as a city and a county of\r\nitself, it includes the picturesque hamlets of Lakenham and Bracondale on\r\nthe south, of Catton on the north, of Thorpe on the east, and of Heigham\r\non the west, in which direction Norwich is rapidly extending.\r\n\r\nThe city is situated in the eastern division of Norfolk, of which county\r\nit is the capital.  It is 20 miles distant from the sea at Yarmouth, 108\r\nmiles distant from London, 42 from Lynn, 22 from Cromer, 43 from Ipswich,\r\n72 from Cambridge, and 99 from Lincoln; being in latitude 52° 42′ N., and\r\nin longitude 1° 20′ E of Greenwich.  The Great Eastern Railway system\r\nplaces it in communication with all the towns before named, and all the\r\nlarge towns of England.  There is a railway station at Thorpe for the\r\nNorfolk line from Yarmouth to Ely, and another station at St. Stephen’s\r\nGates for the Suffolk line from Norwich to Ipswich.  Telegraphic lines\r\nare established along both railways, and there is also another line from\r\nLondon, viâ Norwich, to Cromer, on the northern coast of the county.\r\nNavigation is carried on by river from Norwich to Yarmouth.  The Wensum,\r\nwhich rises at Rudham, enters the city on the N.W., and leaves it on the\r\nS.E.  It pursues a boldly serpentine course through the town, first\r\ntraces for a short space the western limits, then describes a semi-circle\r\nround the left bank, then winds through a thinly-built part of the city,\r\nand next traverses a compact eastern side.  An eminence, that may be\r\ncalled a hill, compared with the flatness of the surrounding country,\r\nextends along the right bank of the river and terminates near its last\r\nbend; and this eminence bears on its summit and its slopes all the more\r\nancient parts of the city, with a large portion of its present streets\r\nand buildings.  The outline of the area within the old walls somewhat\r\nresembles the form of a cornucopia, with the narrow end twisted round\r\nfrom the S. to the S.E., and has been aptly compared to the figure of a\r\nhaunch of venison.  A strong flint embattled wall, flanked with forty\r\ntowers, pierced by twelve beautiful gates, and fortified by a broad\r\nditch, formerly surrounded the city, except at two places, where the\r\nWensum formed a natural defence; but having fallen into decay, and being\r\nconsidered a hindrance to the growth and improvement of the town, it was\r\nstripped of all its gates, its ditch was filled in, and the only portions\r\nof walls which were permitted to remain are a few strips, here and there,\r\nof crazy ruin.  The city inside the walls is divided into thirty-five\r\nparishes, and has five more and parts of two others within the county of\r\nthe city.  Altogether it contains forty parish churches, exclusive of the\r\nCathedral, the French and Dutch Churches, and Christ’s Church, New\r\nCatton; and upwards of twenty Nonconformist chapels.  It formerly\r\nincluded about twenty other parishes, but they have been consolidated\r\nwith some of the present parishes, and the churches either desecrated or\r\ntaken down.  Among the chapels which have altogether disappeared may be\r\nmentioned the Chapel of St. Mary in the Field, St. Catherine’s Chapel,\r\nHildebrand’s Chapel, Magdalen Chapel, St. Michael’s Chapel, (Tombland),\r\nSt. Nicholas’s Chapel, St. Olave’s Chapel, (near King Street gates), and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe older portion of the city in most of its street arrangements is very\r\nirregular; and its thoroughfares are narrow and winding, following in\r\nsome instances the line of the ancient walls.  Some of its houses,\r\nhowever, are handsome structures, and are often admired by strangers as\r\nbeautiful specimens of squared flint facings.  The old street\r\narchitecture, however, is rapidly vanishing before the hand of\r\nimprovement.  Many of the half-timber, lath and plaster houses,\r\nremarkable for their grotesque gables and picturesque appearance, have\r\ngiven place to plainer, but more comfortable and convenient dwellings;\r\nsome of which have handsome fronts, more especially round the Market\r\nPlace, and in the principal streets.  We may, especially, notice the\r\nwarehouses and shops of Messrs. Chamberlin, Mr. G. L. Coleman, and others\r\nin the Market Place; of Mr. Caley, Mr. Fiske, Mr. Livock, Mr. Dixon, Mr.\r\nSawyer, and Mr. Allen in London Street; the offices of the National\r\nProvincial Bank in London Street; and of the Crown Bank on the Castle\r\nMeadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARKET PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Market Place, which occupies the centre of the city, is one of the\r\nmost spacious in England; and being overhung by the singularly massive\r\nsquare tower of St. Peter’s, and presenting several specimens of antique\r\nhouses of the gable-front construction, is very picturesque in its\r\nappearance.  It was formerly the great Croft, belonging to the Castle, on\r\nthe outer ditch of which it is supposed to have abutted.  The first parts\r\nbuilt upon were the east and west sides and the north end.  The other\r\nportions were built by virtue of royal licenses.  As already indicated,\r\nit has been within the last few years greatly improved, by the erection\r\nof new houses and fronts; and upon the whole it may be said to be well\r\npaved—though as regards the paving of the city generally, there is still\r\nroom for improvement.  The approaches to the Market Place, it should here\r\nbe mentioned, were formerly very narrow and difficult, and they are not\r\neven now all that could be wished; but many improvements have\r\nnevertheless been made at very great expense.  Thus, London Street has\r\nwithin the last few years been widened, at a cost of £20,000; and Opie\r\nStreet has been opened from London Street to the Castle Hill.  Of course,\r\nthe principal places of business are mostly clustered together, either in\r\nthe Market Place or in the nearest streets; but in former times, every\r\nbusiness in Norwich had its particular row or station.  Thus, in ancient\r\ndeeds, we read of the Glover’s Row, Mercers Row, Spicer’s Row, Needler’s\r\nRow, Tawer’s Row, Ironmonger’s Row; also of the Apothecary’s Market, the\r\nHerb Market, the Poultry Market, the Bread Market, the Flesh Market, the\r\nWool and Sheep Market, the Fish Market, the Hay Market, the Wood Market,\r\nthe Cheese Market, the Leather Market, the Cloth-cutter’s Market, the\r\nWhite-ware Market; all of which we find mentioned before the reign of\r\nRichard II.; for about the latter end of the reign of Edward III., trades\r\nbegan to be mingled in such a manner, that many of these names were lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        [Picture: Norwich castle]\r\n\r\nHIGH over the centre of the old city, over all its churches, and towers,\r\nand streets, rises the Norman Castle, frowning in feudal grandeur over\r\nthe whole district.  It stands on the summit of a mound or hill, steep on\r\nall sides, which appears to be chiefly the work of nature, with additions\r\nby human labour.  The embattled quadrangular keep, in its restored state,\r\nretaining all the details of architectural decoration peculiar to the\r\nNorman style, presents a faithful image, though without the grey\r\nantiquity, of its original exterior, and is a noble striking object from\r\nwhatsoever point it is seen.  The common history is, that a fortress\r\nexisted here during the Saxon period, and that Uffa, the first King of\r\nthe East Angles, formed one of earth, according to the rude method of the\r\ntimes.  In 642, Anna, another of the East Anglian kings, is said to have\r\nresided here; and during the Danish wars, this fortress was often taken\r\nand retaken.  Alfred is believed to have repaired it, and to have erected\r\nthe first stone structure, which was destroyed by the Danes in 1004.\r\nCanute probably erected another castle here about 1018, and after the\r\nconquest it was much injured during a siege, and was rebuilt by Roger\r\nBigod.  The plan of the fortifications has been a subject of some\r\ncontroversy.  According to the account commonly given of the fortress, it\r\nconsisted of a barbican or outwork to defend the entrance; three nearly\r\nconcentric lines of defence, each consisting of a wall and ditch, and\r\nenclosing a ballium or court; and a great central keep, as the last\r\nresort in the event of a siege.  The area comprised a space of\r\ntwenty-three acres, and each ditch had a bridge over it similar to the\r\none now remaining.  The barbican, or outwork of the fortification, was\r\nsituated beyond the outer ditch, if it ever existed.  The wall commenced\r\nat the opening called Orford Street, and gradually extended to the end of\r\nGolden Ball Lane, the other extremity terminating in Buff Coat Lane.  The\r\nwidest part is stated to have been forty yards broad, and gradually\r\ndecreasing at the extremities, the length being about 220 yards.  Part of\r\nthe original form of the wall was supposed to be traceable from the\r\nposition of the buildings erected on its site in Buff Coat Lane.  The\r\nroad to the castle from Ber Street was supposed to pass through the\r\nbarbican, exactly where Golden Ball Lane recently stood.  The circuits of\r\nthe outer vallum and the middle vallum are minutely described by most of\r\nthe local historians; but unfortunately there is no sufficient evidence\r\nin support of this old theory of three ditches round the castle—nothing\r\nbut a vague traditional story, filled up by imagination.  The editors of\r\nthe history published by Crouse in 1768, say:\r\n\r\n    “This castle was defended by a wall surrounding it, built on the brow\r\n    of the hill on which it stands, and by three ditches; the outermost\r\n    of which reached on the west to the edge of the present Market Place,\r\n    on the north to London Lane, which it took in; on the east nearly to\r\n    Conisford Street, and on the south to the Golden Ball Lane.  The\r\n    postern or back entrance into the works was on the north-east, by\r\n    which a communication was had with the earl’s palace, then occupying\r\n    the whole space between the outer ditch and Tombland.  The grand\r\n    entrance is on the south, from which you passed three bridges in\r\n    going to the Castle.  The first hath been immemorially destroyed; the\r\n    ruins of the second remained till the ditches were filled up and\r\n    levelled thirty years since; and the third still continues and\r\n    consists of one whole arch, exceeded by very few in England.”\r\n\r\nMr. John Kirkpatrick, who wrote an account of the Castle in the last\r\ncentury, gives quite a different description of the earth works.  He\r\nnotices the present ditch, and a second entrenchment lying between the\r\npresent ditch and the Shire house, which then stood near the old weighing\r\nhouse on the hill.  He also refers to the Shire house ditch as a distinct\r\nentrenchment.  He describes a bridge house on the inner side of the great\r\nsouthern ditch in the middle of the present Cattle Market, and the line\r\nof the houses forming the southern limit of the Cattle Market seems to\r\nshow the limit of the outwork.\r\n\r\nMr. B. B. Woodward, F.S.A., in his lectures delivered here on “Norwich in\r\nthe Olden Time,” adopted this view of the earth works, which he believed\r\ndid not consist of three concentric lines of defence.  He described the\r\nSaxon fortress as probably no more than a strong palisade carried along\r\nthe inner edge of two great trenches and the top of the steep bank of the\r\nsmall stream called the “Cockey;” the buildings consisting of a great\r\ntimber hall with offices and stabling.  He believed that the Normans\r\nstrengthened the outworks, cast up the great mound, dug the vast inner\r\nditch, and reared the noble donjon, which, before the “restoration” of\r\nits exterior, was a fine feudal monument.  After the Norman period the\r\nearth works, Mr. Woodward thought, underwent great changes.  The\r\nhorse-shoe trench on the east side disappeared and was built upon.  This\r\nhorse-shoe trench enclosed the Castle Meadow.  Another smaller outwork\r\nwas formed on the south side of the original great southern trench, both\r\nof the last named being crossed by bridges.  In support of this view, Mr.\r\nWoodward referred to the account given by Kirkpatrick, who, as we have\r\nsaid, described the second ditch as lying between the great circular\r\nditch and the Shire house, which then stood near the old weighing house.\r\nThe old way from King Street had been disused because the growth of the\r\ncity had so greatly altered the defensive character of the fortress.  In\r\naddition to this, there were the names of two churches, one of which was\r\nSt. Martin’s, (originally called “on the Hill,”) but afterwards “at\r\nBailey” or “at the Castle gate;” and the other, St. John, now Timberhill,\r\nbut then “at the Castle gate.”  Unless a way existed through the outworks\r\nto the castle hill, these churches could not have been properly called\r\n“at the Castle gate;” and as the “Bailey,” was the space enclosed within\r\nthe intrenchments of the Castle, the other name of St. Martin would be\r\nquite inappropriate.  The Buckes, in their view of the Castle,\r\nrepresented a ruined building, like a bridge house, on the inner side of\r\nthe great southern ditch.  Before the end of the last century, the level\r\nof the south side of the hill was raised to form a Cattle Market.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrod, some years since, at a meeting of the Archæological Society\r\nheld in the Museum, exploded the theory of three circular ditches by\r\nshowing from the city records that houses had always stood on the sites\r\nof the supposed outer and middle ditches; the inner vallum was the only\r\none, and extended round the base of the hill on which the keep is\r\nerected, and is plainly traceable at the present time.  It is planted\r\nwith trees and shrubs, having a gravelled walk in the centre, and is\r\nenclosed with an iron palisade.  The area of the upper ballium is level\r\nand comparatively high, and forms an irregular circle on the summit of\r\nthe hill, surrounded by an iron railing.  The great Keep situated within\r\nthis area is a massive quadrangular pile, 110 feet in length from east to\r\nwest, 92 feet 10 inches in breadth from north to south, and 69½ feet high\r\nto the top of the merlons of the battlements, and the walls are from 10\r\nto 13 feet in thickness.  From the basement to the top are three stories,\r\neach strengthened by small projecting buttresses, between which the walls\r\nare ornamented with semi-circular arches resting on small three-quarter\r\ncolumns.  In the upper story the backs of some of these arcades are\r\ndecorated with a kind of reticulated work, formed by the stones being\r\nlaid diagonally, so that the joints resemble the meshes of a net.  To\r\ngive it greater richness of effect, each stone had two deeply chased\r\nlines, crossing each other parallel with the joints, so as to present the\r\nappearance of Mosaic.  On the exterior of the west side are two arches\r\nwhich appear to have been originally intended as a deception to the\r\nenemy, giving an idea of weakness externally, where in fact was the\r\ngreatest strength; for the wall is not only 13 feet in thickness in this\r\nplace, but, within, it was additionally barricaded by two oblique walls\r\nwhich were, long ago, taken down.  On the east side of the keep there is\r\na projecting tower called Bigod’s tower, which was most probably built by\r\nHugh Bigod, third Earl of Norfolk, who succeeded his brother as High\r\nConstable of the Castle, early in the 12th century.  This tower, which\r\nwas an open portal to the grand entrance of the Castle, is of a richer\r\nkind of architecture, and in the genuine Norman style, and since 1824,\r\nhas been entirely restored, so as now to exhibit its pristine aspect,\r\nwhich is certainly different from the rest of the keep.  The interior of\r\nthe keep has been so greatly altered in order to adapt it to prison\r\npurposes, that the original arrangement of apartments cannot be traced.\r\n\r\nThe style of architecture has been a matter of dispute, as to whether it\r\nis Saxon, Danish, or Norman.  Mr. Boid, in his history and analysis of\r\nthe principal styles of architecture, ventures to challenge any one to\r\nprove the existence of any monument in this country of real Saxon skill;\r\nnor has any specimen been discovered.  Mr. Wilkins, of Norwich, who has\r\ndescribed both the ancient and modern states of the fortress in Vol. xii.\r\nof the Archæologia, believed, however, that the part which yet remains\r\nmight have been constructed chiefly in the reign of Canute, but that it\r\nis notwithstanding in the style of architecture practised by the Saxons,\r\nlong before England became subject to the Danes, and is the best exterior\r\nspecimen of the kind.  Other and later writers, with much better\r\nevidence, believe the whole keep to be Norman, of the time of William\r\nRufus; for it is similar in style to Castle Rising, built in the reign of\r\nthat king, by Albini.  The earth works and stone works are very similar.\r\nThe whole of the exterior of the keep has been refaced, the original\r\nstyle being preserved.  It is to be regretted that the work was not\r\nwholly refaced with small square stones, in the Norman manner, instead of\r\ncommencing with the large massive freestone, which is coloured to\r\nrepresent smaller stones.  This defect, however, on being discovered was\r\nremedied, for a great part of the exterior was finished after the Norman\r\nfashion.  The county jail stands on the east side of the keep, and was\r\nbuilt on the site of a previous prison in 1824–28 at a cost of £15,000.\r\nIt comprises a governor’s house and three radiating wings, and has room\r\nfor 224 male prisoners.  Three bridges are, as we have said, thought by\r\nsome authorities to have crossed three ditches, but for more than a\r\ncentury the present bridge has been the only one.  This bridge consists\r\nof one large semicircular arch.  Mr. Wilkins supposed that it was the\r\noriginal bridge built by the Saxons, but this is only conjectural like\r\nthe rest of his theory about the earth works.  At the termination of this\r\nbridge, upon the upper ballium, are the remains of two circular towers,\r\n14 feet in diameter, which are supposed to have flanked the portal of the\r\nballium wall.  The history of the castle will be given at some length in\r\nsubsequent pages.  We shall now proceed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS grand Norman pile is the great ornament to the city, but its\r\nsituation is so low that its goodly proportions can be seen only from one\r\npoint of view, namely from Mousehold Heath.  From that elevation it\r\npresents the dignity of a great work of architecture, and the spire may\r\nbe seen on a clear day, on the north, at a distance of twenty miles.  The\r\nnoble tower, with its gracefully tapering spire, second in height only to\r\nthat of Salisbury, the flying buttresses, and the circular chapels at the\r\neast end, are objects of interest to the attentive antiquarian observer.\r\n\r\nThe cloisters on the south side, and the bishop’s palace and grounds on\r\nthe north, and other premises, shut out from public view most of the\r\nexterior, except the west front.  A fine view of the splendid effect,\r\nproduced by a series of unbroken lines, may be obtained opposite the\r\nsouth transept, where the whole pile, comprising the transept, tower, and\r\nspire, blend themselves into one harmonious whole.  The interior from the\r\nwest front entrance presents a most imposing appearance, and when\r\nsurveying the vast length of the nave, we feel that our forefathers\r\n\r\n    “Builded better than they knew,\r\n    Unconscious stones to beauty grew.”\r\n\r\nWe shall first give, in as complete a manner as our limited space will\r\npermit, a sketch of the foundation and progress of the edifice, the\r\nerection of which occupied a century, and then we shall describe its\r\ndifferent parts, exterior and interior, including the nave, the screen,\r\nthe choir, the transepts, and the cloisters.\r\n\r\nThe original structure was begun in 1096 by Herbert de Losinga, the first\r\nbishop of the diocese.  The portions he built comprise the choir, with\r\nthe aisles surrounding it, the chapels of Jesus and St. Luke, and the\r\ncentral tower with the episcopal palace on the north side of the church,\r\nand a monastery on the south.  Bishop Eborard, the successor of Herbert,\r\nadded the nave and its two aisles, from the ante-choir or rood loft, to\r\nthe west end.  The building, as left by Eborard, remained till 1171, when\r\nit sustained some damage by fire, but was repaired by Bishop John de\r\nOxford, about 1197, who also added some alms houses to the monastery.\r\nThe Lady chapel at the east end, which has long since been destroyed, was\r\nthe next addition to the building, and was erected by Walter de Suffield,\r\nthe tenth bishop, who filled the See from 1244 to 1257.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1271, the tower was greatly injured by lightning during\r\ndivine service, and in 1272 the whole church was damaged considerably, in\r\nthe violent warfare which was at that time carried on between the monks\r\nand the citizens; but in 1278, having been repaired, the church was again\r\nconsecrated by William de Middleton on the day he was enthroned Bishop of\r\nNorwich, in the presence of King Edward I. and Eleanor his queen, the\r\nBishops of London, Hereford, and Waterford, and many lords and knights.\r\nWe can now form no idea of the grandeur of such a ceremony in that age.\r\n\r\nThe tower having been much injured and weakened by fire, a new one,\r\naccording to Blomefield, was begun and finished by Bishop Ralph de\r\nWalpole; but this, says Britton, more properly applies to the spire, the\r\nstyle of which, rather than of the tower, corresponds with that period.\r\nBishop Walpole ruled the diocese from 1289 to 1299.  Before his\r\ntranslation to Ely, which took place in the latter year, he commenced the\r\ncloister at the north-east angle, and built the chapter house.  He only\r\ncompleted a small portion of the east aisles.  The chapter house has\r\nsince been destroyed.  The rest of the cloister was built by Richarde de\r\nUppenhall, Bishop Salmon, Henry de Will, John de Hancock, Bishop\r\nWakering, Jeffery, Symonds, and others, and was completed A.D. 1430, in\r\nthe 133rd year from the first commencement of the work.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1362, the spire was blown down, and the choir thereby much\r\ninjured; but under the auspices of Bishop Percy, the present spire was\r\nerected and the choir repaired.  In 1629, the upper part of the spire was\r\nagain blown down, and in 1633, at a general chapter, it was ordered to be\r\nrepaired.  In 1843, seven feet were added to its elevation, with the\r\npresent finial which formed a consistent termination to the crockets.\r\n\r\nIn 1463, the church was much injured by fire, the wood work in the\r\ninterior of the tower having been ignited by lightning.  Under Bishop\r\nLyhart, however, it was again repaired and ornamented.  The splendid\r\nstone roof of the nave was added, the cathedral was paved, and a tomb was\r\nerected over the founder, which was afterwards demolished during the\r\ngreat rebellion.  About the year 1488, Bishop Goldwell built the roof of\r\nthe choir of similar but inferior work to that of the nave, adding the\r\nupper windows and flying buttresses.  He also fitted up the choir and the\r\nchapels around it, and covered the arched stone work with lead.  In 1509\r\nthe transepts having been much injured by fire, Bishop Nykke repaired\r\nthem, adding stone roofs to them in the same manner as the rest of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nAt the dissolution of the monasteries, the cathedral suffered greatly\r\nfrom the zeal of the Reformers, much curious work being destroyed; and\r\nseveral obnoxious crucifixes, images, niches, tabernacles, and paintings,\r\nwere removed.  In 1643, the fanatics took possession of the church and\r\nthe adjoining palace, and plundered them of all that was valuable.  The\r\nYarmouth people being in want of a workhouse, sent a petition to the Lord\r\nProtector, praying that “that great useless pile, the cathedral, might be\r\npulled down, and the stones given them to build a workhouse.”  Of course\r\nthe petition was not granted.  Soon after the restoration, the church was\r\nfitted up again.  In 1740, the nave and aisles were newly paved, the\r\ntower was repaired, and the church cleaned.  In 1763, the floor of the\r\nchoir was again repaved, the stalls repaired and painted, and other\r\nimprovements made, not always in harmony with the original structure.\r\n\r\nThe edifice was extended, embellished, altered, and repaired by many\r\nbishops and by wealthy families till it was completed about 1500.\r\nAlternate dilapidations and restorations followed.  The dilapidations\r\nwere sometimes sudden, sometimes gradual, and the restorations have\r\ncontinued at frequent intervals almost to the present day.  The entire\r\npile was repaired and beautified on an extensive scale in 1806–7.  The\r\ndecayed ornaments of the west front were restored, and many improvements\r\nin other parts were effected in 1818 and following years.  The south\r\nfront was renovated, and several houses which had stood against the walls\r\nwere removed in 1831.  The entire fabric was again restored, on the plan\r\nof Edward Blore, about 1840–3; and some portions were repaired, some\r\nembellishments were added, and some interesting ancient features were\r\nbrought into view between the years 1843 and 1868.\r\n\r\nThe pile as it now stands, comprises a nave of fourteen bays with aisles,\r\na transept of three bays in each wing, a central tower, a steeple, an\r\napsidal sacristy on the north-east side, a choir of four bays with\r\naisles, an apsidal end, and a procession path; also three chapels, in the\r\nsouth side, the north-east side, and south-east side; and a cloister with\r\neach alley of eleven panes to the south of the nave.  The dimensions of\r\nthe Cathedral as taken from actual measurement are as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                 _Feet_.   _Inches_.\r\nLength of church                      407           0\r\n,, nave to choir screen               204           0\r\n,, choir from screen                  183           0\r\n,, roof of nave                       251           0\r\n,, transept                           178           0\r\nBreadth of nave and aisles             72           0\r\n,, choir from back of stalls           27           1\r\n,, aisles of choir                     15           0\r\nHeight of spire from ground           315           0\r\n,, tower                              140           5\r\n,, spire from tower                   174           7\r\n,, roof of nave from pavement          69           6\r\n,, roof of choir from pavement         83           6\r\n\r\n_The Interior_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed with our description of the interior, which contains\r\nthe finest specimens of Norman architecture in existence, and admired by\r\nall men of taste.  Nothing can exceed the grandeur of the lofty nave,\r\nmassive columns, and wide circular arches.  The whole pile is chiefly of\r\nthe early Norman style, wherein the semi-circular arches and massive\r\nshort columns are the leading features.  These are considerably varied in\r\nsize, moulding, and ornament, in different parts of the edifice.\r\n\r\nThe Nave comprises fourteen semicircular arches, ornamented with billet\r\nand zigzag mouldings, and supported by massive piers.  The arches of the\r\ntriforium are of similar style to those below.  The magnificent roof, the\r\nwork of Bishop Lyhart, the rebus of whose name is of frequent occurrence\r\nupon the vault and corbels, is ornamented with 328 historical figures,\r\ncuriously carved, in a kind of relievo peculiar to itself, being chiefly\r\ncomposed of little figures, most exactly put together, said to be the\r\nonly work of the kind in existence, being a complete chain of sacred\r\nhistory, beginning at the tower with the Creation of the World; the\r\ndifferent days of the creation being disposed of in the several figures\r\nin the intersections of the arched work of the roof.  The Fall of Man,\r\nNoah’s Ark, and incidents in the lives of the patriarchs, are represented\r\nin the first seven arches; the rest to the west end represent events\r\nnarrated in the New Testament.  The interior of the nave looks much too\r\nlong in proportion to the rest of the pile, and the triforium is out of\r\nkeeping in consequence of its heavy circular arches being too high as\r\ncompared with those of the tier below, but the piers of the nave, with\r\nthe grand arches which they support, are splendid specimens of Norman\r\nwork and decoration.\r\n\r\nThe south transept is Norman work modified by a few innovations, and is\r\nflanked by square turrets, arcaded at the top and terminating in\r\npinnacles.  The north transept is of similar character.  The side aisles\r\nare low, and the roof of plain vaulting.  The west window is of unusually\r\nlarge size, and is of the same design, as regards the tracery, with that\r\nin Westminster Hall.  This window has been filled in with gorgeously\r\ncoloured glass, being designed as a memorial of Bishop Stanley, who was\r\nburied in the middle of the nave.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh arch of the north side are the remains of a doorway, with\r\na stone bench, formerly leading into the monks’ preaching yard, now part\r\nof the bishop’s garden.  Even after the Reformation, and up to the time\r\nof the great rebellion, sermons were preached here before the Civic\r\nAuthorities and the Members of the Cathedral.  Between the sixth and\r\nseventh pillars is an unpretending inscription to the memory of the\r\nlearned Dr. Prideaux, formerly Dean of Norwich, author of the “Connection\r\nof the Old and New Testaments,” who died November 1st, 1724.  The tomb\r\nbetween the corresponding pillars on the opposite side is that of Miles\r\nSpencer, Chancellor of the Diocese in 1537.  Between the seventh and\r\neighth pillars is the low tomb of Bishop Nykke, who died in 1535.  At the\r\neighth pillar a pulpit formerly stood.  Bishop Parkhurst’s tomb stands in\r\nthe next space, between the eighth and ninth pillars.\r\n\r\nThe Screen was originally the division between the rood-loft and the\r\nchapel of our Lady of Pity.  Bishop Lyhart erected the rood-loft, and\r\nupon it the principal rood or cross was placed with the representation of\r\nthe Holy Trinity, to whom this church was dedicated; together with the\r\nimages of the Blessed Virgin and St. John, and such other saints as were\r\nesteemed here.  The rood or crucifix, of full proportions, was made of\r\nwood, and in most churches was placed in a loft constructed for the\r\npurpose over the entrance from the church into the chancel.  The nave\r\nrepresented the Church Militant, and the chancel the Church Triumphant.\r\nThose, therefore, who would pass out of the former into the latter, must\r\ngo under the loft; that is, must go under the cross and suffer\r\naffliction.  But no rood was complete without the images of the Virgin\r\nand St. John on either side of the cross, in allusion to St. John xix.\r\n26,—“Jesus saw His mother and the disciple standing by, whom He loved.”\r\n\r\nThe Choir contains sixty-two stalls according to the number of the old\r\nfoundations, namely, a prior, sub-prior, and sixty monks.  They are\r\nadorned with rich and quaint carvings and canopies, as far as the west\r\npillars of the tower.  The “misereres” (projecting brackets on the under\r\nside of the seats of stalls in churches), are richly carved and present a\r\ngreat variety of design.  Among the stalls the Rev. R. Hart discovered\r\nupwards of sixty _misereres_, and he described them very minutely.  In\r\nevery example that he had seen the space under the ledge is carved in a\r\nbold relief, with an ornamented boss on each side to balance, as it were,\r\nthe centre, whatever it might have been.  As may be supposed scriptural\r\nor legendary designs are not often found in such a position.  There are,\r\nhowever, a few examples.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the tower, which is raised on four massive arches,\r\npresents three arcades, the upper and lower forming galleries, and the\r\nformer containing the lower windows of the lantern, which are filled with\r\npainted glass.  The clerestory and roof of the chancel are the work of\r\nBishop Goldwell.  Here is an admirable specimen of engrafting a later\r\nstyle upon the Norman architecture, with as little violence to the eye as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Bishop Goldwell stands within the chapel, formerly dedicated\r\nto St. James, and with its canopy forms a rich specimen of ornamental\r\nsculpture and architecture.  On the east side of the fifteenth north\r\npillar is the monument to the memory of the learned Bishop Home, author\r\nof an excellent “Introduction to the Study of the Bible.”  In the space\r\nbetween the seventeenth and eighteenth pillars was the chapel dedicated\r\nto St. Anne, and in the next space was the seat occupied by Queen\r\nElizabeth, when she attended divine service during her visit to this\r\ncity.  The monument to the late Bishop Bathurst now occupies the spot, a\r\nsitting statue sculptured in white marble.  Not only for its intrinsic\r\nmerits is this statue of great value, but also because it is the last\r\nfinished work of Sir Francis Chantrey, who visited Norwich for the\r\npurpose of fixing it only a few days before his death.  Opposite to this\r\nmonument is the altar tomb of Sir William Boleyn, now despoiled of its\r\nbrasses.  Sir Thomas Browne tells us in his “Repertorium,” that, during\r\nthe Commonwealth, “more that a hundred” brasses were reeved in the\r\nCathedral alone,—a greater number than the whole county of Norfolk could\r\nnow supply.  Hence our readers may easily understand what an immense\r\nnumber of these interesting memorials must have been lost, independently\r\nof the number that have been partially despoiled by the removal of their\r\ncanopies.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the altar steps, in the middle of the chancel, is the tomb\r\nof Bishop Herbert de Losinga, erected by the Dean and Chapter, in 1682,\r\nin the place of one destroyed during the civil wars.  It has been\r\nlevelled with the pavement and presents a long Latin inscription from the\r\npen of Dean Prideaux.  The east windows of the clerestory were the gift\r\nof the Bishop, the Misses Morse, and the Dean and Chapter of the\r\nCathedral, and were erected between 1840 and 1847.  The lower one in the\r\ntriforium is an obituary window to the memory of the late Canon Thurlow,\r\nplaced there by his friends.  This space had before been occupied by a\r\nwindow with a pointed arch, representing the Transfiguration.  The window\r\nwas removed to the south transept, and the arches of both windows have\r\nbeen restored.\r\n\r\nThe bishop’s throne, ascended by three steps, was originally placed at\r\nthe east end of the church, behind the altar, and raised so high that\r\nbefore the partition was made between the altar and the entrance to Our\r\nLady’s chapel, the bishop had an uninterrupted view from his throne\r\ndirectly in a line through the whole church.  The custos, or master of\r\nthe high altar, annually accounted for the offerings made there, which\r\nproduced a large sum; and at the annual processions of the city and\r\ncountry clergy, on the feasts of the Holy Trinity and St. Paul, something\r\nconsiderable was realized.\r\n\r\nThe stone roof of the south transept, as well as that of the north, was\r\nraised by Bishop Nykke, about 1501.  At the same time, probably, the old\r\nNorman arch leading into the chancel aisle was filled with the rich and\r\nnumerous mullions and tracery, which characterise the last period of\r\npointed architecture.  The adjoining aisle leads to the chapel of our\r\nLady the Less, otherwise called Bawchyn’s Chapel, having been dedicated\r\nto the Virgin and all the Saints, by William de Bawchyn, about the middle\r\nof the fourteenth century.  The founder is buried in an arched vault\r\nunder the chapel.  This chapel is now used as the Consistory Court.\r\nAdjoining is St. Luke’s Chapel, sometimes used as the parish church of\r\nSt. Mary in the Marsh, that church having been demolished.  Strictly\r\nspeaking, the circular part only is the chapel dedicated to St. Luke, but\r\nthe adjoining aisle, as far as the most eastward point, is now enclosed\r\nand fitted up for the use of the parish.  It is part of Bishop Herbert’s\r\noriginal foundation.  The font was brought from the parish church; it is\r\nrichly carved with designs of the seven sacraments, &c.  Passing round at\r\nthe back of the altar we come to the Jesus Chapel.\r\n\r\nThe north transept is similar to the south.  From the east wall of it\r\nthere was a doorway leading to a chapel, said to be the ancient Vestiary.\r\nThe arch has been filled up, and the entrance is from a small door on the\r\noutside.  Over the exterior of the door leading to the Bishop’s palace is\r\na niche, containing a figure, said to represent Bishop Herbert, one of\r\nthe few specimens extant of a Norman statue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Exterior_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE exterior of the Cathedral is not very imposing.  The west front was\r\nthe work of Bishop Alnwick, in the reign of Henry VI.  It is divided into\r\nthree compartments, forming the termination of the nave and the aisles.\r\nThe central division presents the grand entrance doorway, and a large\r\ncentral window filled with coloured glass, which we have already\r\ndescribed.  It rises into a gable, formerly pierced with a small light,\r\nnow a niche, flanked by two turrets with spirelets and round-headed\r\nsingle panels, and surmounted by a cross.  The doorway is formed by a\r\nbold deep-pointed arch, and is much enriched in the spandrels and side\r\nfasciæ with mouldings, niches, pedestals, statues, and other decorations.\r\nThe central window is divided, both horizontally and vertically, into\r\nthree leading compartments, and subdivided by small mullions; and has\r\ngood decorations of perpendicular character.  Each of the two lateral\r\ndivisions of the west front exhibits pure Norman work, and is of three\r\nstories; the first pierced with the doorway; the second pierced with four\r\nwindows separated only by small columns; the third displaying three blank\r\narches, and flanked with a small staircase turret.  At each side of the\r\ngreat window, and at the extremities of the side divisions, are Norman\r\nturrets, lately restored and substituted for very debased cupolas.\r\nEngravings are extant representing this front with high and slender\r\npinnacles where the Norman turrets now stand.\r\n\r\nThe north and south elevations of the nave show a three-storied aisle;\r\nand a clerestory and triforium, with an embattled parapet in each,\r\nexhibit a great height, and tiers of blank arches or arcades with some\r\nlater perpendicular windows.  On the exterior of the nave will be\r\nobserved many traces of alterations in times long subsequent to the\r\noriginal building.  The lowest tiers of windows are of comparatively\r\nmodern insertion, and intersect the string course of a billet moulding,\r\nall round the exterior of the edifice.  Next above is the arcade of blank\r\narches, with semicircular mouldings, having regular bases and capitals,\r\nand continuing round the whole structure.  Above these was the tier of\r\noriginal windows now closed up, but surmounted by windows of the\r\nsixteenth century.  The exterior of the side aisles is here terminated by\r\na plain embattled parapet of the same date as the windows before\r\nmentioned.  The windows of the clerestory are, however, Norman, and have\r\nblank arches on each side, and continue the same all round the upper part\r\nof the nave and transept.  They are surmounted by a parapet similar to\r\nthat of the side aisles.  The exterior of the south transept has been\r\nlately restored, and various old houses that blocked up the entrance have\r\nbeen cleared away.\r\n\r\nThe tower is grandly Norman in four stages, each adorned with arcades,\r\ncolumns, and tracery mouldings.  It has, at the corners, square turrets\r\nwith their angles cut off, and is surmounted by decorated battlements and\r\ncrocketted pinnacles.  The spire is decorated English octangular,\r\nelegantly proportioned, enriched with bands, and boldly crocketted in\r\nribs running up its angles.  It terminates in a handsome finial, and is\r\nthe loftiest in England except that of Salisbury.  The base of the spire\r\nis supported by projecting buttresses at each angle, terminating in a\r\nsmall pinnacle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOISTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cloisters, which are entered by a tasteful modern door on the south\r\nside of the nave, form one of the most beautiful quadrangles in England.\r\nThey comprise a square of about 174 feet, and are 12 feet wide.  They\r\nwere commenced by Bishop Walpole about 1297, but were not completed by\r\nsucceeding prelates till 1430.  The style of architecture is the\r\ndecorated, with traces of the perpendicular.  The eastern part is the\r\nmost ancient, and a progressive change may be observed in the tracery of\r\nthe windows, commencing at the north-east corner, continuing through the\r\nsouth and the west, and terminating with the north sides.  The roof is\r\nmuch admired for its exquisitely beautiful groining, and its bold yet\r\nelegant bosses, with their sculptured subjects and tasteful foliage.  The\r\ndoorway leading from the eastern aisle of the cloisters to the nave is\r\ndeserving especial notice, being a pointed arch with four columns on each\r\nside, having archwolt mouldings, in front of which are seven canopied\r\nniches, with richly-sculptured crockets containing figures.  Above the\r\ndoor, at the south-west corner, are carved figures of “The Temptation of\r\nour First Parents.”  In the first two arches on the west side of the door\r\nare two lavatories, where the monks used to wash their hands before going\r\ninto the refectory or common eating hall.  Over each of these are three\r\nniches, where images formerly stood.  The cloisters are surpassed by none\r\nin beauty of architecture and solemnity of effect.  They branch off from\r\nthe south transept, and enclose a square court or area.  There are eleven\r\nnoble windows or arched openings on the western side, twelve on the east,\r\neleven on the north, and eleven on the south.  All these windows are\r\ndivided into three lights by two columns, and are decorated with a\r\nvariety of beautiful tracery.  They are of decorated architecture, except\r\neight on the north side, which have perpendicular tracery in decorated\r\narches.  The upper portion of the tracery of all the windows appears to\r\nhave been once filled with stained glass.\r\n\r\nThe pavement of the north side of the cloisters was torn up in the great\r\nrebellion, and relaid by William Burleigh, Esq.  In this alley Queen\r\nElizabeth dined in public when she visited Norwich in 1578.  In memory\r\nthereof, her Majesty’s arms and those of the nobility who attended her\r\nwere painted on the wall of the church, and properly blazoned with\r\nsupporters, etc., but they were entirely effaced a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe dormitory of the monks adjoined the cloisters on the south.  At a\r\nshort distance from the cloisters are the only remains of the Priory\r\nfounded by Bishop Herbert, consisting of three massive clustered columns,\r\nthe capitals of which are curiously carved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BISHOP’S PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop’s Palace stands on the north side of the Cathedral Church, to\r\nwhich there was in former times a passage from the door of the north\r\ntransept, arched over with stone similar to the cloisters.  The original\r\npalace was founded by Bishop Herbert, but has undergone so many repairs\r\nand alterations, that but little of the first building remains, and that\r\npart adjoins a new structure, in a similar style of architecture.  In the\r\ngarden there is a fine ruin, said to be remains of the grand entrance\r\ninto the great hall, which reached to the site of the present episcopal\r\nchapel, and was 110 feet long, and 60 broad.  This chapel was restored in\r\n1662, and in it are monuments of Bishops Reynolds and Sparrow.  The\r\nentrance to the episcopal residence is from St. Martin’s Plain, by the\r\npalace gate, built by Bishop Alnwyck about 1430.  It has a large pointed\r\narch of several mouldings, and the spandrels are filled with tracery; but\r\nit has suffered materially from injudicious repairs.  Over the arch is a\r\nseries of pannelled compartments with the letter M crowned.  On the west\r\nside is a small door, on which, amongst other ornaments, are a heart and\r\nmitre, the supposed rebus of Bishop Lyhart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL PRECINCTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral Precincts include the Upper and Lower Close, and a large\r\nportion of garden ground, with good houses on the south side.  The Upper\r\nClose was formerly used as a play ground to the Grammar School; it is now\r\nenclosed with palisades.  At the south-east corner is the Audit Room,\r\nwhich contains the library of the Dean and Chapter.  The Lower Close was\r\nenclosed by Dean Lloyd, in 1782, and converted into a garden.  At the\r\nextremity of the Lower Close, near the edge of the river, still stands a\r\ndouble arch of black flint, which is considered the roughest bit of\r\npicturesque in Norwich, and has been frequently sketched.  It was\r\nformerly the Water-gate to the precincts, and is now known as “Pull’s\r\nFerry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: The Free Grammar School]\r\n\r\nThe Free Grammar School, near the west end of the Cathedral, was founded\r\nby Bishop Salmon, in 1325, and annexed to a small Collegiate Chantry.  At\r\nthe dissolution of this college, the Corporation, by their Hospital\r\nCharter, were required to find a master and usher, and to remunerate them\r\nout of the ample revenues assigned to them by that charter.  This trust\r\nwas transferred, in 1836, from the Corporation to the Charity Trustees.\r\nThere are generally a little more than a hundred pupils at the school.\r\nThe celebrated Dr. Valpy was once the head-master; and in addition to\r\nmany eminent scholars, the celebrated “Norfolk hero,” Lord Nelson; Sir\r\nJames Brooke, the Rajah of Sarawak; and other noted characters, were\r\neducated here.  Opposite the school is a colossal marble statue of\r\nNelson.  It was executed by Mr. Milne, of London, and has been highly\r\ncommended as a work of art.  Of this school, and also of the Commercial\r\nSchool, which is under the same trust, we shall have more to say in\r\nsubsequent pages.\r\n\r\nThe Gateways to the Cathedral on the west side are deserving of notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ERPINGHAM GATE\r\n\r\n\r\nis situated directly before the west front of the Cathedral, and is in an\r\nexcellent state of preservation.  It was built in 1428 by Sir Thomas\r\nErpingham, (who lies buried in the choir of the Cathedral) as a penance\r\nfor having espoused the cause of Wickliffe.  It consists of a lofty\r\npointed arch, in the mouldings of which are a series of thirty-eight\r\nstatues in canopied niches.  The spandrels are highly decorated with\r\ntracery mouldings and shields, the whole being enclosed in a kind of\r\nsquare frame with semi-circular buttresses, each of which is divided into\r\nfour compartments with statues, niches, pedestals, and shields.  As a\r\nmatter of some interest, it may here be mentioned that over against the\r\nfront of this gate is a large block of buildings, enclosing what is\r\ncommonly called Sampson and Hercules’ Court.  The grotesque wood figures,\r\ndesigned to represent these personages, formerly supported the portico,\r\nbut are now placed in the paved court.  The one holds a club, and the\r\nother the jawbone of an ass.  The house itself was formerly owned by Sir\r\nJohn Fastolf, and afterwards by the Countess of Lincoln; and in the time\r\nof Henry VII. by Elizabeth Duchess of Suffolk, who used it as a city\r\nhouse for herself and family.  It is now in the occupation of Messrs.\r\nPratt and Hancock, wholesale grocers and cheese factors, who have covered\r\nin the whole court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ETHELBERT GATEWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nleads to the south end of the Upper Close.  It was built by the citizens\r\nas an atonement for the injuries done in a quarrel which they had with\r\nthe monks in 1272.  The chamber over the arch was formerly used as a\r\nchapel dedicated to St. Ethelbert, the church of that name having been\r\ndestroyed during the riots.  The west front has a modern pediment of\r\nstone tracery, inlaid with flint.  Beneath is a series of blank niches\r\nwith a statue in the centre.  In the spandrels of the arch are figures,\r\nin basso relievo, of a man with a sword and round shield attacking a\r\ndragon.  The east front consists of stone tracery and flint with painted\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIEW FROM THE CASTLE HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now return to the Castle-hill Walk, which is favourable for a\r\nview of the whole city, with all its churches and towers.  If we take our\r\nposition on the eastern side we shall see the broad vale of the Yare,\r\nwhere the Romans came up in their galleys and landed on that side of the\r\nriver, then very wide.  We shall see also where the first street (King\r\nStreet,) extends southward the whole length of the city, with tall\r\nchimnies of great breweries sending forth volumes of smoke.  Northward\r\nthe same street extends to an open space called Tombland; beyond which,\r\nWensum Street and Magdalen Street lead in a straight line to Catton and\r\nthe village of Sprowston.  The circle of vision includes the Cathedral,\r\nthe Grammar School, St. Helen’s Church, Mousehold Heath, Kett’s Castle,\r\nLollards’ Pit, the hamlet of Thorpe, the churches of St. Peter per\r\nMountergate, St. Julian, and St. Peter Southgate, in King Street.\r\nWalking round to the west side, we have before us the spacious Market\r\nPlace, and the noble church of St. Peter Mancroft, with a mass of\r\nbuildings.  From the Market Place we see several lines of streets running\r\nin a direction from east to west; Bethel Street, leading to St. Giles’\r\nChurch, and St. Giles’ Street, in a straight line to Heigham.  Here in\r\nthe foreground, the Guildhall is a conspicuous object.  More on the right\r\nwe have London Street, Prince’s Street, St. Andrew’s Street, Pottergate\r\nStreet, and St. Benedict’s Street, running in lines from east to west.\r\nHere, the chief objects are the churches of St. John’s Maddermarket and\r\nSt. Gregory; and in the distance, St. Lawrence, St. Margaret’s, and St.\r\nMichael’s at Coslany.  From the north side of the Castle walk we see\r\nExchange Street, Post Office Street leading into St. Andrew’s, and St.\r\nGeorge’s Street, Pitt Street, and St. Augustine’s, and St. Martin’s at\r\nOak, all the lower parts of the town, full of close narrow streets,\r\nyards, and courts.  The principal objects in view are St. Andrew’s Hall,\r\nthe churches of St. Martin at Oak, St. Mary, St. Augustine, St. George’s\r\nColegate, St. Saviour, St. Clement, St. Peter Hungate, St. Michael at\r\nPlea, St. Paul, St. Simon and Jude, St. Edmund, and St. George Tombland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATTLE MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cattle Market, on the south side of the hill, has been greatly\r\nextended, and presents the most extensive area for the purpose in\r\nEngland.  On the east side whole blocks of old houses have been cleared\r\naway, and great additions made to the space for the display of horses,\r\ncattle, sheep, and pigs.  The improvements cost the city over £50,000.\r\nEvery Saturday the hill presents a busy and highly interesting scene, and\r\na vast amount of business is transacted here in the space of a few hours.\r\nThe area has recently been further enlarged by the demolition of some old\r\nhouses at the corner of Golden Ball Street.  A line of new houses has\r\nbeen built on the east side, ending with the handsome show rooms of\r\nMessrs. Holmes and Sons, the well-known Agricultural Machine Makers, who\r\nhave won many prizes for their implements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHIREHALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shirehall, on the Castle Meadow, was erected from a plan by William\r\nWilkins, Esq.  It was commenced on September 9th, 1822, and opened\r\nSeptember 27th, 1823, and is a poor imitation of the Tudor style of\r\narchitecture.  It stands on the north-east side of the Castle, and is a\r\nsubstantial brick edifice, possessing all the usual accommodations.  It\r\ncomprises Crown Court, Nisi Prius Court, and rooms for witnesses and\r\nothers.  The county assizes and sessions are held in these courts.  Near\r\nthe crown court there is a small room communicating, by a shaft, with the\r\nprison above, whence prisoners are brought down for trial.  The grand\r\nJury room is a large apartment, and the walls are adorned with fine\r\nportraits of the late Lord Wodehouse and the late Earl of Leicester,\r\npainted by Sir T. Lawrence.  There is also a portrait of the late Henry\r\nDover, Esq., for many years Chairman at Quarter Sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUILDHALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Guildhall is a large antique building, chiefly of flint, at the north\r\nend of the Market Place.  It was completed in 1413, when the windows of\r\nthe Council Chamber were glazed chiefly with stained glass; but all these\r\nornaments have disappeared, except in three east windows.  The furniture\r\nof this room is of the time of Henry VIII., and the wood work is\r\nornamented with the linen pattern.  The room has been much improved of\r\nlate years.  The principal court is on the ground floor, where the city\r\nassizes and sessions are held.  The Police Court is in a room above,\r\nopposite the Council Chamber.  The Town Clerk and City Treasurer have\r\noffices in the building.  The Police Station is on the ground floor of\r\nthe east side.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the hall is decorated with portraits, some interesting\r\ntrophies of the battle of St. Vincent, presented by Nelson, the city\r\nregalia, and the buskins of a famous dancer, who danced from London to\r\nNorwich in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.  When that Queen visited the\r\ncity in 1578, there was a magnificent banquet given in the Council\r\nChamber, and a pageant devised for her amusement was exhibited.  In one\r\nof the cells at the bottom of the building, the martyr Thomas Bilney was\r\nconfined, and there tested his powers of endurance by holding his finger\r\nin the lighted flame of a candle, to prove his willingness to suffer his\r\napproaching doom.  In 1660, the lower court at the west end, now used as\r\nan assize court, was set apart as a cloth hall, and the room above as a\r\nplace for the sale of yarn.  During the present century the hall has been\r\nmuch improved on the south side.  New windows should be inserted on the\r\nnorth side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ANDREW’S HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Andrew’s Hall stands in the centre of the city, in the parish of St.\r\nAndrew.  It was originally the Church of the Convent of the Blackfriars,\r\nthe building of which was begun about the year 1415, by Sir Thomas\r\nErpingham, who died in 1428, before it was finished.  It was completed by\r\nhis son, Sir Robert Erpingham, who was rector of Bracon Ash, in Norfolk,\r\na friar of the order of St. Dominic, and a member of this convent.  This\r\nconvent extended from St. Andrew’s Street to the river from south to\r\nnorth, and as far as Elm Hill on the east.  The cloister was on the north\r\nside of the church, with a burial place in the middle.  The convent\r\nkitchen was at the north-west corner.  Between the nave and choir of the\r\nchurch there was a neat sexangular steeple, which had three large bells\r\nin it and a clock.  It was built about 1462, and fell down on November\r\n6th, 1712.  A turret was afterwards erected in its place, in which a\r\nclock bell hung.  At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538, the\r\ncitizens applied to Henry VIII., through the interest of the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, for a grant of the convent for the use of the city, and\r\nrequested that he would allow them to make the church into “a large hall,\r\nfor the mayor and his brethren, with all the citizens to repair unto at\r\ncommon assemblies,” to make a chapel of the choir, and to appropriate the\r\nrest of the building to other purposes.  This was complied with, and the\r\npetition is dated June 25th, 1540.  After this, the guilds of the several\r\ncompanies in the city, twenty in number, used to hear mass in the choir,\r\nand make their offerings in that place; and most of them held their\r\nfeasts in the hall.\r\n\r\nIn 1544, Henry Fuller, Esq., being then mayor, kept the first mayor’s\r\nfeast in grand style in the new hall.  In 1561, the Earls of\r\nNorthumberland and Huntingdon, the Lord Thomas Howard, and Lord\r\nWilloughby, with many other lords and knights, came to Norwich to visit\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, and they lodged at the Duke’s palace.  At that very\r\ntime the mayor’s feast was held; and William Mingay, then mayor, invited\r\nthe noble lords and their ladies to the banquet.  They accepted the\r\ninvitation, and were entertained in princely style; and they expressed\r\ngreat satisfaction with their reception.  After dinner, Mr. John Martin,\r\na wealthy citizen, delivered the following characteristic speech:—\r\n\r\n    “Maister Mayor of Norwich, and it please your Worship, you have\r\n    feasted us like a King.  God bless the Queen’s Grace.  We have fed\r\n    plentifully; and now, whilom I can speak plain English, I heartily\r\n    thank you Maister Mayor; and so do we all.  Answer, Boys, Answer.\r\n    Your Beer is pleasant & potent, and will soon catch us by the\r\n    _caput_, and stop our manners: And so Huzza for the Queen’s Majesty’s\r\n    Grace, and all her bonny-brow’d Dames of Honour.  Huzza for Maister\r\n    Mayor and our good Dame Mayoress.  His noble grace, there he is, {53}\r\n    God bless him, and all this jolly company.  To all our friends round\r\n    county, who have a penny in their purse, and an English heart in\r\n    their bodies, to keep out Spanish Dons, and Papists with their\r\n    faggots to burn our whiskers.  Shove it about, twirl your cap cases,\r\n    handle your jugs, and Huzza for Maister Mayor, and his brethren,\r\n    their Worships.”\r\n\r\nOn many subsequent occasions, the hall was the scene of grand civic\r\nfestivities, to which we shall have to allude hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe Triennial Musical Festivals are held here.  And, formerly, the\r\nassizes for the city; the nomination of candidates to represent the city\r\nin Parliament; and the mayor’s feasts, which were generally given on the\r\nday when he was sworn into office, were also all held in this spacious\r\nbuilding; and on some festive occasions, nearly 1000 ladies and gentlemen\r\nhave dined here, including most of the principal families of the city.\r\nSeveral times between 1650 and 1700 the hall was proclaimed “a public\r\nexchange for the despatch of business between merchants and tradesmen.”\r\nThe last time was in 1725, when it was used only one year.  It was opened\r\nin October, 1796, as a corn exchange and continued to be used as such\r\nevery Saturday till 1828.  Under the superintendance of Mr. Barry, the\r\nCity Surveyor, a complete restoration of the hall was effected in 1863.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the hall, as seen from the plain, presents an imposing\r\nappearance, chiefly owing to the fine effect of its long range of\r\nclerestory windows, of which there are fourteen on each side.  The five\r\nwesternmost windows on the south side are each of three lights, of\r\ndecorated character, being of earlier date than any of the other windows.\r\nThe sixth or easternmost window is of four lights, perpendicular in\r\nstyle.  On the north side are six beautiful perpendicular windows of four\r\nlights, probably the most elegant in style in the eastern counties.  The\r\nprincipal entrance is through the new porch on the south-west, which is\r\nsimilar in style to the original building.  A large entrance door is\r\nprovided in the centre of the west front, and above this there is a large\r\nand beautiful five-light window, producing a fine effect in the interior\r\nof the hall.  The interior consists of a nave, 124 feet by 32 feet; and\r\nnorth and south aisles, 124 feet by 16 feet, each being divided from the\r\nnave by six lofty and handsomely-moulded stone columns, supporting seven\r\nelegant stone arches.  Above these arches are the clerestory windows,\r\nfourteen on each side, perpendicular in style, and somewhat later in\r\ncharacter than the other windows.  The roof, which is of chestnut, is of\r\nhammer-beam construction, with moulded spandrel brackets and circular\r\nshafts.  From the hammer-beams spring moulded arch ribs.  The rafters,\r\nwhich were originally visible, are plastered on the underside, giving the\r\neffect of panelling; the ground-work being intense blue with gilded\r\nstars.  The hollows in the whole of the timber are coloured vermillion,\r\nand gilded pateræ are inserted within these hollows at stated distances.\r\nThe circular ribs are finished with a bead on the underside, which is\r\ndecorated by spiral bands, alternately drab and oak colours.  The\r\nintersection of the main timbers at the apex of the roof is distinguished\r\nby carved bosses, richly gilt.  The aisle roofs are similarly decorated,\r\nbut without the gilded pateræ.  At the east end the orchestra is placed\r\nwithin a recess, under a fine deeply-moulded stone arch, of large size.\r\n\r\nThe nave and aisles are lighted at night by nine polished brass coronæ,\r\nof characteristic design, pendant from the centres of the arched ribs of\r\nthe roof.  When lighted up at night, during the Choral Society and\r\nFestival Concerts, the interior presents a very brilliant appearance.\r\nAmongst the principal attractions of the hall are the portraits of city\r\nworthies and some historical paintings.  A fine work of art, Queen\r\nEleonora sucking the poison from her husband’s wound; and another, the\r\nDeath of Lady Jane Grey, by Martin, a native of this city; may be seen at\r\nthe west end.  Large sums have been offered for them.  The two oldest\r\nportraits in the hall are Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark.  A\r\nfine portrait of Admiral Lord Nelson, painted by Sir William Beechey, was\r\nthe last for which the illustrious “Norfolk Hero” sat after his return to\r\nEngland in 1801.  It is allowed to be an admirable likeness.  He is\r\nstanding on the quarter deck of a man of war; the tri-coloured flag of\r\nFrance is lying at his feet; and the flag of Spain lies on a cannon;\r\nleaning against which is the sword of the Spanish Admiral, Don Xavier\r\nWinthysen, surrendered to him on February 14th, 1797.  On the hero’s hat\r\nis the magnificent diamond Aigrette, or Plume of Triumph, and under it\r\nthe rich pelisse of sable fur, both of which were presented to him by the\r\nGrand Seigneur.  He is decorated with the red riband as Knight of the\r\nBath, and with the blue riband and medal suspended therefrom, which are\r\nthe Insignia of the Order of St. Ferdinand.  On his breast are stars of\r\nthe most honourable Order of the Bath, of the Grand Cross, of the Order\r\nof St. Ferdinand, and of the Imperial Order of the Crescent Suspended\r\nfrom his neck by a riband, hang two gold chains, and another is affixed\r\nto his button hole on the right side, all of which had been presented to\r\nhim, at various times, for his unparalleled naval victories.\r\n\r\n    “Such honours England to her hero paid,\r\n    And peaceful sleeps the mighty Nelson’s shade.”\r\n\r\nThis superb painting may be seen at the west end of the hall on the north\r\nside.  Gainsborough painted the portrait of Sir Harbord Harbord,\r\nafterwards Lord Suffield, considered one of the best in the hall.\r\nAmongst the other portraits in the building are some painted by\r\nGainsborough, Beechey, Heins, Smith, Bardwell, Stoppelaer, Adolphe, Opie,\r\nClover, Hoppner, Lawrence, and Thompson.  The following is a list in\r\nchronological order, with names of the painters.\r\n\r\n_Name_.                              _Artist_.                _Date of\r\n                                                             Picture_.\r\nQueen Anne                                                        1705\r\nPrince George                                                     1705\r\nBenjamin Nuthall      Mayor          Heins                        1721\r\nRobert Marsh          Mayor          Heins                        1731\r\nFrancis Arnam         Mayor          Heins                        1732\r\nTimothy Balderstone   Mayor          Heins                        1736\r\nThomas Vere, M.P.

The original building, which was erected\r\nin 1828, at a cost of £6000, being found too small, was taken down in\r\n1861, and the present spacious edifice was built by a company at a cost\r\nof £16,000, including the site.  The exterior is massive in its effect.\r\nThe key stone of the large window has a carved head of Ceres.  The\r\ninterior is well lighted from the roof, the superficial area of the glass\r\nbeing equal to the area of the hall.  The inside measurement is 125 feet\r\nby 81 feet.  The height from the floor is 66 feet.  At the east end are\r\nportraits of John Culley, Esq., the originator of the Exchange, and of\r\nthe late Earl of Leicester, who was justly regarded as the greatest\r\nfarmer in Norfolk.  A large amount of business is transacted here every\r\nSaturday afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORWICH PUBLIC LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Public Library is located in a spacious room built for the\r\npurpose at the end of an avenue opposite the Guildhall.  The first\r\nmeeting of subscribers was held there on September 7th, 1837.  The\r\nlibrary contains about 30,000 volumes, including many old books of\r\ndivinity and archæology.  The yearly subscription is one guinea paid by\r\nshareholders, and 26s. paid by others; and subscribers are entitled to\r\nborrow two sets of books at a time.  The library is open from 10 a.m.\r\ntill 9 p.m.  Besides the large room which contains the books, there are\r\nsmaller rooms for the convenience of readers.  Mr. Langton is the\r\nlibrarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORFOLK AND NORWICH MUSEUM\r\n\r\n\r\nis a fine building, erected in 1839, in Broad Street, St. Andrew’s.  It\r\ncontains very valuable collections in geology, ethnology, and entomology,\r\nbut chiefly in ornithology.  The specimens in ornithology comprise nearly\r\nall the varieties of the raptores or birds of prey, mostly supplied by J.\r\nH. Gurney, Esq.  A large new room in the adjoining building is filled\r\nwith specimens of British birds, also contributed by J. H. Gurney, Esq.,\r\nwhose portrait adorns the room.  The fossil remains of mammalia, for the\r\nmost part discovered in Norfolk, are extremely interesting.  Two other\r\nspacious rooms have just been added to the Museum, one of which is filled\r\nwith Elephantine Remains, contributed by the Rev. Jno. Gunn; and the\r\nbotanical department has been enriched by the late J. D. Salmon’s\r\nwell-arranged specimens, bequeathed by him to this institution, which is\r\nopen free on Mondays and Saturdays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORFOLK AND NORWICH LITERARY INSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\noccupies the upper part of the same building as the Museum, and a large\r\nroom in the adjoining one.  It was established in 1822, and contains more\r\nthan 20,000 well-selected volumes in the various departments of\r\nliterature.  It is supported by several hundred subscribers who pay two\r\nguineas yearly, and the shareholders pay a guinea and a half yearly.\r\nEvery member has the privilege of borrowing two books, and a pamphlet and\r\nreview at the same time.  A greater number is allowed to country members,\r\nas well as a longer time for reading.  The rooms are open from 10 a.m.\r\ntill 9 p.m.  Mr. F. Quinton is the librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a large building at the corner of St. Andrew’s Broad Street;\r\nerected in 1856, and opened in 1857, under the Free Libraries and Museum\r\nAct, by the Corporation, at a cost of £10,000.  It includes large rooms\r\nfor the Museum and the Free Library, the Literary Institution, and the\r\nSchool of Art.  The Free Library, in the lower room, contains about 4,000\r\nvolumes, and the Old Collection called the City Library.  The middle room\r\nabove is fitted up as a lecture hall.  The School of Art is located at\r\nthe top of the building, where rooms are furnished for about 200 pupils,\r\nwho receive instruction in drawing, designing, and decorative art.  There\r\nis a committee of management for the Free Library, another for the\r\nMuseum, and another for the School of Art.  Mr. Harper is the librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEATRE ROYAL\r\n\r\n\r\nis situate at a short distance from the Market Place, in Theatre Street.\r\nIt is a very plain building, erected in 1826, but the interior is quite\r\ncommodious enough for the limited number of patrons which Norwich\r\nfurnishes to the drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POST OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nis a large, but by no means handsome building; situate in Post Office\r\nStreet, near the Market Place.  There are two deliveries from London\r\ndaily, and mails daily to all parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARISHES AND PARISH CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorwich appears to have taken the lead in the erection of religious\r\nedifices.  At a very early period, before the reign of Edward the\r\nConfessor, the city contained 25 churches, and in the eleventh century,\r\n55 existed in or near the town.  After the conquest, 43 chapels were in\r\nthe patronage of the burgesses, most of which were afterwards made\r\nparochial.  In the reign of Edward III., 58 parish churches and chapels\r\nwere within the walls, besides 19 monastic institutions and cells,\r\nanchorages, &c.  Norwich still contains a greater number of churches and\r\nparishes than any other city in England except London.  Many of the\r\npresent churches are excellent specimens of ancient architecture.\r\nSeveral of them are built of squared flints.  Besides the cathedral there\r\nare three undoubted specimens of the Norman style, and there are also\r\nmany examples of the decorated or florid which succeeded the lancet\r\nstyle, of the transition style, and of the perpendicular.  This later\r\nperpendicular style, which prevailed during the 15th and 16th centuries,\r\nis the chief characteristic of the city churches.  The best examples of\r\nthis style are the churches of St. Peter Mancroft, St. Andrew, St.\r\nStephen, St. Giles, and St. John Maddermarket; also St. Andrew’s Hall.\r\nOf all these churches complete restorations have been lately effected.\r\nThe original designs have been faithfully adhered to by the architects\r\nand contractors, which is the highest praise that can be awarded them.\r\nIn this age we can only restore or rebuild; we cannot invent new orders\r\nof architecture.  All our restorations take us back to the middle ages,\r\nand the spirit of those ages seems to be again revived in our parish\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to describe the parishes and parish churches, in\r\nfour districts, west, east, north, and south.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe western district is the most prominent, comprising the Market Place,\r\nthe parishes of St. Peter at Mancroft, St. Giles, St. Gregory, St. John’s\r\nMaddermarket, St. Andrew, St. Margaret, St. Benedict, St. Swithin, and\r\nSt. Lawrence.  Nearly all the public buildings are situated in this part\r\nof the town—the Guildhall, the Corn Hall, the Post Office, the Museum,\r\nthe Free Library and School of Art, the Public Library, and the Literary\r\nInstitution.  The Market Place is about 200 yards in length, and 110 in\r\nbreadth, but part of that area is occupied by the Guildhall, and St.\r\nPeter’s church.  A handsome bronze statue of the Duke of Wellington, 8 ft\r\n6 in. high, was erected, at a cost of £1000, in the middle of the Market\r\nPlace in 1854.  This statue is placed on a granite pedestal, surrounded\r\nby a low railing with lamps at the corners.  The new Fish Market is on\r\nthe western side of the Market Place.  It consists of two rows of shops\r\nwith an open space between, and was built, a few years ago, at a cost of\r\n£6000.  On Saturdays the Market Place presents a highly animated scene,\r\nand is well supplied with provisions of every kind.  It is generally\r\ncrowded from morning till night by the citizens, and by the vendors of\r\nthe produce of the field, the garden, or the dairy.  It is surrounded by\r\nhandsome shops, warehouses, hotels, and taverns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Peter of Mancroft_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis parish was, at the beginning of the Confessor’s reign, an open\r\nfield, that part of it which is now the Market Place, being the great\r\ncroft of the Castle or Magna Crofta.  Towards the end of the Confessor’s\r\nreign it began to be built over and inhabited; and at the survey of 1086,\r\nthe whole field was owned and held by Ralf de Guader, Earl of Norfolk, in\r\nright of his castle, who granted it to the King in Common to make a new\r\nburgh between them, which burgh contained the entire parishes of St.\r\nPeter of Mancroft and St. Giles.  The Earl Ralf founded the church of St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul at Mancroft, and gave it to his chaplains.  On his\r\nforfeiture, Robert Blund, the Sheriff, received an ounce of gold, yearly,\r\nfrom the chaplains; and on Godric’s becoming sheriff, the Conqueror gave\r\nit to Wala his chaplain, at which time it was worth £3 per annum.\r\n\r\nSir Peter Read, though not certainly known to be a native of this city,\r\nyet deserves to be mentioned here, because he was buried in St. Peter’s\r\nChurch, having this inscription on his monument:—\r\n\r\n    “Hereunder lieth the corps of Peter Read, Esq., who hath worthily\r\n    served not only his prince and country, but also the Emperor Charles\r\n    the Fifth, both at his Conquest of Barbary, and his siege of Tunis,\r\n    as also in other places, who had given him, by the said Emperor, the\r\n    Order of Barbary, who died on the 29th December, in the year of our\r\n    Lord God 1566.”\r\n\r\nIf it be demanded why the title of “knight” was not put on his tomb, but\r\nonly “esquire,” it may be answered that he was knighted by the Emperor\r\nCharles V., and Queen Elizabeth would suffer no foreign honour to be worn\r\nby her subjects in her dominions, saying, “Her sheep should be known by\r\nher mark only.”  The knight lies buried in the east corner of the north\r\naisle of this church.  His effigy in complete armour is on a brass plate\r\non the stone.  He gave £4 4_s._ yearly from the rental of houses in St.\r\nGiles’, that the great bell of St. Peter’s Mancroft Church should ring at\r\nfour o’clock every morning and eight in the evening for the benefit of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nThe following epitaph in this church is a specimen of good versification\r\nfor the time in which it was written, 1616:—\r\n\r\n    “Here Richard Anguishe sleepes for whom alyve\r\n    Norwich and Cambridge lately seemed to strive;\r\n    Both called him son as seemed well they might;\r\n    Both challenged in his life an equal right:\r\n    Norwich gave birth and taught him well to speake\r\n    The mother English, Latin phrase, and Greeke;\r\n    Cambridge with arts adorned his ripening age\r\n    Degress and judgment in the sacred page;\r\n    Yet Norwich gains the vantage of the strife,\r\n    Whiles there he ended where began his life.\r\n\r\n                                          September XXIII.  Ao Dni. 1616.”\r\n\r\nThe church is a large handsome cruciform structure of freestone mixed\r\nwith flint, begun in 1430 and finished in 1455.  It is a good example of\r\nthe perpendicular style, and is the finest parish church in the city.  It\r\nis 212 feet in length, and 70 feet in breadth, with a noble tower 98 feet\r\nhigh, covered with paneling, and containing an excellent peal of 12\r\nbells, a clock, and chimes.  The bells weigh 183 cwt. 2 qrs. 14 lbs., and\r\nwere exchanged for an old peal of ten in 1775, at a cost of £800 raised\r\nby public subscription.\r\n\r\nThe clustered pillars supporting the roof, with the arches surmounting\r\nthem, are lofty and slender, and the windows are large and numerous, so\r\nthat the whole interior has a light and airy appearance.  The roof of the\r\nnave is of fine open timber work, with a sort of wooden vault over each\r\nwindow, like a stone roof.  The Clerestory has seventeen fine windows on\r\neach side, with short transoms in the heads, and good tracery.  The\r\nvaulting shafts are brought down to the bottom of the clerestory windows,\r\nand have niches under them.  There is a chancel or small transept on each\r\nside of the nave.  The font stands under a perpendicular canopy,\r\nsupported by pillars, and forming a baptistry on a raised platform, with\r\nroom to walk round the font.  The east window is filled with beautiful\r\nstained glass, mostly ancient.  There are some fine paintings in the\r\nvestry.  The church was restored, the old pews were replaced by open oak\r\nbenches, and a new pulpit, reading desk, and altar rail, handsomely\r\ncarved, were purchased in 1851.  During the alterations, a vault four or\r\nfive feet deep was discovered under the stalls of the choir.  The outer\r\nwall of this vault supported the screen dividing the choir from the nave\r\nand aisles, and contained a range of about a dozen earthen jars, placed\r\non their sides with their mouths open to the vault.  The use of these\r\njars has never been ascertained.  The benefice is a perpetual curacy\r\ncertified at £10, and now valued at £87.  It was augmented in 1746 with\r\n£200 given by the Rev. J. Francis, with £100 of royal bounty from 1742 to\r\n1810, and with £400 subscribed by the minister and parishioners in 1818.\r\nThe Rev. C. Turner, M.A., is incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Giles_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Giles’ Street, west of the Market Place, is one of the best built in\r\nthe city, and leads to the small parish of St. Giles.  The church, near\r\nthe top of the street, was founded in the reign of William I. by Elwyn\r\nthe priest, who gave it to the monks of Norwich.  Consequently it is now\r\nin the patronage of the Dean and Chapter.  It is frequently called “St.\r\nGiles on the Hill” in ancient records.  It is a fine structure in the\r\nperpendicular style, and is one of the handsomest old churches in the\r\ncity.  It was wholly rebuilt in the reign of Richard I., but after 1581\r\nthe old chancel was demolished.  A new chancel has been recently built,\r\nand the church completely restored.  The nave is of five bays, and has a\r\ngood open timber roof, supported by angels bearing shields, emblazoned\r\nwith the arms of England, France, and Castile.  The clerestory windows\r\nhave been modernised.  The south porch has a fine groined vault with fan\r\ntracery, and is surmounted by a parvise, and a rich parapet and cornice.\r\nThe nave and aisles are 81 feet long, divided by slender pillars, and are\r\nlighted by large and elegant windows.  The tower is 120 feet high, and\r\ncontains a clock and eight bells.  The church estate consists of small\r\ntenements given by Thomas Parker in 1534.  The perpetual curacy, valued\r\nat £70, was augmented from 1744 to 1791 with £1000 of Queen Anne’s\r\nbounty.  The Rev. W. Nottidge Ripley, M.A., is the incumbent.\r\n\r\nPassing from the Market Place to Pottergate Street we come to the parish\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Gregory_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church is a fine structure of great antiquity, in the perpendicular\r\nstyle.  The chancel was rebuilt in 1325, and the whole pile has received\r\nmany modern repairs.  The nave and aisles, with the two chapels at the\r\neast end, were new leaded in 1537.  In 1597, a timber spire covered with\r\nlead was erected on the tower, and was the only spire in Norwich, except\r\nthat of the Cathedral, but being unsafe, it was taken down.  The tower\r\ncontains a clock and six bells, the latter given by the parishioners in\r\n1818.  The tower arch is very lofty, and across it is the original stone\r\ngallery for the singers, with groined vaults above and beneath, the lower\r\npart forming a western porch opening into the north and south porches,\r\nwhich are also groined.  There are four well moulded arches on each side\r\nof the nave, with clustered shafts having embattled caps.  The rood stair\r\nturret remains on the north side of the edifice.  The clerestory windows\r\nhave decorated tracery, and the windows of the aisles are of a mixed\r\ncharacter under arches recessed in the walls.  In 1861, Mr. Wm. Smith,\r\nand the incumbent collected £800 for the purpose of restoring the church\r\nand reseating it in oak.  The perpetual curacy was certified at £3, and\r\nis now valued at £120.  It was augmented from 1747 to 1812 with £1400 of\r\nroyal bounty.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons.  The present incumbent\r\nis the Rev. J. Wortley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. John’s Maddermarket_.\r\n\r\n\r\nis a very populous parish near the Market Place, between Pottergate\r\nStreet and Charing Cross.  The church is a large handsome edifice in the\r\nperpendicular style, consisting of a nave, two aisles, two porches, and a\r\nfine tower, under which is an arched rood, and on the top are four\r\nfigures at the angles.  The fine decorated east window is of five lights\r\nwith flowing tracery.  The north porch has a richly-groined vault, and\r\nits outer doorway is deeply recessed.  The roofs of the chapel of All\r\nSaints at the east end of the north aisle, and of St. Mary the Virgin in\r\nthe south aisle, are boarded under and painted with angels holding books\r\nand scrolls, with sentences from the Te Deum, the Angelical Salutation,\r\n&c.  The church has been completely restored recently at a cost of £1200.\r\nLady Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, (second wife of the Duke, who was\r\nbeheaded in Elizabeth’s reign,) died at the Duke’s Palace, in this\r\nparish, in 1563, and was interred with great pomp on the north side of\r\nthe choir, where a mural monument was erected to her memory in 1791 by\r\nLord John Howard of Waldon.  The benefice is a discharged rectory, valued\r\nin K. B. at £7 10s. 2d., and now at £110.  It was augmented from 1714 to\r\n1814 with £1800 of royal bounty.  It is in the patronage of New College,\r\nOxford, to which it was granted by Henry VI.  The Rev. G. F. Price is the\r\npresent incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Andrew_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Andrew is extensive, and populous, and improvements\r\nhave been made in some of the streets, where large premises have been\r\nbuilt.  The church in Broad Street, to which it gives its name, is a fine\r\nlarge perpendicular structure, consisting of nave, chancel, aisles,\r\nclerestory, and tower.  The latter, which has seven bells and a clock,\r\nwas rebuilt in 1478, and the nave and chancel were rebuilt in 1606.  The\r\nwindow at the east end is filled with stained glass.  There are sedilia\r\nfor three priests in the chancel, and several old stalls with\r\n“misereres.”  The interior contains many ancient as well as modern\r\nmonuments and inscriptions.  The whole of the interior has been recently\r\nrestored and renovated, and furnished with open benches instead of the\r\nold pews.  The gallery, which obscured the noble tower arch, was removed\r\nin 1863, and the fine screen work, so long hidden, brought to light.\r\nThere is no chancel arch, but the rood stair turret still remains on the\r\nsouth side; and under the east window, externally, are some good niches\r\nand panels.  A beautiful carved stone reredos was erected in 1850 by\r\nsubscription in memory of the late Rev. James Brown, B.D., who was the\r\nesteemed incumbent of this parish from 1807 to 1856.  The benefice is a\r\nperpetual curacy valued in 1831 at £90, and augmented from 1756 to 1786\r\nwith £800 of Queen Anne’s bounty, and with a grant of £600 in 1815.  The\r\nchurch estate is let in long leases, for £22 16s. yearly.  The\r\nparishioners are the patrons.  The Rev. A. C. Copeman, M.A., incumbent.\r\nIn this parish, on St. Andrew’s Hill, stood one of the oldest churches in\r\nthis city, dedicated to St. Christopher.  It was destroyed by fire in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII.  Remains of old vaults may be traced in a line of\r\nvaults and crypts under the City Arms Tavern, and on the premises of Mr.\r\nHarman, Wine and Spirit Merchant, higher up the street on the east side.\r\n\r\nThe Old Bridewell, in this parish, was built by Bartholomew Appleyard\r\nabout the year 1370.  The north wall is 79 feet in length and 27 feet in\r\nheight, and is considered one of the greatest curiosities of the kind in\r\nEngland.  The flints are squared to such a nicety, that the edge of a\r\nknife can scarcely be put between them.  Most of them are about three\r\ninches square.  The surface is very smooth, and no brickwork can appear\r\nmore regular.  The building was nearly destroyed by fire on October 22nd,\r\n1751, and again much damaged by fire on July 28th, 1753, but this curious\r\nwall sustained little injury.  Mr. Talman says, “That the Jews introduced\r\nthe art of squaring flints;” and Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, Secretary to the\r\nRoyal Society, states that the gate of the Austin Friars at Canterbury,\r\nthat of St. John’s Abbey at Colchester, and the gate near the Whitehall,\r\nWestminster, are in the same taste, but the platform on the top of the\r\nRoyal Observatory at Paris, built in 1667, which is paved with flint in\r\nthis manner, is an instance in proof that the French had recovered this\r\nart exemplified in the Old Bridewell here.  William Appleyard, son of the\r\nbuilder, the first mayor of Norwich, occupied this house in 1403.  After\r\npassing through many hands, it became the property of the late Mr.\r\nNewbegin, who converted it into a tobacco factory.  His son, Mr. J.\r\nNewbegin, now holds the property, and has lately built a handsome\r\nwholesale tobacco warehouse on the premises next to the alley.\r\n\r\nIn Broad Street, St. Andrews, stood the ancient church of St. Crucis.  It\r\nwas dedicated to the honour of the Holy Cross, and was erected before the\r\nyear 1272.  It was desecrated in 1551, and the parish united to St.\r\nJohn’s Maddermarket.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Lawrence Church stands upon the very spot to which the arm of the sea\r\nrose in former times, when Norwich was merely a fishing town, and this\r\nspot was the quay or landing place for all herrings brought into the\r\ncity.  After the water had receded, the church was founded on the same\r\nsite in the reign of Edward the Confessor, in the 10th century.  In 1460,\r\nthe original building was taken down, and the present one was erected\r\ntwelve years afterwards.  It consists of a nave, chancel, aisles, north\r\nand south porches, clerestory, and a tower 112 feet high, with six bells.\r\nThe roof of the church is supported by clustered columns, the inside is\r\nlight and regular, and the windows are large and well filled with\r\ntracery.  They were formerly decorated with stained glass, all of which\r\nwas demolished by the Puritans in 1643.  There is here an ancient\r\noctangular font, ornamented with shields, angels, &c.  In the spandrels\r\nof an arched door, in the western side of the church, are two ancient\r\ncarvings, one representing the martyrdom of St. Lawrence broiling on a\r\ngridiron, and the other a number of Danish soldiers shooting arrows into\r\nthe body of King Edmund, whose head is seen lying in a thicket, as\r\ndescribed in the old legend.  The Rev. E. A. Hillyard is the present\r\nincumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Swithin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Swithin’s Church, situated between upper and lower Westwick Street,\r\nis a neat building, containing a nave, two aisles, and tower.  One side\r\nof the nave is supported by pointed arches on columns, and the other by\r\nround arches and square piers.  The Chapel of St. Mary, at the east end\r\nof the north aisle, had an altar, and the guild of the Holy Virgin,\r\ncalled the tanner’s guild, was kept there.  The rectory was anciently in\r\nthe donation of the See of Norwich, and in the year 1200 was annexed to\r\nthe deanery of Norwich, as were the churches of St. Simon and Jude, and\r\nCorstweyt, and the deanery of Taverham, and so held till 1329, when the\r\ndeaneries were separated from the churches which were then perpetually\r\nunited.  But notwithstanding this union, in 1546 Bishop Rugge separated\r\nthe advowson from the bishopric, and granted it to William Farrar and\r\nothers.  In 1608, John Ward was patron, who suffering a lapse, was by the\r\nbishop collated to it; and entry being made that the bishop had collated\r\nhim in full right, it has ever since been supposed to be in the bishop’s\r\npatronage, and held by sequestration or license at the bishop’s\r\nnomination.  During the cleaning of this Church in 1834, an ancient\r\nportrait of Edward the Confessor, painted on a panel, was found beneath\r\none of the seats, where it is supposed to have been placed during the\r\ncivil wars.  The altar piece contains portraits of Moses and Aaron, and\r\nthe church has an ancient font.  The rectory, valued in K. B. at £6 3s.\r\n4d., has been augmented, and is still in the patronage of the bishop.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe New Mills, as to a principal part of them, are in this parish.\r\nFormerly all the city bakers were obliged to grind here, and the miller,\r\nas a public servant, had a livery and badge given him every year.  The\r\nmills are still the property of the city, and in 1706 were let, with the\r\nbaker’s grant thereto belonging, for the term of 87 years, at the yearly\r\nrent of £200, but reduced in 1708 to £180.  The Mills are now let to Mr.\r\nWells, and produce a large quantity of flour weekly.  Steam mills are now\r\nalso at work in this locality, in the occupation of Messrs. Barber and\r\nSons, who are also proprietors of Hellesdon Mills.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Margaret_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Margaret’s Church, in Westwick Street, has a square tower with a\r\nspacious nave, chancel, and south aisle.  It is a plain building of the\r\nperpendicular period.  The rood stair turret remains on the north side of\r\nthe church, and on the south side of the altar is a small pedestal on\r\nwhich the bell that was rung at mass stood in former times.  The rectory\r\nis valued at £80.  The bishop is the patron, and the Rev. J. W. Cobb is\r\nthe rector.  The church which has been for some time disused, being in a\r\nvery ruinous condition, has just been restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Benedict_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict’s Church, at the end of the street to which it gives its\r\nname, is a small building with nave, chancel, north aisle, and round\r\ntower.  The tower contains three bells, and in the chancel is a piscina.\r\nThe church was repaired and re-roofed a few years since, at a cost of\r\n£150.  The living is a perpetual curacy valued at £95, and was augmented\r\nby royal bounty.  The Rev. J. Dombrain is the incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EASTERN DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis side of the city has been greatly improved by the formation of a new\r\nroad called Prince of Wales’ Road, from Foundry Bridge to the Castle\r\nHill.  Handsome houses have been built on each side, and broad pavements\r\nlaid down.  Rose Lane has been widened and improved.  The Castle Meadow\r\nhas been adorned by the erection of a new bank called the Crown Bank, a\r\nvery handsome building in the Corinthian style of architecture.  This is\r\nthe finest building of the kind in the eastern counties.\r\n\r\nThe Cavalry Barracks are situated in Barrack Street on the east side of\r\nthe city, on the site of an old manor house.  They were built by the\r\ngovernment in 1791 at a cost of £20,000.  The buildings are of brick, and\r\nform three sides of a square, the centre being for the accommodation of\r\nthe officers.  The wings accommodate the soldiers to the extent of 320\r\nmen, and 266 horses.  The high wall which surrounds the entire barracks,\r\nincluding the parade ground, encloses an area of ten acres.\r\n\r\nThe Dungeon Tower is opposite the barracks, on land called “The Hospital\r\nMeadow.”  It is a large round tower of brick, originally surrounded by a\r\nbattlement.  It was built as a prison for the cathedral precincts.  The\r\nNorfolk Railway Station stands in the hamlet of Thorpe near the Foundry\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Michael at Plea_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Michael at Plea is at the top of Queen Street.  This\r\nchurch was so named from the Archdeacon holding his pleas or courts\r\nthere.  It is a cruciform church with a low flint tower, and a modern\r\nbell turret.  Its transepts were formerly chapels dedicated to St. John\r\nthe Baptist and the Virgin Mary.  It contains several old paintings of\r\nthe crucifixion, resurrection, &c., in the panels.  About two years ago\r\nthe tower was restored at a cost of £250.  The rectory, valued in K. B.\r\nat £6 10s., and in 1831 at £85, was augmented with £600 of Queen Anne’s\r\nbounty from 1774 to 1791, and with a parliamentary grant of £1000 in\r\n1816.  The lords of the manors of Sprowston and Horsford are patrons\r\nalternately.  The Rev. C. Morse, LL.B., is the incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. George Tombland_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. George Tombland stands at the end of Prince’s Street,\r\nand is so named from the open space near it having formerly been used as\r\na burying place.  It has a handsome square tower which contains five\r\nbells, and was erected by the parishioners in 1445.  The nave, aisles,\r\nand chancel are covered with lead, and have some spacious galleries and\r\nornamental inscriptions of ancient and modern times.  The building is\r\nchiefly of the perpendicular period, but some portions are of an older\r\ndate.  Three new memorial windows were recently inserted on the north\r\nside.  Messrs. J. and J. King, Prince’s Street, put in the stained glass.\r\nThe Rev. W. Bridge was ejected from the incumbency of this parish for\r\nrefusing to read the Book of Sports.  He afterwards became pastor of the\r\nOld Meeting House.  The churchyard has been planted with shrubs, and if a\r\nneat iron railing were substituted for the present wall, it would greatly\r\nimprove the appearance of Tombland.  The Rev. K. Trimmer is the\r\nincumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Peter Hungate_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Peter Hungate Church is in the same street at the top of Elm Hill.\r\nThe original church was demolished in 1458, when the present one was\r\nbuilt.  It was built by John Paston and Margaret his wife.  It is of\r\nblack flint in the form of a cross, having a nave, chancel, transepts,\r\nand square tower with two bells.  The roof of the nave is ornamented with\r\nfigures of angels.  In 1861 the interior was much improved.  The rectory\r\nof St. Peter Hungate, valued in K.B. at £3 1s. 5½d., and now at £63, was\r\naugmented from 1743 to 1810 with £600 of royal bounty.  The Lord\r\nChancellor is patron, and the Rev. S. Titlow, M.A., has been rector since\r\n1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Simon and Jude_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Simon and Jude’s Church in Wensum Street has a nave, a chancel, and a\r\nlow flint and stone tower, with five bells.  It is in the perpendicular\r\nstyle, and is of great antiquity.  It contains a few old brasses, and\r\nseveral monuments of the Pettus family, in one of which lies, in complete\r\narmour, the figure of Sir J. Pettus, the first of the family who was\r\nknighted.  The Rev. J. F. Osborne is the incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Martin at Palace_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Martin at Palace Church stands opposite the entrance to the Bishop’s\r\nPalace.  It has a nave with aisles, chancel with aisles, clerestory, and\r\na tower with five bells.  It is of the plain perpendicular style, and\r\ncontains a good panelled octagon font.  The east window of the chancel is\r\nfilled with stained glass, representing the adoration of the magi, the\r\nannunciation, the crucifixion, the resurrection of our Saviour, &c.  The\r\nliving is a perpetual curacy valued at £70, and augmented from 1743 to\r\n1813 with £1800 of royal bounty.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons.  The\r\nRev. R. W. Barker is incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Helen_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Helen is situated on the east side of the cathedral,\r\nand nearly the whole of the parish belongs to the Great Hospital, which\r\nis an extensive range of buildings, comprising the antique remains of the\r\ndissolved hospital of St. Giles, and several modern additions erected at\r\nvarious periods, for the accommodation of the alms people who have been\r\nincreased in number progressively with the augmentation of the income.\r\nIn 1850, ninety-two men, and eighty-two women were lodged, fed, and\r\nclothed at the expense of the charity, which also supports a master and\r\nten nurses.  The alms people must be of the age of 65 years or upwards\r\nbefore their admission.  They are clothed in dark blue, and allowed\r\nsixpence per week each for pocket money.\r\n\r\nSt. Helen’s Church in Bishopgate Street belonged to the monks, who\r\ndemolished it and consolidated the cure with the church of St. Giles’\r\nHospital, now called the Great Hospital, on the opposite side of the\r\nstreet, soon after the foundation of the latter by Bishop Suffield in\r\n1250.  The whole of this hospital church, which serves as the parish\r\nchurch of St. Helen, is still standing.  It has a square perpendicular\r\ntower at the south-west corner, containing one bell.  The greater part of\r\nthe pile has been converted into lodgings for the alms people.  The\r\nchurch is fitted up with gothic carved work and open seats.  Kirkpatrick,\r\nthe antiquary, is buried here.  The perpetual curacy received by lot £200\r\nof Queen Anne’s bounty in 1816, and was valued in 1831 at £16 exclusive\r\nof the glebe house, but is now worth £200 per annum.  The City Charity\r\nTrustees are patrons.  The Rev. W. F. Patteson, incumbent.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn King Street are the churches of St. Peter per Mountergate, St. Julian,\r\nSt. Etheldred, and St. Peter Southgate, all ancient edifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Peter per Mountergate_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Peter per Mountergate derives the latter part of its name from a gate\r\nformerly placed near the churchyard, at the foot of the Castle mount.\r\nThe old church is in the perpendicular style, and has a nave, chancel,\r\nsouth porch with parvise, and a square embattled tower, with five bells\r\nand a clock.  The building has been recently restored and fitted up with\r\nopen benches, those in the nave being stained deal, and in the chancel\r\noak.  The famous Thomas Codd, who was Mayor of Norwich during Kett’s\r\nRebellion, and who was a great benefactor to the city, was interred in\r\nthe nave.  The benefice is now a perpetual curacy, valued at £78, and\r\naugmented with £200 of Queen Anne’s bounty in 1766, and with a\r\nparliamentary grant of £800 in 1812.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons.\r\nThe Rev. John Durst, incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Julian_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Julian’s Church, in King Street, is a very small ancient structure,\r\nfounded before the conquest, and comprises nave, chancel, north porch,\r\nand tower.  It is principally of the Norman period, and most of the\r\nwindows are decorated and perpendicular insertions.  The tower, which is\r\nruined, has a deeply recessed Norman arch, slightly pointed, and having\r\nshafts with caps and bases.  It has also a small Norman loop window in\r\nthe thickness of the wall splayed both inside and outside.  The south\r\ndoorway is a very fine specimen of Norman architecture, and was restored\r\nin 1845, when the chancel was rebuilt and the church thoroughly restored\r\nat a cost of £500.  The east window was at the same time filled with\r\nstained glass, representing our Saviour seated and surrounded by the\r\nevangelists.  The font is perpendicular in style, cup-shaped and\r\npanelled.  There was a hermitage for a female recluse in the churchyard,\r\nbut it was demolished at the dissolution.  The rectory, certified at £19\r\n3s. 1d., has been long consolidated with All Saints.  The Rev. C. F.\r\nSculthorpe, M.A., is patron.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Etheldred_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Etheldred’s Church, in King Street, is supposed to be one of the\r\noldest structures in the city, and had in its burial ground a very\r\nancient anchorage, which continued till after the Reformation.  It is a\r\nsmall building with a nave, chancel, and tower.  The benefice is a\r\nperpetual curacy, certified at £2 14s., and valued at £77.  It was\r\naugmented from 1745 to 1802 with £800 of Queen Anne’s bounty.  The\r\nTrustees of the Great Hospital are patrons.  The Rev. W. Bishop is the\r\npresent incumbent.\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Etheldred seems to have been one of the parishes of the\r\nAnglo Saxon period, and in it formerly were the houses of many families\r\nof distinction, including the residences of Sir Thomas de Helgheton, of\r\nHenry de Norwich, of the Abbot of Wymondham, of Sir James Hobart, and of\r\nSir Robert de Sulle, who was killed by the rebels in the reign of Edward\r\nIII.  No remains of these houses now exist.  All along the east side of\r\nKing Street, next the river, there is a line of vaults, which seem to\r\nhave formed the foundations of old churches now demolished.  The Old\r\nMusic House still stands in King Street, in the parish of St. Etheldred,\r\nand on its site formerly stood the house of one of the rich Jews, who\r\nsettled here in the reign of William Rufus.  It afterwards became the\r\nproperty of his grandson Isaac, at whose death it was escheated to the\r\ncrown.  Henry III. gave it to Sir William de Valeres, Knt., and in 1290\r\nit was the residence of Alan de Frestons, Archdeacon of Norfolk, who had\r\na public chapel there.  In 1626, it belonged to John Paston, Esq., and in\r\n1633 it was the city house of Chief Justice Coke.  The present house is\r\nnot older than the 17th century.  Under it there are very extensive\r\nvaults of a more ancient date, now occupied by Messrs. Youngs, Crawshay,\r\nand Youngs, as ale stores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Peter Southgate_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Peter Southgate, near the south end of King Street, is an ancient\r\nchurch, with a nave, chancel, north chapel, south porch, and a square\r\nflint tower, in which are three bells.  The windows are chiefly square\r\nheaded, and the architecture is of the late perpendicular period.  There\r\nis a good cross on the east gable.  Part of an old screen remains in\r\nfront of the north chapel.  The Rev. W. Bishop is the incumbent.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nCarrow Works, at the top of King Street, are the most extensive in\r\nEngland for the production of flour, starch, mustard, and blue.  The\r\nworks cover an area of five acres.  They are conveniently situated on the\r\nbanks of the Yare, and are permeated by trams from the Great Eastern\r\nRailway.  Here are large flour mills, starch mills, and mustard mills, in\r\nwhich 1200 hands are employed.  Steam engines to the enormous amount of\r\n400 horse power are used to drive the machinery.  About 100 tons of goods\r\nare produced here weekly, and sent away by rail to all parts of England,\r\nEurope, and America.  A large number of hands are engaged in making the\r\ntins and wooden boxes in which most of the mustard is packed.  We visited\r\nCarrow Works chiefly to see the mustard, starch, and blue factories; but\r\nwe were tempted to take a peep at the great flour mill which has been\r\nerected by Messrs. J. and J. Colman, and which for magnitude and\r\ncompleteness has few equals.  The machinery in this mill is driven by a\r\nmagnificent pair of engines of 80 horse power.  The Mayor for the present\r\nyear, 1868, J. J. Colman, Esq., is the principal proprietor of these\r\ngreat works, and he has built many houses all around for his work-people,\r\nand also schools for their children at a cost of £2000.\r\n\r\nA Nunnery formerly stood outside of King Street Gates, and was called\r\nCarrow Abbey, from “carr” a watering place, and “hoe” a hill.  This abbey\r\nwas dedicated to St. Michael and St. John.  It was founded in the year\r\n1146 by two ladies named Leftelina and Seyna.  It was richly endowed by\r\nKing Stephen, and consisted of a prioress and nine benedictine black\r\nnuns, afterwards increased to twelve.  The site within the walls\r\ncontained about ten acres of land, and the revenues and possessions were\r\nextensive.  At the dissolution the abbey and lands became private\r\nproperty.  J. H. Tillett, Esq., is the present occupier.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis district includes all the parishes from the north-west to the\r\nnorth-east side of the river Wensum; and comprises the parishes of St.\r\nMichael at Coslany, St. Martin at Oak, St. Augustine, St. Mary, St.\r\nGeorge’s Colegate, St. Clement, St. Saviour, St. Paul, St. James, and St.\r\nEdmund.  On the north side we enter the oldest part of the city, which\r\nseems to have been always chosen by the poorest portion of the\r\npopulation, near the great factories, which stand high above all the\r\nsurrounding poverty-stricken dwellings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Michael at Coslany_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Michael at Coslany, commonly called St. Miles’, is a spacious church,\r\nwith a lofty square tower and eight musical bells.  The nave was rebuilt\r\nby John and Stephen Stallon, who were sheriffs in 1511 and 1512.  The\r\nsouth aisle was begun by Gregory Clark, and was finished by his son, who\r\nwas Mayor in 1514.  The interior is handsomely decorated.  At the east\r\nend of the south aisle there is a chapel, founded by Robert Thorp in the\r\nreign of Henry VII., encrusted externally with black flints, like inlaid\r\nwork.  The altar piece, by Heins, represents the Resurrection and the\r\nFour Evangelists, and the floor is paved with black and white marble,\r\nbrought from the domestic chapel at Oxnead.  There are a few ancient\r\nbrasses and modern mural monuments.  The rectory, valued in K.B. at £13\r\n6s. 8d. and now at £117, was augmented in 1738 with £200 bequeathed by\r\nthe Rev. E. Brooke; in 1818, with £200 given by the late rector; and from\r\n1738 to 1818 with £1000 of royal bounty.  Gonville and Caius College,\r\nCambridge, had the patronage of the living, which was usually given to\r\nthe oldest bachelor of that college.  It has recently been purchased by\r\nthe Rev. E. Hollond, Benhall Lodge, Suffolk.  The Rev. R. H. Kidd is the\r\nincumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Martin at Oak_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Martin at Oak, in Coslany Street, and the whole\r\nneighbourhood, is a very old part of the city, full of very poor people.\r\nThe church derived its name from a large oak which formerly stood in the\r\nchurchyard.  This was much visited during the reign of superstition, and\r\nmany legacies were given towards painting, repairing, and dressing the\r\nimage of St. Mary in the Oak.  Another oak was planted on the same spot\r\nin 1656, but that now growing was planted eight years ago.  The church is\r\nbuilt of flint and stone in the perpendicular style, and contains some\r\ngood piers.  In 1852, the chancel was rebuilt and a new organ was placed\r\nin the church; and in 1862, plain open benches were substituted for the\r\nold pews in the chancel.  There are a few monuments and brasses in the\r\nchurch, and in one of the former are effigies of Jeremiah Ravens and his\r\nwife in alabaster.  She died in 1711, and he in 1727.  The south porch is\r\nnow used as a vestry, and the outer doorway is built up.  The benefice is\r\na perpetual curacy, certified at 20s., and now valued at £102.  It was\r\naugmented with £200 given by William Nockells in 1722, and £1000 of royal\r\nbounty obtained from 1723 to 1824.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons.\r\nRev. C. Caldwell, B.A., the esteemed incumbent, is much respected for his\r\nkindness to the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Augustine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom St. Martin at Oak we pass onward into St. Augustine’s, where we find\r\nvarious factories and a very populous neighbourhood.  The church, on the\r\neast side of the Gildencroft, is in the perpendicular style, and consists\r\nof a nave with aisles, chancel with aisles, south porch and tower.  The\r\ntower contains a clock and three bells.  The roof of the north aisle of\r\nthe chancel is finely carved, and the clerestory is built of flint.  In\r\nthe south aisle of the nave is a marble monument in memory of Thomas\r\nClabburn, manufacturer, who died in 1858.  It was erected by the\r\nsubscriptions of more than 600 weavers of Norwich as a tribute to his\r\nmany virtues.  The rectory, valued in K.B. at £6 7s. 8½d. and now at\r\n£150, was augmented in 1781 with £200 of Queen Anne’s bounty, and in\r\n1810, 1811, and 1821, with £1400 in parliamentary grants.  The Dean and\r\nChapter are the patrons.  The Rev. Matthew John Rackham is the incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Mary Coslany_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom St. Augustine’s we pass down Pitt Street to the parish of St. Mary,\r\ninhabited chiefly by poor people.  The church is a cruciform structure\r\nwith a tall round tower of flint, containing six bells.  There are no\r\naisles.  The south porch has a good groined vault and a richly moulded\r\ndoorway, with a parvise or chamber above.  The chancel has a panelled\r\nceiling with rich perforated work.  The pulpit is ancient and has tracery\r\nin the upper part of the panels, with the linen pattern below, and a\r\nperforated iron projection for the book rest.  The font is octagonal, and\r\nhas painted shields of arms in its upper panels.  The rood-stair turret\r\nis at the intersection of the north transept and chancel.  At the west\r\nend of the nave there is an old parish chest, and in the south transept\r\nthere is a square-headed foliated piscina.  Several ancient stalls are\r\nremaining, and in the north wall of the chancel there is a tombstone of\r\nthe Elizabethan era, dated 1578, and having incised figures of Martin\r\nVankermbeck, M.D., and his wife.  The perpetual curacy was augmented,\r\nfrom 1733 to 1824, with £2200 of royal bounty, and is valued at £124.\r\nThe Marquis of Townshend is patron.  Rev. C. Morse, LL.B., is incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. George Colegate_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pass on eastward to the parish of St. George’s Colegate, wherein are\r\nsome of the best built streets on this side of the city.  The church is a\r\nlarge structure rebuilt at different periods, viz., the tower and nave\r\nabout 1459; the chancel in 1498; the north aisle with the chapel of St.\r\nMary in 1504; and the south aisle with the chapel of St. Peter in 1513.\r\nThe tower is lofty and has a clock and three bells.  The rood-stair\r\nturret still remains on the south side.  The east window is of three\r\nlights, and is filled with painted glass by Mr. Swan, with figures\r\nrepresenting Faith, Hope, and Charity.  The living is a perpetual curacy,\r\nvalued at £98, and augmented from 1737 to 1792 with £1000 of Queen Anne’s\r\nbounty.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons.  The Rev. A. W. Durdin,\r\nincumbent.  The memorial to John Crome, familiarly known to Norwich\r\ncitizens, and to artists and connoisseurs in paintings as “Old Crome,”\r\none of the most esteemed of our Norwich “worthies,” has just been placed\r\nin the church of St. George Colegate, in which parish he passed the\r\nlatter years of his life, and in which he died soon after being chosen\r\nchurchwarden, in the year 1821.  The idea of erecting a monument to the\r\nmemory of Crome originated in 1841, amongst some of his fellow-citizens\r\nwho were lovers of the fine arts, but the subscriptions received up to\r\n1844 appear only to have amounted to about twenty-six pounds.  At the\r\ndeath of Mr. Lound, who had been receiving the subscriptions, in 1861,\r\nMr. J. B. Morgan, determining to carry out the object of the subscribers,\r\nrecommended the work of canvassing for subscriptions, which ultimately\r\nreached the sum of about £100.  Funds having been raised, a committee of\r\namateur artists was formed, who consulted Mr. Bell, an eminent sculptor,\r\nof London, and a native of this city, by whom a handsome mural tablet has\r\nbeen placed at the east end of the south aisle of St. George’s Church to\r\nthe memory of Crome.  This tablet, which is of white marble, is divided\r\ninto three panels, the centre panel containing a bas-relief profile bust\r\nof John Crome.  Judging from the portrait of Crome recently hung in the\r\nCouncil Chamber, this is an admirable likeness of the Norwich landscape\r\npainter.  Beneath are the name “John Crome” in gold letters, and a\r\npalette and pencils; and above an elegantly carved laurel wreath.  On one\r\npanel is the following: “Near this spot lie the remains of one of\r\nEngland’s greatest landscape painters, born in this city, December 21st,\r\n1769, and died in this parish April 22nd, 1821;” and on the right-hand\r\npanel, “This memorial is erected forty-seven years after his death by\r\nadmirers of his art, principally connected with Norfolk, his native\r\ncounty.”\r\n\r\nSt. Clement’s parish includes St. Clement Within and St. Clement Without.\r\nThe population increased from 853 inhabitants in 1801 to nearly 4000 in\r\n1861.  This large increase occurred chiefly in the northern suburb of the\r\ncity, called New Catton, which, in 1842, was constituted an\r\necclesiastical district, and assigned to Christ Church, a new edifice\r\nbuilt there.  Some centuries ago, several old churches, called St. Anne’s\r\nChapel, All Saints, St. Botolph, and St. Margaret, existed in this\r\nparish, but no vestiges now remain.\r\n\r\nSt. Clement’s Church, in Colegate Street, is one of the oldest in the\r\ncity, and belonged to the manor of Tokethorpe.  It has a square tower\r\nwith three bells, a nave without aisles, and a chancel, all in the\r\nperpendicular styles.  The chancel contains four dedication crosses, and\r\nis separated from the nave by a fine arch.  The tower arch is blocked by\r\nthe organ and gallery.  The communion plate weighs 88 ozs., including a\r\nsilver gilt cup given by S. Sofyld in 1569.  Three parish houses are let\r\nfor £26 10s. yearly, which is applied with the church rates, except a\r\nreserved yearly rent of 3s. 4d. payable to the Great Hospital, pursuant\r\nto a lease granted in 1569 for 500 years.  The rectory valued in K.B. at\r\n£7 9s. 2d., and now at £96, was augmented in 1738 with £200 of Queen\r\nAnne’s bounty, and £200 bequeathed by the Rev. Edward Brooke.  It is in\r\nthe patronage of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and incumbency of\r\nthe Rev. R. Rigg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Christ Church_.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrist Church in New Catton was consecrated by Bishop Stanley amid a\r\ndisturbance caused by the chartists.  It is a chapel of ease in the\r\nimproving parish of St. Clement.  It is a neat structure of flint and\r\nbrick in the early English style, comprising nave, chancel, transepts,\r\nand a bell turret at the west end.  It was finished in 1841 at a cost of\r\nabout £2500, and has sittings for 600 people.  It was built by\r\nsubscription, and by the same means £800 have been invested for its\r\nendowment, and £200 for its reparation.  The rector of St. Clement’s is\r\npatron of the perpetual curacy, valued at £150, and it is now in the\r\nincumbency of the Rev. Robert Wade, B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Saviour_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Saviour’s Church, in Magdalen Street, is a small structure, and has a\r\nsquare tower with two bells.  It has some modern monuments.  The south\r\nporch is now used as a baptistry.  The font has an octagonal panelled\r\nbasin, and is supported by four shafts resting on lions’ heads, and\r\ncarried through ogee canopies with pinnacles between.  The perpetual\r\ncuracy was certified at £3, and is now valued at £103.  It was augmented\r\nfrom 1729 to 1813 with £1800 of royal bounty.  The Dean and Chapter are\r\npatrons.  The Rev. W. Harris Cooke, M.A., incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Edmund_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Edmund’s Church, in Fishgate Street, was founded in the reign of\r\nWilliam I.  It comprises a nave, chancel, south aisle, and tower with one\r\nbell.  The arches of the nave are nearly flat, and the sub-arches are\r\ncarried on shafts with moulded caps.  The rectory, valued in K.B. at £4\r\n6s. 3d., and now at £165, was augmented in 1726 with £200 given by Rev.\r\nW. Stanley and Rev. R. Corey, and from 1726 to 1819 with £1000 of royal\r\nbounty.  The Rev. T. Taylor is the incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James’ Church, in Cowgate, includes Pockthorpe in its parish, and was\r\na well endowed rectory till 1201, when it was appropriated to the\r\nCathedral Priory.  It is now a peculiar of the Dean and Chapter.  The\r\nRev. A. D. Pringle, incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Paul_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Paul’s Church, in the square called St. Paul’s Plain, is an old\r\ndilapidated building with a small round tower, the upper part of which\r\nwas octagonal, but was rebuilt about 1819 of white brick with stone\r\ncoping.  It has some decorated windows, but is chiefly in the\r\nperpendicular style.  There is a north aisle, and at the east end a\r\nparclose, the two screens of different patterns, but both in the same\r\nperpendicular style.  The perpetual curacy was certified at only £2, but\r\nwas augmented from 1745 to 1749 with £200 of Queen Anne’s bounty, and is\r\nnow worth £150.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons, and the Rev. Bell\r\nCooke is incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n_St. Stephen_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Stephen’s, on the south side of the city, is extensive\r\nand populous.  The streets present some good shops and places of\r\nbusiness.  The principal streets are Rampant Horse Street, St. Stephen’s\r\nStreet, and Surrey Street.  The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital is at the\r\ntop of St. Stephen’s Street, and the far-famed Norwich Union Fire and\r\nLife Office is in Surrey Street.\r\n\r\nThe church, at the west end of Rampant Horse Street, is a handsome\r\nedifice of the late perpendicular style, of the 16th century, with a nave\r\nand clerestory, two aisles, a chancel, two small chapels, and a square\r\ntower.  The nave is divided from the aisles by fluted columns with\r\npointed arches.  The windows are large and numerous, and that at the east\r\nend is filled with stained glass representing the life of the Virgin\r\nMary, and dated 1610.  This church was founded before the Norman\r\nConquest, but has been all rebuilt at different periods, the chancel\r\nabout 1520, and the nave in 1550.  The roof is a fine specimen of open\r\ntimber-work, and is richly carved.  The tower stands on the north side of\r\nthe church, and beneath it is the porch.  In 1859, the interior was\r\nthoroughly restored at a cost of £1500, and a new carved pulpit and a\r\nreading desk were put up at the same time.  Under the superintendence of\r\nMr. Phipson, the county architect, ten new windows have been lately\r\ninserted in this church, five on each side.  They are in the\r\nperpendicular style corresponding to the style of the building.  They are\r\nglazed with cathedral glass and a ruby border.  There is also a new\r\nwindow over the south door of the chancel.  It is glazed with painted\r\nglass of a geometrical pattern, put in by the London firm that produced\r\nthe work in the large western window, representing the death of St.\r\nStephen.  That window cost £300.  The benefice is a discharged vicarage,\r\nvalued in K.B. at £9, and now at £212.  It was augmented from 1715 to\r\n1812 with £1000 of royal bounty.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons.  The\r\nRev. C. Baldwin, vicar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. John Sepulchre_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. John Sepulchre is a large church at the top of Ber Street, dedicated\r\nto St. John the Baptist and the Holy Sepulchre, and founded in the reign\r\nof Edward the Confessor.  It consists of a nave, chancel, a sort of\r\ntransept chapel on each side, and a lofty tower with five bells and a\r\nclock.  The font is octagonal and is ornamented with angels, lions, &c.\r\nThe east window is of three lights filled with stained glass, the centre\r\nlight presenting a figure of St. John the Baptist.  The window is in\r\nmemory of the Rev. Samuel Stone, M.A., incumbent of this parish, who was\r\na great friend of the poor, and died in 1848.  Here is a fine mural\r\nmonument of the Watts family.  The rood-stair turret still remains, and\r\nin the south side of the chancel is a fine consecration cross.  The\r\nliving is a perpetual curacy, certified at £9 1s., and now valued at\r\n£144.  It was augmented from 1737 to 1812 with £1600 of royal bounty.\r\nThe Dean and Chapter are patrons.  The Rev. W. T. Moore, incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Michael at Thorn_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis part of the city includes the parish of St. Michael at Thorn, so\r\ncalled from the “thorns” formerly growing in the neighbourhood, of which\r\nthere is one now in the churchyard.  The Rev. A. Davies is incumbent of\r\nthe parish.  The church is remarkable for its antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_All Saints_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of Ber Street we may turn to the left into the parish of\r\nAll Saints, where the church stands in an open space called All Saints’\r\nGreen.  The church is a small structure, having a nave, chancel, porch,\r\nand tower containing three bells.  The chancel contains some decorated\r\nwindows, but the other portions of the church are perpendicular.  The\r\neast window is modern and filled with poor stained glass, but there are\r\nsome fragments of ancient stained glass, containing heads of bishops,\r\n&c., in the windows of the aisles.  The font is octagonal and in the\r\nperpendicular style.  There are three monuments with merchant’s marks\r\nupon them.  The rectory, valued in K.B. at £3 14s. 7d., is consolidated\r\nwith St. Julian, valued in K.B. at £5.  The joint benefices are now worth\r\n£300 per annum.  They were augmented with £300 of Queen Anne’s bounty in\r\n1769 and 1810, and with £200 given by John Drinkwater, Esq., and £500\r\ngiven by S. Thornton, Esq., in 1800.  The Rev. C. F. Sculthorpe, M.A., is\r\npatron, and the Rev. G. S. Outram is incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. John Timberhill_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. John’s Timberhill, at the north end of Ber Street, was founded soon\r\nafter the priory of Norwich, to which it was appropriated, and it was\r\ndedicated to St. John the Baptist.  It has a nave, chancel, south porch\r\nwith parvise, and two aisles with chapels at their east ends.  That on\r\nthe north, a part of which is now used for the vestry, was called our\r\nLady’s Chapel.  There is a hagroscope or squint on the south side of the\r\nchancel, and near it is a small decorated piscina.  The font is circular\r\nand Norman.  The whole building needs restoration.  The square tower fell\r\ndown on August 20th, 1784, and damaged the west end of the church.  Its\r\nfoundations still remain, but the bells were sold to pay for the repairs.\r\nThe perpetual curacy was augmented from 1738 to 1813 with £1000 of royal\r\nbounty, and valued in 1835 at £31.  The Dean and Chapter are patrons.\r\nThe Rev. S. Titlow, M.A., has been the incumbent since 1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapel Field_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is yet left unnoticed a small district lying south of St. Giles’,\r\nand which is generally known as Chapel Field.  Near this field once stood\r\na college called St. Mary in the Fields, founded about the beginning of\r\nthe 13th century by John Le Brun.  Soon after its establishment its\r\nbenefactors were so numerous that in a short time it became a very noble\r\ncollege, having a dean, chancellor, precentor, treasurer, seven\r\nprebendaries, and six chaplains.  Miles Spencer, the last dean, persuaded\r\nthe college to resign its revenues for small pensions, after he had\r\nobtained a grant of the whole for himself from Henry VIII. at the\r\ndissolution.  The property afterwards passed through several hands, and\r\nthe field is now the property of the corporation.  It has recently been\r\nenclosed by a massive palisade, and much improved as a place of\r\nrecreation; and a large Drill Hall has been built at the north-west\r\ncorner for the use of the Volunteers.  The Drill Hall was opened by the\r\nPrince of Wales in 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAMLETS.\r\n\r\n_Heigham_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hamlets have, of late years, been greatly increased in extent and\r\npopulation, and are likely to leave the old city in the shade.  Heigham,\r\non the west side of the city, has become a town, with two churches, and\r\nanother about to be built, three chapels, and several large schools.\r\nSince 1801, the population has increased from 544 to 15,000 souls.  Many\r\nnew streets have been laid out between the Dereham and Earlham Roads;\r\nlong rows of new houses have been built, and are nearly all occupied.\r\nThe National School-house, on Dereham road, was built in 1840 at a cost\r\nof £1000, and is attended by about 270 children.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe CITY JAIL, an ugly building, stands in this hamlet at the corner of\r\nSt. Giles’ Road.  It was built in 1827 from a design by Mr. Philip\r\nBarnes, of Norwich, at a cost of £30,000.  The front elevation is massive\r\nand is supported by Tuscan columns.  The whole building encloses an area\r\nof 1 acre 2 roods 34 poles, and contains 114 cells.  The house of the\r\ngovernor stands in the centre and commands a view of the entire prison,\r\nwhich is well ventilated and supplied with water pumped by the\r\ntread-wheel.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe NEW WATER WORKS are in this hamlet, and supply the city with water\r\nfrom the river Wensum.  After filtration the water is forced up by steam\r\npower to the distributing reservoir at Lakenham, at a height of 134 feet\r\nabove the level of the river at Carrow Bridge, whence it flows by\r\ngravitation to all parts of the city and the suburbs.  The present\r\ncompany has a capital of £60,000 in £10 shares, and was incorporated\r\nunder an act of parliament passed in 1850, the powers of which have been\r\nenlarged by subsequent acts, so that wholesome and pure water is now\r\nconstantly supplied at very low terms.  Excellent provision has also been\r\nmade for a plentiful supply for extinguishing fires, by fixing hydrants\r\nat every 100 yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Hall’s Palace_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: Bishop Hall’s Palace]\r\n\r\nThe OLD PALACE, where the celebrated Bishop Hall resided, (now known as\r\nthe Dolphin Inn,) is in this hamlet.  Here he retired after his expulsion\r\nfrom the bishop’s palace by the republican party in 1644.  The house,\r\nwhich is fast going to decay, displays the peculiarities of the domestic\r\narchitecture of the time of James I.  The front presents two projecting\r\nbays, one on each side of the door, which afford a light to the lower and\r\nupper rooms.  The doorway deserves a passing notice, and some curiously\r\ncarved heads will be found in the interior, as well as the remains of an\r\nancient piscina in the wall at the entrance.  There is a large parlour on\r\nthe right hand, wainscotted all round from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe NEW WORKHOUSE was erected in 1859 at an expense of £33,000 exclusive\r\nof £680 paid for about nine acres of land.  It is an extensive range of\r\nbrick buildings in the Tudor style of architecture, having room for about\r\n1000 inmates, but it has never had so many as yet, though the number is\r\nincreasing every year.  The debt on the building was £22,000, and will be\r\ngradually paid off by instalments.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe NEW CEMETERY.  The greatest improvement effected in Norwich during\r\nthe present century was the closing of all the churchyards for burials,\r\nand the opening of a new cemetery for the dead.  It was opened in 1856\r\nand is pleasantly situated on high ground next the Earlham Road; the\r\nwhole area being divided into two parts, one side being consecrated and\r\nthe other unconsecrated.  The whole comprises 35 acres of land prettily\r\nlaid out and planted.  It was formed at a cost of £7000 by the Burial\r\nBoard.  There are entrances from the Earlham and Dereham Roads.  The two\r\nprincipal chapels are of early English architecture with porches and\r\napsidal terminations.  There is also a small chapel for the use of the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe long contemplated division of this extensive hamlet into three\r\nparishes, has at length been carried into effect.  The old church of St.\r\nBartholomew is to be the parish church of the new parish of that name on\r\nthe north side next the river.  The estimated population is 5,600.  The\r\nRev. J. G. Dixon is rector.  The central part of the hamlet, lying\r\nbetween the Dereham and Earlham Roads, with a population of 4,400, is to\r\nform the new parish of St. Philip; but a church has not been yet built.\r\nThe third parish, the incumbency of which is retained by the Rev. C. T.\r\nRust, includes all that part of Heigham which lies between Earlham Road\r\nand the boundary of St. Stephen’s.  The population is about 6,400.  The\r\nchurch, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in Essex Street, is the parish\r\nchurch.  The church of St. Bartholomew stands on an eminence above the\r\nWensum, and is a small structure in the perpendicular style, with a nave,\r\nsouth aisle, north porch, chancel, and a square tower, in which are three\r\nbells.  It has a mural monument to the pious Bishop Hall, who was buried\r\nhere in 1656.  The living is a rectory valued in K.B. at £6 13s. 4d., and\r\nnow at a little over £200.  Trinity Church, near Unthank’s Road, was\r\nbuilt by subscription, and consecrated in August 1861, to supply the\r\ngreat want of church accommodation which had long been felt in this part\r\nof the hamlet.  It is a large building in the decorated style, and\r\nconsists of nave, transepts, and apsidal chancel, with a tower containing\r\none bell, and surmounted by a slated spire 120 feet high.  The total cost\r\nwas £7000.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, an ancient lead coffin, containing the remains of a female\r\nskeleton, was discovered about four feet below the surface on a chalk pit\r\nat Stone Hills, Heigham.  It was perfectly plain, and appeared to have\r\nbeen formerly enclosed in an outer case of wood, and was probably of the\r\nRoman period.  Near it were found two bronze torque rings of a twisted\r\npattern, encrusted with a fine green patina, and evidently of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hellesdon_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHellesdon, adjoining Heigham, is a small and pretty village on an\r\neminence two miles north-west of the city, but the parish is partly in\r\nTaverham hundred.  It adjoins the river, which is here crossed by a\r\ncast-iron bridge, built by the corporation of Norwich in 1819.  The\r\ncommon was enclosed in 1811.  The Bishop is lord of the manor and owner\r\nof a great part of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earlham_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlham is a very pleasant village, situated at the end of the Earlham\r\nRoad.  The ivy-mantled church is a very ancient building of small size.\r\nThe hall, situated in a park, is associated with the honoured name of\r\nGurney, and will long be an object of deep interest.  Amongst other\r\nmembers of that distinguished family who resided here was the deservedly\r\nesteemed Joseph John Gurney, who often entertained many of the\r\ncelebrities of his day.  It was here that Wilberforce, Chalmers, and a\r\nhost of worthies, well known to fame, visited one of the happiest of the\r\nhomes of England, where the sterling character of Thomas Fowell Buxton\r\nwas formed and matured, and where he met with the partner of his future\r\nlife.  It was the birthplace of Elizabeth Fry the philanthropist, of whom\r\nthere is yet no monument in this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eaton_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Eaton, two miles south-west of Norwich, is in the vale of\r\nthe Taas.  The manor is about 1300 acres, and belongs to the Dean and\r\nChapter, but the soil is let to a number of lessees, many of whom have\r\nhandsome houses in the Newmarket Road, one of the finest approaches to\r\nthe city.  Indeed, this road may be called the “west end” of Norwich.\r\nEaton church is dedicated to St. Andrew, and is a long ancient building\r\ncovered with thatch, and having an embattled tower with three bells.  It\r\nwas originally a Norman structure, but it appears to have been rebuilt in\r\nthe early English period, and to have been considerably altered in the\r\n15th century.  About two years ago the church was thoroughly restored at\r\na cost of about £400, when a number of beautiful mural paintings were\r\ndiscovered, some of them well preserved.  The living is a vicarage not in\r\ncharge, valued at £87, and augmented in 1732 with £200 given by the Earl\r\nof Thanet, and £200 of Queen Anne’s bounty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lakenham_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLakenham is the next hamlet on the south side of the city, and the roads\r\nto it are favourite walks of the citizens.  Caister is an adjoining\r\nvillage, where may be seen extensive remains of a Roman camp, built\r\nbefore Norwich existed.  The configuration of the camp may still be\r\ntraced as a parallelogram, enclosing an area of 32 acres, sufficient for\r\na force of 6000 men.  On the western side, which was washed by the Taas,\r\nformerly stood the water gate, with a round tower, where vessels used to\r\nunload.  A very large number of Roman coins have been dug up here.\r\nReturning to the hamlet of Lakenham, we ascend a hill called Long John’s\r\nHill.  Lakenham church stands on high ground above the river Taas, and is\r\na small structure dedicated to St. John the Baptist and All Saints.  It\r\nhas a tower with three bells.  The benefice is a vicarage united to\r\nTrowse Newton, and with it valued at £261, in the patronage of the Dean\r\nand Chapter, and incumbency of the Rev. Alfred Pownall, M.A.\r\n\r\nSt. Mark’s Church, in Lakenham, was consecrated September 24th, 1844, and\r\nis a neat structure in the perpendicular style, comprising a nave without\r\naisles, and an embattled tower with turrets, pinnacles, and three bells.\r\nIt was built by subscription at a cost of £4000, and contains 900\r\nsittings, most of which are free.  The interior has commodious galleries,\r\nand is neatly fitted up.  Ladies presented the communion table, plate,\r\nbooks for divine service, font, &c.  The population in this hamlet has\r\nincreased from 428 in 1801 to 4866 in 1861.  The perpetual curacy, valued\r\nat £150, is in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter.  The Rev. N. T.\r\nGarry, M.A., is incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trowse-Millgate_, _Carrow_, _and Bracondale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrowse-Millgate, Carrow, and Bracondale, extend southward from King\r\nStreet to the river Yare, opposite Trowse Newton.  They form one hamlet,\r\nthough each division had formerly a parochial chapel.  Miss Martineau\r\nowns the greater part of the soil, and lives at Bracondale Lodge, a\r\nhandsome mansion with delightful pleasure grounds.  The late P. M.\r\nMartineau collected here many remnants of Gothic architecture in 1804,\r\nand used them in the erection of a lofty arch and an edifice,\r\nrepresenting a small priory with windows filled by stained glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thorpe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Thorpe, one of the most delightful suburbs of the city,\r\nlies on the south-east side, opposite Foundry Bridge, and extends to\r\nMousehold Heath.  It contains many handsome villas, which are mostly\r\nsurrounded by gardens.  Many of the city gentry reside in this pleasant\r\nhamlet, which now contains about 3000 inhabitants.  The church, dedicated\r\nto St. Matthew, was built in 1852 at a cost of £2300, for an\r\necclesiastical district, comprising that part of Thorpe parish within the\r\ncity liberties, containing about 2500 inhabitants.  It is a neat\r\nstructure in the Norman style of architecture, from a design by Mr. Kerr,\r\nformerly architect of this city.  It consists of a nave, transepts, and\r\napsidal chancel, and is a unique structure.  The five windows of the\r\nchancel are filled with stained glass.  The rector of Thorpe is patron of\r\nthe perpetual curacy, valued at £130, which is now held by the Rev.\r\nGeorge Harris Cooke, M.A., who has a handsome parsonage house, erected in\r\n1863 at a cost of £1400, in the Tudor style.\r\n\r\nThe road from the Foundry Bridge to Thorpe village is a favourite walk of\r\nthe citizens.  Thorpe lodge (the entrance to which is guarded by couchant\r\nlions, and is a conspicuous object on the left,) was the residence of the\r\nlate John Harvey, Esq., “a fine old English gentleman,” who was a great\r\npromoter of manufactures, and of aquatic sports.  Its present proprietor\r\nand occupant is Donald Dalrymple, Esq.  The old hall, the name by which\r\nthe manor house is now known, stands at the entrance to the village.  It\r\nwas formerly the country seat of the bishops.  Adjoining are the remains\r\nof a chapel, now used as a coach house and stable.  On the south side of\r\nthe river, which was once reached by the ferry boat, stands the village\r\nof Whitlingham, where the citizens formerly resorted by thousands in the\r\nsummer months.  The grounds in this locality present a pleasing variety\r\nof hill and dale, wood and water, and the view from the White House\r\nincludes the windings of the “bonny Yare,” the opposite village of\r\nThorpe, the spire of the Cathedral rising above the distant hills, and\r\nthe frowning aspect of the old Norman Castle.  The whole of the land here\r\nnow belongs to R. J. H. Harvey, Esq., M.P., who has greatly improved an\r\nestate of 2000 acres next the river.  He has often thrown the grounds\r\nopen to the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Rosary Burial Ground, in Thorpe hamlet, was established in 1819 by\r\nthe late Rev. Thomas Drummond, for the use of Dissenters.  Being aware\r\nthat many of the burial grounds attached to their chapels are held on\r\nleases under the corporation, he urged the necessity of a general\r\ncemetery on freehold land, so securely vested in trust that it could not\r\nbe converted to other uses at any future time.  The Rosary occupies eight\r\nacres of land in a good situation.  It is divided into sections separated\r\nby plantings of trees or shrubs, and contains a small chapel.  It is not\r\nconsecrated, and ministers of any denomination may officiate at funerals.\r\nIn this beautiful resting-place for the dead are deposited the remains of\r\nmany of the worthiest of the Norwich citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pockthorpe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPockthorpe was originally part of Thorpe, but when severed in the time of\r\nthe Conqueror, with the parishes of St. James and St. Paul, took the name\r\nof Paucus Thorpe or Little Thorpe, corrupted into Pockthorpe.  The place\r\nis apparently wedded to poverty, with no Divorce Court to grant it\r\nrelief.  It is chiefly inhabited by poor weavers or spinners, who still\r\nadhere to an old pastime, the rearing of pigeons, as appears from many\r\ncoops at the broken windows.  The brewery here is an old well-established\r\nconcern, and sends out about 100,000 barrels of beer yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNONCONFORMISTS’ CHAPELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OLD MEETING HOUSE, Colegate Street, was erected in 1693 by the\r\nIndependents, a congregation of which body had existed in Norwich since\r\nthe Commonwealth.  They had originally assembled in a brewery in St.\r\nEdmund’s, and afterwards in the “west granary” of St. Andrew’s Hall.  Mr.\r\nBridge, the first pastor, who was incumbent of St. George’s, Tombland,\r\nseceded from the church in the reign of James II., and sat in the\r\nWestminster Assembly of Divines.  The building is a large structure of\r\nred brick, fronted with four Corinthian pilasters.  It contains sittings\r\nfor 700 persons, and has spacious schoolrooms adjacent.  The Rev. John\r\nHallett is the present minister.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nPRINCE’S STREET CHAPEL (Independent) was erected in 1819.  It is a\r\nhandsome building of white brick, and has been enlarged and almost\r\nrebuilt at a cost of £2000, under the superintendence of Mr. Boardman,\r\narchitect, of this city.  It will now accommodate 1000 persons.  The new\r\nfront presents an elevation in the modern Italian or composite style,\r\nwith seven windows of ornamental design.  The roof has been raised and\r\nnew windows inserted, eight on each side.  New galleries have been\r\nerected with cast-iron columns, and ornamental iron front.  A new apse\r\nhas been added, and a vestry or retiring room at the back.  The whole\r\ninterior has been reseated with plain open benches.  The entrances,\r\nstaircase, hall, and avenues, are laid with tessellated tiles.  At a\r\nshort distance from the chapel there is a spacious schoolroom, with class\r\nrooms on each side.  The Rev. G. S. Barrett is the present minister.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPEL IN THE FIELD, (Independent) opened in 1858, is a handsome\r\nedifice with two imposing spiral turrets.  Its arched interior has a fine\r\neffect, increased by the introduction of four painted windows in the\r\napse.  The building affords sittings for 900 persons.  Adjoining are\r\nspacious schoolrooms in a similar style of architecture.  The Rev. Philip\r\nColborne is the present minister.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE TABERNACLE (Lady Huntingdon’s Connexion) is situate near St. Martin’s\r\nat Palace.  It was built by the Calvinistic Methodists, under Mr.\r\nWheatley, in 1772, at a cost of £1752.  In 1775, the Tabernacle was sold\r\nto the Countess of Huntingdon, who visited Norwich in the following year,\r\nand vested the building in trust with four clergymen and three laymen of\r\nthe same connexion to appoint ministers whose preaching and sentiments\r\nare according to the articles and homilies of the church of England.  It\r\ncontains 1000 sittings.  The Rev. Burford Hooke is the present minister.\r\nThere is also another chapel of the same connexion on the Dereham Road,\r\nof which the Rev. John Joseph James Kempster is the minister.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MARY’S CHAPEL (Baptist) was originally erected in 1714, but was\r\nrebuilt in its present style in 1811 and enlarged in 1838.  Rev. Joseph\r\nKinghorn was pastor from May 20th, 1791, till his death, on September\r\n1st, 1832.  Rev. William Brock was pastor from 1833 to 1848, when he\r\nresigned his charge and went to London, where he preaches at Bloomsbury\r\nchapel.  Since 1849, the Rev. G. Gould has been the pastor.  Spacious\r\nschoolrooms adjoining the chapel are now in course of erection.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. CLEMENT’S (Baptist) was erected in 1814 and contains 900 sittings,\r\nand there is a spacious schoolroom adjacent.  The celebrated Mark Wilks\r\nwas once the pastor.  The present minister is the Rev. T. Foston.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nEBENEZER CHAPEL (Baptist), on Surrey Road, was built in 1854, the\r\nminister being the Rev. R. Govett, who some years since seceded from the\r\nestablished church.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE GILDENCROFT (Baptist), in St. Augustine’s, formerly occupied by the\r\nSociety of Friends, was erected in 1680.  There is a spacious burial\r\nground attached, in which lie the remains of Joseph John Gurney, Mrs.\r\nOpie, and other eminent Friends.  The Rev. C. H. Hosken is the minister.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nORFORD HILL CHAPEL (Baptist) was opened as a chapel in 1832.  The Rev. J.\r\nBrunt is the present minister.\r\n\r\nThere are also Baptist Chapels in Cherry Lane, (Rev. W. Hawkins); this\r\nwas formerly a Wesleyan Chapel in which the Rev. John Wesley preached;\r\nPriory Yard, (Rev. R. B. Clare); Pottergate Street, (Rev. H. Trevor); and\r\nJireh Chapel, Dereham Road, (no regular pastor).\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE PRESBYTERIANS recently purchased St. Peter’s Hall, in Theatre Street,\r\nas a place of worship.  The hall contains about 700 sittings, which are\r\ngenerally all occupied.  The Rev. W. A. Mc Allan was ordained minister in\r\n1867, and he preaches with great success to large congregations.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nWESLEYANS.  The Revs. John and Charles Wesley paid their first visit to\r\nthis city in 1754, but their followers had no settled place of worship\r\nhere till 1769, when they built a small chapel in Cherry Lane, where the\r\nlate Dr. Adam Clarke was stationed in 1783, and began to display that\r\nvast genius which afterwards astonished the religious world.  The\r\nWesleyan Methodists have two chapels, one a very spacious edifice in Lady\r\nLane, and the other, just finished, in Ber Street.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe UNITED METHODIST FREE CHURCH has two chapels.  That in Calvert Street\r\nwas erected by the Wesleyan Methodists in 1810, and is a large brick\r\nedifice with about 1200 sittings, and two houses for the ministers.  The\r\nother is in Crook’s Place, Heigham, and was opened in 1839, and contains\r\n800 sittings.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMITIVE METHODISTS have chapels on St. Catherine’s Plain, Cowgate\r\nStreet, and Dereham Road.  The first named, called Lakenham Chapel, was\r\nbuilt in 1835, and contains 600 sittings.  The second, in Cowgate Street,\r\nwas built about 20 years since, and contains 300 sittings.  The third, on\r\nDereham Road, was built in 1864, on the site of a smaller one, at a cost\r\nof £1316, raised by subscription.

In the last century there was a\r\nchapel connected with the palace of the Duke of Norfolk on the site of\r\nthe present Museum, but it was lost when that property was sold by him.\r\nThe Roman Catholics raised a subscription and built their present chapel\r\nin St. John’s Maddermarket in 1794.  It is merely a plain building, but\r\nthe altar is very handsome.  It contains sittings for about 600 people.\r\nThe services here are carried out with great solemnity, and with a strict\r\nadherence to the ritual of the Church of Rome.  There is generally a\r\nlarge congregation at divine service.  The Rev. Canon Dalton is the\r\nofficiating priest.  He resides near the chapel in a very ancient\r\nbuilding that was occupied by the City Sheriff in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth.  The chapel in Willow Lane, called the Chapel of the Apostles,\r\nis a handsome building, erected in 1828.  The windows are of stained\r\nglass, and the interior decorations are very striking.  This chapel is\r\nserved by Fathers of the Society of Jesus, commonly called Jesuits.  It\r\nis the custom of that order to change the officiating clergy every few\r\nyears.  The Rev. Mr. Lane of the order was a contemporary of the Rev. Mr.\r\nBeaumont, the first priest of St. John’s chapel, during the greater part,\r\nif not all, of that gentleman’s lengthened ministry of 62 years, and died\r\nabout the same time.

Woodward,\r\nB. B. Woodward, the Rev. R. Hart of Catton, R. Fitch, Esq., and other\r\nantiquaries, who have explored every part of the old city.  They nearly\r\nall agree in their accounts of the rise and progress of Norwich, and of\r\nits condition at different periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. B. Woodward, Esq., F.S.A., delivered two lectures on “Norwich in the\r\nOlden Time,” to the members of the Church of England Young Men’s Society,\r\nat the Assembly Rooms, some years since.  He showed a thorough knowledge\r\nof all the previous authorities, with whom he sometimes differed.  He\r\nexhibited four large maps, presenting views of the Old City at different\r\nperiods, from A.D. 400 to A.D. 1400.  He stated that he had derived the\r\ngreater part of his materials for them from the series of maps of ancient\r\nNorwich made by his father, the late Mr. S. Woodward, but he had\r\ncorrected and completed them from the publications of various\r\nArchæological Societies since they had been constructed, and he hoped\r\nthat they would serve to illustrate the growth and progress of the\r\nancient city with general fidelity to facts.  Directing attention to the\r\nfirst map, which represented the condition of the _Venta Icenorum_, A.D.\r\n400, Mr. Woodward pointed out the purely fictitious character of the\r\nearliest accounts of Norwich to be found in the older historians, who\r\ndrew, in all good faith, on their fertile imaginations, and both\r\npersuaded themselves that they were writing history, and that they were\r\nbelieved to be doing so by others.\r\n\r\nThe old-established tradition, that the sea came up to Norwich, he\r\nstated, was undoubtedly to be accepted, but not as having occurred within\r\nthe historic period.  From various facts, and particularly from the\r\noccurrence of a Roman road at Wangford, near Bungay, near the edge of the\r\npresent stream, he concluded that in the times of the Romans, the valleys\r\nof the Eastern Counties did not present a very different aspect from\r\ntheir present one, though of course where there was now meadow, marsh\r\nexisted formerly, and many small streams have disappeared.  Mr. Woodward,\r\non this point, differed entirely from all the local historians and\r\nantiquarians, and his opinion is not supported by any evidence.  The\r\nexistence of a Roman road at Wangford, near Bungay, if such there be, has\r\nnothing to do with the river Yare.  Mr. Woodward offered no proof that it\r\nis a Roman road.  All the local historians state that a broad arm of the\r\nsea flowed up to Norwich till the 11th century, when Sweyn came up with a\r\ngreat fleet and landed an army here.  Parochial records prove that the\r\nriver came up to St. Lawrence Steps at a later period.  We may therefore\r\ndismiss this singular opinion as untenable.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodward regarded Norwich as the _Venta Icenorum_ of the Romans for\r\nseveral reasons, and particularly because it was plain from the\r\noccurrence of these Ventas in Britain, and none in any other part of the\r\nRoman world, that this was the name of a British town, which its being\r\ncalled the Venta of the Iceni strongly confirmed—even, in fact, a British\r\nstronghold, constructed according to the custom of that people in parts\r\nof the country without hills.  In hilly countries the strongholds were\r\nentrenchments round the summits of the hills, but then there were small\r\ntracts of land surrounded by marshes.  Such were the British strongholds\r\non Bungay Common, and that at Horning, and such he believed was the\r\n_Venta Icenorum_.  They were not intended for permanent occupation, but\r\nas places of safety for their wives and children, and for their cattle,\r\nin case of the attack of another tribe; and they could rarely be held\r\nagainst the enemy for any length of time.  In this instance, the trench\r\nwas drawn in a horse-shoe form, from the eastern slope of the ground on\r\nwhich the Castle now stands to the western side, the steep bank of the\r\nlittle stream, called the Cockey, being rendered more steep by art,\r\nwhilst the Wensum and marshes protected the other sides.  The position of\r\nthe Roman camp, as the map showed, was determined by its being the\r\nfittest for keeping in check the _Iceni_ of _Venta_, and preventing them\r\nfrom marching against the southern part of the island; and it might\r\nprobably have been placed there after the disastrous experiment of what\r\nthe _Iceni_ could do under such a leader as their famous Queen Boadicea.\r\nIn the latter part of the Roman period it would seem that the conquerors\r\nhad less occasion for mere military force here, for the remains of a\r\nRoman villa had been found in the northern side of the camp at Caister.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodward said the Map of Norfolk still showed traces of Roman roads\r\nradiating from Norwich.  The principal roads were—one entering the\r\nstronghold in the western side, now St. Stephen’s Street; another\r\nentering it on the east, now known as King Street.  This last crossed the\r\nriver by a ford at Fyebridge, and was the origin of Magdalen Street and\r\nSt. Augustine’s Street; another road left the fortress on the western\r\nside, near the river, and was called St. Benedict’s Street; and the last\r\ncrossed the river at Bishopbridge by another ford, and sent off branches\r\nto the north-east and east of Norfolk.  He believed that nearly all the\r\nmain lines of road originated with the Romans, but this is at least\r\ndoubtful.  Norwich must then have been a very large town to have required\r\nso many main lines of roads; but its very existence as a town is\r\nuncertain during the Roman period.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodward’s second map exhibited the entrenchments round the fortress\r\nas already described, at the time of the Conquest.  Map the third\r\nexhibited the condition of the city in the time of the Domesday Survey,\r\nor about A.D. 1100, when 54 churches and chapels existed.  Map the fourth\r\nshowed the state of the city A.D. 1400, when Norwich was described as at\r\nthe acme of its splendour and importance, and second only to Bristol,\r\nafter London.  This arose from its being the capital of East Anglia, and\r\nthe residence of so many of the clergy and gentry.  Mr. Woodward pointed\r\nout the sites of some of the old monasteries in this period.  The\r\nBishop’s palace was then within the precincts of the close.  Besides the\r\nmonastery there, and that of St. Leonard’s, there were then several\r\nothers in Norwich.  In King Street, to the south of St. Faith’s Lane,\r\nwere the Austin Friars, and to the north of Rose Lane the Grey Friars.\r\nBoth these monastic communities were said to have encroached on the\r\nadjacent streets, churchyards, &c., by extending their precincts; which\r\naccounted for the changes around them.  The Carmelites occupied the whole\r\nangle of the city between the river, the walls, and Bargate Street.  But\r\nfew traces of these establishments now remain.  The case of the Black\r\nFriars was very different.  Their magnificent church is still almost\r\nentire; much of the convent is still standing in St. Andrew’s Hall, and\r\nthe Dutch or Walloon Church, and the oldest parts of the former\r\nWorkhouse.  In addition to these, there had been several smaller monastic\r\norders which were merged in the others before the 15th century.  In this\r\nperiod, most of the streets on the north side of the town were in\r\nexistence, and some on the south side.\r\n\r\nFormerly, as already intimated, some of our streets were named from the\r\ntrades of those who occupied them.  Thus there were Saddlers’ Gate, now\r\nWhite Lion Street; Wastelgate, now Red Lion Street; Cordwainers’ Row, now\r\npart of the Walk; Goldsmiths’ Row, north side of the Market; Hosiers’\r\nRow, in part of London Street; Cutlers’ Row, in part of London Street;\r\nHatters’ Row, now St. Giles’ Street; Dyers’ Row, in St. Lawrence Street;\r\nand Pottergate Street, still so called.  The Cloth Hall stood in the\r\nHaymarket; and on the west side were the Butchery, the Fishmarket, and\r\nvarious other rows, where articles of food were sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD WALLS AND GATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nR. FITCH, ESQ., is the very best authority respecting the old walls and\r\ngates, of which he made a study for many years; and in 1861 he published\r\na very handsome illustrated volume entitled, “Views of the Gates of\r\nNorwich made in the years 1792–3, by the late John Ninham; with an\r\nHistorical Introduction, Extracts from the Corporation Records, and\r\nPapers by the late John Kirkpatrick, contributed to the Transactions of\r\nthe Norfolk and Norwich Archæological Society, by Robert Fitch, F.S.A.,\r\nF.G.S.”  The author says:—\r\n\r\n    “The history of the walls of Norwich is a history of the gate houses,\r\n    and in speaking of the origin of the first we include that of the\r\n    second.  In 1294, being the 23rd Edward I., the first mural tax was\r\n    granted, and continued three years.  A second tax succeeded this, and\r\n    in 1304 a third tax was imposed, to continue in operation for five\r\n    years.  In the 11th of Edward II., a fourth tax of the like nature\r\n    was allowed; and in two years after, namely in 1319, the walls of\r\n    Norwich were completed.”\r\n\r\n    “When the thickness and extent of the fortifications of this city are\r\n    considered, it cannot be thought surprising that a period of 25 years\r\n    elapsed before these mural defences were finished, so far as to\r\n    render no additional tax necessary.  It must not, however, be\r\n    considered that no other pecuniary assistance was required towards\r\n    the work.  The citizens themselves manifested the greatest interest\r\n    in the subject; and the ancient books of account contain not only\r\n    entries of money expended on the walls and gates, but also register\r\n    the private contributions of persons towards the same object and for\r\n    necessary reparation.”\r\n\r\n    “It has been previously observed, that in 1319 the walls of the city\r\n    were said to have been completed; but something more was required to\r\n    render them adequate to the purpose for which they were designed.\r\n    Neither towers nor gates could be of use unless properly furnished\r\n    with munitions of war and the implements then in use for their\r\n    projection.  This does not appear to have taken place until 23 years\r\n    after completion, namely in 1342, in 16th Edward III., when a\r\n    patriotic citizen, Richard Spynk, for the honour of the monarch and\r\n    the safety of his fellow citizens, gave thirty espringolds to cast\r\n    stones with, to be kept at divers gates and towers; 100 gogions, or\r\n    balls of stone, locked up in a box; a box with ropes and\r\n    accoutrements; four great arblasters, or crossbows, and 100 gogions\r\n    for each arblaster; two pairs of grapples, to bring the bows to the\r\n    requisite tension for discharge; also other gogions, and some\r\n    armour.”\r\n\r\nAfter stating other acts of this citizen, Mr. Fitch proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    “From this long recital of gifts, it must be concluded that Richard\r\n    Spynk was virtually the fortifier of the city; for it is clear that\r\n    until his munificence made the gates and walls complete, they were\r\n    imperfect.  Nor did he suffer his work to fall into decay; but by the\r\n    adoption of rules and regulations, he preserved to the city the full\r\n    benefit of what he had done.”\r\n\r\n    “Before proceeding further with an outline of the history of the\r\n    Walls and Gates, it should be stated that Norwich had been previously\r\n    surrounded by a ditch and bank for protection.” * * * * *\r\n\r\n    “One benefit produces another, and to Richard Spynk was the City not\r\n    only indebted for its safety from aggression, but also for an\r\n    extension of its liberties.\r\n\r\n    “It is recorded that Queen Isabella induced the king, her son, in\r\n    consideration of the costs and charges for the Walls which had been\r\n    raised without call on the Government, to grant a charter to the\r\n    Citizens, that they, and their heirs and successors, dwelling in the\r\n    said City, should for ever be free from jurisdiction of the Clerk of\r\n    the Market and of the household of the King, and his heirs, so that\r\n    the said Clerk or his officers should not enter the City, or fee or\r\n    make assay of any measures or weights, or to exercise or do anything\r\n    belonging to the said office of the Clerk of the Market.\r\n\r\n    “In this King’s reign, according to the Customs’ Book, there is an\r\n    account of the battlements on the various gates, towers, and walls.\r\n    These were numbered, in order that each parish might be made\r\n    acquainted with its responsibilities of repairs in this respect.\r\n    Beginning from the river to Coslany Gate, there were 112 battlements,\r\n    and 10 on the gate itself.  From that point to St. Augustine’s Gate,\r\n    were 69 battlements, and on the gate, 12.  Thence to Fibrigge Gate—on\r\n    the walls and towers were 153 battlements, and on the gate, 13;\r\n    thence to Pockthorpe Gate—on the walls and towers were 178, and on\r\n    the gate, 10; and from this gate to the river were about 40.  From\r\n    this point to the tower of Conisford Gate, the river chiefly protects\r\n    the city, but the tower bore 12 battlements; and from the tower on\r\n    the city side of the water to Conisford Gate, were 26 battlements\r\n    with 14 on the gate.  Thence to Ber Street Gate, were 150; on the\r\n    gate and its wicket were 27; and from thence to St. Stephen’s Gate\r\n    were 307 (here were some strong towers); and on this gate and wicket\r\n    were 28.\r\n\r\n    “From St. Stephen’s to St. Giles’ Gate were 229 (here again were\r\n    several strong towers), and on the gate and wicket were 15; and from\r\n    St. Giles’ to St. Benedict’s Gate were 100, and on the gate itself\r\n    and wicket were 16; thence to Heigham Gate 79, and on the gate 4—and\r\n    from this gate to the tower and wall on the river were 16\r\n    battlements; in all, 1630.  At this period (1345, according to the\r\n    Domesday Book of the City) there was a tax called ‘Fossage,’ to\r\n    defray the great charges of the walls and ditches.”  * *\r\n\r\n    “In 1385 a general survey was made, and all the walls and gates were\r\n    placed in good repair, with a sufficient number of men appointed to\r\n    guard them.  It was also agreed that churchwards should be chosen\r\n    annually, whose duty it should be to prevent any decay or permanent\r\n    injury to the fortifications by timely repair or by reconstruction.\r\n    In 1386, the expectancy of invasion caused general fear throughout\r\n    the realm, and particularly in the eastern counties.  The king sent\r\n    nearly a thousand men to Yarmouth for the defence of the coast; and\r\n    so imminent was the peril, that the king commanded the authorities of\r\n    Norwich to place the walls, towers, and gates in full and able\r\n    condition to repel all who might appear in opposition to the king’s\r\n    authority, or crush a design to injure the city.  The towers were\r\n    therefore filled with engines of defence, the walls rendered perfect,\r\n    and the ditches made as wide and as deep as the necessities of the\r\n    case demanded.” * * * *\r\n\r\nThe author proceeds to show the anxious attention which was paid to the\r\npreservation of the walls and gates, by copious extracts from a roll,\r\ndated 1386.  He then gives a full history of the fortifications, from\r\nwhich we shall make some extracts in our narrative of events at different\r\nperiods.  He thus concludes his historical sketch:—\r\n\r\n    “Not a fragment of the gates now exists, but the certain indications\r\n    of where, in some instances, they once stood, are yet accidentally\r\n    preserved.”\r\n\r\nWith a short notice of these, the account is concluded:—\r\n\r\n    “CONISFORD GATE.  A fragment of the wall of the east side of this\r\n    gate still exists, attached to the west of the ‘Cinder Ovens’ public\r\n    house at the south end of King Street, and also on the opposite side\r\n    of the street.\r\n\r\n    “BER STREET GATE.  No portion of this gate remains; but where the\r\n    structure stood is sufficiently evident by the high wall on the west\r\n    side of the upper end of Ber Street.\r\n\r\n    “BRAZEN DOORS.  Not a fragment remains.\r\n\r\n    “ST. STEPHEN’S GATE.  No portion left.\r\n\r\n    “ST. GILES’ GATE.  The house against which the south side of this\r\n    gate abutted still stands, and part of the lower walls of the\r\n    building can be seen. {126}\r\n\r\n    “ST. BENEDICT’S GATE.  Here a corresponding house or abuttal of this\r\n    gate stands perfect, with one of the strong iron staples, on which\r\n    hung one of the doors, projecting from the wall.\r\n\r\n    “HEIGHAM GATE.  Very slight remains left.\r\n\r\n    “ST. MARTIN’S GATE.  A portion of the north side of this gate is left\r\n    erect and firm, with small tenements abutting against it\r\n\r\n    “ST. AUGUSTINE’S GATE.  No fragment is left.  A large portion of the\r\n    ditch between this gate and St. Martin’s is clearly seen, very few\r\n    buildings having been erected on its site.\r\n\r\n    “MAGDALEN GATE.  No portion left, but the form and interior of the\r\n    city wall is well seen at this point.\r\n\r\n    “BARRE or POCKTHORPE GATE.  Indications are left of where the gate\r\n    stood, with fragments of the wall on the right and left\r\n\r\n    “BISHOP’S GATE.  Nothing of the gate exists, but the exact site may\r\n    be seen by the necessary increased width of the bridge.\r\n\r\n    “The precise spot where each gate stood may be found by tracing a\r\n    line of the city wall, where it crossed a street; the gates being of\r\n    course integral portions of the wall perforated for traffic and\r\n    fortified with extra work for adequate defence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESECRATED CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Francis Blomefield, of Fersfield, who flourished in the first\r\nhalf of the last century, was the chief of Norfolk historians and\r\nantiquarians.  He was great in genealogy and heraldry, and very elaborate\r\non monuments and epitaphs, while he altogether passed over more important\r\nmatters.  We might almost wish that he had known less of heraldry and\r\nmore of history; but his great work must ever be the foundation of local\r\nhistory in Norwich and Norfolk.  A perfect copy of his work, being very\r\nscarce, is now worth at least £20.  It contains most of the documentary\r\nantiquities of the city, such as charters, acts of parliaments,\r\nproceedings of public bodies, and other official sources of information,\r\nof which he has made a good use.  He has given full details from the\r\nrecords of every parish, and of the old corporation.  He states the great\r\nchanges which took place in the city and county at the time of the\r\nReformation, and the dissolution of the monasteries, when nineteen of\r\nthose institutions existed in Norwich.\r\n\r\nBlomefield notices several large conventual churches, which were\r\ndesecrated at the Reformation, and many parish churches which have been\r\ndemolished, their parishes being incorporated with those now existing.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nALL SAINTS’, situated in Fyebridge Street, was at the north corner of the\r\nstreet called Cowgate, at its entrance into Magdalen Street, and was\r\nbuilt before the Conquest.  At the foundation of the cathedral it was\r\nappropriated to the convent, and at the Reformation to the dean and\r\nchapter.  It was said to have had a very fine font, erected in 1477.  In\r\n1550 the church was taken down, and the parish, with that of St.\r\nMargaret, was annexed to St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. BARTHOLOMEW’S, in Ber Street, was in the patronage of the prior of\r\nWymondham, and at the Dissolution was consolidated with St. John’s\r\nSepulchre, and the church taken down.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. BITTULPH’S stood in Magdalen Street, a little north of Stump Cross.\r\nIt was founded before 1300 and was taken down in 1548, and the parish\r\nunited to St. Saviour’s.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. CHRISTOPHER’S stood on the east side of St. Andrew’s Hill, and was\r\none of the oldest churches in the city.  It was burnt down in the reign\r\nof Henry III.  The greater portion of the parish was united to St.\r\nAndrew’s and a smaller part to St. Michael’s at Plea.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. CRUCIS, or St. Crowches, stood in Broad Street, St. Andrew’s.  It was\r\ndedicated to the honour of the holy cross, and was erected before the\r\nyear 1272.  In 1551 it was desecrated, and the parish united to St.\r\nJohn’s Maddermarket.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. CLEMENT’S, in Conisford, situated in King Street, was a very ancient\r\nchurch, founded long before the Conquest.  It was united with St.\r\nJulian’s in 1482.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. CUTHBERT’S was situated at the north end of King Street, near\r\nTombland.  About 1492 it was united to the church of St. Mary the Less at\r\nthe monastery gates, and was demolished in 1530.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. EDWARD’S stood on the west side of King Street, near St. Etheldred’s\r\nchurch.  About the end of the 13th century it was united to St. Julian’s.\r\nAll along King Street there are many vaults and crypts, which seem to\r\nhave formed the foundations of old churches and monasteries.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. FAITH’S or ST. VEDAST’S was situated near the place where Cooke’s\r\nhospital now stands, in Rose Lane.  It was founded before the Conquest\r\nand was taken down in 1540, the parish being united with that of St.\r\nPeter per Mountergate.  The latter is a corruption of the old name\r\n“Parmenter Gate,” which should be restored by authority.  It was the old\r\nTailor Street.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. FRANCIS’ belonged to the Grey Friars, whose convent stood near the\r\nsite of Cooke’s hospital.  It was a noble church, 300 feet in length and\r\n80 feet in breadth, with cloisters and a large chapter house.  At the\r\nDissolution it was, with the convent, granted to the Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. JAMES’, CARROW, belonged to the nunnery there, and with it became\r\nprivate property at the Dissolution, the parish being united to Lakenham.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. JOHN’S IN SOUTHGATE stood at the north corner of Rose Lane, and about\r\n1300 was annexed to St. Peter Parmenter Gate.  The Grey Friars pulled it\r\ndown and annexed the site of it to their convent.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. JOHN THE BAPTIST’S stood on the site of the present Octagon chapel.\r\nIt was originally a parish church; but when the Dominicans, or Friars’\r\nPreachers, settled here in 1226, it was given to them, and the parish was\r\nunited to St. George’s at Colegate.  They immediately built a convent in\r\nthis place and the church was used by them as a chapel, till they removed\r\nto their new convent in St. Andrew’s, where they dedicated their church\r\nalso to St. John the Baptist.  The church is now St. Andrew’s Hall, and\r\nthe chancel (formerly the Dutch church) is now the place of worship of\r\nthe FREE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MARGARET’S, IN FYEBRIDGE, was a church of ancient foundation,\r\nsituated on the west side of Magdalen Street, near the gate.  There is no\r\naccount how long it has been dissolved.  The parish is now united with\r\nSt. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MARGARET’S AT NEWBRIDGE, anciently called St. Margaret’s at Colegate,\r\nwas situated near Blackfriars’ bridge, on the west side of the street.\r\nThe parish was depopulated by the great pestilence, in 1349, when the\r\nchurch ceased to be parochial, and the parish was annexed to that of St.\r\nGeorge’s Colegate.  The church occupied the site of Weston’s brewery, now\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MARTIN’S in BALLIVA was situated near the spot where, until lately,\r\nthe Golden Ball tavern stood, on the south side of the Castle Hill.  The\r\nchurch was on the right hand of the entrance into Golden Ball Lane.  In\r\n1562, this church was demolished and the parish united to St. Michael’s\r\nat Thorn.  Formerly all persons dying in the castle, and all criminals\r\nexecuted, were buried in this churchyard, but this right, after the\r\ndesecration of the church, was conferred upon St. Michael’s at Thorn.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MARY THE VIRGIN’S was situated in Conisford, and belonged to the\r\nAugustine Friars, being also dedicated to St. Augustine.  It was a noble\r\nstructure, 450 feet long and 90 feet wide, with cloisters on the north\r\nand south sides.  After the Dissolution it became private property in\r\n1547, when the church and conventual buildings were demolished.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MARY UNBRENT stood on the west side of Magdalen Street, near Golden\r\nDog Lane.  The church was demolished at the dissolution, and the parish\r\nunited to St. Saviour’s.  “Unbrent” means unburnt.  The church was called\r\nSt. Mary _in combusto loco_, or in that part of the city burnt in the\r\ngreat fire in the time of William I.  Blomefield thinks that the church\r\nwas then consumed, and afterwards rebuilt; and that it was erroneously\r\nwritten in ancient documents _uncombusto_, instead of _in combusto_.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW’S, near the palace, was a small church.  The parish has,\r\nsince the great pestilence of 1349, been united with that of St. Martin’s\r\nat Palace.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MICHAEL’S in Coslany was sold to the Austin Friars in 1360, and\r\nshortly afterwards the parish was united to that of St. Peter Parmenter\r\nGate, when the church was demolished and a cloister erected on its site.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. OLAVE’S, or St. TOOLEY’S, stood on the east side of Tooley Street,\r\nnext to the corner of Cherry Lane.  It was demolished in 1546, and the\r\nparish consolidated with St. George’s Colegate.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. CATHERINE’S in NEWGATE was situated on St. Catherine’s Hill.  In 1349\r\nthe whole parish was almost depopulated by the pestilence, after which\r\nthe church was deserted and converted into a chapel, the parish being\r\nunited with that of All Saints.  At the Dissolution the chapel was\r\ngranted to Sir John Milton, and in 1567 conveyed to the city for the use\r\nof St. Giles’ hospital.  Thus a large amount of Church property was\r\napplied to secular purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESECRATED CHAPELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlomefield gives an account of different chapels dedicated to various\r\npurposes, most of which were destroyed at the Dissolution.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. CATHERINE’S CHAPEL stood upon Mousehold, about a mile north-east of\r\nthe barracks, was founded about the time of the Conquest, and was deemed\r\na parochial chapel while it was standing.  At the Dissolution this chapel\r\nwas demolished and the parish united with that of St. James.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPEL OF ST. THOMAS A BECKET, which was not parochial, stood near\r\nthe same place.  No traces of the building can now be discovered.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGE OF ST. MARY IN THE FIELDS, originally called the Chapel in\r\nthe Fields (whence the present name of Chapel Field was derived), was a\r\nchapel dedicated to Mary the Virgin.  It was founded about the year 1250,\r\nby JOHN LE BRUN, as an hospital, but its benefactors were so numerous and\r\nmunificent that in a very short time it became a noble college,\r\nconsisting of a dean, chancellor, precentor, treasurer, and seven other\r\nprebendaries.  Six chaplains or chantry priests were afterwards added.\r\nThe dean was collated by the bishop in right of the see, or by the king\r\nduring a vacancy.  The premises were very extensive, and were granted at\r\nthe dissolution to Miles Spencer, LL.D., the last dean.  After passing\r\nthrough many hands the property came into possession of shareholders, who\r\nbuilt Assembly Rooms on the site of the college.  Bond Cabbell, Esq.\r\nsubsequently bought the whole building for a Freemasons’ Hall.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nGUILDHALL CHAPEL adjoined the south side of the hall, and was dedicated\r\nto St. Barbara.  It served as a chapel for the prisoners as well as for\r\nthe Court to attend divine service when they assembled on public\r\nbusiness.  It was pulled down long since, and the present porch was\r\nerected on its site.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. MICHAEL’S CHAPEL, TOMBLAND, stood on the site of the obelisk, and was\r\none of the most ancient religious buildings in Norwich.  It was founded\r\nby the Earl of the East Angles long before the Conquest and prior to the\r\nbuilding of the Cathedral; served as a chapel for the use of their\r\npalace, which stood facing the south side of the chapel-yard; and\r\noccupied the south end of Tombland, from the monastery gate to the chapel\r\nditch.  Bishop Herbert demolished it, and the whole site was laid open\r\nfor the improvement of the monastery, and a stone cross was erected on\r\nthe spot.  Instead of this, the Bishop built another chapel on the summit\r\nof the hill outside of Bishopgate, and dedicated it to St. Michael.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. NICHOLAS’ CHAPEL, Bracondale, was situated at the corner of the road\r\nnow leading to Carrow Bridge.  It was much frequented by fishermen and\r\nwatermen, who were then numerous, and who made offerings there to St.\r\nNicholas, their patron saint.  It was founded before the Conquest and was\r\nparochial; but in the time of Edward II. the parish was returned as\r\nbelonging to Lakenham, with which it is now united.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. OLAVE’S CHAPEL, near King Street Gates, was a parochial chapel long\r\nbefore the Conquest, and in the reign of Edward III. the parish was\r\nunited to that of St. Peter Southgate.  The chapel was demolished before\r\n1345.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONASTIC INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor’s _Index Monasticus_ contains the fullest account of the old\r\nmonasteries which, at one period, were very numerous in the city.  Many\r\nof them possessed large churches, great wealth, and considerable power.\r\nThey comprised Priories, Friaries, and Nunneries, which were situated in\r\nor near King Street, or St. Faith’s Lane, or the Cowgate.  Formerly all\r\nthe west side of the river was called the Cow-holm, where cows fed on the\r\nmeadows, and Cowgate consisted of open fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine Priory at the cathedral was founded by Bishop Herbert as\r\nalready noticed.  The Priory of St. Leonard’s was founded by Bishop\r\nHerbert before he built the cathedral, and here he placed the monks while\r\nthe priory was being built.  It was situated on Mousehold Heath, opposite\r\nBishop’s Bridge, and served as a cell to the cathedral priory till the\r\nDissolution.  At the Dissolution it was granted by Henry VIII. to Thomas,\r\nDuke of Norfolk, whose son Henry, Earl of Surrey, erected on its site a\r\nsplendid house, called Surrey house, which has long since fallen into\r\ndecay.  St. Michael’s Chapel, built by Bishop Herbert, was near the\r\npriory, and served by monks.  It was demolished by the rebel Kett, who,\r\nwith his followers, encamped near it, so that it has since been called\r\nKett’s Castle.  Near the remains of this chapel, in the valley beneath,\r\nwas Lollard’s Pit, the spot where many of the early Reformers were\r\nburned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis class of monastic institutions consisted of houses erected for the\r\nFriars, of orders grey, or white, or black.  The monasteries were seldom\r\nendowed, because the Friars were, by profession, beggars, and lived on\r\nwhat they could get.  They obtained a great deal of money in the ages of\r\nsuperstition.  Many of their buildings were large and stately, and\r\nconnected with noble churches in which great personages were frequently\r\ninterred.  Most of the monasteries were houses of refuge for the\r\ndestitute poor in the middle ages.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE GREY OR FRANCISCAN FRIARS seem to have been the first who settled\r\nhere near the site of Cooke’s Hospital about 1226.  This convent was a\r\nplace of great resort, and the church, as already stated in our notice of\r\nthe Desecrated Churches, was a large building 300 feet in length, and 80\r\nfeet in breadth, with spacious cloisters and conventual buildings; not a\r\nstone of which now remains.  One of the cloisters of this convent was\r\ncalled “Pardon Cloister,” on account of the pope granting indulgences to\r\nall who were buried there, a source of revenue to the monks.  At the\r\nDissolution the possessions were granted to the Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE FRIARS or CARMELITES had a flourishing convent near White\r\nFriars’ Bridge, which was founded by Philip de Cowgate in 1256.  He\r\nassumed the name from his estates, being the principal person in those\r\nparts of the city.  The monks were called White Friars from their dress,\r\nand Carmelites from the monastery of Mount Carmel in Palestine, the place\r\nof their first residence, from which they were driven by the Saracens\r\nabout the year 1238, after which they settled in different parts of\r\nEurope.  The monastery has been long demolished, and the site built upon.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK FRIARS, sometimes called the Dominican Friars or Friars’\r\nPreachers, settled here about 1226, in the church of St. John the\r\nBaptist, which formerly stood in Colegate Street, on the site of the\r\nOctagon Chapel.  They afterwards removed into the parish of St. Andrew,\r\nwhere they built a large monastery.  The name of the church is now St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAUSTIN FRIARY.  The possessions of this convent were bounded on the north\r\nby St. Faith’s Lane, and extended as far as the river.  At the\r\nDissolution they were granted to Sir Thomas Heneage.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE FRIARS DE DOMINA arose in 1288, and in 1290 were introduced here.\r\nThey had a house on the south side of St. Julian’s Churchyard, where they\r\ncontinued till the reign of Edward III., when, all the brethren dying of\r\nthe great pestilence of 1348, their convent became private property.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE FRIARS OF ST. MARY occupied a house situated in the yard of the\r\ndesecrated church of St. Martin in Balliva, where the Golden Ball Tavern\r\nstood.  They joined the order of White Friars.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE FRIARS DE PICA or PIED FRIARS, so called from their black and white\r\ngarments, lived in a college at the corner of the churchyard of St. Peter\r\nParmentergate.  They joined one of the other orders.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE FRIARS DE SACCO, or BRETHREN of the SAC, settled here about 1250 in a\r\nhouse opposite to the church of St. Peter’s Hungate.  The whole premises,\r\nbounded by Bridge Street on the west, by the river on the north, and by\r\nthe street leading to Hungate on the south, were settled on them, where\r\nthey built a church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, on the site of which\r\nSt. Andrew’s Hall now stands.  The Black Friars were united with them in\r\n1307, when the convent was greatly enlarged, extending to the river on\r\nthe north side, and to Elm Hill on the east side.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nA NUNNERY formerly existed at Carrow Abbey, dedicated to St. Mary and St.\r\nJohn.  It was founded in the year 1146 by two ladies named Leftelina and\r\nSeyna.  It was richly endowed by King Stephen, and consisted of a\r\nPrioress and nine Benedictine Nuns, which number was afterwards increased\r\nto twelve.  The site within the walls contained about ten acres of land,\r\nand the revenues and possessions were great.  At the Dissolution the\r\nabbey and lands became private property.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nANCHORAGES or HERMITAGES were connected with several of the monastic\r\ninstitutions in the city, and even inhabited by recluses.  Anchorets were\r\na sort of monks, so called from their shutting themselves up in\r\nanchorages or cells.  Of these there were male and female, the eremite or\r\nhermit, who pretended to follow the example of John the Baptist, and the\r\nanchoress, who professed to imitate the conduct of Judith.  All these\r\nanchorages were abolished at the Dissolution or at the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONUMENTAL BRASSES OF NORWICH AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Archæologists, and particularly to those directing their attention to\r\nMonumental Brasses, the following list of Brasses in Norwich and the\r\nprincipal villages in the neighbourhood, may be considered useful.  They\r\nare classified under their distinctive characters, namely—1st,\r\nEcclesiastics; 2nd, knights; 3rd, civilians and ladies; 4th,\r\nmiscellaneous.  The list specifies those consisting of effigies generally\r\nperfect, with their inscriptions, unless otherwise mentioned.\r\n\r\nAn alphabetical list of the churches, with the various brasses in each,\r\nis also appended.\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTICS.\r\n    1389.

It was the scene\r\nof many important events in the times of the Iceni, the Romans, the\r\nAngles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes, and Normans.  It was the royal seat of\r\nAnglo-Saxon princes.  It was the Hierapolis Monachopolis of the middle\r\nages; famous for its churches and convents; and in later times,\r\ncelebrated for its Norman castle and cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe first foundations of history are very often mere traditions, which\r\nare transmitted from parents to their children, from one generation to\r\nanother.  Probable only in their origin, they become less probable in\r\nevery succeeding age.  In process of time fable gains and truth loses\r\nground.  Hence it is almost impossible to ascertain the origin of any\r\nplace claiming a high antiquity.  The early writers could not divest\r\ntheir minds of the fascinating fables of Geoffrey of Monmouth.  In former\r\ntimes, when the power of imagination prevailed, the distinction between\r\nlegend and history was scarcely recognised.  For centuries there are not\r\neven legendary accounts of East Anglia or of its capital.  But instead of\r\nlegends, there are permanent memorials of the past; great earthworks,\r\nfortifications, camps, strongholds, buildings, churches, ruins of\r\nmonasteries and abbeys.  The soil has yielded up relics of the\r\ndead—weapons, utensils, coins, ornaments, and sepulchral urns, showing\r\nthe presence of the Iceni, the Romans, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes,\r\nand Normans, at different periods.  All these energetic nations were\r\nconcerned in events that took place in Norfolk and Norwich.\r\n\r\nThe Iceni appear to have been politically independent up to the period of\r\nthe Roman invasion, B.C. 55.  Their alarm in consequence of that invasion\r\nled them to negociate an alliance, but we have no reason to suppose that\r\nit was ever carried into effect.  They took the lead in a rebellion which\r\nthe Roman General Ostorius was barely able to quell; and Roman historians\r\nbear testimony to the valour with which they struggled to maintain their\r\nliberty.  The superior discipline of the Roman soldiers enabled them,\r\nhowever, to triumph over a semi-barbarous people, unprotected by body\r\narmour and unused to military tactics; but it was no easy victory.  For\r\nabout 600 years after the defeat of the Iceni, no reliable information\r\nrespecting that people is to be found in any history.  Indeed they\r\ndisappear from history altogether, and we can only infer what advances\r\nthey made in civilization from the scattered remains that have been found\r\nin the eastern counties.  These remains prove that the Iceni were not\r\nsemi-savages, but that they had made some progress in useful arts, that\r\nthey built houses, and wore woven garments.\r\n\r\nThere are no remains in the eastern counties of cairns, cromlechs,\r\nDruidical circles, or other memorials of ancient perseverance and\r\nmechanical skill, nature having interposed an absolute veto.  But there\r\nare remains of earth works and tumuli, burrows or artificial mounds in\r\nwhich were deposited the urns or ashes of the dead.  There are thousands\r\nof pits in many places, and these are supposed to have been the\r\nfoundations of Icenian houses.  Remarkable excavations are thickly\r\nclustered all over Weybourne Heath, varying from 8 to 20 feet in\r\ndiameter, and from 2 to 6 feet in depth.\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Museum contains some remains of articles made by the Iceni,\r\namongst which may be mentioned sepulchral urns, varying from the most\r\nprimitive simplicity, up to forms and patterns worthy of any age.  The\r\n_chevron_ ornament, which is by far the most usual style of decoration,\r\nhas been traced not merely in India, Egypt, Etruria, and Nineveh, as well\r\nas in Saxon and Norman work, but even among the works of ancient American\r\nsettlers in Yucatan!  The Museum also contains specimens of Icenic Celts\r\nor javelin heads, made of flints, which appear to have been originally\r\nfitted on a wooden shaft or handle, with a provision for drawing it back\r\nafter the infliction of the wound, by means of a cord passing through the\r\nring, as in the metal specimens.  It is probable that these flint\r\nspecimens were in use long anterior to the Roman invasion.\r\n\r\nAbout 1844 or 1845, some discoveries were made in Norfolk of gold torques\r\nand coins of the Iceni.  In March 1855, at Weston in Norfolk, 300 coins\r\nof the Iceni were found.  The most ordinary type is the rude\r\nrepresentation of a horse on each side; others have two crescents placed\r\nback to back; and on some (in about the proportion of one in twenty,) is\r\na rude profile of a human head, while in a few instances there is a\r\nfigure of a wild boar.  Beneath the horse in some cases are the letters E\r\nC E or E C N, (supposed to be a contraction of Iceni,) also C E A, T, A T\r\nD, A T E D, or A N T D, which antiquarians are as yet unable to explain.\r\nProbably all the coins, like a single coin which has been found of\r\nBoadicea, the unfortunate Queen of the Iceni, were subsequent to the\r\nRoman invasion, for Cæsar expressly tells us that the Britons in his time\r\nused metal rings instead of money, the value being determined by their\r\nweight; and Camden, with great probability, supposes that most of the\r\nBritish coins must have been struck as a sort of poll tax or tribute\r\nmoney to the Romans.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the antiquities of the British period are articles of\r\nthe most urgent necessity, and of the rudest possible form; but a long\r\ninterval of tranquillity brought even luxuries in its train, and it is a\r\nvery remarkable fact that even the lapse of 1800 years has scarcely\r\neffected any change in some articles of general utility.  The discoveries\r\nmade at Herculaneum and Pompeii have led to a revival of the classical\r\nforms, both in porcelain and in plate, the greatest practical compliment\r\nthat could be paid to the taste of the Roman artists.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects which have been found at different places may be\r\nmentioned sepulchral vases, varying, of course, in style and taste, but\r\nin some instances most beautifully formed; funeral lamps, lacrymatories,\r\n(or phials supposed to have contained the tears of the sorrowing\r\nrelations,) _fibulæ_ (or brooches), gold rings, gold seals, steelyards,\r\nweights, tweezers, a curiously formed brass lamp for three lights, a\r\npatera of Samian ware, and coins of the Roman emperors.  All these may be\r\nseen in the Norwich Museum.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence of the existence of Norwich as a city for 400 years\r\nafter the Christian era.  The whole island was a howling wilderness, and\r\nNorfolk was a vast common, like Roudham Heath.  The natives lived by\r\nhunting or fishing, and sheltered themselves in the woods, or in caves,\r\nor huts.  Water covered nearly all the area in which the city is now\r\nbuilt, and filled all the valley of the Yare.  The aborigines, called the\r\nIceni, probably lived in huts near the banks of the river, as it afforded\r\na good supply of fish; but there is no proof that they lived in any place\r\nthat could be called a town or even a village.  There is in fact, no\r\nreliable account whatever of the natives, how they lived, or where they\r\nlived in this district; for they have not even left any names of places,\r\nand very few traces of any progress in the useful arts, and certainly\r\nnone of any buildings.  On Mousehold Heath, near the city, and at various\r\nplaces in the county, there are hollows supposed to have been made by the\r\nIceni as the foundation of huts, or of houses of wicker work, or some\r\nother perishable material, with a conical thatching at the top.\r\nExternally they must have looked like very low bastions, having doorways,\r\nbut apparently neither chimneys nor windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nNorwich in the Roman Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Julius Cæsar invaded the island, B.C. 55, he found seventeen tribes\r\nof the ancient Britons or Celts, and the Iceni, inhabiting this eastern\r\ndistrict.  They belonged to a very old family of mankind, of whose\r\nbeginning there is no record, and their end is still more remote in the\r\nfuture.  They first planted this island and gave to the seas, rivers,\r\nlakes, and mountains names which are poems, imitating the pure voices of\r\nnature.  Julius Cæsar only made an inroad into the country through a part\r\nof Kent, and gained no permanent hold of the island.  The Rev. Scott F.\r\nSurtees, in a recent work, maintains (and some persons think\r\nsuccessfully) that Julius Cæsar effected his first landing on the coast\r\nof Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, under Claudius, landed on the eastern coast; and established\r\nhis power in this part of the country.  He built strongholds at Gorleston\r\nand camps at Caister, near the present site of Yarmouth, and on the\r\nopposite shore at Burgh Castle, where extensive ruins yet remain.\r\nAdvancing up the arm of the sea, the Romans built a camp at Reedham; and\r\nsailing yet higher up they built camps on the southern side of Norwich,\r\nat Caistor and Tasburgh.  Historians for a long time believed that\r\nCaistor was the _Venta Icenorum_ of the Romans, and preserved a very\r\nancient tradition, that Norwich was built of Caistor stone out of the\r\nruins of the Roman camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VENTA ICENORUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Hudson Gurney, Esq., collected ample materials for a full\r\nhistory of Norwich, but the only result of his researches seems to have\r\nbeen a letter to the late Dawson Turner, Esq., on the question of the\r\n_Venta Icenorum_ mentioned by the Roman writers, whether it was Elmham,\r\nas Blomefield supposed, or Caistor, as later historians believed, or\r\nNorwich, as most antiquarians now think.  The question is of some\r\nimportance as regards the antiquity of the city; for supposing it to have\r\nbeen the _Venta Icenorum_ of the Romans, with all the Roman roads\r\nradiating from it, the _Venta_ must have been a large place.  Main roads\r\nwere of course made for traffic and for means of communication, which\r\nimply the existence of many people living in settled habitations.\r\n\r\nMain roads prove a certain advance in civilization; but the question is,\r\nwhether the Romans really made all the roads attributed to them, in\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk, during the four hundred years of their occupation.\r\nMain roads might have radiated from Caistor originally, and afterwards\r\nmight have been diverted to Norwich.\r\n\r\nMr. Hudson Gurney adduced some proofs that Norwich and not Caistor was\r\nthe Venta Icenorum.  He says—\r\n\r\n    “The first question to examine, on the view of Norwich, Norwich\r\n    Castle, and the Roman Camp at Caistor, may be, whether Norwich or\r\n    Caistor be the ‘Venta Icenorum’ of the Romans; Norwich standing on\r\n    the Wensum, and Caistor on the Taes, on the opposite side of what was\r\n    the great estuary.”\r\n\r\n    “To begin, then, with Camden.  In his accounts of Norwich and of\r\n    Caistor he falls into the most extraordinary errors, confounding the\r\n    courses of the three rivers, the Wensum, the Taes, and the Yare.  He\r\n    places Norwich upon the Yare instead of the Wensum, and gives the\r\n    Wensum the course of the Taes as ‘flowing from the south;’ and still\r\n    more strangely, as a king-at-arms, he attributes the erection of the\r\n    present Castle of Norwich to Hugh Bygod, ‘from the lions salient\r\n    carved in stone on it, which were the old arms of the Bygods on their\r\n    seals, though one of them bore a cross for his seal.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Hudson Gurney remarks on this error—\r\n\r\n    “Now the lions were two lions passant regardant, very rudely carved,\r\n    one on each side of the arch of the great entrance, and the Bygods,\r\n    whose original arms were or, a cross gules, never bore the lion till\r\n    assumed by Roger Bygod in the reign of Henry III., who took the arms\r\n    of his mother, the heiress of William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, in\r\n    whose light he became Earl Marshal of England.”\r\n\r\nThus Camden is disposed of, and other authorities are quoted in the\r\nletter in favour of Norwich being the Venta Icenorum.\r\n\r\n    “Horsley, in his _Britannia Romani_, states that Venta was the\r\n    capital of the _Iceni_, situated on the Wentfar, and thence deriving\r\n    its name; and misled by and quoting Camden, he places Venta at\r\n    Caistor.”\r\n\r\n    “King, who, born in Norwich, might have been supposed to have been\r\n    better informed, in his _Munimenta Antiqua_ follows Camden, and turns\r\n    the Taes into the Wensum; and in his paper in the fourth volume of\r\n    the _Archæologia_, he pronounces the existing Castle of Norwich to be\r\n    ‘the very tower which was erected about the time of King Canute.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Hudson Gurney, after setting aside Wilkins as an authority, proceeds—\r\n\r\n    “In 1834, I went over the Camp at Caistor and the country adjacent,\r\n    with Colonel Leake, who may be considered the greatest living\r\n    authority for the sites of ancient cities and fortified camps, and he\r\n    at once said that he was convinced that Norwich was the _Venta\r\n    Icenorum_, and capital of the Iceni, and Caistor the fortified camp\r\n    planted by the Romans over against it, on the other side of the\r\n    estuary, to bridle, as was their custom, a hostile population.”\r\n\r\nAfter quoting a letter to the same effect, Mr. Hudson Gurney continues—\r\n\r\n    “In the Roman Itineraries you have three Ventas; Venta Bulgarum,\r\n    Winchester; Venta Silurum, Caer Went, in Monmouthshire; and Venta\r\n    Icenorum; and of these Ventas, the confusion between Winchester and\r\n    the Venta Icenorum seems to have been begun very early, both with the\r\n    chroniclers and romancers, probably from the one having retained the\r\n    rudiments of the name, and the other becoming known as Northwic.”\r\n\r\n    “Sir Francis Palgrave, in the researches which he has made for his\r\n    forthcoming history of ‘England under the Normans,’ being led to the\r\n    examination of all contemporary authors, in order to clear up points\r\n    which he found otherwise inexplicable, has referred me to the two\r\n    following passages, which would seem to prove that Norwich was the\r\n    Venta Icenorum almost beyond dispute.”\r\n\r\nHere follow Latin quotations from the life of William the Conqueror by\r\nWilliam of Poictiers and from Ordericus Vitalis under the year 1067.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Poictiers says:—\r\n\r\n    “Gwenta urbs est nobilis atque valens, cives ac finitimos habet\r\n    divites, infidos, et audaces: Danos in auxilium ceteris recipere\r\n    potest: a mari quod Anglos a Danis separat millia passuum\r\n    quatuor-decim distat.  Hujus quoque urbis intra mœnia, munitionem\r\n    construxit, ibidem Gulielmum reliquit Osberni filium præcipuum in\r\n    exercito suo, et in vice sua interim toti regno Aquilonem versus\r\n    præesset.”\r\n\r\nAnd Ordericus Vitalis states:—\r\n\r\n    “Intra mænia Gwentæ, opibus et munimine nobilis urbis, et mari\r\n    contiguæ, validem arcem construxit, ibique Gulielmum Osberni filium\r\n    in exercitu suo præcipuum reliquit, eumque vice sua toti Regno versus\r\n    Aquilonem præesse constituit.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Gurney proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    “Taking, then, Norwich for the Venta Icenorum of the Romans—called\r\n    Caer Guntum by the British, and Northwic by the Saxons and Danes—you\r\n    find the Capital of the Iceni, founded on the shoulder of the\r\n    promontory overlooking the Wensum, towards the great estuary, which\r\n    formed a natural stronghold for successive races of inhabitants.\r\n    Whilst the Romans, fixing their permanent camp at Caistor, on the\r\n    Taes, where that river joined the estuary, into which the Wensum, the\r\n    Taes, and the Yare, all discharged themselves, would command the\r\n    passage into the interior of the country; and taking Caistor for the\r\n    ‘Ad Taum,’ you will find the distances sufficiently to agree with the\r\n    Roman Itineraries.”\r\n\r\n    “The Camp at Caistor contains an area of about thirty-five acres, and\r\n    the Roman station at Taesborough, on another promontory higher up\r\n    upon the stream, has an area of about twenty-four acres.”\r\n\r\nAnother strong point in favour of Norwich having been the Venta Icenorum\r\nis, that all the roads radiated from the city to all parts of East\r\nAnglia.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the rise and progress of the city we must remember that it was\r\nin the centre of a vast common, and that it was the nucleus of an\r\nagricultural community, at first without any trade or any kind of\r\nmanufactures.  It was merely a collection of huts or a fishing station,\r\nnear the banks of a river or arm of the sea.  The social state of the\r\nplace should be considered with reference to the progress of agriculture\r\nat different periods in the surrounding district.  Norwich was for ages\r\nonly a small market town, with a very small number of inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nNorwich in the Anglo-Saxon Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE destruction of all documents relating to East Anglia, during the\r\nirruptions of the Danes, has rendered this period the most obscure of any\r\nperiod of our history.  The Angles, Saxons, and Jutes having subjugated\r\nthe fair territory of England, they divided it into seven kingdoms,\r\ncalled the Heptarchy, in which Norfolk formed a part of East Anglia.  The\r\nAnglo-Saxon leader, Uffa, established himself in this part of the island,\r\nin 575; and assumed dominion over that portion of the eastern district\r\nnow divided into Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire, giving it the name\r\nof East Anglia, of which Norwich was made the metropolis.  Norwich was,\r\ntherefore, a royal city, and the residence of the kings.  Uffa, the first\r\nking, is supposed to have formed here a strong entrenchment of earth on\r\nthe site of the present castle, encircled by broad ramparts and a ditch,\r\nas under the present Saxon arch.  Uffa, who died A.D. 578, was succeeded\r\nby his son Titul; on whose demise, in 599, his son Redwald assumed the\r\nreins of government and embraced Christianity, but by the influence of\r\nhis wife renounced it again.  He was succeeded, A.D. 624, by his son\r\nErpenwald, who was killed by a relation named Richbert, A.D. 633.  His\r\nhalf brother Sigebert, who succeeded to the crown, established the\r\nbishopric of Dunwich, in Suffolk, and formed the first seminary for\r\nreligious instruction, which led to the establishment of the university\r\nin Cambridge.  Fatigued with the crown and its cares, he resigned it,\r\nA.D. 644, to his kinsman Egric, and retired into the famous monastery at\r\nBury St. Edmund’s.\r\n\r\nNorwich then became one of the chief seats of Anna, king of the East\r\nAngles, who gave the castle, with the lands belonging to it, to his\r\ndaughter Ethelfrida on her marriage with Tombert, a prince of the\r\n_Gyrvii_ or Fenmen, who inhabited the fens of Lincolnshire and the\r\nadjacent parts of Norfolk.  At the same time Tombert granted to\r\nEthelfrida, as a marriage settlement, the isle of Ely, which for greater\r\nsecurity was to be held by castle guard service to the castle of Norwich.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Anna till the reign of Alfred the Great there are few\r\nevents on record except the frequent incursions of the piratical Danes,\r\nwho at last over-ran East Anglia, and had their head quarters at Thetford\r\nin 870.  But the reign of the Great Alfred was distinguished by his\r\ndecisive victories over those Northern marauders.  One of his chief\r\nobjects was to fortify the principal parts of his kingdom against hostile\r\nattacks.  Finding the walls or ramparts of Norwich Castle too weak for\r\nrepelling the attacks of the Danes, he caused others to be erected with\r\nthe most durable materials.  That it was a noted military station, and a\r\nroyal castle in his time, is evident from a coin struck here in the year\r\n872, having round the head _AElfred Rex_, and on the reverse _Northwic_.\r\nAfter making peace with the Danes in 878, he assigned to them, for their\r\nresidence, the whole of East Anglia, and their leader Guthrum fixed his\r\nseat at Norwich; but, breaking his faith, the city and county were\r\nwrested from him, and reverted again to the Angles under six successive\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nEdward the Elder succeeded his father, the illustrious Alfred, in the\r\nyear 901, and kept the Danes at bay.  Ericke, one of their chiefs, held\r\nEast Anglia under the king, till he rebelled in 913, when he was\r\noverthrown and slain.  Athelstan, who succeeded Edward, totally expelled\r\nthe Danes, and reduced the whole kingdom under his government.  In his\r\nreign Norwich flourished, and it is probable that he was here in 925, for\r\na coin still extant has on the obverse _Ethalstan_, and on the reverse\r\n“_Barbe Mon Northwic_,” that is “Barbe, mint master of Norwich.”  Among\r\nthe other East Anglian coins struck here, the following may be mentioned;\r\none of Edmund, the successor of Athelstan, inscribed round the head\r\n_Edmund Rex_, and on the reverse _Edgar Mon Northwic_; several of Edred,\r\ncoined about 946, and inscribed round the head _Eadred Rex_, and on the\r\nreverse _Hanne Mo Northwic_; two of Edward the Martyr, having on the\r\nobverse _Edward Rex. Angl._ and on the reverse _Leofwine Mon Nor._; and\r\nthree of Ethelred the Unready, having on the obverse _Edelred Rex_.\r\n\r\nThere is no account of the castle after the time of Anna till the Danish\r\nwars; and then it was often won and lost by the contending powers.\r\n\r\nBlomefield, in his History of Norfolk, vol. II. p. 4, notices the coins\r\nof several Anglo-Saxon princes, Alfred, Athelstan, Edmund I., Edred,\r\nEdward the Martyr, and Ethelred II.  The circumstance of Alfred coining\r\nmoney here is remarkable, as at the date of this coinage, (872) the\r\ngovernment of East Anglia could only have just come into his hands, upon\r\nthe extinction of the East Anglian dynasty in the person of St. Edmund,\r\nand the country either was or had just been in the military possession of\r\nthe Danes.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Athelstan the city appears to have been in a\r\nflourishing state.  In the reign of Edward, 941, and his successor Edred,\r\n945, it greatly increased in wealth and extent.  The greater part of the\r\ncity was then built on the north side of the river Wensum, with a small\r\npopulation.  The city is certainly of Anglo-Saxon origin, but as an\r\nAnglo-Saxon city it was destroyed by the Danes, and no vestiges remain of\r\nits Anglo-Saxon buildings, excepting, perhaps, one or two round towers of\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nNorwich under the Danes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Danes became settled in the city, and fortified themselves against\r\nall enemies, about 1011; and the next year, Turkil or Turketel, a Danish\r\nearl, took possession of all Norfolk, having expelled the English Earl\r\nUlfketel, and held it under Sweyn till his death, which happened in 1014.\r\nThen the Danish army chose Canute his son for their king: but upon\r\nSweyn’s death the English took courage and sent for Ethelred out of\r\nNormandy, who returned and drove Canute out of the country.  Turkel,\r\nhowever, continued governor of the East Angles, and he persuaded Canute\r\nto return; and he became king of England in 1017.  That monarch assigned\r\nall Norfolk to Earl Turkel; and according to the old author of an Essay\r\non the Antiquity of the Castle:—\r\n\r\n    “Committed to him the custody of Norwich, which his father Sweyn\r\n    burnt and destroyed; and to keep the East Angles secure to him, he\r\n    (Canute) was most like to be the builder of the present stone Castle\r\n    of Norwich.  For when by compact with the English nobles, the law\r\n    called _Engleshire_ was made by universal consent, for the safety of\r\n    the Danes that were by agreement to remain in England, Canute sent\r\n    home to Denmark his mercenary army of Danes, but in great caution\r\n    built several strong forts and castles, garrisoning them with such\r\n    Danes as had been settled in England before his time, intermixed with\r\n    such English as he had confidence in.”\r\n\r\nThe author of this ingenious Essay produces sufficient arguments to show\r\nthat there was a building in the fortifications in the reign of Canute,\r\nand that there had been one since the time of King Alfred, and that\r\nCanute might have repaired or even rebuilt it.  Indeed, there must have\r\nbeen a castle before the Conquest, as in Domesday Book a number of\r\ntenements are stated to have belonged to the castle.  The present\r\nbuilding was probably reared after the Conquest, it being so like Rising\r\nCastle and others.  Roger Bigot very likely built it, and Thomas\r\nBrotherton repaired it in the reign of Edward I., as proved by his arms\r\nstill in the stone work.  Certain it is, from the time of Sweyn’s\r\nsettling in the city in 1010, and the Danes swarming hither in large\r\nnumbers, it rose almost at once to great importance, as appears from the\r\nSurvey in the reign of Edward the Confessor.  This is highly probable if\r\nwe believe the best authority on the subject, namely the _Saxon\r\nChronicle_, which states that the city rose from desolation, in 50 years,\r\nto be a place of great magnitude, far exceeding its former size.  The\r\nDanes came hither in such numbers that they became the parent stock of\r\nthe people of Norwich and Norfolk; and this is proved by the names of\r\nmany places in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nEdward the Confessor began his reign in 1041, and the Earldom of Norfolk\r\nwas given to Harold, son of Earl Godwin, who was afterwards king of\r\nEngland, and on his rebellion was seized by the king and given to Algar,\r\nson of Leofric, Earl of Chester, who resigned it again to Harold at his\r\nreturn; and in 1052, on the death of Earl Godwin, Harold, in recompense\r\nfor his generosity, gave Algar his earldom again; but he being banished\r\nin 1055, it came to the king, who pardoned him at Harold’s request, so\r\nthat he enjoyed it till his death, when it came again to the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nNorwich in the Norman Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Norman Conquest of England caused many changes in Norfolk and\r\nNorwich.  One of the immediate results of the invasion, in 1066, was a\r\nvast influx of foreigners into the county and city; and the pressure of\r\nthe Norman yoke was felt as much in Norwich as in any part of the\r\nkingdom.  It was about the same period that Jews began to settle here for\r\nthe first time, enriched by the extortions incident to a conquest, and,\r\nas Fuller says, “buying such oppressed Englishmen’s goods as Christians\r\ndid not care to meddle with.”\r\n\r\nWilliam the Conqueror caused a survey to be made of all the lands in the\r\ncountry, the register of which is called the DOMESDAY BOOK, and was\r\nfinished in 1081.  It is written in Roman with a mixture of Saxon, and is\r\nstill preserved in the chapter-house at Westminster, amongst the national\r\narchives.  It was printed in the 40th of George III. for the use of the\r\nmembers of both houses of parliament, and the public libraries of the\r\nkingdom.  It specifies the extent of the land in each district; the state\r\nit was in, whether meadow, pasture, wood, or arable; the name of the\r\nproprietor; the value, &c.  Domesday Book, p. 13, states:—\r\n\r\n    “In Norwic, in the time of King Edward, were 1320 burgesses, of whom\r\n    one was so much the king’s vassal, that he might not depart or do\r\n    homage (to any other) without his licence.  His name was Edstan; he\r\n    possessed 18 acres of land and 12 of meadow, and two churches in the\r\n    burgh and a sixth part of a third, and to one of these churches there\r\n    belonged one mansion in the burgh and six acres of meadow: these six\r\n    acres Roger Bigod holds by the king’s gift.  And of 1238 (of the said\r\n    burgesses) the king and the earl had soc, sac, and custom; and of 50\r\n    Stigand had the soc, sac, and patronage; and of 32 Harold had the\r\n    soc, sac, and patronage,” &c., &c.\r\n\r\nSoc, sac, and custom was the entire jurisdiction, for _soc_ is the power\r\nthat any man had to hold courts, wherein all that dwell on his land, or\r\nin his jurisdiction are answerable to do suit and service; _sac_ is the\r\nright of having all the amerciaments and forfeitures of such suitors; and\r\n_custom_ includes all other profits.  At this time, also, there were no\r\nfewer than 136 burgesses who were Frenchmen, and only six who were\r\nEnglish in the new burgh, which comprised the parishes of St. Giles’ and\r\nSt. Peter’s Mancroft.  The Dutch and the Flemings, about this time, came\r\nover the sea and located themselves in the city and county, and\r\nintroduced the worsted and other manufactures.\r\n\r\nWilliam I. gave the Earldom of the city of Norwich to Ralph de Guader,\r\nwho designed to wed the daughter of one William Fitz-Osbern, sister of\r\nRoger Earl of Hereford, and a relative of the king.  This matrimonial\r\nscheme not pleasing the king, it was prohibited, but barons in those days\r\nwould sometimes have a will of their own, and the fair affianced was made\r\na bride within the castle walls, whose doorway in an angle marks the site\r\nof the act of disobedience to the sovereign.  After the sumptuous feast,\r\nwith its attendant libations, a rebellion was planned by Waltheof, Earl\r\nof Northumberland, Huntingdon, and Northampton, and Roger, Earl of\r\nHereford.  Having carried the forbidden marriage into effect, they became\r\nbold in their language and designs, until a chorus of excited voices\r\njoined them in oaths as conspirators against their lord the king.\r\nTreachery revealed the plot, and the church lent its aid to the crown to\r\ncrush the rebels.  Lanfranc, then the primate and archbishop, sent out\r\ntroops, headed by bishops and justiciaries, the highest dignitaries of\r\nchurch and law, to oppose and besiege them.  The bridegroom fled for\r\nsuccour to his native Brittany, leaving his bride for three months to\r\ndefend the garrison with her retainers, at the end of which time the\r\nbrave Emma was forced to capitulate, but upon mild terms, obtaining leave\r\nfor herself and her followers to flee to Brittany.  Her husband became an\r\noutlaw, her brother was slain, and scarcely one guest present at that\r\nill-fated marriage feast escaped an untimely end.\r\n\r\nNor did the city go unscathed.  The devastation carried into its midst\r\nwas heavy; many houses were burnt, many were deserted by those who had\r\njoined the earl, and it is curious to read in the valuation of land and\r\nproperty, taken soon after this event, how many houses are recorded as\r\nvoid, both in the burgh or that part of the city under the jurisdiction\r\nof the king and earl, and in other portions, subject to other lords; for\r\nit would seem that the landlords of the soil on which the city stood were\r\nthe king or earl of the castle, the bishop, and the Harold family.\r\nClusters of huts were then built round the base of the hill, and\r\nconstituted the feudal village; its inhabitants consisting of villains,\r\nof which there were two classes, the husbandmen or peasants annexed to\r\nthe manor or land, and a lower rank described as villains in gross, or\r\nabsolute slaves, transferable by deed from one owner to another, the\r\nlives of these slaves being a continual state of toil, degradation and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nAfter the banishment of Earl Ralph, the king, having obtained possession\r\nof the castle, appointed Roger Bigod constable, with a limited power as\r\nbailiff, he having to collect the rents and revenues belonging to the\r\ncrown.  He retained these honours during the reign of the succeeding\r\nmonarch, William Rufus, though he joined in the fruitless attempt to\r\nplace that king’s elder brother, Robert Curthose, on the throne.  These\r\ntroubles were not ended till 1091, when the king made peace with his\r\nbrother Robert, agreeing that the lands of those who had assisted him\r\nshould be restored to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nNorwich in the Twelfth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT the commencement of this century, a considerable addition was made\r\nto the population of the city by a vast influx of Jews, who originally\r\ncame from Normandy, and were allowed to settle in England as chapmen for\r\nthe sale of confiscated goods.  They afterwards became numerous, and were\r\nso much in favour with William Rufus that he is said to have sworn, by\r\nSt. Luke’s face, his usual oath, that “If the Jews should overcome the\r\nChristians, he himself would become of their sect.”  In his reign the\r\npresent castle is supposed to have been built.\r\n\r\nHenry I., on his accession to the crown, met with great opposition from\r\nmany of the nobles who were in the interest of his elder brother, Robert,\r\nDuke of Normandy; but Roger Bigod strongly espousing his cause, became a\r\ngreat favourite.  In the first part of his reign, the king gave him\r\nFramlingham in Suffolk, and continued him Constable of the Castle till\r\nhis death.  He was succeeded by his son William Bigod, on whose decease\r\nHugh Bigod, his brother, who inherited his estate, was appointed Governor\r\nof the Castle.  In 1122, the king kept his Christmas in Norwich, when,\r\nbeing pleased with the reception he met with, he severed the government\r\nof the city from that of the castle, the constable of which had been\r\nheretofore the sole governor.  Henry I. granted the city a charter\r\ncontaining the same franchises as the city of London then enjoyed, and\r\nthe government of the city was then separated from that of the castle,\r\nthe chief officer being styled Propositus or Provost.  The liberties of\r\nthe city from the time of Henry I. to Edward III., were often suspended\r\nand gradually enlarged.  In 1403 the city was separated entirely from the\r\ncounty of Norfolk, under the name of the county and city of Norwich; and\r\nthe first Mayor was then elected by the citizens.  The old corporation\r\ngenerally comprised a dignified body of men, who maintained the\r\nhospitalities of the city.  Under the ancient charter the corporation of\r\nNorwich consisted of a mayor, recorder, steward, two sheriffs,\r\ntwenty-four aldermen, including the mayor, and sixty common councilmen.\r\nThe Municipal Reform Act transferred its government into the hands of a\r\nmayor, a sheriff, and a town council consisting of forty-eight\r\ncouncillors, and sixteen aldermen elected by the council, who unitedly\r\nelect the mayor and sheriff.  To these, and to a recorder, with an\r\nindefinite number of magistrates appointed by the crown, the government\r\nof the city is entrusted.\r\n\r\nKing Stephen, on his accession, granted the custody of the castle to his\r\nfavourite, Hugh Bigod, who was a principal instrument in advancing him to\r\nthe crown, by coming directly from Normandy where Henry I. died, and\r\naverring that he on his deathbed had disinherited his daughter Maud, the\r\nempress, and appointed Stephen, Earl of Bolyne, his heir.  The citizens,\r\ntherefore, taking this opportunity, used what interest they could with\r\nthe king to obtain a new charter, vesting the government of the city in\r\ncoroners and bailiffs instead of provosts; but the affair took a\r\ndifferent turn to what they expected, for the king, upon a distrust of\r\nBigod favouring the cause of the Empress Maud, seized the castle and all\r\nthe liberties of the city into his own hands, and soon afterwards granted\r\nto his natural son William, for an appanage or increase of inheritance,\r\nthe town and burgh of the city of Norwich, in which were 1238 burgesses\r\nwho held of the king in burgage tenure; and also the castle and burgh\r\nthereof, in which were 123 burgesses that held of the king in burgage,\r\nand also the royal revenue of the whole county of Norfolk, excepting what\r\nbelonged to the bishopric, &c.  The whole rent of the city, including the\r\nfee farm, was then about £700 per annum.  The king restored the city\r\nliberties for a fine in 1139.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King Stephen more Flemings came over; and these\r\nsuccessive immigrations were a real blessing to the land.  England had\r\nnot been a manufacturing country at all till the arrival of the Flemings,\r\nwho introduced the preparation and weaving of wool, so that, in process\r\nof time, not only the home market was abundantly supplied with woollen\r\ncloth, but a large surplus was made for exportation.  The Flemings were\r\nkinsmen of the Anglo-Saxon race, and were distinguished for that probity\r\nin their commercial dealings which afterwards became the characteristic\r\nof the English merchants at large.\r\n\r\nHenry II., in the first year of his reign, 1155, took the city, castle,\r\nand liberties from William, the natural son of Stephen; but, as a\r\nrecompense, restored to him all those lands which his father held in the\r\nreign of Henry I.  He also prevailed upon Hugh Bigod to yield up all his\r\ncastles, whereby the whole right became vested in the crown; the king\r\ngoverning the city by the sheriff, who paid the profits arising therefrom\r\ninto the exchequer.  About the year 1163 Hugh Bigod was restored to the\r\ntitle of the Earl of Norfolk, and at the same time appointed Constable of\r\nNorwich Castle, by which means he became sole governor of the city.  In\r\n1182, the citizens recovered the liberties of the city on paying a fine\r\nof 80 marks to the king.\r\n\r\nRichard I. was crowned September 4th, 1189, and a riot happened on\r\naccount of a Jew attempting to enter Westminster Hall contrary to the\r\nking’s express command.  Many of the Jews were killed, and their houses\r\nplundered and burnt.  A rumour was thereupon spread throughout the nation\r\nthat the king did not favour them, on which the people of Bury, Lynn, and\r\nNorwich, took occasion to rise and rob great numbers of them.  On\r\nNovember 27th following, Roger, son of Hugh Bigod, was created Earl of\r\nNorfolk, and steward of the king’s household.  By his means the city\r\nregained as ample a charter as London then possessed, for in 1193, the\r\nking granted the city in fee farm to the citizens and their heirs, for a\r\nfee farm rent of £180 yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nNorwich in the Thirteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING JOHN ascended the throne in 1193, and in a few years afterwards the\r\nbarons rebelled against him.  In 1215, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk,\r\njoined the insurgent barons.  The king seized the castle, expelled the\r\nearl, and appointed the Earl of Pembroke and John Fitz-Herbert Constables\r\nof the Castle.  Lewis, the Dauphin of France, having obtained a grant of\r\nthe kingdom from the pope, brought over a large force, ravaged the\r\ncounties of Norfolk and Suffolk, took the castle, and reduced the city.\r\nHe made William de Bellomonte his marshal and constable, and placed him\r\nwith a garrison within the castle walls.\r\n\r\nKing John granted two charters to the citizens, bestowing certain\r\nprivileges; and he came to the city in 1256, as is evident from the\r\nCharter of Liberties granted to the port of Yarmouth, it being dated\r\nMarch 25, 1256, by the king at Norwich.  On the same day he likewise\r\ngranted his third Charter to the city, bestowing certain commercial\r\nprivileges.  In 1265 Simon Montfort and his adherents seized all the\r\nking’s castles and committed the custody of them to their own friends,\r\nand having also gotten the king’s person into their power, they obliged\r\nhim to send letters to the sheriffs of counties, including Norfolk,\r\ncommanding them to oppose all attempts in favour of the king.  But the\r\nking having routed the barons at Eversham, removed all the constables\r\nwhich the confederates had appointed, and amongst the rest Roger Bigod;\r\nin whose stead, John de Vallibus, or Vaux, was made Constable of this\r\nCastle, and Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and soon afterwards, in\r\nconsequence of great disturbances in the city, he was ordered to enter\r\nit, and did so, notwithstanding its liberties.  In December, 1266, the\r\ndisplaced barons, headed by Sir John de Evile, entered the city and\r\nkilled many persons, imprisoned more, plundered the town, and carried\r\naway the wealthiest of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAccording to Blomefield, about this time, on a Good Friday, the Jews were\r\naccused of having crucified a boy, twelve years of age, named William;\r\nand the date of his alleged death, March 24th, was marked as a holiday.\r\nNo evidence is adduced that the crime was committed, and no motive is\r\nassigned for it.  The date of the year is not given, and the boy’s name\r\nbesides William is not stated.  The Jews denied the charge, but it was\r\ngenerally believed, and they were terribly persecuted.  The people then\r\nseized upon every pretence for robbing and plundering the poor Jews.  It\r\nis said that the crime was discovered by Erlward, a burgess, as they were\r\ngoing to bury the body in Thorpe Wood.  On this the Jews applied to the\r\nsheriff, and promised him 100 marks if he would free them from this\r\ncharge.  The sheriff sending for Erlward obliged him to swear that so\r\nlong as he lived he would never accuse the Jews nor discover the fact.\r\nAbout five years afterwards, Erlward, on his deathbed, made known the\r\nwhole affair, and the body, it is said, having been found in the wood,\r\nwas taken and buried in the churchyard of the monks.  They alleged that\r\nmany miracles were there wrought by it which occasioned its being removed\r\ninto the church and enshrined in the year 1150.\r\n\r\nEdward I. succeeded to the throne in 1272, and in the next year the king\r\nappointed Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, to be Constable of the Castle.\r\nThe interdict, which was removed on Christmas eve, was renewed on the day\r\nafter Epiphany, but was taken off till Easter, when it was renewed the\r\nthird time.  In 1274, the affair between the monks and citizens\r\ncontinuing unsettled, it was referred to the pope, who left it to the\r\ndecision of the king, who adjudged the citizens to pay 500 marks yearly\r\nfor six years, and to give the church a cup of the value of £100, and\r\nweighing 10 lbs. in gold.  The monks were to repair their gates and to\r\nhave access to all parts of the city, and some of the chief citizens were\r\nto go to Rome to beg the pope’s pardon.  These conditions being agreed\r\nto, the king restored to the city all its ancient privileges on payment\r\nof a fine of 40s. yearly, besides the old fee farm.  The interdict was\r\nalso removed on November 1st, 1275.  The king kept his Easter in the city\r\nin 1277, and he granted a new charter in 1285.  In 1289 the liberties\r\nwere seized, but were restored again at the end of the year.  Soon\r\nafterwards the king, while on a pilgrimage to Walsingham, granted a new\r\ncharter.  In 1296, the city first sent representatives to parliament,\r\noriginally four in number, who were paid for their services, but on\r\naccount of the expense the number was reduced to two members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nNorwich in the Fourteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN this century this city and other towns began to obtain political\r\nprivileges.  The kings of the middle ages found themselves obliged to\r\nsummon burgesses to parliament in order to obtain supplies.  The early\r\nparliaments appear to have been convened chiefly for this purpose, and\r\nwere constantly dissolved as soon as the business for which they met was\r\ntransacted.  Formerly the burgesses returned were always citizens, who\r\nreally were representatives of the city and its interests, and not merely\r\nsupporters of the ministry of the day.  There is no record of the early\r\nlocal elections, but lists will be given of the burgesses returned.\r\n\r\nEdward II. began his reign on July 7th, 1307, and he reigned nineteen\r\nyears.  Walter de Norwich, son of Jeffry de Norwich, was so much in\r\nfavour with the king as to be one of the Barons of the Exchequer in 1311,\r\nand in 1314 was summoned as a parliamentary baron, and afterwards made\r\nthe Treasurer of the Exchequer, which office he held several years.  He\r\nobtained liberty for free warren in all his demean lands, and a fair to\r\nthe manor of Ling in Norfolk, on July 20th, and two days following.  He\r\ncontinued in favour till his death.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III., A.D. 1328, the king, by a statute, made\r\nNorwich a staple town for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, by which\r\nthe trade of the city was much increased.  In the “Paston Letters” we\r\nfind the following reference to articles of Norfolk manufacture:\r\n\r\n    “I pray that you will send me hither two ells of worsted for\r\n    doublets, to happen me this cold winter, and that ye enquire where\r\n    William Paston bought his tippet of fine worsted which is almost like\r\n    silk, and if that be much finer that ye sh’d buy me, after seven or\r\n    eight shillings, then buy me a quarter and the nail thereof for\r\n    collars, though it be dearer than the other, for I would make my\r\n    doublet all worsted for the honour of Norfolk.”\r\n\r\nIn 1340, Norwich Castle was made the public prison for the county of\r\nNorfolk, and the custody thereof was committed to the sheriff.  A great\r\ntournament was held in Norwich, at which the king, with his queen\r\nPhillippa, was present; and they kept their court at the bishop’s palace.\r\nIn 1342 the king and queen honoured the city with another visit.\r\n\r\nIn 1344 a new charter was granted, by which the liberty of the castle was\r\nreduced to the outward limits of the present ditch, and so continues.  By\r\nthis charter, the citizens became proprietor’s of the ancient fee of the\r\ncastle, that is, the castle ditches, and the great croft, now the market\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Richard II., A.D. 1381, Wat Tyler’s rebellion broke out\r\nin London.  Insurrection became prevalent in many parts of the kingdom,\r\nmanufactures declined, and discontent became general.  Norwich and\r\nNorfolk shared in the general plunder at the hands of armed bands.  Under\r\nJohn Lyster, Litister, or Linster, a dyer, 50,000 men attacked the city\r\nand committed great depredations.  They were, however, pursued to North\r\nWalsham by the king’s troops under the command of Henry Le Spencer,\r\nBishop of Norwich, and defeated.  Their leader and many of his adherents\r\nwere taken and executed for high treason.  They were hung, drawn, and\r\nquartered, according to the barbarous usage of the times.  In 1399, the\r\nbailiffs having put the city into a proper posture of defence, openly\r\ndeclared for Henry Duke of Lancaster, son and heir of John of Gaunt, the\r\nlate deceased duke, their especial friend.  On this declaration, Henry\r\ngave them strong assurances that, whenever it was in his power, the\r\ncharter which they so earnestly desired for electing a mayor, &c., should\r\nbe granted them, and he was afterwards as good as his word.  The great\r\nconnection there was between John of Gaunt and this city, arose through\r\nWilliam Norwich, a knight, who was a friend of the Duke’s, and who\r\nfrequently visited the town, for which he always expressed great regard.\r\nIn 1389, the great John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, visited this city,\r\nand was honourably received.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of Henry IV., Sir Thomas Erpingham, knight, a Norfolk\r\nman, Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Lord Chamberlain, obtained the\r\nKing’s Charter, dated at Westminster, February 6th, 1399, confirming all\r\nthe former charters ever granted to the city.  In 1409, through the\r\ninterest of Sir Thomas, a grant was made to the city for a certain term\r\nof years of the alnage and survey of all manner of worsteds made in\r\nNorwich and Norfolk.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE’S COMPANY took its rise in the second half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and consisted of a society of brethren and sisters associated in\r\nhonour of the Martyr St. George, who by voluntary contributions supported\r\na chaplain to celebrate service every day in the cathedral before the\r\naltar, for the welfare of the brethren and sisters of the Guild, whilst\r\nliving, and of their souls when dead.  In this state they continued till\r\nthe fourth year of Henry V., when that prince granted them a charter\r\ndated at Reading, incorporating them by the name of the Aldermen,\r\nMasters, Brethren, and Sisters of the Fraternity and Guild of St. George\r\nin Norwich; and empowering them to choose yearly, one Alderman and two\r\nMasters, and to make all reasonable orders and constitutions for their\r\nown government; to have a common seal; to sue and be sued; and to\r\nmaintain a chaplain to pray daily for the health of the king, the\r\nalderman, masters, and sisters whilst alive, and their souls when dead;\r\nand lastly to purchase £10 per annum in mortmain.  The prior, mayor,\r\nsheriffs, and aldermen of the Guild, had power to expel or remove any\r\nmember for bad behaviour.  In consequence of this charter, ordinances\r\nwere made for the well-governing of the society, and for yearly choosing\r\none alderman, four masters, and twenty-four brethren, for the Assembly or\r\nCommon Council.  In 1451, by the mediation of Judge Yelverton, the\r\ndisputes between the Guild and the city were settled; when it was agreed\r\nthat the mayor for the time being should yearly, on the day after the\r\nGuild, be chosen Alderman of the Guild for the year following his\r\nmayoralty, that the Assembly of the Guild should consist of twenty\r\npersons, and that the common council of the city should be eligible for\r\nadmission into the company, but be liable to the charge of the feast.\r\nIndeed, the chief object of the Guild was feasting.  Every brother took\r\nan oath on admission.  The Aldermen and Common Council of the Guild had\r\npower to choose such men and women, inhabitants of the city, to be\r\nbrethren and sisters of the Guild, as they might think fit.  But no man\r\nliving out of the city could be chosen unless he was a knight, esquire,\r\nor gentleman of note.  Many other orders were made in regard to their\r\nprocession, which was always very grand.  This Guild, with the other\r\nancient crafts or companies of the city, made a very splendid appearance\r\non all public occasions.  The companies were then on the same footing as\r\nthose of the city of London now are, and some of the trades long\r\ncontinued as a fraternity, and chose wardens among themselves.  From the\r\nFriday after May day, to the Friday before the Guild day, the members of\r\nSt. George’s Company used to meet every evening at the Guildhall in the\r\nMarket Place, where they refreshed themselves with as much sack and sugar\r\nrolls as they pleased, besides two penny cakes from the baker’s.  Being\r\nthus assembled they sent for the last chosen feast-makers, and asked them\r\nwhether they intended to bear the charges of the feast, “which” (said\r\nthey) “will cost you more than you think.”  By this they so terrified\r\ntimorous, wary people, that they were persuaded to buy it off, though,\r\nhad they agreed to make the feast, it would not have cost them much more\r\nthan £6 or £7, which sum they were glad to save.  The Company continued\r\ntill February 24th, 1731, when the committee appointed for the purpose\r\nreported to an assembly held that day, that they had treated with St.\r\nGeorge’s Company, who had agreed to deliver up their charters, books, and\r\nrecords, into the hands of the corporation, provided the latter would pay\r\ntheir debts, amounting to £236 15s. 1d., which, being agreed to, they\r\nwere accordingly delivered up and deposited with the city records in the\r\nGuildhall.  Thus terminated this ancient feasting company by the\r\nsurrender of all their goods to the corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nNorwich in the Fifteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the commencement of this century (in 1402) the grand affair of\r\nobtaining a new charter occupied the greater part of the time of the\r\ncitizens, but as nothing could be done without the concurrence of Bishop\r\nSpencer, they at last found means to soften him, and to obtain his\r\npromise that he would not oppose them in this their favourite object.\r\nAll obstacles being now removed, they offered to lend Henry 1000 marks,\r\nwhich so far obliged the king that he was willing to give them as full a\r\ncharter as they could desire.  This was accordingly done, and the new\r\ncharter was granted on January 28th, 1403.  By this charter the city\r\nobtained a full power of local self-government.\r\n\r\nHenry V. began his reign on March 20th, 1412, in which year the city was\r\nin great disorder, occasioned by the disputes between the Mayor and the\r\nCommons, respecting the election of mayors, sheriffs, and other officers\r\nof the corporation, and the powers granted by the charter, concerning\r\nwhich they could not agree.  These contentions exhausted the city\r\ntreasury, and at length they were settled by the mediation of Sir Robert\r\nBerney, John Lancaster, William Paston, and others.  The burgesses who\r\nserved in Parliament in this reign were R. Brasier, R. Dunston, W.\r\nSedman, J. Biskelee, H. Rufman, W. Eton, J. Alderfold, W. Appleyard, R.\r\nBaxter, and Henry Peking.\r\n\r\nIn 1422 the doctrines of the Reformation were introduced into the city,\r\nand several persons were executed as Wickliffites or Lollards.  A large\r\nchalk pit, in Thorpe Hamlet, on the outskirts of the city, is to this day\r\ncalled “Lollards’ Pit.”\r\n\r\nHenry VI., when only nine months old, was proclaimed king on August 31st,\r\n1422, and in his reign a general persecution of the Lollards broke out in\r\nthis diocese.  The Lollards were men who earnestly desired the\r\nreformation of the church, and they were followers of that great and good\r\nman John Wickliffe, but they were called Lollards as a name of infamy.\r\nThey were so zealous for the truth that they chose rather to suffer\r\ngrievous torments and death than forsake their faith.  On this account\r\nabout 120 persons were persecuted for their profession of the pure gospel\r\nof Christ.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, 1448, the king paid a royal visit to the city, and among\r\nother preparations the gates were decorated, and the King’s arms, and the\r\narms of St. George, were painted and raised on six of the gates.  In\r\n1449, his Majesty paid another visit, after a sojourn with the Earl of\r\nSuffolk at Costessey.  The king entered Norwich by St. Benedict’s Gate,\r\nwhich was especially ornamented for the occasion.  These peaceable\r\nentries, with the picturesque pomp of a royal procession, always pleased\r\nthe loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nIn 1452, it being rumoured that Edward earl of March, son to the duke of\r\nYork, was advancing towards London, the queen, much terrified thereat,\r\ntried to make as many friends as she could, and for that purpose came to\r\nthis city, when, in full assembly, the Commons resolved to advance 100\r\nmarks as a loan to the king; and the aldermen at the same time presented\r\nthe queen with 60 marks, to which the Commons added 40 more, so that the\r\nking had now 200 marks of the city.  The citizens then obtained a new\r\ncharter, dated March 17th, and consented to in full parliament.  It\r\ncontained a restitution of all liberties, a general pardon of all past\r\noffences, and a confirmation of all former charters.\r\n\r\nIn 1460, during the contest between the houses of York and Lancaster, the\r\nmayor and aldermen raised forty armed men and the Commons eighty, and\r\nappointed Wm. Rookwood, Esq., their captain, with whom they agreed for\r\nsix weeks’ pay, at six-pence a day for each soldier, and sent them to the\r\nassistance of the king, who wrote them a letter of thanks, with a request\r\nthat they would maintain the soldiers for one month longer, which was\r\nreadily complied with.  In 1474, the king visited the city, and was\r\npresented with a sum of money by way of benevolence; but in the following\r\nyear the city had to pay £80 6s. 11d. for the forces employed in France.\r\n\r\nIn July 1469, Elizabeth Woodville, the queen of Edward IV., visited\r\nNorwich and remained here several days.  Her majesty, with a great\r\nretinue, entered the city through “Westwyk Gate,” which was decorated for\r\nthe occasion.  John Parnell was brought from Ipswich to exercise his\r\nskill in ornamentation; and under his superintendence, a stage covered\r\nwith red-and-green worsted was erected, adorned with figures of angels,\r\nescutcheons, and banners of the royal lady and the king, with a profusion\r\nof crowns, roses, fleur-de-lys, &c.  Gilbert Spurling exhibited a\r\nfragment of the salutation of Mary and Elizabeth, which required from him\r\na speech in explanation.\r\n\r\nIn 1486, being the 1st Henry VII., on the rebellion of Lambert Simnel,\r\nwho assumed the name of Edward Plantagenet, the king, expecting an\r\ninvasion of the eastern parts of his kingdom, made a progress through\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk to confirm the inhabitants in their loyalty, and\r\nspent his Christmas at Norwich, when the city made him a handsome\r\npresent.  Hence he went a pilgrimage to Walsingham, so famous for its\r\npretended miracles, where he made his vows; and after he returned\r\nvictorious, he sent his banner to be offered there as an acknowledgment\r\nof his prayers having been heard.\r\n\r\nThe monastic institutions of this city might claim the honour of having\r\nsome learned men connected with them in the 15th century.  Thomas\r\nBrinton, or Brampton, a monk of Norwich, attained to such an eminence in\r\nthe schools of England that his fame was spread abroad, and he was sent\r\nfor by the pope to Rome.  He often preached before the pope in Latin, and\r\nbeing first made his penitentiary was afterwards raised to the see of\r\nRochester.  His sermons preached before the pope were published, with\r\nsome others.  John Stow, who flourished in 1440, was a Benedictine monk\r\nof the monastery of St. Saviour, in Norwich, and doctor of divinity of\r\nOxford.  It appears, by his works, that he was at the council of Basil.\r\nHis works were _The Acts of the Council_ at Basil; various _Collections_;\r\nand _Solemn Disputations_, &c.  John Mear, a monk of Norwich, and D.D. of\r\nOxford, was a person of subtle art for explaining difficulties.  He was\r\ndivinity reader at several monasteries, and the author of several works,\r\nwhich have all been lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nNorwich in the Sixteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the commencement of this century most of the houses in the city were\r\nbuilt of wood with thatched roofs.  This accounts for the number of fires\r\nwhich broke out at different times, and which, in 1507 and 1509, reduced\r\na large portion of the city to ashes, no fewer than 718 houses being\r\nconsumed in the latter year.  These conflagrations induced the\r\ncorporation, in 1509, to issue an order that no newly-erected buildings\r\nin the city should be covered with thatch, but this injunction not\r\nextending to those previously erected, some few still retain this\r\ndangerous covering.\r\n\r\nIn 1501, John Rightwise, then mayor, began building the cross in the\r\nMarket Place, and finished it in 1503.  It was a commodious and handsome\r\npile, but falling into decay, it was sold by the Tonnage Committee in\r\n1732 for £125, and soon afterwards it was taken down.  About 1506, St.\r\nAndrew’s Church was built, near the site of the old church of St.\r\nChristopher.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. began his reign on April 22nd, 1509, when the city was in a\r\nstate of great distraction, on account of the terrible fires which caused\r\nmuch destruction of property.  In that year a great part of the\r\ncathedral, with its vestry, and all the ornaments and books were\r\ndestroyed by a fire, which broke out on St. Thomas’ night.  In 1515, the\r\nLady Mary, sister to the king, and her consort the Duke of Suffolk,\r\nvisited the city on their return from France, and were nobly entertained.\r\nHenry VIII., while he continued a papist, burned the reformers; and when\r\nin a fit of anger he disowned the pope and assumed the English tiara, he\r\nwas no less zealous against both Papist and Puritan, who would not bind\r\ntheir consciences to his royal decrees.  During the prelacy of Richard\r\nNykke or Nix, the bigotted bishop of Norwich, several church reformers\r\nwere burnt here and at other places.\r\n\r\nIn 1517, Cardinal Wolsey visited the city to mediate between the citizens\r\nand the monks, but their disputes were not finally settled till 1524,\r\nwhen the jurisdiction of the convent was ascertained and separated from\r\nthat of the corporation until 1538, when they were converted into a dean\r\nand chapter.\r\n\r\nOn March 2nd, 1520, Queen Catherine and Cardinal Wolsey visited the city,\r\nand all the city companies went to meet the queen “in Puke and Dirke\r\nTawney Liveries,” and the city presented her with 100 marks.\r\n\r\nIn 1522, in consequence of the many vexatious suits in the Sheriff’s\r\nCourt for words and trifling debts, it was agreed that four aldermen be\r\nnamed, one out of each of the great wards, to sit in person, or by\r\ndeputies, every Wednesday, from eight till nine in the morning, to adjust\r\nall debts under two shillings, and all actions on words, for the ease and\r\npeace of the city.  This institution was of great benefit, and in some\r\nmeasure answered the purpose of the old Court of Conscience.\r\n\r\nIn 1524, on September 2nd, through the mediation of Cardinal Wolsey, a\r\ncomposition and final agreement was sealed between the prior and the city\r\nat the Guildhall, by which the city resigned all jurisdiction within the\r\nwalls of the priory, the whole site thereof being hereby acknowledged to\r\nbe part of the County of Norfolk and in the Hundred of Blofield; and the\r\nchurch gave up all right of jurisdiction in every place without their\r\nwalls and within the walls of the city; so that now, Tombland, with the\r\nfairs kept thereon, and all things belonging to those fairs—and\r\nHolmstrete, Spytelond, and Ratten Row, with their letes—were adjudged to\r\nbelong to the city, and to be part of the county thereof.  The prior and\r\nconvent and their successors were also exempted from all tolls, customs,\r\nand exactions whatever, by land or water in the whole city, or county of\r\nthe city and its liberties, for goods or chattels bought or sold for the\r\nuse of the prior and convent, their households, or families.\r\n\r\nIn 1525 the king granted the city another charter, confirmed likewise by\r\nparliament, in which the late composition and agreement between the city\r\nand prior was fully recited and established, and new privileges were\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nIn 1530 the king was declared supreme head of the church of England; and\r\nwas acknowledged so by act of parliament in 1535.  In the latter year an\r\nact was passed for recontinuing liberties in the crown, by which all\r\ncities, boroughs, and towns corporate, had their liberties and privileges\r\nfully confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILNEY’S MARTYRDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA short account of the martyrdom of Thomas Bilney, in 1531, may serve to\r\nillustrate the persecuting spirit of the age.  He had renounced the\r\ntenets of the Church of Rome, and was condemned on the following passages\r\nextracted from two sermons which he had preached in 1527, at Ipswich.\r\n\r\n    “Our Saviour Christ is our Mediator between us and the Father; what\r\n    need have we therefore for any remedy from saints?  It is a great\r\n    injury to the blood of Christ to make such petitions, and blasphemeth\r\n    our Saviour.”\r\n\r\n    “Man is so imperfect by himself, that he can in no wise merit by his\r\n    own deeds.”\r\n\r\n    “The coming of Christ was long prophesied before, and desired by the\r\n    prophets; but John Baptist, being more than a prophet, did not only\r\n    prophesy, but with his finger shewed Him, saying, ‘_Behold the Lamb\r\n    of God_, _which taketh away the sins of the world_.’  Then, if this\r\n    was the very Lamb which John did demonstrate, that taketh away the\r\n    sins of the world, what injury is it to our Saviour Christ, that to\r\n    be buried in St. Francis’ cowl should remit four parts of penance?\r\n    What is then left to our Saviour Christ, which taketh away the sins\r\n    of the world?  This I will justify to be a great blasphemy to the\r\n    blood of Christ.”\r\n\r\n    “It is great folly to go on pilgrimages; and preachers in times past\r\n    have been antichrists; and now it hath pleased God somewhat to shew\r\n    forth their falsehoods and errors.”\r\n\r\n    “The miracles done at Walsingham, Canterbury, and Ipswich, were done\r\n    by the devil through the sufferance of God, to blind the poor people;\r\n    and the Pope hath not the keys that St. Peter had, except he\r\n    followeth Peter in his living.”\r\n\r\n    “Christian people should set up no lights before images of saints,\r\n    for saints in heaven need no lights, and images have no eyes to see;\r\n    and, therefore, as Ezechias destroyed the brazen serpent that Moses\r\n    made by the commandment of God, even so should the kings and princes\r\n    of these times destroy and burn the images of saints set up in\r\n    churches.”\r\n\r\nIt was further deposed against Bilney, that he was notoriously suspected\r\nto be a heretic, and that in his sermons he had exhorted the people to\r\nput away their gods of silver and gold, and to desist from offering to\r\nthem either candle, wax, money, or any other thing; and that in\r\nrehearsing the litany he said, “pray you only to God and no saints;” and\r\nwhen he came to that part, Sancta Maria, &c., or, O Saint Mary pray for\r\nus, he called out, “stop there.”\r\n\r\nThese and many other articles of the like nature being proved, he was\r\nexhorted to recant and abjure them; and upon his refusing to do so, the\r\nBishop of London, having pulled off his cap, and made the sign of the\r\ncross on his forehead and breast, pronounced the following sentence:—\r\n\r\n    “I, by the counsel and consent of my brethren here present, do\r\n    pronounce thee, Thomas Bilney, who has been accused of divers\r\n    articles, to be convicted of heresy; and for the rest of the sentence\r\n    we will deliberate till to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Bilney was again asked whether he would recant and return to\r\nthe unity of the church; when he desired a day or two for consideration\r\nand to consult his friends.  In fear of a dreadful death at the\r\nexpiration of the time, he subscribed his abjuration; and being absolved,\r\nhe had the following penance enjoined him; to bear a faggot at the\r\nprocession at St. Paul’s, bareheaded, and to stand before the preacher\r\nduring the sermon there, and to remain in prison till he should be\r\nreleased by Cardinal Wolsey.  When in prison, the reflection on what he\r\nhad done drove Bilney almost to despair, and he suffered all the agonies\r\nof remorse for more than twelve months.\r\n\r\nAt length he resolved to seal that truth which he had so shamefully\r\nabjured, with his blood.  For this purpose he travelled to Norwich, and\r\non his way to the city he openly preached those doctrines for which he\r\nhad been condemned; and being apprehended, was confined in one of the\r\ncells under the Guildhall.  On August 19th, he was taken to Lollards’\r\npit, outside of Bishopsgate, and burnt there in the presence of a crowd\r\nof horrified spectators.\r\n\r\nThis and many other instances may serve to show the persecuting spirit of\r\na church which had arrogated to itself a dominion over the consciences of\r\nmen, and dared to propagate a religion of fear as the religion of Christ.\r\nAfter the Reformation, which had now begun, the same persecuting spirit\r\nwas manifested by the Church of England; and many suffered here for their\r\nnonconformity to the Establishment.  Several other martyrs were burnt in\r\nNorwich during the same reign, and in 1539, one William Leyton, a monk of\r\nEye, in Suffolk, was burnt here, for speaking against a certain idol\r\nwhich used to be carried about in procession at Eye; and for asserting\r\nthat the sacrament ought to be administered in both kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the same year peace and amity were settled between the church and the\r\ncity on a much more stable foundation than had been previously effected,\r\nby an arrangement as to jurisdictions of the authorities.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn 1534 an act was passed for rebuilding those parts of the city which\r\nwere laid waste by the late fires; by which it was enacted that if the\r\nowners of such void grounds should, by the space of two years after\r\nproclamation made by the mayor for all persons to rebuild or enclose\r\ntheir grounds, neglect to rebuild on such ground, or sufficiently enclose\r\nthe same with mortar and stone, then it should be lawful for the mayor,\r\netc., to enter on such vacant grounds, and hold and retain them to their\r\nown use and their successors’ use for ever, discharged of all rents and\r\noutgoings whatsoever, provided that, within two years after such entry\r\nmade, they either rebuild or enclose them as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, in giving an account of the state of society in the middle ages, we\r\nwere to omit from our enumeration of causes the vast influence of the\r\nclergy of the church of Rome, we should present a very imperfect view of\r\nthe subject.  The priests dominated over the minds of men for many\r\ncenturies, and their influence either for good or evil pervaded all\r\nclasses of society.  This influence caused the erection of monasteries,\r\nnunneries, priories, and friaries, nineteen in number, in Norwich before\r\nthe 16th century.  Monastic institutions were originally beneficial to\r\nsociety.  In the dark ages, they preserved learning to some extent, and\r\nwere houses of refuge for the destitute.  No doubt there were many good\r\nself-denying men and women amongst the monks and nuns, who did some\r\nservice to the poor who then abounded in the land.  But in time the\r\nmonasteries sunk for the most part into dissolute confraternities; stupid\r\nand sleepy, where not vicious; and banded together against the liberties\r\nof the nation; and there were constant broils between the monks and the\r\ncitizens in Norwich.\r\n\r\nThe king having entirely renounced the authority of the church of Rome,\r\nand assumed the title of Head of the Church of England, caused a very\r\nstrict inquiry to be instituted into the state of all monastic\r\ninstitutions.  This inquiry resulted in their suppression, more for the\r\ngratification of the monarch’s avarice than from his desire to benefit\r\nhis subjects; and most of the monks in Norwich and Norfolk, as well as in\r\nother parts of England, were sent adrift with small pensions.  The king,\r\nindeed—in revenge for being excommunicated by the pope—suppressed 1148\r\nmonasteries in England, whose revenues amounted to £183,707 yearly.  He\r\neither seized the property for himself or divided it amongst his\r\nfavourites, and the Duke of Norfolk obtained a great part of it in\r\nNorwich.  The dissolution of those ancient institutions caused a great\r\ndeal of poverty; the priests were driven out homeless over the land, and\r\nthe poor had no houses of refuge and no means of relief.\r\n\r\nIn 1538, Thomas Cromwell, lord privy seal, the king’s vicegerent, sent\r\ninjunctions to all bishops and curates, charging them to take care that\r\nan English bible of the largest size be placed open in each parish\r\nchurch, for every one to have recourse to.  The open bible was generally\r\nread in this city and elsewhere, and this, no doubt, promoted the\r\nreformation of religion.  In spite of the tyranny of kings, the\r\ndomination of priests, and the superstition of the people, the\r\nReformation still advanced, and the national mind was emancipated by\r\ndegrees from ancient thraldom.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn 1545, one Rogers, of Norfolk, was condemned and suffered martyrdom,\r\nfor opposing the six articles of an act passed for abolishing diversity\r\nof opinions in religion.  This act inflicted the penalty of death upon\r\nthose—1st, who by word or writing denied transubstantiation; 2nd, who\r\nmaintained that communion in both kinds was necessary; 3rd, or asserted\r\nthat it was lawful for priests to marry; 4th, or that vows of chastity\r\nmight be broken; 5th, or that private masses are profitable; 6th, or that\r\nauricular confession is not necessary to salvation.\r\n\r\nThe king died on the 28th January, 1546; and his exequies were celebrated\r\nhere with great pomp, as appears from the chamberlain’s account; though\r\nwhat good he ever did for the city it would be hard to say.  He was a\r\nking who spared no man in his anger and no woman in his lust.  In his\r\nreign, 72,000 persons were hung for political offences or for the crime\r\nof poverty as a warning to others.  The “Merry England” of those days was\r\nin fact a terrible country to live in.  Men were beaten, scourged,\r\nbranded with hot irons, and killed without mercy or limit.\r\n\r\nEdward VI. was proclaimed king on January 28th, 1546; and on February\r\n25th, his coronation was celebrated with much pomp in Norwich, where\r\ngreat rejoicings took place.  Six large guns were fired on Tombland; the\r\npopulace were treated with plenty of beer; and bonfires were lighted in\r\nseveral of the streets.  There was a grand procession with a pageant, in\r\nwhich the king was represented by an effigy of king Solomon.\r\n\r\nOn March 8th, 1546, Edward VI., and the executors of his deceased father,\r\ngranted to the mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and commonalty, the hospital of\r\nSt. Giles’ in this city, now called the Old Men’s hospital, with all the\r\nrevenues belonging thereto for the maintenance of poor people dwelling\r\ntherein, all which the late king had promised to give them at the request\r\nof the citizens, a short time before his death.\r\n\r\nNorwich has always been noted for its civic feasts and good cheer; and\r\nBale, writing at this time (1549), in his “Continuation of Leland’s\r\nAntiquities,” says:—\r\n\r\n    “Oh, cytie of England, whose glory standeth more in belly chere than\r\n    in the searche of wisdome godlye, how cometh it that neither you nor\r\n    yet your ydell masmongers have regarded this most worthy commodytie\r\n    of your countrye?  I mean the conservacyon of your antiquyties, and\r\n    of the worthy labours of your learned men.  I thynke the renowne of\r\n    such a notable act would have much longer endured than of all your\r\n    belly banquettes and table triumphes, either yet of your newly\r\n    purchased hawles, to keep St. George’s feast in.”\r\n\r\nAnd again he says:—\r\n\r\n    “I have been also at Norwyche, our second cytie of name, and there\r\n    all the library monuments are turned to the use of their grossers,\r\n    candelmakers, sope sellers, &c.”\r\n\r\nSmall credit is here given to the city for the patronage and promotion of\r\nintellectual pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nKETT’S REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1549 the city was the scene of an insurrection resembling that of the\r\nJacquerie in France, and the War of the Peasants in Germany.  The facts\r\nof this local rebellion were simple enough.  The poor people objected to\r\nthe enclosure of waste lands, in the neighbourhood of Attleborough and\r\nWymondham, by the nobility and gentry, who had been put in possession of\r\nthe abbey lands, which had been previously appropriated for the use of\r\nthe poor, who still considered that they had a right of commonage on the\r\nwaste lands and open pastures.  The rebellion commenced at Eccles, Wilby,\r\nAttleborough, and the neighbouring villages, the inhabitants of which\r\nwere enraged at Mr. John Green, lord of the manor of Wilby, who had\r\nenclosed that part of the common belonging to his manor, which had from\r\ntime immemorial been open to the adjoining commons of Hargham and\r\nAttleborough, and in which the people had enjoyed all rights of\r\nintercommoning with each other.  The people continued quiet till\r\nWymondham fair, on July 7th, when they collected in large numbers.  The\r\nleaders of the movement, accompanied by a large number of others, went to\r\nMorley, about a mile from Wymondham, and laid open the new enclosures;\r\nand on returning to Wymondham, they destroyed all the fences by which the\r\ncommons and wastes were enclosed.  John Flowerdew, of Hethersett,\r\nincensed at the destruction of his fences, gave forty pence to a number\r\nof the country people to throw down the fences of Robert Kett, alias\r\nKnight, whose pasture lay near Wymondham Fairstead.  They carried out his\r\nwishes to the full, and on the following morning returned to Hethersett,\r\nwhere, at Kett’s instigation, they laid open other enclosures of\r\nFlowerdew’s.  After this, the rioters appointed Robert Kett and his\r\nbrother William, a butcher, to be their captains, and the movement soon\r\nassumed the form of an organized rebellion.  The numbers of the rebels\r\nquickly increased, and marching on Mousehold Heath, they took possession\r\nof the mansion of the Earl of Surrey; and thence proceeded to lay siege\r\nto the city.  They held courts of justice under a large tree, called the\r\n“Oak of Reformation:” and having augmented their numbers to 16,000 from\r\nthe citizens, and strongly fortified their camp, they summoned the city\r\nto surrender.  For months they maintained hostilities, and the country\r\nround was pillaged and laid waste, until at length they gained an\r\nentrance to the city, and took the mayor and several councillors\r\nprisoners to their camp.  A strong force was thereupon sent down for the\r\ndefence of the city, under the Marquis of Northampton, and a regular\r\nbattle was fought at the base of the hill on St. Martin’s Palace Plain.\r\nIn this engagement Lord Sheffield was slain; and the rebels, having\r\nforced the Marquis to retreat, plundered the city, and set fire to it in\r\nmany parts.  In short, all attempts to quell this violent insurrection\r\nwere ineffectual, till a large army, which had been raised to proceed\r\nagainst the Scots, was ordered to march to the relief of Norwich, under\r\nthe command of the Earl of Warwick, who arrived under the city walls on\r\nthe 23rd of August.  On the following day, after making an ineffectual\r\noffer of pardon to the insurgents, on the condition that they should lay\r\ndown their arms, the king’s troops commenced their attack; and having\r\nmade several breaches in the walls, and forced open some of the gates,\r\nthey soon entered the city, and took possession of the Market Place.  In\r\nthe midst of this scene of blood, the king’s ammunition carriages, having\r\nentered apart from the main body of the army, were captured by the enemy,\r\nbut were soon retaken by a detachment from the Market Place.  A large\r\nbody of the rebels still remaining in the city now made a lodgement on\r\nTombland, and through their superior local knowledge, greatly annoyed the\r\nsoldiers by posting small parties at the angles of the different streets\r\nleading to the Market.  The Earl of Warwick, however, brought out his\r\nwhole force to scour the city, and the rebels, after setting fire to\r\ntheir camp, were obliged to quit their post on the hill and retreat to\r\nDussyn’s Dale, on Mousehold, resolving to finish the business by a\r\ngeneral engagement in the valley.\r\n\r\nOn August 27th, being re-enforced by a newly-arrived detachment of\r\ntroops, the Earl marched out of the city to attack the rebels, to whom he\r\nagain offered pardon, provided they would quietly lay down their arms;\r\nbut, confident in their numbers, they refused to capitulate.  A bloody\r\nconflict ensued, but the rebels, being unaccustomed to the discharge of\r\nartillery, were soon in confusion.  Of this the Light Horse took\r\nadvantage, and advancing to the charge, drove the rebels from the field\r\nand pursued them with great slaughter.  Over 3000 were killed, and about\r\n300 of the ringleaders were afterwards executed.  The gates of the city\r\nsuffered much damage during this insurrection.  The rebels set Bishop’s\r\ngate on fire, with some of the houses in the street, and those belonging\r\nto the Great Hospital.  Pockthorpe, Magdalen, St. Augustine, Coslany, and\r\nBer Street gates, shared the same fate.  When the disturbances ceased,\r\nthe repair of the city generally was commenced, and especially of the\r\ngates.  Outside Magdalen Gates a gallows was erected, at which place and\r\nat the cross in the Market Place 300 rebels were executed.  Two, styled\r\nprophets, were hanged, drawn, and quartered, their heads being placed on\r\nthe towers, and their quarters on the gates.\r\n\r\nRobert and William Kett were tried in London for high treason and\r\nrebellion, and convicted.  On November 29th, they were delivered to Sir\r\nEdmund Windham, High Sheriff of the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, to\r\nreceive punishment.  Robert was conveyed to Norwich, and being brought to\r\nthe foot of the castle, was drawn up to a gibbet erected at the top, and\r\nthere left hanging alive till he died by famine; and his body, being\r\nentirely wasted, at length fell down.  A similar sentence was executed\r\nupon William, who was suspended alive upon the top of Wymondham steeple.\r\nThis fearful rebellion having been thus brought to an end, the citizens,\r\nafter the departure of the kings troops, began to repair the damages to\r\nthe walls and gates.  Unhappily, however, their trials were not yet over,\r\nfor the late disastrous occurrences were followed by such a scarcity and\r\ndearness of provisions, that the corporation issued an edict, requiring\r\nall the wealthier inhabitants to find corn for their own households\r\nelsewhere, so that their poorer neighbours might have the exclusive\r\nbenefit of the city markets.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Princess Mary was proclaimed here on July 18th, 1553, and was the\r\nfirst English Queen in her own right, and the people of Norwich and\r\nNorfolk rushed to her standard, impelled by the memory of Kett’s\r\nrebellion.  The queen was a bigoted Roman Catholic, and in her reign\r\npopery was revived in its worst form, associated with all the atrocities\r\nof the most sanguinary persecution.  Protestants were gathered like fuel\r\nfor burning; and as for the Puritans, no fate could be too severe for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1556, William Carman, of Hingham, was burnt in Lollards’ pit,\r\noutside of Bishop’s Gate.  He was charged with being an obstinate\r\nheretic, and actually having in his possession a bible, a testament, and\r\nthree psalters in the English tongue.\r\n\r\nOn July 13th, of the same year, Simon Miller, merchant of Lynn, and\r\nElizabeth Cooper, a pewterer’s wife, of the parish of St. Andrew, were\r\nburnt together in Lollards’ pit.  On August 5th, Richard Crashfield, of\r\nWymondham, Thomas Carman, William Seaman, and Thomas Hudson, were burnt\r\nfor heresy in the same place.\r\n\r\nOn July 10th, 1557, Richard Yolman, a devout old minister, seventy years\r\nof age, was burnt for heresy.  He had been curate to that learned and\r\npious martyr, Mr. Taylor, of Hadleigh.\r\n\r\nAs if a judgment had come on the country for such atrocities, the quartan\r\nague and a new sickness soon afterwards raged so violently, that it was\r\nsaid that “fire, sword, and pestilence,” had swept away a third part of\r\nthe men of England; and it is recorded that ten of the Norwich aldermen\r\nfell victims to the latter scourge.\r\n\r\nDuring this short reign, the city was afflicted by the presence of those\r\nmerciless persecutors, Bishop Hopton and Chancellor Dunnings, at whose\r\ninstigation several martyrs to the reformed religion were burnt here in\r\n1557 and 1558.  Happily the career of this bigoted, blood-thirsty,\r\npriest-ridden queen, was cut short, and a new and brighter era dawned\r\nupon the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis queen ascended the throne on Nov. 7th, 1558, and was proclaimed here\r\non the 17th of the same month.  She was a zealous promoter of the\r\nReformation.  The form of worship used in the churches was similar to\r\nthat in the time of Edward VI.; but the protestants were almost as\r\nintolerant in this reign as the Romanists had been before, though they\r\nclaimed the right of private judgment; and the principle of toleration\r\nwas not recognised for centuries by any church, or sect, or party.\r\n\r\nIn 1561, on the Guild day, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Earls of\r\nNorthumberland and Huntingdon, with many other nobility and gentry, dined\r\nwith the Mayor, William Mingay, Esq., in St. Andrew’s Hall, which could\r\nscarcely contain the company and their retinue.  The entertainment is\r\nsaid to have been very magnificent, and the expense of the feast amounted\r\nto 32s. 9d.\r\n\r\nIn 1565, the prosperity of the city, which had begun to decline, was\r\nagain revived by the settling here of 330 Flemings and Walloons, who had\r\nfled from the Netherlands, from the rigid persecution under the\r\nsanguinary Duke of Alva.  In 1570, by the fostering encouragement of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, the number of these foreign settlers had increased to\r\n3925, and by the introduction of bombazine, and other manufactures, they\r\ncontributed much to the wealth and prosperity of Norwich.\r\n\r\nDuring the long reign of Elizabeth, numerous conspiracies were formed for\r\nthe re-establishment of Popery, and in 1570, John Throgmorton, Thomas\r\nBrooke, and G. Redman, were hanged and quartered here for having joined\r\nin these traitorous enterprises.  In 1572, the Duke of Norfolk and\r\nseveral other noblemen were attainted and beheaded for similar offences,\r\nat London, York, and other places.  The Duke not only espoused the cause\r\nof Mary, Queen of Scots, but even offered to marry that Roman Catholic\r\nPrincess.\r\n\r\nIn 1574, a rumour was spread of invasion by the so-called invincible\r\nArmada.  Norwich, towards the general defence, exhibited on its muster\r\nroll 2120 able men, of whom 400 were armed; the total number enrolled in\r\nthe whole county of Norfolk, being at the same time, 6120 able men, of\r\nwhom 3630 were armed.  Happily there was no occasion for their services,\r\nthe Armada being destroyed by a storm at sea.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth made a progress through Suffolk and Norfolk, from the\r\n16th to the 22nd August, 1578.  She came on horseback from Ipswich to\r\nNorwich, though she had several coaches in her train; and she lodged in\r\nthe Bishop’s Palace.  For several days she was entertained by splendid\r\npageantries, principally allusive to the trade and manufactures of the\r\ncity.  Whilst here she dined publicly in the North Alley of the Cathedral\r\nCloister, and often went a hunting on horseback, and to witness wrestling\r\nand shooting on Mousehold heath.  The city records contain full details\r\nof the pageantries on the occasion of the royal visit.  In no other city\r\nwas the Queen received with greater cordiality and pageantry than in\r\nNorwich.  The corporation, the inhabitants, the clergy, with the nobility\r\nand gentry of the county, contributed largely to afford the royal lady as\r\npleasant and costly a reception as should be pleasing to her as a\r\nspectacle, and demonstrative of exuberant loyalty.  This joy was soon\r\nturned into mourning; for, says a record known as the _Norwich Roll_,\r\n“The trains of Her Majesty’s carriage being many of them infected, left\r\nthe plague behind them, which afterwards increased and contynued, as it\r\nraged about a year and three quarters.”  Nearly 5000 fell victims to this\r\ndreadful malady.\r\n\r\nIn 1578, Matthew Hamond, of Hethersett, wheelwright, a heretic and\r\nblasphemer, being convicted of reviling the queen and of denying the\r\nauthority of the Scriptures, the Godhead, the atonement of our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, and the existence of the Holy Ghost, was set in the pillory on\r\nMay 13th, and both his ears were nailed.  Afterwards, on May 20th, he was\r\nburnt in the castle ditch.  In 1587 and 1588 Francis Knight and Peter\r\nCole, of Ipswich, were burnt in the same place for their deistical\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation was not only stayed, but thrown backward by this\r\narbitrary, despotic queen.  Though she was well disposed to reformation\r\nin the abstract, yet the fear of popish influence and a jealousy for her\r\necclesiastical authority over the church, made her act in the spirit of\r\nthe worst excesses of popery.  She persecuted all who disputed her\r\nauthority in religious matters.  In vain did the exiles return, hoping\r\nfor peace and “freedom to worship God.”  The expulsion of a multitude of\r\nclergy, who refused to conform to many impositions, and the many\r\nhardships suffered by the puritans, especially in Norfolk and Suffolk,\r\nevinced that no concession was to be expected from her.  Her great idol\r\nwas perfect uniformity.  To enforce it, she passed many laws, which made\r\nnonconformity worse than felony, and she treated the Puritan as a rebel\r\nagainst all authority, both human and divine.  A beautiful “Memorial” of\r\nthe ministers of Norfolk is still preserved in vindication of their\r\nloyalty, and in advocacy of greater liberty of conscience.  The result of\r\nit, however, was that seven or eight of them were suspended in Norwich.\r\nBut instead of this being the means of stopping the progress of\r\nPuritanism, the sincere inquirers after truth were incited by such harsh\r\nmeasures to fresh investigations, and more emboldened to declare their\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nIn 1582, on a second return made of the strangers settled here, they were\r\nfound to be 1128 men; 1358 women; 815 children, strangers born; 1378\r\nchildren, English born; in all 4679.  The whole population was about\r\n15,000, and the citizens continued to return burgesses to parliament from\r\ntime to time, but not so frequently as in former reigns.  During this\r\nreign William Kemp, a comic actor of high reputation, and greatly\r\napplauded for his buffoonery, danced a morris dance all the way from\r\nLondon to Norwich in nine days, and was accompanied by crowds of people\r\nas he passed on from town to town.  When he arrived in Norwich he was\r\nvery kindly treated by the citizens, who turned out to meet him in large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nNORWICH PAGEANTS were celebrated during the middle ages, and occupy a\r\nlarge space in the records of the corporation.  Books of the several\r\ncompanies relating to the pageants have been lost except that of St.\r\nGeorge, but some additional information has come to light on the subject.\r\nA series of extracts were made early in the last century from the\r\nGrocers’ book, showing the proceedings and expenditure of that company in\r\nregard to their pageants from 1534 to 1570, and also the versions of the\r\nplays in 1533 and in 1563.  All the plays of that period were called\r\nmysteries or miracle plays, and were founded on bible history.  The play\r\nwas performed in a carriage called a “House of Waynscott, painted and\r\nbuilded on a cart with fowre whelys.”  Painted cloths were hung about it,\r\nand it was drawn by four horses, “having head stalls of brode inkle with\r\nknoppes and tassels.”  The vehicle had a square top with a large vane in\r\nthe midst, and one for the end, and a large number of smaller ones.  The\r\ncompany was evidently unable to afford the cost of four horses in 1534;\r\nonly one was hired, and four men attended on the pageant with “Lewers.”\r\nOne of the plays was called “Paradyse,” and was performed by the Grocers\r\nand Raffmen.  It begins much in the same manner as the Coventry play,\r\nwith God the Father relating the planting of the garden of Eden, the\r\ncreation of man and placing him there, and God’s intention to create\r\nwoman.  The other characters are Lucifer, Adam, and Eve, who exhibit the\r\nincidents related in Genesis.  Of the good taste or propriety of these\r\nentertainments any observation is needless.  They formed a remarkable\r\nfeature in the life of the middle ages, and show the childishness of the\r\npeople.  The dialogues in all these plays are puerile doggerel.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMINENT CITIZENS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Legge_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew of the citizens of Norwich could make any pretensions as to birth,\r\nwhatever they might say about their birth-place.  Among the natives of\r\nthis city of obscure parentage may be mentioned Thomas Legge, LL.D., who\r\nwas educated in Trinity College, where he was fellow, as also at Jesus\r\nCollege, till he was chosen by Dr. Kaye as second master of Kaye’s\r\nCollege.  He was Dean of the Arches, one of the Masters of Chancery,\r\ntwice Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and thirty-four\r\nyears Master of Kaye’s College.  Justus Lipsius eulogised him as a very\r\nexcellent antiquary, and as an oracle of learning.  He was a great\r\nbenefactor to this college, bequeathing £600 for the building of the east\r\npart thereof, besides several lesser liberalities.  Thomas Bacon, the\r\nfifteenth Master of Gonville Hall, had done great damage to it, and left\r\nit in debt; but Dr. Legge and his two successors repaired all losses,\r\nacting not so much like the masters as the stewards of the house.  Dr.\r\nLegge was the author of two tragedies, namely, “The Destruction of\r\nJerusalem,” and “The Life of King Richard III.,” which last was performed\r\nbefore Queen Elizabeth, with great applause, in St. John’s College Hall.\r\nThe doctor died July 12th, 1607, leaving the college his heir, and he was\r\nburied in it, so that he left his native city only the barren honour of\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kaye_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Kaye, or as he is sometimes called, Caius, was born at Norwich in\r\n1510, and studied in Gonville Hall, Cambridge, from which he removed to\r\ntravel abroad.  He took his degree of M.D. in the University of Padua.\r\nIn the reign of Edward VI. he was appointed principal physician at court,\r\na place which he enjoyed under both the Queens Mary and Elizabeth.  The\r\nCollege of Physicians of London elected him one of their Fellows, and he\r\npresided over that body several years.  Being very rich and desirous to\r\npromote learning, he procured a charter from Queen Elizabeth dated 1565,\r\nto turn Gonville Hall into a College; and he endowed it with the greater\r\npart of his estate.  He lived as an ornament to his profession till July,\r\n1573, when he died, aged 63, at Cambridge.  He wrote the “Antiquities of\r\nCambridge,” an excellent book; and he presented it to James I. as he\r\npassed through his college.  The King said, “Give me rather _Caius de\r\nCanibus_,” a work of his as much admired, but hard to be got.  He was\r\nmaster of his college for some time, but in his old age he resigned that\r\noffice to Dr. Legge, a fellow commoner in his college, and a native of\r\nNorwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Archbishop Parker_.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchbishop Parker, a native of Norwich, flourished in this reign, and was\r\na great benefactor to the city.  He was born August 6th, 1504, being the\r\nson of William Parker, a wealthy citizen.  He was educated at the Grammar\r\nSchool here, and in 1520 he was sent to Corpus Christi College, where he\r\ntook his degrees of B.A., M.A., and D.D., before 1538.  The Queen\r\nafterwards appointed him Archbishop of Canterbury, and he was very active\r\nin persecuting the Puritans here.  He was the author of many works which\r\nshowed much learning.  He died on May 17th, 1575, and was buried in\r\nLambeth Chapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nNorwich in the Seventeenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS was a very eventful period in the annals of the city.  The century\r\nopened with storms and inundations in the physical world, heralding\r\ncommotions in the political world.  On April 9th, 1601, a sudden storm of\r\nhail and rain passed over the city, whereby the upper part of the\r\nCathedral spire, which had been lately repaired, was beaten down.  It\r\nfell on the roof of the church, which it broke through, doing great\r\ndamage to it as well as to the walls of the choir.  The spire was split\r\non the south-east side from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nJames I. was proclaimed king on March 24th, 1602; and soon after he was\r\nseated on the throne he granted a general pardon to the mayor, sheriffs,\r\nand commons of this city, for all past offences.  The local occurrences\r\nwere not very important during this reign of 23 years.  There were,\r\nhowever, great disturbances between the citizens and Dutch strangers\r\nrespecting trade rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nIn 1602, the plague raged with unusual fury in this country.  As many as\r\n30,578 persons died in London, and 3076 in Norwich.  This visitation was\r\nattended with so great a scarcity of food, that wheat sold for ten, rye\r\nfor six, and barley for five shillings per bushel.  In the summer of\r\n1609, the city was again visited by the plague, though but few died of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt the assizes held August, 1617, a dispute arose between Sir Henry\r\nMontague, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench, and John\r\nMingay, Esq., then Mayor, concerning precedence.  This was occasioned by\r\nthe indiscretion of Sir Augustine Palgrave, Sheriff of Norfolk, who had\r\nimprudently informed the Chief Justice that it was his right to sit in\r\nthe chair at the preaching place in the Green yard, with the Mayor on his\r\nleft hand.  This the Mayor opposed, resolutely asserting his right to the\r\nchair; and the Chief Justice as resolutely insisted, being misled by the\r\ninformation of the sheriff.  But this matter was afterwards set right,\r\nand the sheriff was obliged to acknowledge his error, after having been\r\nseverely reprimanded by the Judge for misleading him.  On the next day, a\r\ncontest of the same kind happened between the High Sheriff and the\r\nSheriffs of Norwich; when, to prevent any disputes of the like nature in\r\nfuture, it was determined that only the High Sheriff should attend the\r\nJudges when they are upon the county business, and only the Sheriffs of\r\nNorwich when they are on the city business.\r\n\r\nCharles I. was proclaimed king, on March 1st, 1625.  The mayor of\r\nNorwich, stewards, justices, sheriffs, and aldermen, were present at the\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nOn March 31st, 1625, Charles I. was proclaimed in Norwich, and on May\r\n13th following, Thomas, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl-Marshal of\r\nEngland, was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of the county of Norfolk, and of\r\nthe city of Norwich, and county of the same.\r\n\r\nOn October 19th, 1625, the citizens petitioned the king to be released of\r\ntaxes, on account of their poverty and the ravages of the plague; and in\r\n1641, the citizens petitioned Parliament, to be discharged from paying\r\n£2500 assessed upon them, on account of their great poverty and the\r\nimpossibility of raising the money.\r\n\r\nIn 1626, writs of quo warranto were brought against the mayor, &c., for\r\nrefusing to furnish two ships of war demanded of them; and the\r\ncorporation, on the trial, which took place in 1629, obtained a verdict\r\nin their favor, having proved that they neither used nor usurped any\r\nprivileges but what their charters warranted.  During this contest the\r\ncity raised a sum of money, and presented to the king by way of loan, as\r\nsettled by the lord keeper, lord treasurer, comptroller, and chancellor\r\nof the duchy of Lancaster, who came hither for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1627, an order arrived for levying 250 foot soldiers in the city of\r\nNorwich and county of Norfolk, of which number the citizens were ordered\r\nto furnish 25; but they would raise no more than 17, that being their\r\nfull proportion.\r\n\r\nDuring this reign the plague raged with great violence in the city and\r\ncounty.  On July 12th, 1625, the king issued a commission to the mayor,\r\n&c., to scour the city ditches, to remove all nuisances in and about the\r\ncity, to repair the walls and turrets, and to tax all residing in the\r\nseveral wards, according to their ability, toward the work; it being\r\nthought very necessary, in order to stop the plague which had been\r\nbrought from Yarmouth, and begun to spread here.  The mayor had\r\npreviously requested the bailiffs at Yarmouth to order all the wherrymen\r\nto carry no infected persons dwelling in their town to the city.\r\nConstables of every ward gave notice that no person coming from London\r\nshould be entertained without notice given to the aldermen of their ward;\r\nand watch was set at every gate, day and night, to hinder all persons\r\ncoming from infected places entering the city, and the carriers were\r\ncommanded to bring no such persons, nor any wool whatever.\r\nNotwithstanding all this caution, the plague began to spread, so that on\r\nJuly 23rd, the aldermen of every ward appointed “Searchers” in each ward,\r\nto be keepers of such persons as were suspected of being infected.  The\r\nbellman warned all the citizens to take their dogs and swine outside of\r\nthe walls, on pain of being killed.  On July 30th, the watch of the gates\r\nceased, it being known that the plague raged within the city.  Twenty-six\r\npersons died of it in that week; and before August 11th, it had so much\r\nincreased, that it was resolved that every alderman should have power to\r\nsend his warrants to the city treasurers to relieve the infected persons;\r\nand the plague abated that very week.  Orders were issued that the doors\r\nof all persons who died of the disease should be nailed up and watched.\r\nEvery one who begged about the streets was whipped, because all the poor\r\nwere then relieved, so that no one had any excuse for begging for food.\r\n\r\nIn 1634, under date of March 23rd, a letter signed by the king, was\r\ndirected to the mayor, sheriff, and aldermen, requiring their constant\r\nattendance at the sermon preached every Sunday morning, either in the\r\nCathedral or Green yard, and that they would be there at the beginning of\r\nthe service, after the manner observed in the city of London; and that\r\nnone be absent without the consent of the bishop.  On this point a court\r\nwas held, and it was ordered that the mayor and court should constantly\r\nmeet at the Free School, and thence proceed to church agreeably to his\r\nmajesty’s instructions; the king having great regard for their spiritual\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first parliament of the reign of Charles I., in 1625, has been\r\nseverely censured on account of the penurious supply which it doled out\r\nfor the exigencies of a war in which its predecessors had involved the\r\nking.  Nor is the reproach wholly unfounded.  A more liberal proceeding,\r\nif it did not obtain a reciprocal concession from the king, would have\r\nput him more in the wrong.  But the Puritans in parliament formed a\r\nmajority, and were determined not to vote money without a redress of what\r\nthey deemed to be grievances.  The king finding he could not obtain the\r\nsupplies he required from the House of Commons, determined to rule\r\nwithout a parliament, and to raise money by some other means.  Hence the\r\ncontests between the king and the parliaments, which were often called\r\nand soon dissolved.  This served only to aggravate the embarrassments of\r\nthe crown.  Every successive House of Commons inherited the feelings of\r\nits predecessor, otherwise it would not have represented the people.  The\r\nsame men, for the most part, came again to parliament more irritated and\r\ndifficult of reconciliation with the sovereign than before.  Even the\r\npolitic measure, as it was fancied to be, of excluding some of the most\r\nactive members from seats, by nominating them sheriffs for the year,\r\nfailed of the expected success because all ranks partook of a common\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn 1642, July 12th, the parliament voted and declared the necessity of\r\nrecourse to arms, and on the 29th of the same month, Moses Treswell was\r\napprehended for attempting to enlist men into the king’s service, after\r\nhaving been forbidden to do so by the corporation.  The citizens\r\nsupposing that this act would be deemed a declaration against their\r\nsovereign, ordered a double watch to be set in every ward, and a\r\nprovision of all military stores to be made.  They received a letter from\r\nthe parliament thanking them for their great services in sending up\r\nCaptain Treswell, and exhorting them to raise the militia, and to prevent\r\nanyone from levying troops within their jurisdiction without consent of\r\nparliament.  Soon afterwards, the king issued proclamations requiring the\r\nassistance of his subjects against the rebels, but no regard was paid to\r\nthem in Norwich.  On the other hand, the magistrates ordered a general\r\nmuster of the trained bands and volunteers, and put the city into the\r\nbest state of defence, fearing an attack from the gentlemen of Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk who had declared for the king.  As a further proof of their\r\nzeal they sent fifty Dragoons for Colonel Cromwell’s regiment, which\r\ncomposed part of the troops under Lord Grey of Wark, raised for the\r\npreservation of the peace in the associated counties of Norfolk, Suffolk,\r\nEssex, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, and Huntingdonshire.  As soon as\r\nthese had marched, the magistrates raised a hundred more dragoons, and to\r\nmount them, gave orders for seizing the horses of those citizens who\r\nfavoured the cause of the king, and who were called malignants.  On March\r\n13th, the city raised fifty more Dragoons, and on March 26th, 1643, a\r\nhundred men were ordered to be raised and sent to Cambridge to re-enforce\r\nthe associated army.  The weekly contribution levied by parliament on the\r\ncounty was £1250 in the following proportions: Norfolk £1129, Norwich\r\n£53, Lynn £27, Yarmouth £34 16s. 5d., Thetford £5 11s. 9d.  On April 2nd,\r\nbeing Easter day, Captain Sherwood marched to Lynn with a hundred\r\nvolunteers to secure that town from any sudden surprise by the king’s\r\nforces.  On August 12th, a meeting of the associated counties was\r\nappointed on account of the danger with which the city was threatened by\r\nthe approach of the enemy, and the castle was ordered to be fortified.\r\nLincolnshire was also admitted amongst the associated counties.  Lynn was\r\ngarrisoned by the forces of the parliament, and fortified at the expense\r\nof the Association.  On November 18th, four of the Court, representing\r\nthe Association, were fined £10 each for want of expedition in collecting\r\nthe proposition money, and the Earl of Manchester ordered the immediate\r\nassessing and levying of such sums of money as should have been raised by\r\nany edict of parliament.  This stringent commission was carried out by\r\nforce of arms.\r\n\r\nIn 1643, it having been agreed between the English and Scotch\r\ncommissioners that £100,000 should be immediately advanced to the Scots,\r\nto enable them to put their army in march for England, an order was sent\r\ndown to Norwich for levying £6000, part of the said sum in the following\r\nproportions; in Norwich, £265; in Yarmouth, £174; in Lynn, £132; in\r\nThetford, £27 18s. 9d., and the remainder in the county of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Court, on March 9th, 1644, seven pictures, taken from St.\r\nSwithin’s Church, the Angel and Four Evangelists from St. Peter’s, Moses\r\nand Aaron and the Four Evangelists from the Cathedral, and other\r\npaintings, were publicly burnt in the Market Place.  A committee was\r\nappointed to “view the churches for pictures and crucifixes,” in\r\nconsequence of which, these over-zealous Reformers committed all kinds of\r\noutrages and excesses by destroying monuments in the churches, and\r\nburning valuable paintings, as stated by Bishop Hall in his “Hard\r\nMeasure,” a pamphlet on the proceedings of the Puritans.  On Christmas\r\neve, 1645, the mayor issued orders to all the city clergy commanding them\r\nneither to preach, nor to administer the sacrament, in their respective\r\nchurches on the day following, and to the inhabitants, charging them to\r\nopen their shops as on other days; so little did the Puritans in that age\r\nunderstand the principles of toleration.\r\n\r\nIn 1648, a petition was presented to the mayor, &c., signed by 150\r\npersons, praying for a more speedy and effectual reformation, and\r\ncomplaining that their faithful ministers were discouraged and slighted;\r\nthe ejected ministers countenanced and preferred; old ceremonies, and the\r\nservice book constantly used, and the directory for worship almost\r\ntotally neglected; and further praying, that the ordinances against\r\nsuperstition and idolatry might be put in strict execution; “so, shall\r\nthe crucifix on the cathedral gate be defaced, and another on the roof of\r\nthe cathedral neere the west door in the inside, and one upon the free\r\nschool, and the image of Christ on the parish house of St. George at\r\nTombland be taken down, and many parish churches more decently made for\r\nthe congregations to meet in.”  The mayor, John Utting, paying little\r\nregard to this petition, was sent for to London, and Mr. Alderman Baret\r\nput in his place.  After he was gone, the common people, having a great\r\naffection for the mayor, went to the committee house, then on the site of\r\nthe present Bethel, where the gunpowder was kept, and set fire to\r\nninety-five barrels, which killed and wounded about one hundred persons\r\nand greatly damaged the adjacent buildings.  For this outrage six of the\r\nperpetrators were hanged in the Market Place.\r\n\r\nOn January 30th, 1649, King Charles was beheaded at Whitehall.  Soon\r\nafter the death of the king the House of Commons published a decree to\r\nforbid the proclaiming of Charles Stuart, eldest son of the late king, or\r\nof any person whatsoever, on pain of high treason; and afterwards enacted\r\nthat the kingly office should be abolished as unnecessary, burdensome,\r\nand dangerous; and that the state should be governed by the\r\nrepresentatives of the people without king or lords, and under the form\r\nof a Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIn 1650, on discovery of an intended insurrection in Norfolk in favour of\r\nKing Charles, which was to have broken out on October 7th, several of the\r\nconspirators were apprehended and tried at the new hall, in Norwich,\r\nbefore three judges, commissioned by the parliament for that purpose.\r\nTheir sitting continued from December 20th to December 30th, and they\r\ncondemned twenty-five persons, who were all executed, some of them at\r\nNorwich and others in different parts of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nOn June 24th, 1654, an ordinance was published for the six months’\r\nassessment for the maintenance of the armies and fleets of the\r\nCommonwealth, at the rate of £120,000 per month for the first three\r\nmonths, and £90,000 per month for the rest.  Towards each monthly payment\r\nof the last sum, Norwich raised £240 and Norfolk £4660.  On August 29th,\r\nan ordinance was issued for ejecting scandalous and insufficient\r\nministers and schoolmasters; whose qualifications were to be tried by\r\ncommissioners appointed for that purpose in every county.  In consequence\r\nof this ordinance many able divines in the kingdom were ejected from\r\ntheir livings, and their places filled by such as best suited the views\r\nof the ruling party.  During the Commonwealth, the city was put in\r\ndefence against the royalists, the castle was fortified for the service\r\nof Cromwell, the goods of the bishops and clergy were sequestrated, the\r\nbishops palace was sacked, the cathedral and churches were plundered and\r\ndefaced, and Bishop Hall was turned out and driven into retirement at his\r\npalace in Heigham, which is still in existence, being used as a tavern\r\ncalled the Dolphin.  He died there and was buried in the old church in\r\nHeigham.  We shall speak more at length of this distinguished prelate in\r\nour notice of “The Eminent Citizens” of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Oliver Cromwell, which happened on September 3rd, 1658,\r\nthe mayor of Norwich, like the mayors of other towns, received letters\r\nfrom the privy council, notifying that event and the election of his son\r\nRichard Cromwell to the dignity of Protector, and commanding him to\r\nproclaim the said Richard protector of the three kingdoms, which was done\r\naccordingly on the seventh of that month.  The new protector’s honours\r\nwere, however, but of short continuance; for in the month of April, 1659,\r\nthe army obliged him to dissolve the parliament which he had convoked,\r\nand soon afterwards deposed him from his high office.  During the fatal\r\ncontentions respecting the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges\r\nof parliament, the city suffered less than might have been expected, and\r\nNorfolk less than many other counties.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe citizens, tired of strife and commotion, were among the first to hail\r\nthe return of monarchy in the person of Charles II., who was proclaimed\r\nhere on May 10th, 1660, and the sum of £1000 was presented to His\r\nMajesty, on behalf of the city, by the mayor, who received the honour of\r\nknighthood.  In 1663 the king granted to the city the charter by which,\r\nwith little interruption, it was governed till 1835, when the municipal\r\nact came into force.  In 1670, Lord Howard presented the corporation with\r\na noble mace of silver gilt, and a gown of crimson velvet for the mayor.\r\nIn 1671, the king and queen and many nobles visited the city, and were\r\nentertained in grand style at the palaces of the bishop and the Duke of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\nIn 1682, a majority of the corporation surrendered to the king the\r\ncharter which he had granted them nine years before, and in lieu of it a\r\nnew one was substituted not so favourable to the city; the king having\r\nreserved the right of removing magistrates of whom he did not approve.\r\n\r\nIn 1687, by the mandate of James II., ten aldermen and nineteen\r\ncouncillors were displaced; but the arbitrary conduct of that monarch\r\nsoon brought about his ruin, and when Henry, Duke of Norfolk, rode into\r\nthe Market Place at the head of 300 knights and gentlemen and declared\r\nfor a _free_ parliament, the corporation and citizens responded with loud\r\nacclamations.  After the glorious revolution of 1688, the first charter\r\nof Charles II. was restored to the city, and the aldermen who had been\r\nremoved were reinstated in their offices.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Mary, king and queen of England, began their reign on\r\nFebruary 13th, 1688, and during their reign the city flourished\r\nexceedingly, and the country in general was prosperous.\r\n\r\nIn 1697 the coin was regulated afresh, the old money being called in and\r\nrecoined, for which purpose, mints were established in various places,\r\namong others one in this city, which coined £259,371.  The quantity of\r\ncoin and plate brought in here to be coined was 17,709 ounces.\r\n\r\nWe may here give the statements of two eminent writers respecting Norwich\r\nand Norfolk in this century.  Sir Thomas Browne, jun., in 1662, wrote as\r\nfollows about the city and county:—\r\n\r\n    “Let any stranger find me out so pleasant a county, such good ways,\r\n    large heaths, three such places as Norwich, Yarmouth, and Lynn, in\r\n    any county of England, and I’ll be once again a vagabond and visit to\r\n    them.”\r\n\r\nAnd he wrote so with good reason.  Few, if any, of the cities of England\r\nthen contained more handsome buildings, or presented so good an\r\nappearance as did the old city of Norwich, while only London and Bristol\r\nsurpassed her in the extent and importance of their commerce.  Lord\r\nMacaulay, in his graphic History of England thus describes the state of\r\nthe city in the 17th century:—\r\n\r\n    “Norwich was the capital of a large and fruitful province.  It was\r\n    the residence of a bishop and of a chapter.  It was the seat of the\r\n    manufacture of the realm.  Some even distinguished by learning and\r\n    science had recently dwelt there, and no place in the kingdom, except\r\n    the capital and the universities, had more attractions to the\r\n    curious.  The library, the museum, the aviary, and the botanical\r\n    gardens of Sir Thomas Browne were thought by the Fellows of the Royal\r\n    Society well worthy of a long pilgrimage.  Norwich had also a court\r\n    in miniature.  In the heart of the city stood an old palace of the\r\n    Duke of Norfolk, said to be the largest town house in the kingdom out\r\n    of London.  In this mansion, to which were annexed a tennis court, a\r\n    bowling green, and a wilderness extending along the banks of the\r\n    Wensum, the noble family of Howard frequently resided.  Drink was\r\n    served to the guests in goblets of pure gold; the very tongs and\r\n    shovels were of silver; pictures of Italian masters adorned the\r\n    walls; the cabinets were filled with a fine collection of gems\r\n    purchased by the Earl of Arundel, whose marbles are now among the\r\n    ornaments of Oxford.  Here, in the year 1671, Charles and his court\r\n    were sumptuously entertained; here, too, all comers were annually\r\n    welcomed from Christmas to Twelfthnight; ale flowed in oceans for the\r\n    populace.  Three coaches, one of which had been built at a cost of\r\n    £500 to contain fourteen persons, were sent every afternoon round the\r\n    city to bring ladies to the festivities, and the dances were always\r\n    followed by a luxurious banquet.  When the Duke of Norfolk came to\r\n    Norwich he was greeted like a king returning to his capital; the\r\n    bells of St. Peter’s Mancroft were rung, the guns of the castle were\r\n    fired, and the mayor and aldermen waited on their illustrious citizen\r\n    with complimentary addresses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEminent Citizens of the Seventeenth Century.\r\n\r\n_Bishop Hall_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Hall, Bishop of Norwich, the first English Satirist, was a noted\r\ncharacter in this century.  He was born July 1st, 1574, in Bristow Park,\r\nwithin the parish of Ashby de la Zouch, in Leicestershire.  He was\r\neducated by a private tutor till he was fifteen years of age, when he\r\nremoved to Cambridge, and was admitted to Emmanuel College, of which he\r\nwas a chosen scholar, and took the degree of Bachelor of Arts.  His\r\nsatires were published in 1597, 1598, and 1599, and added greatly to his\r\nreputation by their pungency and classical style.  They equal the satires\r\nof Juvenal and Persius on similar themes, and in lashing the vices of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\nDr. Hall, in 1624, refused the bishopric of Gloucester, but in 1627 he\r\naccepted that of Exeter, holding with it _in commendam_ the rectory of\r\nSt. Breock in Cornwall.  At this time he seems to have been suspected of\r\na leaning to the Puritans, and it must be allowed that his religious\r\nviews were more consonant with theirs than with the lax Arminianism of\r\nLaud.  But at the same time, Dr. Hall was a zealous supporter of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nOn November 15th, 1641, he was translated, by the little power left to\r\nthe king, to be Bishop of Norwich, but having joined with the Archbishop\r\nof York and eleven other prelates, in a protest against the validity of\r\nsuch laws as should be made during their compulsory absence from\r\nparliament, he was ordered to be sent to the tower, with his brethren, on\r\nthe 30th of January following.  Shortly afterwards they were impeached by\r\nthe Commons for high treason, and on their appearance in parliament were\r\ntreated with the utmost rudeness and contempt.  The Commons, however, did\r\nnot think fit to prosecute the charge of high treason, having gained\r\ntheir purpose by driving them from the House of Lords, and Hall and his\r\nbrethren were ordered to be dismissed; but upon another pretext they were\r\nagain sent to the tower.  In June following, Hall was finally released on\r\ngiving bail for £5000!  He returned to Norwich, and being received with\r\nrather more respect than he hoped for, in the then state of public\r\nopinion, he resumed his duties, frequently preaching to large\r\ncongregations, and enjoying the forbearance of the predominant Puritan\r\nparty till April, 1643, when the destruction of the church was\r\ncontemplated.  About this time, the ordinance for sequestrating notorious\r\ndelinquents having passed, and our prelate being included by name, all\r\nhis rents were stopped, his palace was entered, and all his property was\r\nseized.  A friend, however, gave bond for the whole amount of the\r\nvaluation, and the bishop was allowed to remain a short time in his\r\npalace.  While he remained there, he was continually exposed to the\r\ninsolence of the soldiery and mob, who demolished the windows and\r\nmonuments of the cathedral.  At length he was ordered to leave his\r\npalace, and would have been exposed to the utmost extremity, if a\r\nneighbour had not offered him the shelter of his humble roof.  Some time\r\nafterwards, but by what interest we are not told, the sequestration was\r\ntaken off a small estate which he rented at Heigham, to which he retired.\r\nThe house in which he lived, now called the Dolphin Inn, is still\r\nstanding, and should be carefully preserved as a memorial of a great and\r\ngood man.\r\n\r\nBishop Hall, in his tract _Hard Measure_, has given a most touching\r\naccount of the treatment he experienced.  He says in his tract “The\r\nShaking of the Olive Tree:”—\r\n\r\n    “It is no other than tragical to relate the carnage of that furious\r\n    sacrilege whereof our eyes and ears were the sad witnesses, under the\r\n    authority and presence of Linsey, Tofts the sheriff, and Greenwood.\r\n    Lord, what work was here; what clattering of glasses, what beating\r\n    down of walls, what tearing up of monuments, what pulling down of\r\n    seates, what wresting out of irons and brass from the windows and\r\n    graves, what defacing of armes, what demolishing of curious stone\r\n    work which had not any representation in the world, but only of the\r\n    cast of the founder, and skill of the mason; what toting and piping\r\n    upon the destroyed organ pipes, and what a hideous triumph on the\r\n    market day, before all the country, when, in a sacrilegious and\r\n    profane procession, all the organ pipes, vestments, both copes and\r\n    surplices, together with the leaden crosse which had been newly sawn\r\n    down from over the green yard pulpit, and the service book and\r\n    singing books that could be had, were carried to a fire in the public\r\n    Market-place; a lewd wretch walking before the train in his cope\r\n    trailing in the dirt, with a service book in his hand, imitating in\r\n    an impious scorne the tune and usurping the words of the litany\r\n    formerly used in the church.  Neer the publick crosse all these\r\n    monuments of idolatry must be sacrificed to the fire, not without\r\n    much ostentation of a zealous joy in discharging ordinance to the\r\n    cost of some who professed how much they longed to see that day.”\r\n\r\nThe good bishop’s sufferings did not damp his courage, for in 1644, we\r\nfind him preaching in Norwich whenever he could obtain the use of a\r\npulpit; and with yet more boldness, in the same year he sent _A modest\r\noffer of some meet considerations in favour of Episcopacy_ addressed to\r\nthe Assembly of Divines.  During the rest of his life he appears to have\r\nremained at Heigham, unmolested, performing the duties of a faithful\r\npastor, and exercising such hospitality and charity as his scanty means\r\npermitted.  He died, September 8th, 1656, in the 82nd year of his age,\r\nand was buried in the church of St. Bartholomew, in Heigham.  In his\r\nwill, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “I leave my body to be buried without any funeral pomp, at the\r\n    discretion of my executors, with the only monition that I do not hold\r\n    God’s house a meet repository for the dead bodies of the greatest\r\n    saints.”\r\n\r\nHe left a family behind, according to Lloyd, of whom Robert, the eldest\r\nson, was afterwards a clergyman, and D.D.  His wife died in 1647.  His\r\nprose works were published at various periods in folio, quarto, and\r\nduodecimo.  They were collected in a handsome edition of 10 vols.,\r\noctavo, by the Rev. Josiah Pratt, and are his best memorials.  The\r\n“Meditations” have been often reprinted.  As a moralist, he has been\r\ncalled the British Seneca.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Thomas Browne_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne flourished in this century in Norwich, as a Physician.\r\nDr. Johnson wrote a memoir of him, from which we learn the following\r\nparticulars.  He was born in London, in the parish of St. Michael, in\r\nCheapside, on October 19th, 1605.  Of his childhood or youth there is\r\nlittle known, except that he lost his father very early; that he was,\r\naccording to the common fate of orphans, defrauded by one of his\r\nguardians; and that he was placed for his education at the School of\r\nWinchester.  He was removed in 1623 from Winchester to Oxford, and\r\nentered a gentleman commoner of Broadgate Hall, which was soon afterwards\r\nendowed and took the name of Pembroke College, from the Earl of Pembroke,\r\nthe Chancellor of the University.  He was admitted to the degree of B.A.,\r\nJanuary 31st, 1626–7, being the first man of eminence who graduated from\r\nthe new college, to which the zeal or gratitude of those that love it\r\nmost can wish little better than that it may long proceed as it began.\r\nHaving afterwards taken his degree of M.A., he turned his attention to\r\nphysic.  He practised it for some time in Oxfordshire, but soon\r\nafterwards, either induced by curiosity or invited by promises, he\r\nquitted his settlement and accompanied his father-in-law, who had some\r\nemployment in Ireland in the visitation of the forts and castles, which\r\nthe state of Ireland then made necessary.  He left Ireland and travelled\r\non the Continent, and was created an M.D. at Leyden.  About the year 1634\r\nhe is supposed to have returned to London; and the next year to have\r\nwritten his celebrated treatise, called _Religio Medici_, or, “The\r\nReligion of a Physician,” which excited the attention of the public by\r\nthe novelty of paradoxes, the dignity of sentiment, the quick succession\r\nof images, the multitude of abstruse allusions, the subtlety of\r\ndisquisition, and the strength of language.  At the time when this book\r\nwas published the author resided at Norwich, where he had settled in\r\n1636, by the persuasion of Dr. Lushington, his tutor, who was then rector\r\nof Burnham Westgate, in West Norfolk.  His practice became very\r\nextensive, and in 1637 he was incorporated Doctor of Physic, in Oxford.\r\nHe married in 1641, Mrs. Mileham, of a good family in Norfolk.  He had\r\nten children by her, of whom one son and three daughters survived their\r\nparents.  In 1646, Sir Thomas Browne published his “Enquiries into Vulgar\r\nand Common Errors,” which passed through many editions.  In 1658, the\r\ndiscovery of some ancient urns in Norfolk, gave him occasion to write\r\n“Hydriotaphia, Urn-burial, or, a Discourse of Sepulchral Urns;” in which\r\nhe treats with his usual learning on the funeral rites of ancient\r\nnations, exhibits their various treatment of the dead, and examines the\r\nsubstances found in the Norfolcian urns.  To this treatise on Urn-burial\r\nwas added the “Garden of Cyrus; or, the Quincuxial Lozenge, or Network\r\nPlantation of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, Mystically\r\nConsidered.”  He doubted the Copernican hypothesis, on the same ground as\r\nsome divines distrust the Cuvierian system of Geology, as opposed to\r\nGenesis.  These were all the tracts which he published, but many papers\r\nwere found in his closet.  Of these, two collections were published in\r\n1722, and all his works were issued in a cheap form by G. H. Bohn, and\r\nare in the Norwich Free Library.  To the life of this learned man there\r\nremains little to be added, but that in 1665 he was chosen Honorary\r\nFellow of the College of Physicians, as a man “_Virtute et literis\r\nornatissimus_,” eminently embellished with literature and virtue.  In\r\n1671, he received at Norwich, the honour of Knighthood from Charles II.,\r\na prince, who, with many frailties and vices, had yet skill to discover\r\nexcellence and virtue, to reward it with such honorary distinctions, at\r\nleast, as cost him nothing.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne, in 1680, wrote a _Repertorium_, or Account of the\r\nTombs and Monuments in the Cathedral Church of Norwich.  The basis of the\r\nwork was a sketch hastily drawn up twenty years previously on the\r\ninformation of “an understanding singing man,” ninety-one years old, in\r\norder to preserve the remembrance of some of the monumental antiquities\r\nwhich barbarous zeal had destroyed.  The reckless character of these\r\nravages has thus been exhibited in a description made on the spot and at\r\nthe moment, by one who suffered in his person, property, and health.\r\n\r\nThus the knight lived in high reputation, till he was seized with a\r\ncolic, which, after having tortured him for about a week, put an end to\r\nhis life at Norwich, on his birthday, October 19th, 1682, having\r\ncompleted his 77th year.  Some of his last words were expressions of\r\nsubmission to the will of God, and fearlessness of death.  He lies buried\r\nin the Church of St. Peter Mancroft, within the rails at the east end of\r\nthe chancel, with this inscription on a mural monument, placed in the\r\nsouth pillar of the altar:—\r\n\r\n                                  M.

BR.\r\n\r\nMr. Simon Wilkin, F.L.S., in a supplementary memoir, states that Dr.\r\nBrowne steadily adhered to the royal cause in perilous times.  He was one\r\nof the 432 principal citizens, who, in 1643, refused to subscribe towards\r\na fund for regaining the town of Newcastle.  Charles II. was not likely\r\nto have been ignorant of this, and he had, no doubt, the good feeling to\r\nexpress his sense of it by a distinction which was, no doubt, gratifying\r\nto Sir Thomas Browne.  Sir Thomas is supposed to have lived in the last\r\nhouse at the south end of the Gentleman’s Walk, where the Savings’ Bank\r\nnow stands.  Blomefield asserts that he lived where Dr. Howman then\r\nlived, (1760) and that he succeeded Alderman Anguish in that house; and\r\nMr. Simon Wilkin says that he ascertained by reference to title deeds,\r\nthat the last house at the southern extremity of the Gentleman’s Walk,\r\nHaymarket, belonged, in Blomefield’s time, to Dr. Howman.  This house was\r\nfor many years a china and glass warehouse, and tradition has always\r\nasserted it to be Dr. Browne’s residence.  The last occupier was Mr.\r\nSwan, and the house was pulled down to make room for the Savings’ Bank.\r\nIt contained some spacious rooms.  In the drawing room there was, over\r\nthe mantel-piece and occupying the entire space of the ceiling, a most\r\nelaborate and richly ornamented carving of the royal arms of Charles II.,\r\nno doubt placed there by Sir Thomas to express his loyalty, and to\r\ncommemorate his knighthood.  In Matthew Stevenson’s poems, 12mo, 1673,\r\nthere is a long poem on the progress of Charles II. into Norfolk, in\r\nwhich the honour conferred on Browne is thus noticed:—\r\n\r\n    “There the king knighted the so famous Browne,\r\n    Whose worth and learning to the world are known.”\r\n\r\nEarly in October, 1673, Evelyn went down to the Earl of Arlington’s, at\r\nEuston, in company with Sir Thomas Clifford, to join the royal party.\r\nLord Henry Howard arrived soon afterward, and prevailed on Mr. Evelyn to\r\naccompany him to Norwich, promising to convey him back after a day or\r\ntwo.  “This,” he says, “as I could not refuse I was not hard to be\r\npersuaded to, having a desire to see that famous scholar and physician,\r\nDr. T. Browne, author of the _Religio Medici_, and _Vulgar Errors_, &c.,\r\nnow lately knighted.”  After arriving in Norwich, Evelyn says:—\r\n\r\n    “Next morning I went to see Sir Thomas Browne, with whom I had some\r\n    time corresponded by letter, though I had never seen him before.  His\r\n    whole house and garden being a paradise and cabinet of rarities, and\r\n    that of the best collections, especially medails, books, plants, and\r\n    natural things.  Amongst other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a\r\n    collection of the eggs of all the foule and birds he could procure,\r\n    that country (especially the promontory of Norfolk) being frequented,\r\n    as he said, by severall kinds, which seldome or never go further into\r\n    the land, as cranes, storkes, eagles, and a variety of water foule.\r\n    He led me to see all the remarkable places in this ancient city,\r\n    being one of the largest, and certainly, after London, one of the\r\n    noblest in England for its venerable Cathedralle, number of stately\r\n    churches, cleanesse of the streets, and buildings of flints so\r\n    exquistely headed and squared, as I was much astonished at; but he\r\n    told me they had lost the art of squaring the flints in which they\r\n    once so much excelled, and of which the churches, best houses, and\r\n    walls are built.  The Castle is an antique extent of ground which now\r\n    they call Marsfield, and would have been a fitting area to have\r\n    placed the ducal palace in.  The suburbs are large, the prospects are\r\n    sweete, with other amenities, not omitting the flower gardens, in\r\n    which all the inhabitants excel.”\r\n\r\nAt that time the hamlets of Thorpe, Lakenham, and Heigham, were all\r\nfields or cultivated grounds and gardens, and the city was interspersed\r\nwith gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Samuel Clarke_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Clarke, D.D., was the son of Edward Clarke, one of the Aldermen of\r\nNorwich, where he was born in 1675, and where he was educated at the\r\nGrammar School, his father being at that time one of the representatives\r\nof the city in parliament.  In 1691, he was entered as a student in Caius\r\nCollege, Cambridge, where his great capacity for learning was soon\r\ndeveloped, and where he became distinguished as a metaphysician,\r\nmathematician, and divine.  He was the author of many works, the chief of\r\nwhich was a “Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God.”  Upon his\r\nentering into holy orders, he became Chaplain to the learned Dr. Moore,\r\nBishop of Norwich, with whom he lived in great esteem, having the\r\nadvantage of the fine library of that prelate.  In 1704, he was called to\r\nan office worthy of all his learning, namely, that of lecturer on Mr.\r\nBoyle’s foundation.  He preached sermons concerning the Evidences of\r\nNatural and Revealed Religion, which will always be highly esteemed.\r\nSoon afterwards, he was presented to the living of St. Bennet’s, near\r\nPaul’s Wharf, London, and where he constantly preached without notes.  In\r\nthe same year he translated the _Optics of Sir Isaac Newton_ into elegant\r\nLatin, which was so acceptable to that great philosopher, that he\r\npresented £500 to the divine, being £100 for each of his children.  He\r\nwas soon after made one of the Chaplains in Ordinary, and in 1709, Queen\r\nAnne presented him to the Rectory of St. James’, Westminster, when he\r\nwent to Cambridge and took his degree of Doctor of Divinity.  He died on\r\nMay 17th, 1729, aged 54 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert_, _Viscount of Yarmouth_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1683 died the Rt. Hon. Robert, Viscount of Yarmouth, Baron of Paston,\r\nLord Lieutenant of Norfolk and Norwich.  He was buried at Oxnead.  His\r\nfuneral sermon was preached by the Rev. John Hildeyard, LL.D., then\r\nrector of Cawston, and it was afterwards published.  At page 27 there is\r\nthe following passage, referring to the deceased viscount:\r\n\r\n    “Great was his love to the ancient, loyal, and honourable corporation\r\n    of Norwich, because the members of that body, generally speaking,\r\n    loved the king; they found him their friend and, _maugre_ the blast\r\n    of calumny, the _new charter_ shall remain a token of it.  He spared\r\n    no cost nor pains, as themselves can witness, to make the world\r\n    believe that he loved them.  Most of the tables of his house were\r\n    spread together for their entertainment, and all his friends employed\r\n    to bid them welcome; nay, his very sleep was ofttimes broken to find\r\n    out ways how best to serve them, and he commended the care of the\r\n    city with his last breath, to all his best friends, and the blessing\r\n    of God.”\r\n\r\nHappy corporation, that had such a friend; but Blomefield says,\r\n\r\n    “Whatever the Dr. (Hildeyard) might think of it, the effects of the\r\n    new charter now began to be too visible, for Mr. Nic Helwys was\r\n    chosen mayor, and eleven common council in room of those eleven of\r\n    the sixty common council appointed by the charter, which were not\r\n    qualified; but such choice was of no force till confirmed by the\r\n    king, who sent a letter under the privy seal, dated at Windsor, May\r\n    17th, signifying by the Earl of Arundel that he approved of them, and\r\n    the names of the two elected sheriffs were signified to the Lord\r\n    Lieutenant, and that they were persons of loyalty, and therefore they\r\n    desired his lordship to give his gracious Majesty information thereof\r\n    in order to his approbation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. John Cosin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Cosin, D.D., was born in this city in 1594, and finished his studies\r\nin Caius College, Cambridge, where he took his last degrees.  When he\r\nentered into holy orders he was presented to a Prebendary in the\r\nCathedral Church of Durham, and appointed Archdeacon of the East Riding\r\nof Yorkshire.  But the civil wars breaking out, and he being an active\r\nPapist, he was obliged to seek refuge abroad till the Restoration in\r\n1660, when he returned, and was promoted first to the Deanery of\r\nPeterborough, and then to the Bishopric of Durham.  He died at Durham,\r\naged 78, in 1672.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. John Pearson_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Pearson, D.D., was the son of a Clergyman in Norwich, where he was\r\nborn in 1613.  He received the first rudiments of learning at Eton,\r\nwhence he was removed to King’s College, Cambridge, where he finished his\r\nstudies, and took his degrees.  His first ecclesiastical preferment was a\r\nPrebendary of Salisbury; and soon afterwards he was chosen Rector of St.\r\nClements, East Cheap, where he remained till 1660, and where he wrote his\r\nlearned explanation of the Creed.  At the Restoration, he was appointed\r\nArchdeacon of Surrey, and afterwards he was promoted to the See of\r\nChester, where he continued till his death, in 1686.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Goslin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Goslin, a native of Norwich, flourished in the 17th century.  He was\r\nfirst Fellow and then Master of Caius College, in Cambridge, Proctor of\r\nthat University, and thrice Vice Chancellor thereof, a general scholar,\r\neloquent Latinist, and a rare physician, in which faculty he was Regius\r\nProfessor.  He was a great benefactor to Catherine’s Hall, but left his\r\nnative city only the honour of his name.  He died in 1625.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. John Carter_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Carter was an eccentric character in the city during this\r\ncentury.  He was born at Bramford, in Suffolk, in 1594, and became upper\r\nminister of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, which position he held from 1638\r\nto 1653.  He preached three extraordinary sermons before the corporation,\r\npreparatory to the guild day festival in 1644, 1647, and 1650.  The title\r\nof the first is “The Nail Hit on the Head, and Driven into the City and\r\nCathedral Wall of Norwich;” of the second, “The Wheel Turned by a Voice\r\nfrom the Throne of Glory;” and the third, “A Rare Sight; or, the Lyon\r\nSent from a Far Country, and Presented to the City of Norwich in a Sermon\r\nupon the Solemne Guild Day, June 18th, 1650.”  The third sermon fills 150\r\npages, is the length of several modern sermons, and must have occupied\r\ntwo hours and a half in the delivery; a terrible long grace to a guild\r\nday dinner.  It is ornamented with many wood cuts, among which is the\r\nlion in various attitudes, couchant, guardant, rampant, passant, &c.,\r\ngiving the preacher opportunities of displaying his knowledge of, at\r\nleast, the terms of heraldry, and sarcastically to apply them to the\r\nmagistracy.  He says:—\r\n\r\n    “In one respect, your city arms do very well befit you.  It is a lion\r\n    with a castle over it.  Many of you can be like lions, very\r\n    courageous, so long as you have a castle over you for protection and\r\n    countenance; but take away the castle, and who will expose himself to\r\n    danger?  What a sordid thing is this!  There is a lion couchant, but\r\n    never did I hear of a lion crouchant, or current, a fearful and\r\n    dastardly lion.  Who among you will strike down a disorderly\r\n    ale-house, if the brewer that serves it be an alderman, a rich man,\r\n    or a friend?”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the discourse is replete with coarse expressions, biting\r\nsarcasms, and party prejudices, not likely to have edified, and much less\r\nto have pleased the congregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nNonconformity in Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Church of Rome reigned supreme over all Europe for a thousand years,\r\nbut in the 15th century, reason revolted against her authority.\r\nLutheranism and Calvinism were the first forms of the revolt on the\r\nContinent, and they assumed the names of Presbyterianism and Puritanism\r\nin England and Scotland.  Norwich, in common with Norfolk and Suffolk,\r\neventually took up the cause of the Reformation with a zeal and vehemence\r\nwhich make them stand alone in the annals of history.\r\n\r\nNorwich Nonconformists, in times of the fiercest persecution, held many\r\nprohibited meetings, which were sometimes discovered in different parts\r\nof the city.  Norfolk, situated as it is in the eastern coast, was the\r\nrefuge of many protestants, who fled from the Netherlands to escape from\r\nthe severe persecutions of the infamous Duke of Alva.  Even before this\r\ntime, there were many in the county and city who objected to the new\r\nservice book, or English liturgy, published by the authority of Edward\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation made much progress here in the reign of this young and\r\npious king; but even then a disposition lingered to retain and enforce\r\nsome of the Romanist rites and ceremonies.  The excellent Bishop Hooper,\r\nwho after all became a martyr, would probably have lost his life simply\r\nfor refusing to wear the priestly vestments, through the rigour of Bishop\r\nRidley (who himself afterwards suffered martyrdom) had he not at length\r\nconsented to wear them at his consecration.  The Baptists, the\r\nUnitarians, and all who went beyond the new state model were consigned to\r\nthe flames.\r\n\r\nBishop Hooper was born in the year 1495, and was burnt in the reign of\r\nQueen Mary.  The sixty years of his life formed the most important period\r\nof English history.  When he was born, the Reformation had just begun;\r\nwhen he died it had struck such deep roots amongst the people, especially\r\nof Norwich and Norfolk, that neither force, nor persecution, nor argument\r\ncould stop its progress.  In Bishop Hooper’s time, and in his diocese of\r\nGloucester, the ignorance of the clergy was amazing.  Out of 311 of his\r\nclergy he found 168 unable to repeat the ten commandments; 31 out of the\r\n168 could not tell in what part of the Bible the ten commandments were to\r\nbe found; 40 could not tell where the Lord’s prayer was given, and 31 did\r\nnot know who was the author of it.  In Norfolk and Norwich the clergy\r\nwere quite as ignorant of Scripture.  They practised all kinds of\r\nimpositions on the people who were debased by superstition, immorality,\r\nand vice.  There was over all the land a darkness which might be felt.\r\nThe people had no bibles nor testaments, and the prayers of the church\r\nwere all in Latin, and of course the people could not understand them.\r\nThere was scarcely any preaching at all, but instead thereof profane\r\nmiracle plays were performed in the cathedral, and were paid for like any\r\nother dramatic performance.\r\n\r\nIn 1574, so notorious was the city for the nonconformity of many of the\r\nministers, that when orders were given to Archbishop Parker “to punish\r\nthe Puritan ministers, and put down the prophecyings, and readings, and\r\ncommenting on the Scriptures, which had been introduced into the church,”\r\nthe queen gave him private orders to begin with Norwich.  Accordingly, in\r\n1576, many of the Norwich ministers were suspended and treated so\r\nseverely, that even the Norfolk justices presented a petition to Her\r\nMajesty, praying for lenity towards them.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown, a clergyman of Norwich, originated the sect of the\r\nBrownists, afterwards called the Independents.  He was at one time a\r\nzealous promoter of that system, but English societies existed before\r\nhim, holding similar views.  According to Sir Walter Raleigh, 20,000\r\npersons at least held independent principles of ecclesiastical polity.\r\nAmongst these were many men of great learning and distinction, all of\r\nwhom were commanded to quit the realm.  Wherever found, they were\r\nimprisoned, with or without law, for life.  Elias Thacker and John\r\nCopping suffered death at Bury St. Edmund’s.  John Lewis was burnt at\r\nNorwich.  Francis Kett, M.A., for holding “detestable opinions,” was also\r\nburnt alive in Norwich.  William Dennys was a martyr in the same cause,\r\nat Thetford.  Greenwood, Barrow, and Penry fell as martyrs of conscience.\r\nJohnson, Smith, Answorth, Canne, Robinson, and Jacob, only escaped by\r\nflight to Holland, and found liberty there to form several churches, and\r\nto compose an elaborate account of their doctrines and principles, a fact\r\nwhich testifies to their enlightened piety and superior learning.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James I. no favour was shown to the Puritans, but on the\r\ncontrary, severities were continued.  The king amply fulfilled his threat\r\nto the Puritans at the Hampton Court conference;—“_If this be all your\r\nparty has to say_, _I will make them conform or harrie them out of the\r\nland_, _or else do worse_.”  By these proceedings the country was\r\nrendered almost destitute of preachers, and scandalous men undertook the\r\ncare of souls in place of the zealous refugees.  This King James\r\npublished the “Book of Sports,” in vindication of the encouragement of\r\nvarious games on the sabbath day.  Bishop Kennett styles it “A trap to\r\ncatch tender consciences,” and a means of promoting the ease, wealth, and\r\ngrandeur of the bishops.  This book was, in the next reign, (Charles I.)\r\nrepublished by the bigotted Archbishop Laud; and it was ordered to be\r\nread in every church throughout the kingdom.  The bishop of Norwich, then\r\nBishop Wren, was very peremptory on this and other points.  He is said to\r\nhave driven upwards of 3000 persons to seek bread in a foreign land.  The\r\nwoollen trade of Norwich, which had been created by the Flemish refugees,\r\nwas mostly in the hands of the Puritans, and the rigorous measures of\r\nthis prelate nearly destroyed it by banishing them.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Bridge, M.A., was the lecturer of St. George Tombland, Norwich, up\r\nto the year 1637.  He was a pious and learned man, who held other livings\r\nand performed his duties well.  To him, on a certain day, came Bishop\r\nWren’s order to read the “Book of Sports” on the next Sunday in church.\r\nHe sat in dejection, with the odious volume before him, abhorring the\r\nprofaneness of its contents and its daring contradiction of Scripture.\r\nHe resolved not to read it.  He took counsel of his brethren, and several\r\nof them together refused compliance, fled to Yarmouth, and thence with\r\nsad hearts embarked for Holland, where they spent many anxious years,\r\nhoping to be allowed to return.  Laud informed King Charles I. that\r\nBridge had left two livings and a lectureship and had fled to Holland;\r\nand the king wrote against his name this bitter sentence: “_We are well\r\nrid of him_.”  It was an expression worthy of a bigoted and worldly mind.\r\nThus it appears that the reformation was not the work of kings or\r\nbishops, or the great and learned.  The history of those times is the\r\nhistory of persecuting power in opposition to the progress of the\r\nGospel—an opposition the more dreadful inasmuch as it was carried on\r\nunder the pretence of doing service to religion.\r\n\r\nThe Reformed Church of England acknowledged the right of private judgment\r\nin theory, but ignored it in practice.  The Puritans, on the other hand,\r\ncarried it out to its legitimate consequences; and Milton, their great\r\nchampion, advocated absolute freedom of thought and speech as the\r\nbirthright of every man.  No doubt Puritanism ran into some excesses of\r\nbigotry and intolerance, but it was an intolerant age.  Puritanism,\r\nhowever, preserved civil and religious liberty and the right of private\r\njudgment, and perpetuated that right to all sects and classes of the\r\nnation.  Puritanism has been charged with the sin of schism, but the\r\nearly reformers were forced into it by persecution for conscientious\r\nscruples respecting points of doctrine and discipline.  William Bridge,\r\nAsty, Allen, Cromwell, and Fynch, all were thrown out of their livings by\r\nthe Act of Uniformity, and became Nonconformist ministers in Norwich.\r\nWithout any conference the question put to them was, “_Will you upon oath\r\nconform_?”  The answer was, “We cannot.”  Immediate expulsion followed.\r\nWhere, then, was the sin of schism?  Their sin would have been in\r\nconformity.  They would have proved to the world that they were mere\r\nhirelings, like the “Vicar of Bray,” who changed his religion to please\r\nthe reigning sovereign of the day.  Bridge, returning with some others to\r\nhis native county, founded the first Independent church at Yarmouth about\r\n1642.  A year later the church at Norwich was formed into a distinct\r\nbody.  They met at first in a brew-house in St. Edmund’s, afterwards in\r\nthe refectory over the cloisters in the convent formerly belonging to the\r\nBlack Friars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDEPENDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly advert to the rise of the Nonconformist religious\r\ndenominations in this city, and quote a passage from a discourse by the\r\nRev. A. Reed, delivered at the Old Meeting House, Norwich, on February\r\n27th, 1842, on the occasion of the second centenary.  He said,—\r\n\r\n    “There is no doubt that in or about 1641 many refugees returned to\r\n    their homes in Norwich, Yarmouth, and other places.  Those who\r\n    returned to the two former localities had been united together in\r\n    fellowship with the church at Rotterdam.  They earnestly desired\r\n    that, as they had been companions in suffering, they might not cease\r\n    to form one church.  The difficulty was where to fix the joint\r\n    society.  Norwich offered liberty and opportunity.  But the proximity\r\n    of Yarmouth to the sea was desirable for safety.  Early in 1642 they\r\n    met, probably in Norwich, to discuss the point; and agreed to send to\r\n    Rotterdam for leave to gather in fellowship here.  The assent reached\r\n    them in the autumn, authorizing them to form a church at Norwich or\r\n    other place.  On November 23rd, 1642, they met to form a church.\r\n    Most of the members’ names, twelve in all, we find afterwards\r\n    attached to the Norwich covenant.  They did not settle the question\r\n    of place at this meeting.  The Yarmouth church book records a\r\n    resolution to fix the church at Norwich for the present.  They met\r\n    again for this purpose, and the brethren at Norwich, out of an\r\n    earnest desire to finish the work of incorporating a church, yielded\r\n    that the church meetings (i.e. ordinances and meetings for admission\r\n    of members) should be for the present at Yarmouth.  The church was to\r\n    settle with all convenient speed where most liberty and opportunity\r\n    appeared, and wherever the increase of the church was greatest; but\r\n    none of them were required to remove their habitations at present.\r\n    Soon after this agreement, however, the Norwich brethren find these\r\n    concessions too inconvenient; they beg that the church may be settled\r\n    at Norwich, and that the Yarmouth people would remove to the city.\r\n    At length they consent reluctantly to part company, and a separate\r\n    church is formed at Norwich.  But the materials for the society\r\n    already existed, and owing to these facts, the early date of 1642\r\n    appears to me to belong as much to us as to our sister society at\r\n    Yarmouth.”\r\n\r\nThe records of the congregational church at Beccles contain information\r\nof much historic value to all the congregational churches in Norwich,\r\nNorfolk, and Suffolk, and from those records the following particulars\r\nare derived.  On June 10th, 1644, the Church at Norwich in the Old\r\nMeeting House was regularly formed.  Mr. Oxenbridge, assistant pastor at\r\nYarmouth, and several of the Yarmouth brethren were present, when the\r\ncovenant was adopted and signed afresh.  On July 26th, 1647, Mr. Timothy\r\nArmitage was unanimously chosen pastor.  The members were 32 in number.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Mr. Armitage, in 1655, Mr. Thomas Allen, M.A., gave up\r\nthe station he held of “Preacher to the City” in January, 1656, to become\r\npastor of the Old Meeting.  During his long ministry of 17 years, the\r\ncause continued to flourish, the congregation being large.  He died\r\nSeptember 21, 1673.\r\n\r\nOn October 9th, 1675, Mr. John Cromwell was ordained pastor, and Mr.\r\nRobert Asty an assistant pastor.  Mr. Asty was an ejected minister of\r\nSuffolk, an author, and a useful, devout preacher.  Still the church\r\ngrew, and was the centre of much good to the city and county, for many\r\ncongregations were established in Norfolk and Suffolk, at Wymondham,\r\nNorth Walsham, Guestwick, Tunstead, Stalham, Edgefield, and other places.\r\n\r\nThen followed, about 1685, Mr. Martin Fynch, who was an ejected clergyman\r\nof Totney, in Lincolnshire.  An elaborate inscription yet remains on his\r\ntombstone, to record his worth and usefulness.  He was carried to his\r\ngrave on the shoulders of his deacons, amidst great lamentations of the\r\nwhole church and congregation.  About two or three years before his\r\ndeath, a handsome and spacious brick edifice was erected, which is the\r\npresent Old Meeting House.  In 1688, the Revolution promoted the cause of\r\nreligious liberty.  Many distinguished residents in the city now joined\r\nthe nonconformists, and the resources of the society were increased by\r\nendowments left for the benefit of the poor, and other purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. John Stackhouse succeeded Mr. Fynch in 1690, and continued pastor for\r\n17 years.  Towards the close of his pastorate, the church began to suffer\r\nfrom its altered circumstances.  It had become far too worldly for its\r\nspiritual welfare.  The bonds of unity, so long preserved by Christian\r\ncharity, grew weak.  The members divided in reference to the choice of a\r\nco-pastor, and the dispute ran so high, that the minister and most of the\r\ncongregation were actually driven out of their place of worship, and were\r\nobliged to fit up a meeting house in the ruins of the Black Friars’\r\nconvent.  Mr. Stackhouse died without witnessing a reconciliation between\r\nthe mutually offended parties.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Scott left the pastorate of the church of Hitchin, in Herts,\r\nand settled in Norwich in 1709.  The two parties were reconciled under\r\nhis ministry, and he returned to the Old Meeting House about 1717, under\r\nvery favorable auspices.  His son, Mr. Nichol Scott, became his\r\nassistant, and a most unhappy difference on a point of doctrine once more\r\nkindled the flame of discord.  The son was dismissed in 1737, and numbers\r\nof his hearers left with him.  For a time he lectured in the French\r\nChurch, but finding little encouragement, he became a doctor of physic,\r\nand practised in the city.  The father’s mind was so shattered by the\r\ndispute, that he became almost unfit for ministerial work.  He died in\r\n1746.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott was, in his latter years, assisted by Mr. Abraham Tozer, who\r\nnow succeeded to the charge at Norwich.  Dr. Doddridge assisted at his\r\nordination, and Mr. Samuel Wood was chosen co-pastor with Mr. Tozer.  On\r\nthe removal of the latter to Exeter, Mr. Wood, afterwards Dr. Wood, held\r\nthe pastoral office for twenty years.  The church enjoyed, under his\r\ncare, a season of prosperity and peace, and the meeting house was densely\r\ncrowded.  He died, November 2nd, 1767, much lamented.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Newton, who had been assistant preacher, was ordained pastor\r\nFebruary 16th, 1768, and continued in the office fifty-six years.  He\r\ngave the second list of the whole number of members, which had increased\r\nto 108.  He had five assistants in succession.  Mr. Hull was the last\r\nassistant, and on the death of Mr. Newton, June 29th, 1809, succeeded him\r\nin the pastoral office.  The number of members increased to 112 in 1811,\r\nand to 156 in 1820.  Mr. Hull officiated fourteen years, and then\r\nresigned in consequence of a disagreement with the deacons.  He became a\r\nchurch clergyman and perpetual curate of St. Gregory’s in this city.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Stephen Morell removed from Exeter and was chosen pastor in June\r\n17th, 1824, and he died in October of the same year.  The church next\r\ninvited the services of the Rev. J. B. Innes, of Weymouth, in 1825, and\r\nbeing chosen pastor, he continued in the office twelve years.  He died in\r\nApril, 1837.  He was greatly beloved by his personal friends, and his\r\ncharacter and talents were held in general esteem.\r\n\r\nThe vacant office was next filled by the Rev. J. H. Godwin, who was\r\nordained to it on December 6th, 1837.  After fulfilling the pastoral\r\nduties for two years, he became resident tutor of Highbury College.  The\r\nRev. A. Reed was then invited to fill the office, and became pastor over\r\na church of 190 members.  He continued till 1855, and then removed to a\r\nwider sphere of labour.  The Rev. John Hallett was invited in the\r\nfollowing year, and is now the esteemed minister of the church.  Mr.\r\nHallett, in a recent contribution to the pages of the _Evangelical\r\nMagazine_ on the history of the Old Meeting House, says:—\r\n\r\n    “The Rev. A. Reed, B.A., now of St. Leonard’s, was Mr. Godwin’s\r\n    successor till 1855.  Under his superintendence, bicentenary\r\n    services, commemorating the foundation of the church, were held,\r\n    which, judging from published and oral reports, must have been of a\r\n    stirring and deeply interesting character.  Spacious school-rooms\r\n    were erected, and large day-schools established.  Many still live in\r\n    our midst who gratefully attest the faithfulness and success of Mr.\r\n    Reed’s pastorate.\r\n\r\n    “In April, 1856, the writer was, he believes, divinely led to occupy\r\n    the vacant post.  For obvious reasons, the history of the last twelve\r\n    years must remain untold.  It may, however, be stated that the\r\n    present pastor, like his predecessor, has had the privilege of\r\n    celebrating a bicentenary.  For reasons before assigned, it will\r\n    probably be conceded that nowhere was it more proper that a\r\n    bicentenary commemoration of the ejectment of 1662 should be held\r\n    than in this Old Meeting House, and that a more fitting way of\r\n    commemorating it could not be devised than that of enfranchising the\r\n    building in which some of them laboured, and the ‘yard’ in which they\r\n    sleep.  This was accordingly done.  The premises, which were\r\n    leasehold, and the lease of which was nearly expired, were purchased\r\n    and repaired at a large outlay, and then put in trust for the\r\n    denomination.  ‘Thus, for nearly two centuries, has the Lord\r\n    preserved to Himself a worshipping people in this place.  Thousands\r\n    have found this ancient sanctuary the very ‘House of God,’ and,\r\n    literally, ‘the gate of Heaven,’ and are now enjoying the full glory\r\n    they anticipated here.  And,’ adds my predecessor, with a\r\n    thankfulness and faith in which I fully share, ‘still the waters flow\r\n    strong and deep, and the banks are green with promise, and through\r\n    future ages the brook shall not be dried up, but with purer, wider,\r\n    stronger, and more fertilizing current, shall form one of those\r\n    millennial streams wherewith the whole earth shall be watered as a\r\n    fruitful garden of the Lord.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Martin Hood Wilkin, in his life of Joseph Kinghorn, gives the\r\nfollowing account of the origin of the Baptist denomination.  A General\r\n(Arminian) Baptist Church was formed in Norwich in 1686 by the learned\r\nand zealous Thomas Grantham.  They purchased a part of the White Friars’\r\nPriory in St. James’s, on the site of which they built the Meeting House\r\nnow known as the Priory Yard Chapel.  From this Church several members\r\nseparated at a very early period and formed the Particular (Calvinistic)\r\nBaptist Church, over which Mr. Kinghorn afterwards presided.  Of its\r\nhistory he has left a somewhat elaborate sketch in the notes of the last\r\nsermon he preached in the Meeting House, in St. Mary’s, before it was\r\ntaken down in 1811.  He says,\r\n\r\n    “Of the origin of this Church I find no record.  The first date in\r\n    our old Church book is 1691.  In 1693, we find an account of\r\n    admonition given to a brother who had, ‘for several years past,’\r\n    withdrawn himself from the Communion of the Church. * * * I find a\r\n    statement of the sentiments of the Church in that time, entitled,\r\n    ‘The several articles of our faith, in which with one accord we\r\n    agree.’  Of the state of the Church I can say but little.  A list of\r\n    55 members follows, which appears to have been the number at that\r\n    time.  Of their minister I can say still less, except that the second\r\n    and third articles in the book are drawn up with that precision which\r\n    marks the junction of talent and education, especially at a time when\r\n    few had any claim to the advantages of a classical education.  One of\r\n    these is signed ‘Edward Williams, pastor.’ * * * * At this time our\r\n    ancestors met for the worship of God in the ‘Granary,’ in St.\r\n    Michael’s Coslany.  Their baptisms were performed in the river.  At\r\n    one period, a friend had premises convenient, and in the memory of\r\n    some now alive, they were used for that purpose; but such is the\r\n    effect of habit, that the prejudice in favour of a mode so primitive\r\n    continued some time after better conveniences were obtained.  From\r\n    this period nothing of importance is to be discovered till 1745.\r\n    Then the premises which stood on this spot were purchased and the\r\n    Meeting (house) was erected, which was nearly two-thirds the size of\r\n    the present building.  When it was finished I do not find, but from a\r\n    private record I am informed, that Mr. Lindoe, who for many years was\r\n    an honourable and valued deacon, was the first person baptised in\r\n    this house, and this was on March 15th, 1746.  From this period, for\r\n    some time, the Church seems to have worn a flourishing appearance on\r\n    the whole.  They had a minister, Mr. John Stearne, who was evidently\r\n    a superior man.  He died in July, 1755.  Rev. George Simson, M.A.,\r\n    from Cambridge, accepted a call from Mr. Stearne’s Church, went to\r\n    Norwich, in 1758, continued there two or three years, and then\r\n    removed to Warwick, where he had formerly been pastor, and where,\r\n    weighed down by age and infirmities, he died suddenly in 1763.  After\r\n    this period there was an evident decline for some years, though to\r\n    what extent I am not able to say.  Afterwards there was an appearance\r\n    of prosperity.  In 1766 I find a list of members again, amounting to\r\n    59, the largest number hitherto met with, but alas! after that\r\n    period, there was much to be lamented.  There was the evil conduct of\r\n    some, and a spirit of division in others, which all tended to\r\n    mischief. * * * * But we are now approaching a period within the\r\n    remembrance of many of you, in which it will be useless to attempt to\r\n    trace the history of events which you know.  Suffice it then, to say\r\n    that causes already mentioned brought the Church and congregation\r\n    down to a very low ebb, when Mr. David, whose name I have heard so\r\n    many of you repeat with esteem and affection, first came here.  On\r\n    his ordination, the list of members that appeared in the Church book,\r\n    and which included all the members as they stood at that time, was\r\n    only 31; and now events took a turn.  The short period of his life\r\n    was distinguished by its utility.  The Meeting House became too small\r\n    for the congregation, and in 1783, it was enlarged to its present\r\n    size.”\r\n\r\nSuch is Mr. Kinghorn’s account (condensed) of the early Baptist Churches.\r\nAfter a visit to the North, he returned to Norwich in July, 1789, and\r\nthen commenced the long career of his ministry at St. Mary’s Chapel,\r\nthough the invitation to the pastoral office was not received till some\r\nmonths afterwards.  He rigidly adhered to what is called “strict\r\ncommunion” in his Church, admitting only those who had been immersed to\r\nthe Lord’s supper; and on this point he maintained a long controversy\r\nwith Mr. Robert Hall, of Bristol, who advocated “free communion” with all\r\nbelievers in a Work published in 1815.  The Rev. J. Kinghorn was much\r\nesteemed by his numerous friends, including Mrs. Opie, J. J. Gurney,\r\nEsq., Rev. J. Alexander, Bishop Bathurst, Mr. W. Wilkin, Mr. W. Taylor,\r\nand others, of Norwich, and many more men of learning all over the\r\ncountry.  He took rank among the Nonconformists with Mr. R. Hall of\r\nBristol, Mr. Foster, the author of _Essays on Decision of Character_, Mr.\r\nInnes, and Mr. James A. Haldane, of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe following TRIBUTARY LINES are by MRS. OPIE, on hearing it said that\r\nJ. Kinghorn “was fit to die.”\r\n\r\n    “Hail! words of truth, that Christian comfort give!\r\n    But then the ‘fit to die,’ how fit to live!\r\n    To live a bright example to mankind,\r\n    ‘Feet to the lame and eyesight to the blind!’\r\n    To lift the lamp, the word of God, on high;\r\n    To point to Calvary’s mount the sinner’s eye;\r\n    To tread the path the first Apostles trod,\r\n    And earn that precious name, ‘a man of God.’\r\n    He lived whom Christian hearts deplore,\r\n    And hence the grief—he lives for us no more.\r\n    But faith exulting joins the general cry,\r\n    He, fit to live, was greatly fit to die!”\r\n\r\nMr. Kinghorn was succeeded by the Rev. W. Brock, who was the esteemed\r\npastor for many years, and is now the minister of Bloomsbury Chapel,\r\nLondon.  He was followed by the present minister, the Rev. G. Gould.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Calvinistic Methodists in Norwich seem to have been originated by Mr.\r\nJames Wheatley, who came to the city about 1750, and preached at first in\r\nthe open-air, on Tombland and the Castle Hill.  Great excitement was\r\nproduced, and a temporary building was soon erected, and called the\r\nTabernacle.  The site has been changed, but the name is still retained.\r\nThe present Tabernacle was built in 1784.\r\n\r\nThe Wesleyan Methodists first appeared in Norwich in 1754, when the Revs.\r\nJohn and Charles Wesley visited the city, and the Rev. J. Wesley preached\r\nhere for some time, and on leaving, appointed Mr. T. Oliver in his room.\r\nOne of his successors was the Rev. R. Robinson, afterwards at Cambridge,\r\nwho also preached for some time at the Tabernacle; and another was Dr.\r\nAdam Clarke, the learned Commentator, who was appointed in 1783, but left\r\nin 1785.  Their first chapel was built in 1769, in Cherry Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nSocial State of the City from the Fourteenth to the Eighteenth Centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE we proceed to chronicle the leading local events of the 18th\r\ncentury, it may not be altogether unprofitable to review briefly the\r\nsocial state of the city during some 300 or 400 years preceding.  In\r\ndoing this we may now and then have to advert to matters to which we have\r\nalluded already; but at the risk even of an occasional repetition, it\r\nwill be worth while—in order to help our readers to appreciate subsequent\r\nimprovements at their proper worth—to consider a little more minutely\r\nthan we have yet done, the physical circumstances under which the\r\ncitizens have lived in former centuries, and the various influences to\r\nwhich they have been subject.\r\n\r\nA “Chapter of Horrors” might be written, descriptive of the plagues,\r\npestilences, famines, floods, and fires, which devastated the city and\r\ncounty for 300 years.  It would seem as if the darkness and gloom of the\r\nphysical world corresponded at times with the superstitions and vices of\r\nthe people.  The dark ages were ages of terrible calamities, and England\r\nwas then a terrible country to live in.  Plagues and pestilences now and\r\nagain desolated the whole land, and Norfolk and Norwich did not escape\r\nthe ravages of diseases emphatically named the “Black Death.”\r\nExaggerated accounts must have been given of the desolations caused by\r\nthese various scourges, or else both city and county must have more than\r\nonce lost the great part of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBlomefield is responsible for very dark pictures indeed; but his\r\nstatements, right or wrong, have been endorsed by later compilers of\r\nlocal history.  We are told, by one writer, for instance, that:—\r\n\r\n    “In 1348, the plague, which had lately ravaged the greatest part of\r\n    the known world, broke out in this city; wherein there died,\r\n    according to the most credible accounts, within the space of twelve\r\n    months, upwards of 57,000 persons, besides religious and beggars; and\r\n    this will not appear very surprising, when we consider that in some\r\n    places not one-fifth part of the people were left alive, and that\r\n    Norwich was more populous at that time than it has ever been since.\r\n    It then contained sixty churches, besides conventual ones, within the\r\n    walls; and the large parishes of Heigham and Pockthorpe, and the\r\n    large chapel of St. Mary Magdalene without them.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the astounding statement in a local history printed by John\r\nCrouse, in 1768.  Where he got his “credible accounts” he does not say,\r\nand he moreover gives the statement of the Domesday Book, that in 1086,\r\nthe city contained only 1565 burgesses; so that the population must have\r\nincreased in 250 years to a most fabulous extent, for 57,000 persons to\r\nhave died of the plague in 1348.  In 1377, a census was taken of some\r\nlarge towns, and Norwich was then found to contain 5300 people.  But in\r\ntruth the number, 57,000, very probably applied to the whole diocese, for\r\nthe same local history states:—\r\n\r\n    “This severe visitation was not confined to the city alone, but\r\n    cruelly extended itself all over the diocese; so that in many\r\n    monasteries and religious houses, there were scarce two out of twenty\r\n    left alive.  From the register book it appears that in the course of\r\n    the year there were 863 institutions.  The clergy dying so fast, that\r\n    they were obliged to induct into livings numbers of youths who had\r\n    but just received the tonsure.”\r\n\r\nThe register in question was, no doubt, one of the whole diocese.\r\n\r\nIn 1361 there happened a great dearth, attended by the plague; this was\r\ncalled the second pestilence.  And on January 15th, in the same year,\r\nthere arose so furious a storm of wind from the south west, as to throw\r\ndown the tower of the cathedral, which falling on the choir demolished a\r\ngreat part of it.  The storm raged violently for six or seven days, and\r\nwas succeeded by a prodigious fall of rain, which occasioned incredible\r\ndamage by inundations.  Where the inundations occurred is not stated in\r\nthe local history, but if in the city the damage must have been great\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nIn 1369, the plague broke out afresh and carried off great numbers of\r\npeople very suddenly.  Yet in 1371, the citizens were commanded to\r\nfurnish the king with a good barge, sufficiently equipped for war to\r\nserve against his enemies, the French and Spaniards.  This does not\r\nindicate that the city had been almost depopulated only a few years\r\nbefore.  Indeed, during all this time the citizens had been doing their\r\nbest by legal contests to hinder Yarmouth being made a staple town,\r\nthough they did not succeed.\r\n\r\nAbout 1390 a great mortality broke out in the city, occasioned by the\r\npeople eating unwholesome food; and this not so much from a scarcity of\r\ncorn as of money to purchase it.  The plague raged greatly in Norfolk and\r\nin many other counties, and was nearly equal in severity to the first\r\ngreat pestilence.  So states the local narrative which we have just\r\nquoted; and yet, according to the census of 1377, as already stated, the\r\npopulation was only 5300!  What reliance then can be placed on such\r\naccounts?  The calamities recorded were, no doubt, sufficiently awful\r\nwithout the aid of exaggeration.\r\n\r\nIn 1578, the plague again broke out, and continued to rage nearly two\r\nyears; destroying 2335 natives and 2482 strangers.  During the infection,\r\nit was ordered that every person coming from an infected house, should\r\ncarry in his hand a small wand two feet in length; and that no such\r\nperson should appear at any court or public place, or be present at any\r\nsermon; and that the inscription, “Lord have mercy on us,” should be\r\nplaced over the door of every infected house, and there remain until the\r\nhouse had been clear of the infection for one month at least.\r\n\r\nIn 1583, the plague broke out once more, and 800 or 900 persons died of\r\nit, chiefly “strangers;” and in 1588, the same disease again raged in the\r\ncity, but not very violently.  Notwithstanding all these awful\r\nvisitations, no proper sanitary measures appear to have been adopted.\r\n\r\nIn 1593, there happened so great a drought, that many cattle perished for\r\nwant of water; but it is stated that in the year following it scarcely\r\nceased raining, day or night, from June 21st to the end of July.\r\n\r\nIn 1602, the plague again raged with almost unprecedented fury, there\r\ndying thereof 30,578 in London, and 3076 in Norwich.  This visitation,\r\nmoreover, was attended with so great a scarcity, that wheat sold for ten,\r\nrye for six, and barley for five shillings a bushel—a very high price in\r\nthose days; and the poor in the city must then have been in a dreadful\r\nstate of destitution.  Again, in the summer of 1609, the city was visited\r\nby its former scourge, though but few died of it.  The mayor received a\r\nletter from the privy council to keep up the ancient strictness and\r\nseverity of lent, as if the poor had not fasted long enough!\r\n\r\nIn 1625, we find that something like sanitary measures were begun.  On\r\nJuly 12th of that year, the mayor received a commission authorising the\r\nbody corporate to levy a tax on all the inhabitants, to be applied\r\ntowards scouring the ditches, and the removal of all nuisances in and\r\nabout the city, the better to prevent the spreading of the plague which\r\nhad lately broken out in Yarmouth, having been occasioned by the arrival\r\nthere of some infected persons.  These precautions not having the desired\r\neffect, the Black Tower, then on Butter Hills, was fitted up for the\r\nreception of the afflicted poor.  In September, about 40 died in a week,\r\nand the plague raged till May, 1626, when it began to abate.  As many as\r\n1431 persons died while the disease continued.\r\n\r\nIn 1646, the plague again made its appearance in Norwich, but its effects\r\nwere not very fatal.  In 1665, however, it broke out once more, and made\r\ndreadful ravages; carrying off 2251 persons.  During its continuance, at\r\nthe instance of the County Magistrates, the Market was held in the Town\r\nClose, and the City was not quite cleared of the disease till the end of\r\n1667.  The Bishop then ordered September 19th to be observed as a day of\r\ngeneral thanksgiving to God for His great mercy in putting a stop to the\r\npestilence.  All quite right and proper, but had there been more\r\ncleansing as well as praying, the city might not have suffered so\r\nseverely.  The Corporation had utterly and entirely ignored its chief\r\nduty in regard to all sanitary rules and regulations.  There was scarcely\r\nan apology for a system of drainage, and never a sufficient supply of\r\nwater.  The poor people were cooped up in narrow yards, courts, and\r\nstreets, and, on account of high prices, could seldom obtain wholesome\r\nfood.  They had a terrible revenge in these direful plagues, which\r\ndestroyed the rich in their fine houses, as well as the poor in their\r\nhovels.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the social state of the city during this period may be\r\nformed from a few gleanings from the City Records, from which it will\r\nappear, that from the 14th till the 18th century, though the authorities\r\nneglected to improve the sanitary condition of the city, they took great\r\ncare to protect the people from frauds of brewers, traders, and\r\nmanufacturers, who were at least strongly suspected of being addicted to\r\ndishonest practices.  Mr. R. Fitch, of this city, has published some\r\ninteresting notices of “Brewers’ Marks and Trade Regulations.”  These are\r\nof great historical interest, and we therefore make no apology to our\r\nreaders for reproducing the following extracts:—\r\n\r\n    “Scarcely a trade was exempt from these regulations, some of which\r\n    were attended with espionage so peculiar and strict as to lead us to\r\n    wonder why public opinion, although in those days admittedly weak,\r\n    was not so far aroused as, by its own voice, to free the community\r\n    from some of the petty, if not the heavier restrictions.\r\n\r\n    “Brewers, we discover, had especial symbols of their own, which they\r\n    registered when licensed to follow their occupations, and it was also\r\n    found that these marks were borne by successive followers of the same\r\n    trade, until the business of succeeding firms became extinguished by\r\n    the death or retirement of the last of a long line of brewers, and\r\n    then only did the particular symbol fall into disuse.\r\n\r\n    “From the year 1606 to 1725, no less than fifty separate marks have\r\n    been found in the City of Norwich, some of them being borne as\r\n    symbolical of a particular brew-house, by eight or nine persons, who\r\n    followed each other in one and the same occupation.  These marks were\r\n    noted in a variety of documents, belonging to the Corporation, one\r\n    preserved in their muniment room.  They appeared, for instance, in a\r\n    ‘Brewer’s book,’ or the book of the ‘Clarke of the Market,’ and in\r\n    books recording the proceeding of city courts and assemblies.  The\r\n    following extracts taken from the ‘Brewers’ Book’ relate to the\r\n    government of all brewers’ houses and tippling houses, fully bearing\r\n    out the opinion previously expressed as regards the strictness of the\r\n    laws by which such places were regulated.\r\n\r\n    “‘The enquirie for Brewers to ye Booke of ye Clarke of ye Market, and\r\n    is taken out of his booke:—\r\n\r\n    “‘Items, to be enquired of Ale brewers; whether they brewe their ale\r\n    of anie maner of fustie, dustie, or wealved maulte, mixed or mingled\r\n    with any hoppes, roson, chalke, or any other noisome or unwholesome\r\n    corn or liquor.\r\n\r\n    “‘And yt they make noe rawe ale or long roping ale, keeping their Ale\r\n    fixed, yt is to say, twelve pence highning and twelve pence lowning\r\n    in a quarter of maulte.  For when ye mace buy a quart of maulte for\r\n    two shillings, then ye may sell a gallon of ye best ale for an halfe\r\n    penny; three shillings, three farthings; foure shillings, foure\r\n    farthings; five shillings, five farthings; six shillings, six\r\n    farthings; seven shillings, seven farthings; eight shillings, eight\r\n    farthings; nine shillings, nine farthings; and so forth and no\r\n    further.\r\n\r\n    “‘And to sell a quarte of the best ale for a halfe penny, with\r\n    measures true sized, and sealed according to the King’s standard, and\r\n    doing the contrarie to be punished.\r\n\r\n    “Thus it appears that brewing was a very ancient business in this\r\n    city in the 16th century, and the best ale was sold for a half penny\r\n    per quart before the iniquitous malt-tax was imposed.\r\n\r\n    “The following are extracts from the statutes, &c.\r\n\r\n    “‘Statute 23, Henry 8.  That no Brewer shall hence forth occupie ye\r\n    misterie or craft of coupers, no make any barrells, &c., wherein they\r\n    shall put their beer or ale.  Penalty 3d. 4d. for every vessell.\r\n\r\n    “‘Every vessell to be made of seasonable wood, and marked with ye\r\n    coupers’ mark, ye contents of every vessell for Beer, as above said\r\n    or more.\r\n\r\n    “‘Coupers not to inhance ye prices of vessells, but keepe this rate,\r\n    on forfeit of 3d. 4d. for every vessell, defective or enhanced, viz.\r\n    Barrell for beer, ixd.; Kynderkyn, vd.; Ferkyn, iijd.; Ale Barrell,\r\n    xvjd.; Kynderkyn, ixd.; Ferkyn, vd.  Brewers not to put Beer or Ale\r\n    to sale but in Barrells, &c., conteyning as above said.  And to sell\r\n    at such prices as affixed by ye Justices of ye Peace of ye County, or\r\n    Maior, Sheriff, or other head officers of City, Borough, and Town\r\n    Corporate, under forfeiture as above, under Beere brewers out of\r\n    Clarke of Markets book, half to ye king, and half to him who will\r\n    sue.’”\r\n\r\n    “No doubt other traders, as well as brewers and keepers of tippling\r\n    houses, were regulated by corresponding laws.  Indeed this appears\r\n    from the records and orders in the books of the corporate assembly.\r\n    In the 8th year of Edward IV., the mayor issued an order in the name\r\n    of the king, that brewers were not to sell yeast, but to give it away\r\n    to whoever wanted it, as it had been freely given away time out of\r\n    mind.  By the 4th and 5th of Philip and Mary, it was enacted that:—”\r\n\r\n    “No bere bruer to brewe nor sell to any typpler, or other person, any\r\n    bere called doble doble bere, but only two sorts of bere, viz., best\r\n    bere and small bere, upon forfeit of ye beer and cask.”\r\n\r\n    “According to the Brewers’ Assembly book, 30th July, 1657, the\r\n    brewers agreed, by reason of 2/6 excise per barrel, that they would\r\n    not sell any strong beer to any ale-house keeper, under 12/- per\r\n    barrel of beer, and excise.  It was also agreed in August, 1657, that\r\n    ale-house keepers might sell one wine quart of strong beer for a\r\n    penny.  There were three sorts of beer of different prices, viz.,\r\n    4/-, 6/-, and 10/- per barrel, beside excise.  The brewers of beer\r\n    petitioned strongly against the tax of 2/6 per barrel, as a great\r\n    hardship and injustice.  The names of 40 brewers are recorded in this\r\n    city, from 1600 to 1725.”\r\n\r\n    “Brewers’ marks are entered as early as 1606, and as late as 1725.\r\n    The mark, No. 1, John Boyce, was first borne by Henry Woodes, in\r\n    1606, and after him by five successive brewers, ending with this John\r\n    Boyce, in 1725.  As yet, the regulations relating to trade marks\r\n    generally are very imperfectly known, leaving a wide field of\r\n    research to those who desire further information.  The same marks\r\n    passed from one brewer to his successors, and they were held in all\r\n    their integrity, till within a century and a half of our own time.\r\n    It would be an important contribution to local history, if all the\r\n    rules relating to trade could be collected and elucidated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nNorwich in the Eighteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Reformation had now become an established fact in the Churches of\r\nEngland and Scotland; the glorious Revolution of 1688 had been\r\naccomplished; the civil wars were over, and the country enjoyed a long\r\nperiod of repose.  Local events had, it is true, become of less\r\nimportance, because less connected with general history; but the\r\nnarrative will not be the less interesting to local readers.  Walls and\r\ngates still surrounded the old city, and confined it within narrow\r\nlimits.  All the principal streets within the walls were now built.  The\r\npopulation had increased to 28,000, the working classes being chiefly\r\nemployed in textile manufactures, which were in great demand all over\r\nEurope.  The operatives were well employed and well paid during the\r\ngreater part of this century.  It was, in short, a flourishing period in\r\nthe history of Norwich, as regards its manufactures and its trade.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne was proclaimed here on March 12th, 1701, and was crowned on\r\nApril 3rd, 1702, with extraordinary exhibitions of joy.  In this year,\r\ntoo, the art of printing, which had been for some time discontinued here,\r\nwas revived, and Francis Burgess soon afterwards opened a printing office\r\nnear the Red Well.  In 1701, the first newspaper, called the Norwich\r\nGazette, was published by Henry Cosgrove, he being assisted in the\r\nundertaking by the celebrated Edward Cave, the original planner and\r\nfounder of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, which was first published in 1731.\r\nThe Gazette was subsequently enlarged, and called the _Norfolk Chronicle\r\nand Norwich Gazette_, published by Messrs. Stevenson and Matchett.  The\r\nformer gentleman was a learned antiquarian, and published “The\r\nAntiquities of Ely.”\r\n\r\nIn 1705, the Weavers’ Hall was broken open, and the books were destroyed,\r\nsince which time the custom of sealing stuffs has been disused.  What was\r\nthe cause of the tumult does not appear.\r\n\r\nIn 1706, a great part of the city was laid under water by two violent\r\nfloods, both of which happened in the month of November.\r\n\r\nIn 1711, the first act was passed for erecting workhouses, &c., in this\r\ncity; by which it was provided—\r\n\r\n    “That from and after the first day of May, 1712, there shall be a\r\n    corporation to continue for ever, within the said city of Norwich and\r\n    county of the same, and liberties thereof, consisting of mayor,\r\n    recorder, and steward, justices of the peace, sheriffs, and aldermen\r\n    of the said city for the time being, and of thirty-two other persons\r\n    of the most honest, discreet, and charitable inhabitants of the said\r\n    city and county, in the four great wards of the said city, and the\r\n    towns, and out parishes in the county of the said city, in such\r\n    manner as is hereinafter expressed, and the said thirty-two persons\r\n    shall be elected on the third day of May next ensuing, or within\r\n    three days after, at an assembly of the said city, for that purpose\r\n    to be held, by the votes of the mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and\r\n    commonalty, in common council assembled, or of the major part of them\r\n    present.”\r\n\r\nThen follow the provisions of the act by which all the parishes in the\r\ncity were incorporated for the relief of the poor.  The Court of\r\nGuardians was constituted, and empowered to assess to the poor rates all\r\nlands, houses, tenements, tithes, stock, and personal estates.  The\r\nassessment of stock and personal estate, as may be easily imagined,\r\ncaused great dissatisfaction amongst the rate-payers possessed of\r\nproperty, and was abolished in 1827, when a new act was obtained which\r\nconsiderably altered the constitution of the court.  This act was further\r\namended by another passed in 1831, and that was superseded in 1863, by\r\nthe act at this time in force.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, the steeple of the new Hall, now St. Andrew’s Hall, fell down\r\nand was never rebuilt.\r\n\r\nIn 1713, the Duke of Ormond was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk and\r\nNorwich, in the room of Lord Townshend.\r\n\r\nGeorge I. was proclaimed here on the 3rd of August, 1714, two days after\r\nQueen Anne died.\r\n\r\nIn 1714 a Bethel was built for the reception of poor lunatics by Mrs.\r\nMary Chapman—one of the first charitable foundations in this country for\r\nthose unhappy persons.  In 1717 she endowed the same by her will, in\r\nwhich is the following pious clause:—\r\n\r\n    “Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to visit and afflict some of my\r\n    nearest relations with lunacy, but has blessed me with the use of my\r\n    reason and understanding; as a monument of my thankfulnesss for this\r\n    invaluable mercy, I settle Bethel, &c., for this purpose.”\r\n\r\nShe was the widow of the Rev. Mr. Chapman, minister of St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nIn 1715, in consequence of the rebellion in the north, an artillery\r\ncompany of 100 men was first raised in Norwich.  William Hall, Esq., was\r\ntheir captain.\r\n\r\nOn January 8th of the same year, Sir Peter Seaman, an Alderman, died and\r\nleft provision for binding out two poor city boys yearly.  On December\r\n17th of the same year, Thomas Hall, Esq., merchant, died.  He founded a\r\nmonthly sacramental lecture; bequeathed several legacies to charities,\r\nand left £100 for a gold chain to be worn by the Mayor of Norwich, and\r\nwhich is the same as is now worn by the deputy mayor.  It weighs 23 ozs.\r\n6 dwts.  Mr. Hall was interred with great funeral pomp at St. George’s\r\nColegate.  His portrait was presented by John and Edward Taylor, Esqs.,\r\nto the corporation, and was placed in the common council chamber, May,\r\n1821.\r\n\r\nAn act was passed in 1722 for the better qualifying of the manufacturers\r\nof stuffs and yarns to act as magistrates, and for regulating the\r\nelections of such officers.\r\n\r\nAbout this time another act was passed for clearing, deepening,\r\nextending, maintaining, and improving the haven and piers of Great\r\nYarmouth, and for deepening the rivers flowing into the harbour; and also\r\nfor preserving ships wintering in the haven from accidents by fire.  For\r\nthese purposes certain duties were to be paid for 21 years after Lady\r\nday, 1723, on all goods unladen in the haven of Yarmouth, or in the sea\r\ncalled Yarmouth roads.  This act was very important to the navigation\r\nbetween Yarmouth and Norwich.\r\n\r\nIn 1724 the Sheriff’s Office was rebuilt, and the statue of Justice\r\nplaced on the Guildhall.  Alderman Norman died the same year, and left an\r\nestate in Norwich for charitable purposes.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the society of “Free and Accepted Masons” appeared\r\npublicly in this city.  Mr. Prideaux, son of the Rev. Dr. Prideaux, Dean\r\nof Norwich, author of “The Connection between the Old and New\r\nTestaments,” was the first Master here.  Their lodge was at the Maid’s\r\nHead Inn.  B. Bond Cabbell, Esq., has within the last few years bought\r\nthe old Assembly Rooms in Theatre Street for the Order.\r\n\r\nOn September 28th, 1725, a petition was presented to the mayor and\r\ncorporation, signed by the principal traders in Norwich, requesting the\r\nuse of the New Hall in St. Andrew’s for an Exchange, which was\r\nimmediately granted.  On October 4th of the same year, the court,\r\nattended by nearly 200 gentlemen and principal tradesmen, came to the New\r\nHall in St. Andrew’s, which was then opened and solemnly proclaimed to be\r\nan exchange, on which occasion the Recorder (Stephen Gardiner, Esq.)\r\ndelivered the following address:—\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen,—This place is now opened with an intent to promote\r\n    traffic and commerce.  Here, formerly, God was worshipped, though in\r\n    a corrupt manner; and may the consideration of the sacred use this\r\n    building has been put to so far influence all that shall resort\r\n    hither, that nothing in the course of business may be here transacted\r\n    but with great justice and honesty.  I wish success to this\r\n    undertaking, and the prosperity of the city in every respect.”\r\n\r\nThe hall continued open as an exchange only one year, and it was open\r\nevery day in the week except Saturdays and Sundays, which proves that a\r\nconsiderable mercantile trade must have been carried on in the city at\r\nthat time.  Soon afterwards was begun the impolitic system of local\r\ntaxation in trade, which has almost ruined Lynn and Yarmouth, and which\r\ngreatly retarded the prosperity of Norwich.  In 1725 the corporation\r\nobtained an act, which came into operation on May 1st, 1726, for levying\r\ntolls upon all goods or merchandise brought up the river higher than\r\nThorpe Hall.  The dues were to be applied towards rebuilding the walls\r\nand bridges, &c., but this was done to a very small extent.\r\n\r\nOn February 24th, 1726, in consequence of the proceedings of the\r\nPretender, Charles Stuart, who endeavoured to secure the crown of\r\nEngland, a loyal address of the corporation was presented to King George\r\nI. by the city members.  That monarch died at the palace of the Bishop of\r\nOsnaburgh, on his way to Hanover, on June 11th, 1727.\r\n\r\nGeorge II. and his Queen Caroline were crowned on October 11th, 1727, and\r\nthere was a grand illumination and bonfire here in honour of the event.\r\n\r\nIn 1729 an act was passed for the better regulating the city elections,\r\nand for preserving the peace, good order, and government of the city; and\r\nat an assembly on the Guild eve, the mayor and aldermen of Norwich first\r\nsat in the council chamber, and the common council in their own room; for\r\nby that act a majority of each body was required to a corporate order,\r\nwhilst, before it passed, the two bodies sat, debated, and voted\r\ntogether.  In 1730, under this act, three nominees for each of the four\r\ngreat wards were first elected, who returned the remaining number of\r\ncommon councilmen, sixty in the whole.\r\n\r\nIn 1730, the _Norwich Mercury_ was first issued by William Chase.  It was\r\nafterwards published for many years by the late Mr. Richard Mackenzie\r\nBacon and Mr. Kinnebrook.  Mr. R. M. Bacon was the editor, and one of the\r\nmost talented men who ever appeared in this city as a political writer\r\nand critic.  He was the author of “The Elements of Vocal Science,” and\r\nother works.\r\n\r\nAt the quarterly assembly held in 1730, on St. Matthias’ day, 161 freemen\r\nwere admitted and sworn, and afterwards it was reported by the committee,\r\nappointed for that purpose, that they had treated with St. George’s\r\nCompany, who had agreed to resign their books, charters, and records,\r\ninto the hands of the corporation, which was done accordingly, and the\r\npower of the company ceased.  In consequence of this, the form of a\r\nprocession was arranged for the Guild day instead of that formerly\r\nexhibited, by the St. George’s Company.  It was further ordered that, for\r\nthe future, every mayor shall be excused making a Guild breakfast, or\r\nholding any mayor’s feasts in May or August, as heretofore, and that, in\r\nlieu thereof, the new mayor shall make a feast, on the day on which he is\r\nsworn, at the New Hall, and there entertain the recorder, steward,\r\nsheriffs, justices, aldermen, and their ladles, and the common\r\ncouncilmen; and every mayor who makes such a feast shall be entitled to\r\nthe sum of £100, to be paid by the chamberlain immediately after the said\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\nIn 1732, Sherers’ Cross, commonly called Charing Cross, a neat ancient\r\nstone pillar, was taken down.  The cross was so called from the sheermen\r\nor cloth cutters, who principally dwelt in this part of the city.  The\r\ncorner house, in the reign of Edward II., belonged to Christopher\r\nShere-hill, or at Sherers’ hill.  In the same year the old Market Cross\r\nwas demolished, being sadly out of repair.\r\n\r\nIn 1733, July 11th, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Walpole, of Houghton in\r\nNorfolk, was, in person, sworn a freeman of the corporation, and\r\npresented by the mayor with a copy of his freedom in a gold box.\r\n\r\nIn 1734, Sir Robert Walpole presented the city with a gilt mace,\r\nbeautifully enchased, weighing 168 ounces.  On the cup part are the arms\r\nof Sir Robert and of the city.  A new damask gown was also bought by the\r\ncorporation, to be worn by the Speaker on all public occasions.\r\n\r\nOn October 30th, 1739, being the king’s birthday, war was proclaimed here\r\nagainst Spain.  The mayor and aldermen attended on horseback in their\r\nscarlet gowns, with the two sheriffs, who appeared for the first time in\r\nthe gold chains given by Thomas Emerson, Esq., of London, a native of\r\nthis city, to be worn by the sheriffs of Norwich for the time being.  A\r\nportrait of him was placed in St. Andrew’s Hall at the expense of the\r\ncorporation, and the honorary freedom of the city was afterwards\r\npresented to him.\r\n\r\nIn 1740, the cathedral was cleaned and repaired.  It was again repaired\r\nand beautified in 1763, in Bishop Younge’s time; and in 1777 and 1780,\r\ntwo painted windows, representing the Transfiguration and the twelve\r\nApostles (finely executed by the Lady of the late Dean Lloyd), were\r\nplaced in the east end of the choir.  Subsequently, these windows were\r\nremoved to another part of the cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn 1741, April 4th, it was ordered by the corporation of Norwich, that no\r\nstranger should exercise any trade in the city more than six months\r\nwithout taking up his freedom.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, May 3rd, war was proclaimed here against France, by the mayor\r\nand corporation, on horseback.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1745, the magistrates and principal inhabitants associated\r\nin support of the government and in defence of the liberties of the land,\r\nin consequence of the rebellion in Scotland.  An artillery company, of\r\nabout 100 men, was raised in Norwich, and Lord Hobart appointed\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nIn 1746, October 9th, there was a general thanksgiving on the suppression\r\nof the Rebellion in Scotland.  A magnificent arch was erected in Norwich\r\nMarket Place, which, with the whole city, was illuminated.\r\n\r\nIn 1747, an act was passed for holding the county summer assizes and\r\nsessions in the city, till a new Shirehall could be built.\r\n\r\nOn February 7th, 1748, peace with France and Spain was proclaimed here,\r\nthe mayor and corporation attending on horseback, preceded by a party of\r\ndragoons and the artillery company.\r\n\r\nOn October 22nd, 1751, a fire broke out, which destroyed the bridewell\r\nand several adjoining houses.  That extraordinary man, “Peter, the Wild\r\nYouth,” was confined there at the time.  When a child, he was lost in a\r\nwood in Germany, and was found, at the age of 12, naked and wild.  This\r\nbridewell house was built about the year 1370, by Bartholomew Appleyard,\r\nwhose son William was, in 1403, the first Mayor of Norwich.  There are\r\nsome fine arched vaults under the premises, and the wall next St.\r\nAndrew’s church, built with flint, is well worthy the observation of the\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\nAn act was passed this year (1751) to open the Port of Yarmouth for the\r\nimportation of wool and woollen yarn from Ireland, which was very\r\nbeneficial to the city.\r\n\r\nThe number of houses and inhabitants, in the city precincts and hamlets,\r\nin 1752, was as follows:—7139 houses, 36,169 souls, being an increase of\r\n7288 inhabitants since 1693, when the population was only 28,881.\r\n\r\nIn 1755, a table was drawn up settling the habits to be worn by the mayor\r\nand corporation at public meetings.\r\n\r\nA slight shock of an earthquake was felt here on January 10th, 1756.  On\r\nMay 3rd of the same year, the freedom of the city was voted to the Right\r\nHon. Wm. Pitt, and Henry B. Legge (the former being late secretary of\r\nstate, and the latter, chancellor of the exchequer), for their conduct\r\nduring their honourable but short administration.  The freedom of the\r\ncity, and thanks of the corporation, were also voted to Matthew Goss,\r\nEsq., for his present of the gold chain which has ever since been worn by\r\nthe mayors.  A public subscription was made for the poor, in consequence\r\nof the high price of wheat, and scarcity of work, and 12,000 persons in\r\nNorwich were supplied with household bread at half-price for some time.\r\n\r\nOn July 12th, 1756, the Earl of Orford put the act for the better\r\nregulating the Militia in execution.  This act fixed the number of men to\r\nbe raised for Norfolk and Norwich at 960, of which the city furnished\r\n151.\r\n\r\nOn June 21st, 1759, there was a most violent storm here, some of the\r\nhailstones being two inches long, and weighing three-quarters of an\r\nounce.  On July 4th and 5th, the Norfolk Militia, commanded by Lord\r\nOrford, marched from Norwich to Portsmouth, and passed in review before\r\nHis Majesty George II., at Kensington.\r\n\r\nIn digging under the rampart of the Castle Hill in 1760, two very curious\r\nbones were discovered, supposed by some to be amulets, which the Druids\r\nwore at their sacrifices.\r\n\r\nIn 1760, King George II. died at Kensington, on October 25th, and his\r\ngrandson, George III. was proclaimed king, in Norwich, on the 29th, by\r\nthe mayor and corporation, preceded by the four Norwich companies of\r\nmilitia, with flags, banners, and music.  On September 22nd, 1761, the\r\ncoronation of their Majesties was celebrated with great splendour in\r\nNorfolk, and in Norwich there was a general illumination, and a grand\r\ndisplay of fireworks from a triumphal arch erected in the Market Place.\r\n\r\nOn October 27th, 1762, there was a sudden flood in the city, which laid\r\nnear 300 houses and 8 parish churches under water.  It rose 12 feet\r\nperpendicular in 24 hours, being 15 inches higher than St. Faith’s flood\r\nin 1696.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, January 3rd, John Spurrell, Esq., died, leaving £1355 to the\r\ncorporation, the interest to be applied for the benefit of the poor in\r\nthe Great Hospital, and for other charitable purposes.  The Earl of\r\nBuckinghamshire, alderman Thomas Harvey, and Mr. Robert Page, gave £100\r\neach to Doughty’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn the same year _Sir Armine Wodehouse_, _Bart._, gave a valuable volume\r\nto the corporation containing some old statutes, in which the\r\nprescriptive right of the corporation to its present legal name is\r\nsupported.  It had been the property of the Wodehouse family for 200\r\nyears.  A vote of thanks was passed to Sir Armine Wodehouse for his\r\npresent.  He was a member of parliament for Norfolk from 1736 to 1768 (32\r\nyears), and died in 1777.  His death was occasioned by a herring-bone\r\nsticking in his throat.\r\n\r\nOn January 7th, 1769, the church belonging to the Dutch congregation was\r\nopened for the poor of the workhouses.  The poor continued to attend till\r\nthe New Workhouse was built in Heigham, after which they attended divine\r\nservice in the chapel there.\r\n\r\nOn November 19th, 1770, there was a great flood in Norwich, four inches\r\nhigher than that of 1762.  The sufferers were relieved, by a\r\nsubscription, with money, coals, and bread.  On December 19th, of the\r\nsame year, there was a violent storm of wind and rain, such as had not\r\nbeen remembered since 1741.  Happisburgh, Postwick, and Strumpshaw\r\nwindmills were blown down, and much damage was done in the city and\r\ncounty; many ships with their crews were lost on the Norfolk coast.  In\r\nthe same year the following turnpike roads were made and opened, from St.\r\nStephen’s Gates to Trowse, from St. Stephen’s Gates to Watton, from St.\r\nBenedict’s Gates to Swaffham, from Bishop Bridge to Caister near\r\nYarmouth, and from Norwich to Dereham, Swaffham, and Mattishall.\r\n\r\nOn March 1st, 1771, the names of the streets and highways in the city\r\nwere ordered to be fixed up for the first time; but this order appears to\r\nhave been very imperfectly carried out.  In the same year the foundation\r\nstone of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital was laid by Wm. Fellowes, Esq.,\r\nwho was a great promoter of that benevolent institution.  It was erected\r\nby a public subscription in the city and county; and it was opened on\r\nJuly 11th, 1772, for out-patients; and on November 7th, in that year, for\r\nin-patients.  It has been of great benefit to the poor, who have always\r\nbeen attended by the principal physicians and surgeons in the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, St. Andrew’s Hall underwent a complete alteration.  The old\r\ngateway and wall next Bridge Street were taken down, part of the green\r\nyard was taken in, and the old city library room was rebuilt over the\r\ngateway, thus defacing all that part of the hall.  At the last\r\nrestoration the old city library room was pulled down, and a new porch\r\nwas erected, with many other improvements.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, the new year was ushered in with a most terrible storm of wind\r\nand rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning.  The lead on St.\r\nAndrew’s Church was rolled up, and great damage was done in several parts\r\nof the city.  In October of this year, the navigation from Coltishall to\r\nAylsham was completed for boats of thirteen tons burthen, at a cost of\r\n£6000.  About this time smuggling was carried to a great height, even in\r\nbroad day.\r\n\r\nOn January 20th, 1780, at a numerous meeting of citizens and county\r\ngentlemen, a petition was agreed to and signed, praying the house of\r\ncommons to guard against all unnecessary expenditure, to abolish sinecure\r\nplaces and pensions, and to resist the increasing influence of the crown.\r\nA strong protest was afterwards signed against the proceedings of this\r\nmeeting.  Mr. Coke presented the petition.  Armed associations were\r\nformed against the government at Yarmouth, Lynn, Holt, and other places.\r\n\r\nOn March 24th, 1783, manufactures of textile fabrics in the city being\r\nvery prosperous, the pageant of the Golden Fleece, or what is called\r\nBishop Blaize, was exhibited by the wool combers, in a style far\r\nsurpassing all former processions of the kind in Norwich.  The procession\r\nbegan to move at 10 a.m. from St. Martin’s at Oak, and thence passed\r\nthrough the principal streets of the city.  On December 3rd, of the same\r\nyear, the Black Friars’ Bridge was opened.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1784, the Amicable Society of Attorneys, in Norwich, was\r\ninstituted.  On May 1st, at an assembly of the corporation, the freedom\r\nof the city was voted to be presented to Mr. S. Harvey, Mr. Windham, and\r\nMr. Pitt.  On December 13th, the Norwich Public Library was first opened\r\nand located in the old library room, formerly over the entrance to St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\nOn March 25th, 1785, mail coaches, between Norwich and London, were\r\nestablished, performing a journey of 108 miles in fifteen hours, by which\r\nalteration in the post, letters arrived from London a day sooner.  This\r\nwas considered a great improvement.  Subsequently, half a dozen stage\r\ncoaches ran between Norwich and London daily.  In July, after various\r\nascents by several persons, Major (afterwards General) Money, at 4.25\r\np.m., ascended with a balloon from Quantrell’s gardens, and at 6 p.m. the\r\ncar touched the surface of the sea.  During five hours the major remained\r\nin this perilous situation, and at 11.30 p.m. was taken up by the Argus\r\nrevenue cutter, eighteen miles off Southwold, bearing west by north, and\r\nhe landed at Lowestoft on the following morning.  On October 18th, of the\r\nsame year, the “Friars’ Society for the Participation of Useful\r\nKnowledge” was instituted.  This society first suggested the scheme of\r\nthe association for the relief of decayed tradesmen, their widows, and\r\norphans.  With them also originated the Soup Charity in this city, and it\r\nwas long supported and conducted by them, but of late years it has been a\r\nseparate charity.\r\n\r\nOn April 26th, 1786, the Norwich and Norfolk Benevolent Medical Society\r\nwas instituted.  In May, an exact account of the inhabitants of Norwich\r\nwas taken from house to house, and the population was ascertained to be\r\n40,051 souls, exclusive of those living in the precincts of the\r\nCathedral, being an increase of nearly 4000 since 1752.  This entirely\r\ncontradicts the statement of Mr. Arthur Young, in his Tour of England,\r\npublished in 1770, to the effect that 72,000 persons were then employed\r\nin manufactures in this city.\r\n\r\nOn November 5th, 1788, the centenary of the glorious Revolution of 1688\r\nwas celebrated in this city and county by illuminations, bonfires, public\r\ndinners, &c., but more particularly at Holkham, where Mr. Coke, the late\r\nEarl of Leicester, gave a grand fête, ball, and supper, and a display of\r\nfireworks, &c.  The citizens appear to have been more sensible then than\r\nthey are now of the immense benefits they derived from that great change\r\nin the British constitution and government.\r\n\r\nNext year (1789) a revolution broke out in France and astounded all\r\nEurope.  It caused a mighty commotion and a general war, which lasted\r\nmany years, and destroyed millions of men.  Norwich, like every other\r\ncity in England, was affected by it, and lost nearly all its foreign\r\ntrade during the terrible conflict.  On July 14th, the Revolution was\r\ncommemorated by republicans at the Maid’s Head Inn, in this city.  Among\r\nthe toasts of the day after a dinner were “The Revolutionary Societies in\r\nEngland,” “The Rights of Man,” and “The Philosophers of France.”  The\r\nRevolution, however, had not advanced very far in its atrocities when\r\nmost people regarded it in a very different light, and associations were\r\nformed here against “Levellers” and “Revolutionists.”\r\n\r\nOn December 5th, 1792, the mayor, sheriffs, and seventeen aldermen of\r\nNorwich, pledged themselves to support the constitution of Kings, Lords,\r\nand Commons, as established in 1688.  Meetings of the inhabitants were\r\nalso held in this city, and in Yarmouth, Lynn, &c., and declarations of\r\nloyalty and attachment to the constitution were unanimously agreed to and\r\nsigned; for men had begun to be alarmed by the “Reign of Terror” in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 a petition for parliamentary reform, signed by 3741 inhabitants\r\nof Norwich, was presented to the House of Commons by the Hon. H. Hobart,\r\nbut was not received, it having been printed previous to presentation.\r\nThis indicated a great advance in liberal opinions towards the end of the\r\nlast century, chiefly amongst the Nonconformists, who had greatly\r\nincreased in numbers, whilst the church was asleep.  The vast expenditure\r\nin the long war against France caused a great increase in taxation.\r\n\r\nOn April 12th, 1794, a great county meeting was held at the Shirehall, to\r\nconsider the exertions which should be made at that crisis for the\r\ninternal defence and security of the kingdom.  The High Sheriff, T. R.\r\nDashwood, Esq., presided.  The Honble. C. Townshend moved resolutions,\r\nsupported by the Marquis Townshend, Lord Walsingham, Mr. Buxton, Mr.\r\nWindham, and Mr. Joddrell, for forming volunteer corps of cavalry, and\r\nfor entering into subscriptions to maintain the same.  Mr. Coke condemned\r\nthe war _in toto_, and insisted that it might have been avoided, or at\r\nthe least brought to a conclusion, by a negociation for peace, and he\r\nmoved as an amendment:\r\n\r\n    “That it is our duty to refuse any private subscriptions for public\r\n    purposes and unconstitutional benevolences.”\r\n\r\nSo much altercation and confusion ensued, that when the High Sheriff put\r\nthe question, it was impossible to tell which party had the majority; and\r\na division being deemed impracticable, the chairman proposed that such\r\ngentlemen as chose to subscribe would retire with him to the Grand Jury\r\nRoom, which was agreed to.  Nearly £6,000 was subscribed, and the amount\r\nwas afterwards increased to £11,000!\r\n\r\nOn October 21st, 1795, a memorial was transmitted from the court of\r\nmayoralty of Norwich to the representatives of the city on the high\r\nprices of every necessary of life, requesting them to support such\r\nmeasures as might have a tendency to reduce them, and to facilitate the\r\nrestoration of peace.  Prices of corn and provisions had risen to an\r\nalarming height; wheat to 100s., barley to 30s., and oats to 30s. per\r\nquarter, and symptoms of rioting had in consequence appeared in Norwich\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nAt a county meeting held on July 20th, 1796, in the Angel Inn (now the\r\nRoyal Hotel) it was resolved to petition parliament for the removal of\r\nthe Lent assizes from Thetford to Norwich, and a petition was presented\r\naccordingly.  The bill brought for this object into the House of Commons\r\nwas strongly opposed, and finally rejected; but afterwards the assizes\r\nwere removed to the city, and have been held there ever since.  This year\r\nthe sum of £24,000 was collected for the maintenance of the poor in\r\nNorwich, while the population was under 40,000, or half the present\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nIn 1797, February 14th, the Norwich Light Horse Volunteers were\r\norganized, of which John Harvey, Esq., was afterwards appointed captain\r\nand major.  On February 22nd, the Norwich Loyal Military Association was\r\nformed, of which John Patteson, Esq., was appointed captain, and\r\nafterwards major; and R. J. Browne, C. Harvey, and A. Sieley, Esqs., were\r\nappointed captains.  Military matters then occupied a great deal of the\r\nattention of the citizens.\r\n\r\nOn March 4th, intelligence was received here of the defeat of the Spanish\r\nfleet by Admiral Jervis, and served in some measure to dissipate the\r\ngeneral gloom which at this time pervaded the public mind.\r\n\r\nOn April 25th, a great county meeting was held in the open air on the\r\nCastle Hill, and a petition was almost unanimously adopted, praying His\r\nMajesty to dismiss his ministers, as the most effectual means of reviving\r\nthe national credit and restoring peace.  This was moved by Mr. Fellowes,\r\nseconded by Mr. Rolfe, supported by Lord Albemarle, Mr. Coke, Mr. Mingay,\r\nMr. Plumptre, Mr. Trafford, and others.  On April 28th a counter county\r\nmeeting was held, and an address to the king was adopted, expressing\r\nconfidence in the ministry of the day.\r\n\r\nOn May 16th the citizens followed suit.  At a numerously attended common\r\nhall a petition to His Majesty, praying him to dismiss his\r\nadministration, was carried unanimously, with the exception of one\r\nspirited Tory, who had nearly fallen a victim to popular vengeance on the\r\nspot.  A counter address of the citizens was afterwards signed and\r\npresented to the King, who must have been a good deal bothered at the\r\ntime by such evidences of the violent agitation of his subjects.\r\n\r\nOn May 26th, attempts were made here to seduce the military from their\r\nallegiance; and on the following day the republican orator, Thelwall,\r\narrived in this city, which caused a great commotion.  On the 29th, a\r\nparty of the Inniskilling Dragoons proceeded to his lecture room,\r\nopposite Gurney’s bank, drove out the persons assembled, destroyed the\r\ntribune and benches, and then attacked the Shakespear Tavern adjoining,\r\nin which a disturbance had taken place.  After destroying the furniture\r\nand partly demolishing the house, and also breaking the windows and\r\ndestroying the furniture of the Rose Tavern, in which they supposed the\r\nlecturer had concealed himself, the dragoons, on the appearance of their\r\nofficers and the magistrates, retired to their barracks.  Thelwall, in\r\nthis affray, fortunately for him, escaped and fled to London.  Davey, the\r\nlandlord of the Shakespear Tavern, on being pursued by the soldiers,\r\nthrew himself from the garret into the street, and was much injured.  At\r\nthe subsequent assizes, Luke Rice, a tailor of this city, was indicted\r\ncapitally for aiding and abetting the soldiers in this outrage; but as\r\nthe offence charged in the indictment did not come within the meaning of\r\nthe statute, he was acquitted.  He had, however, a very narrow escape.\r\nOn June 1st of the same year, (1797) a mutiny broke out on board the\r\nfleet at Yarmouth, and several sail of the line hoisted the red flag of\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1798, the sword of the Spanish Admiral Don Francisco\r\nWinthuysen, presented by Admiral Nelson to the corporation of Norwich,\r\nwas placed in the Council Chamber of the Guildhall, with an appropriate\r\ndevice and inscription.\r\n\r\nOn February 28th, at a general meeting of the inhabitants of this city,\r\nmore than £2,200 were immediately subscribed as voluntary contributions\r\ntowards the defence of the kingdom.  In a few weeks afterwards, the whole\r\nsubscription amounted to more than £8000, a proof of the loyalty as well\r\nas liberality of the well-to-do citizens.  In May, the following Loyal\r\nVolunteer Corps were formed for the purpose of preserving internal\r\ntranquillity, and supporting the police of this city, viz., the Mancroft\r\nVolunteers, Capt. John Browne; St. Stephen’s Volunteers, Capt. Hardy; St.\r\nPeter per Mountergate, &c., Capt. Herring; St. Saviour’s and St.\r\nClement’s, Capt. Fiske; St. Andrew’s, Capt. T. A. Murray.\r\n\r\nOn June 19th, the Norwich Light Horse Volunteers and Loyal Military\r\nAssociation attended J. Browne, Esq., to the cathedral, previous to his\r\nbeing sworn into the office of mayor; afterwards the Association fired a\r\n_feu de joie_ in the Market Place.\r\n\r\nOn October 11th, at a meeting of the wealthy inhabitants of the city, a\r\nsubscription was entered into for the relief of the orphans of those\r\nbrave seamen who fell on August 1st in the ever memorable battle of the\r\nNile; and on the 24th of the same month, at a special assembly of the\r\ncorporation, an address of congratulation was adopted to his Majesty on\r\nthe late victory; and it was agreed that a request should be made to Lord\r\nNelson to sit for his portrait, to be placed in St. Andrew’s Hall.  His\r\nLordship assented and the portrait was painted by Beechey and placed in\r\nthe hall, where it may still be seen.\r\n\r\nNovember 29th was appointed as a day of a public thanksgiving for the\r\nlate naval victories, and was celebrated as such in Norwich with the\r\ngreatest festivity.  In the morning the mayor and corporation,\r\naccompanied by the Light Horse Volunteers and the Parochial Associations,\r\nattended divine service at the cathedral, where an excellent sermon was\r\npreached by the Rev. T. F. Middleton, afterwards Bishop of Calcutta.  The\r\nsword, taken by Lord Nelson was borne in the procession.  On their return\r\nto the Market Place there was a feast, and in the evening an\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nIn 1799, October 28th, the Guards and several other regiments, to the\r\nnumber of 25,000 cavalry and infantry, landed at Yarmouth from Holland.\r\nNext night the Grenadier Brigade of Guards, commanded by Col. Wynward,\r\nmarched into Norwich by torchlight, and were soon afterwards followed by\r\nupwards of 20,000 more troops.  Through the exertions of John Herring,\r\nEsq., mayor, and the attention of the citizens in general, these brave\r\nmen received every accommodation that their situation demanded.  The\r\nmayor soon afterwards received a letter from the Duke of Portland\r\nexpressive of the high appreciation by the government of the mayor’s\r\nloyalty and activity on this occasion, and of the humanity of the\r\ncitizens who supplied the wants of the soldiers.  The mayor was\r\nafterwards presented to his Majesty at St. James’, and offered the honour\r\nof knighthood, which he declined.  The Duke of York, Prince William of\r\nGloucester, and several other officers employed in this unsuccessful\r\nexpedition, also passed through the city on their way to London.  The sum\r\nof £18,000 was raised this year for the maintenance of the poor of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nOn January 23rd, 1800, John Herring, Esq., then mayor, summoned a general\r\nmeeting of the inhabitants at the Guildhall, to consider the propriety of\r\napplying to parliament for an act for the better paving, lighting, and\r\nwatching of the city, for removing and preventing annoyances and\r\nobstructions, and for regulating hackney coaches.  At this meeting a\r\ncommittee was appointed to consider the plan proposed, and to report to a\r\nfuture general meeting.  This committee held several meetings, and at\r\nlength made a report, which was laid before a general meeting of the\r\ncitizens on March 3rd.  The estimated cost of lighting, watching, paving,\r\n&c., was only £2770.  The produce of the tolls was estimated at £1715,\r\nand of a rate of 6d. in the pound at £3000; making the total receipts\r\n£4715, and leaving a balance of £1945 for the commencement of the work,\r\nwhich sum would have been increased by some annual payments.  The general\r\nmeeting adopted the report, and a petition was signed by most of the\r\ninhabitants of the city in favour of a bill to carry out the\r\nimprovements.  Unfortunately, however, the petition could not, from some\r\nunforeseen circumstances, be presented that session.  The project was,\r\nfor a time, postponed; but an act was obtained in 1806 to carry out the\r\nobject, and commissioners were appointed for the purpose.  This body\r\nconsisted of the dean and prebend, the recorder, 28 members of the\r\ncorporation, and 24 parochial commissioners, annually elected, in all\r\n136.  This heterogeneous body continued for about forty years, and after\r\nspending over £300,000, left Norwich the worst paved town in England, and\r\nalso left a debt of £17,000, which still remains as a legacy to the city!\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial State of the City in the Eighteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the 18th century, various improvements were made, among\r\nwhich may be mentioned, the demolition of the old gates, the widening and\r\nopening of several streets, and the erection of a new flour mill, worked\r\nby steam power, near Black Friars Bridge, for better supplying the people\r\nwith flour.  Still, large numbers of the poor appear to have been for a\r\nlong time in a very destitute condition.  Famines were of frequent\r\noccurrence, and riots often took place on account of the high prices of\r\nevery kind of food.  In 1720, on September 20th, a dangerous riot broke\r\nout, and rose to such a height, as to oblige the sheriffs to call in the\r\naid of the Artillery Company, at whose approach the rioters instantly\r\ndispersed.  Again, in 1740, riots occurred in several parts of the\r\ncountry, and in most of the towns in Norfolk.  The magistrates of this\r\ncity called the military to their aid, and six or seven lives were lost\r\nbefore the rioters could be quelled.  Again, in 1766, in consequence of\r\nthe great scarcity and advanced price of provisions of every sort, some\r\ndangerous riots broke out in several places.  In this city the poor\r\npeople collected on September 27th, about noon, and in the course of that\r\nday and the next, committed many outrages by attacking the houses of\r\nbakers, pulling down part of the New Mills, destroying large quantities\r\nof flour, and burning to the ground a large malthouse outside of\r\nConisford gate.  Every lenient measure was tried by the city magistrates\r\nto pacify the poor starving people, but to no effect.  The magistrates\r\ntherefore were compelled to repel force by force.  On Sunday afternoon\r\nthey, with the principal inhabitants, attacked the rioters with such\r\nvigour, while they were demolishing a house on Tombland, that they were\r\ndispersed.  About thirty of the ringleaders were taken and tried, and\r\neight of them were sentenced to death, but only two were executed.  They\r\nsuffered the extreme penalty on January 10th, 1767.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, Norwich was, at this time, in a more flourishing\r\nstate as regards trade than it has ever since been known.  Wages were not\r\nhigh, but employment was universal.  On April 25th, 1796, fine flour\r\nhaving risen to 70s. a sack, a mob attacked several bakers’ shops in the\r\ncity.  The magistrates and inhabitants assembled and proceeded to the\r\nplaces against which the attacks of the populace were directed, but the\r\nmob did not disperse till after the riot act had been read and three\r\npersons apprehended.  On May 17th, a dreadful affray took place near\r\nBishop Bridge, between the soldiers of the Northumberland and\r\nWarwickshire regiments of Militia.  Several were terribly bruised and\r\nothers wounded with bayonets before their officers could part them.\r\nEducation was, at this time, at a very low ebb, and the clergy neglected\r\nthe poor.  Few schools were yet opened for their children, who grew up in\r\nignorance and vice.  Working-men spent their hard-earned money in\r\ndrunkenness, or indulged in the most brutal sports, such as\r\nprize-fighting or cock-fighting.  They were also demoralised by bribery\r\nand treating at contested elections.  In fact, ward elections were so\r\nfrequent that the city was kept in a perpetual state of agitation and\r\nturmoil.  We can now form no notion of the misery, poverty, and vice,\r\nwhich these local elections inflicted on the city.  It was often said\r\nthat a single ward election did more harm than all the sermons in all the\r\nchurches and chapels did good.  These local contests at length prevented\r\ncapital being employed in manufacturers, and made politics the first\r\nobject of all the influential citizens, who, if they were not, strove to\r\nbecome, members of the old corporation, not from any consideration of\r\npublic duty, not to promote the welfare of the citizens, but to serve\r\ntheir own political or personal interests.  There is abundant evidence\r\nthat the prosperity of the city, and private friendships, were alike\r\npoisoned by the party spirit, engendered by frequent ward elections; at\r\nthe same time the moral character of the whole working population was\r\ngreatly deteriorated, and the working classes themselves greatly\r\ndepraved.\r\n\r\n\r\nNonconformity in the 18th Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this 18th century the Nonconformists became very numerous and\r\npowerful in the city and county.  Methodism imparted a healthful stimulus\r\nto the revival of religion.  It aroused the church and all denominations.\r\nBesides the very flourishing bodies of Wesleyans and Baptists, the\r\nIndependents made great progress.  Within two centuries, in place of one,\r\nseveral chapels arose; and throughout all England, few towns exhibited a\r\ngreater increase of Nonconformists than Norwich.  We have already given\r\nan account of their rise and progress in the 17th century, but we have\r\nnot yet noticed the Unitarians.  A history of the Octagon chapel in\r\nNorwich, by Mr. John Taylor, formerly of this city, and continued by his\r\nson, Mr. Edward Taylor, contains a full account of the rise and progress\r\nof the Unitarians here.  They were at first called Presbyterians, but\r\nthat name was inappropriate, as they never had the Presbyterian polity\r\nnor doctrine.  Mr. John Taylor says, the first Presbyterian chapel was\r\nbuilt in 1687, on a piece of ground, formerly part of the great garden or\r\norchard, “sometime belonging to the prior and convent of the late friars’\r\npreachers,” of whose deserted walls the Dissenters took possession.  The\r\nbuilding was so constructed that it might be converted into dwelling\r\nhouses in case their preachers were compelled to abandon it.\r\n\r\nBlomefield, in his History of the City, says:—\r\n\r\n    “In 1687, the Presbyterians built a meeting house from the ground,\r\n    over against the Black Boys; and at the same time the Independents\r\n    repaired a house in St. Edmund’s formerly a brew house.”\r\n\r\nAfter the passing of the Toleration Act, in 1689, this meeting house,\r\nwhich, had not been long finished, was duly licensed.  Dr. Collinges, a\r\nlearned Presbyterian minister, was the first pastor appointed to preach\r\nby the congregation.  He had a considerable hand in the “Annotations to\r\nthe Bible,” which were begun and carried on by Mr. Matthew Poole, and\r\nwhich go under his name.\r\n\r\nDr. Collinges died in January, 1690, and was probably succeeded soon\r\nafter by Mr. Josiah Chorley, who was not a native of Norwich, but came\r\nfrom Lancashire.  He officiated about thirty years, and was succeeded by\r\nthe Rev. Peter Finch, a highly esteemed preacher for many years.  After\r\nhe died his funeral sermon was preached by Mr. Taylor, who said:—\r\n\r\n    “Surely the character of Mr. Finch, drawn out so even and clear\r\n    without any remarkable spot or flaw, through the long course of\r\n    sixty-three years in this city, must be deserving of remembrance and\r\n    imitation, since it must be the result of a steady integrity and\r\n    solid wisdom.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Finch was one of the first pupils who entered into the first\r\ndissenting academy, erected after the Reformation, by the Rev. Mr.\r\nFrankland; and he survived almost all the 300 gentlemen who, in the space\r\nof thirty years, were educated in that academy.  He died October 6th,\r\n1754, on his 93rd birthday, and was buried in St. Peter’s Church, in this\r\ncity.  His descendents were residents here till 1847.  His son was many\r\nyears clerk of the peace for the county of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nMr. John Brooke was invited to take his place towards the end of the year\r\n1718.  This minister was born in or near Yarmouth, where some of his\r\ndescendants have generally resided.  He resigned in 1733, and removed to\r\nYork, where he died.  Dr. John Taylor was elected to the vacant office in\r\n1733, and continued till 1757, when he resigned.  He was the author of\r\nmany works of a religious character.  In 1753 the old chapel was pulled\r\ndown, and a subscription was raised of nearly £4000 for a new one.  The\r\nfirst stone of the new building was laid on February 25th, 1754, by Dr.\r\nTaylor; and within three years the present elegant chapel was completed\r\nat a cost of £5174.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Bourn, son of Mr. Bourn of Birmingham, was ordained co-pastor\r\nwith Dr. John Taylor, and he published volumes of sermons which\r\nestablished his reputation in that kind of composition.  He resigned in\r\n1775, and retired to a village near Norwich.  Several gentlemen, who\r\nafterwards attained considerable eminence in science, were brought up\r\nunder Mr. Bourn’s ministry, viz., Sir James Edward Smith, so long\r\npresident of the Linnean Society; Mr. Robert Woodhouse, the eminent\r\nmathematician and professor of astronomy at Cambridge; and Dr. Edward\r\nMaltby, afterwards bishop of Durham.  Mr. Bourn removed to Norwich not\r\nmany months before his death, and died in the 83rd year of his age; he\r\nwas interred in the burying ground of the Octagon Chapel.  Mr. Bourn was\r\nsucceeded by the Rev. John Hoyle, who was minister for seventeen years.\r\nHe died in the 51st year of his age, on November 29th, 1775, and was\r\ninterred in the Octagon burying ground.\r\n\r\nOn December 15th, 1776, Mr. Alderson was chosen minister, and soon\r\nafterwards Mr. George Cadogan Morgan became co-pastor.  He had been\r\neducated under the inspection of his uncle, the celebrated Dr. Richard\r\nPrice, so that great expectations were formed of his abilities, and the\r\ncongregation were not disappointed.  He soon, however, resigned and went\r\nto Yarmouth; and in 1755, Dr. William Enfield was invited to become\r\nco-pastor with Mr. Alderson, and he accepted the office.  In 1786, Mr.\r\nAlderson resigned; and in 1787 was succeeded by Mr. P. Houghton.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, Mr. P. M. Martineau projected the establishment of the Public\r\nLibrary at Norwich, in which he was cordially seconded by Dr. Enfield,\r\nwho was one of the earliest presidents of an institution, which for the\r\nextent and variety of its catalogue surpasses most provincial libraries.\r\nIn the early periods of the first French Revolution, a periodical work\r\nwas established by the liberal party in Norwich, entitled “The Cabinet;”\r\nto which the principal contributors were Mr. John Pitchford, Mr. Wm.\r\nYoungman, Mr. Norgate, Mr. C. Marsh (afterwards M.P. for Retford), Mrs.\r\nOpie (then Miss Alderson), Mr. John Taylor, and Dr. Enfield.  After\r\npublishing many learned works, Dr. Enfield died in the 57th year of his\r\nage, on November 3rd, 1797.  After his death, three volumes of his\r\nsermons were published by subscription; and among the subscribers were\r\npersons of almost every sect in Norwich, from the cathedral prebendary to\r\nthe independent minister.  More than twenty beneficed clergymen’s names\r\nappear in the list, and it is very well known that Dr. Enfield’s sermons\r\nhave been heard from many pulpits of the established church.  Professor\r\nTaylor, late of Gresham college, thus wrote in a supplementary memoir:—\r\n\r\n    “With his dissenting brethren Dr. Enfield was always on the best\r\n    terms, especially with Mr. Newton and Mr. Kinghorn, the ministers of\r\n    the Independent and Baptist congregations.  The Presbyterian\r\n    congregation, comprising many individuals of station and influence in\r\n    the city, took the lead in every movement of the dissenting body, who\r\n    never appeared in a more united and honourable position than when Dr.\r\n    Enfield was their acknowledged head.  The state of society during his\r\n    residence in Norwich, was eminently suited to his habits and tastes.\r\n    Parr, Peel, Walker, Howes, and Smyth were his contemporaries.  Parr\r\n    was the head master of the grammar school, Potter was a prebendary of\r\n    the Cathedral, and Porson was occasional resident at the house of his\r\n    brother-in-law, Mr. Hawes of Coltishall, a village a few miles from\r\n    Norwich.  Dr. Enfield was a welcome visitor at the bishop’s palace;\r\n    for though Dr. Bagot had no political or religious sympathy with the\r\n    minister of the Presbyterian congregation, he knew how to estimate\r\n    his talents, his manners, and his admirable conversational powers.\r\n    Among the residents in Norwich at this time, with whom Dr. Enfield\r\n    associated, were Dr. Sayers, Mr. William Taylor, Mr. Hudson Gurney\r\n    (afterwards M.P. for Newport and a vice-president of the Society of\r\n    Antiquaries), Dr. Rigby, Dr. Lubbock, Sir James Edward Smith, the\r\n    Rev. John Walker (an accomplished scholar and one of the minor canons\r\n    of the Cathedral), Mrs. Opie (then Miss Alderson), Mr. Bruckner, the\r\n    minister of the Dutch and French protestant congregations at Norwich,\r\n    and others, who though unknown to the world as authors, were yet\r\n    worthy associates in such a society.”\r\n\r\nDr. Enfield’s estimate of the character of society at Norwich, is thus\r\nexpressed in a letter from Liverpool to Professor Taylor’s father:—\r\n\r\n    “You will easily imagine the pleasure I feel in enjoying the society\r\n    of my old friends here, especially that of Mr. Roscoe and Dr. Currie;\r\n    but with these and a few other exceptions, I find more congenial\r\n    associates at Norwich.  For a man of literary tastes and pursuits, I\r\n    can truly say that I know of no town which offers so eligible a\r\n    residence.”\r\n\r\nMr. Roscoe and Dr. Currie, referred to above, were then in high\r\nreputation in Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe altered state of society in Norwich, about the end of the 18th\r\ncentury is thus depicted in a paper in the Monthly Magazine for March,\r\n1808, under the title of “Fanaticism—a Vision,” which was generally\r\nattributed to the pen of Sir James Edward Smith:—\r\n\r\n    “You know the flourishing and happy state of this ancient city in the\r\n    early part of your life, and particularly how peaceably and even\r\n    harmoniously its inhabitants lived together on the score of religion.\r\n    Christians of various denominations had each their churches, their\r\n    chapels, or their meeting houses, and in the common intercourse of\r\n    life all conducted themselves as brethren.  The interests of humanity\r\n    would even frequently bring them together on particular occasions to\r\n    pay their devotions in the same temple.  The bishop (Bathurst)\r\n    treated as his children all who, though they disowned his spiritual\r\n    authority, obeyed his Divine Master; while the Presbyterian, the\r\n    Independent, the Catholic, and the Quaker, partook of his hospitality\r\n    and repaid his benevolence with gratitude and respect.  This state of\r\n    society, worthy of real Christians, was broken up by those who wore\r\n    that character only as a mask.  A set of men, interested in promoting\r\n    dissensions, by which villany and rapacity might profit, and in\r\n    decrying those genuine fruits of religion, that salutary faith and\r\n    pure morals, which by comparison shamed their own characters, after\r\n    long in vain attempting to exalt blind belief in general, and their\r\n    particular dogmas, in preference to a useful and virtuous life, but\r\n    too successfully obtained their end.  On all the great truths of\r\n    revealed religion, honest men could never be long at variance.  On\r\n    disputable points they had learned a salutary forbearance, which\r\n    enabled them, while they thought for themselves, to let others do the\r\n    same.  The only resources of those who wish to stir up religious\r\n    animosity, is to bring forward something that no one can determine.\r\n    The less mankind understand a subject, the more warmly do they debate\r\n    and strive to enforce the belief of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMINENT CITIZENS OF THE 18TH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n_Merchants and Manufacturers_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the eminent citizens of this century may be first mentioned the\r\nchief merchants and manufacturers, who were very intelligent, wealthy,\r\nand enterprising.  They were also benevolent, and the founders of various\r\ncharitable institutions.  Many of them were Nonconformists, and active\r\nsupporters of their chapels, while they carried on a great foreign trade.\r\nThe correspondence which they had begun on the continent they extended in\r\nevery direction.  By sending their sons to be educated in Germany, Italy,\r\nand Spain, they cultivated a more familiar connection with those\r\ncountries.  Their travellers also were acquainted with various languages,\r\nand went all over Europe, exhibiting their pattern cards in every town on\r\nthe continent.  Norwich could then boast of rich, energetic,\r\nenterprising, and intelligent men, who made the city what it was in their\r\nday.  Lest their very names should be forgotten, we shall place them in\r\nthis record.  Amongst the manufacturers were\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Robert and John Harvey,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Starling Day and Son,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Watson, Firth, and Co.,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. John Barnard and Angier,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Thomas Paul and Flindt,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. J. Tuthill and Sons,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. William Barnard and Sons,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Edward Marsh and Son,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Bream and King,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Martin and Williment,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Peter Colombine and Son,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. James Buttivant and William White,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. W. and W. Taylor,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. J. Scott and Sons,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. E. Gurney and Ellington,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Patteson and Iselin,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Booth and Theobald,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. George Maltby and Son,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. William and Robert Herring,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Worth and Carter,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Bacon and Marshall,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Ives and Robberds,\r\n\r\n  Messrs. J. and J. Ives, Son, and Baseley,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Robert Partridge,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Bartholomew Sewell,\r\n\r\n  Mr. John Robinson,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Robert Wright,\r\n\r\n  Mr. John Wright,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Robert Tillyard,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Daniel Fromantiel,\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. C. Hampp,\r\n\r\n  Mr. John Herring,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Joseph Cliver, Jun.,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Oxley,\r\n\r\nand others, all of whom have passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Kirkpatrick_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. John Kirkpatrick, a linen merchant, who lived in St. Andrew’s, was a\r\nlearned antiquarian of this period, to whom the city is greatly indebted\r\nfor his researches and documents respecting the antiquities of Norwich,\r\nbut only fragments have been published.  The late Mr. Hudson Gurney\r\nobtained possession of most of his manuscripts, and published his account\r\nof the “Religious Orders in Norwich,” in 1845.  This work was compiled\r\nfrom a manuscript quarto volume of 258 pages, in the handwriting of the\r\nauthor.  Mr. Dawson Turner, the editor, says, in the preface:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Kirkpatrick’s father was a native of the village of Closeburn,\r\n    in Dumfriesshire, a fact recorded by his son in his will, and further\r\n    proved by the arms on his tomb (in St. Helen’s church) which are\r\n    those of the baronet’s family of Kirkpatrick, of Closeburn.  From\r\n    Scotland he removed to Norwich, where he resided in the parish of St.\r\n    Stephen.  His son John was apprenticed in that of St. Clement, and\r\n    subsequently established himself in business as a linen merchant, in\r\n    St. Andrew’s, in premises opposite Bridewell Alley.  He was there in\r\n    partnership with Mr. John Custance, who was mayor in 1726, and was\r\n    the founder of the family of that name at Weston.  In the year of his\r\n    partner’s mayoralty, Mr. Kirkpatrick was appointed treasurer to the\r\n    Great Hospital, in St. Helen’s, an office which his premature decease\r\n    allowed him to occupy only for two years.  He married the youngest\r\n    daughter of Mr. John Harvey, great-grandfather of the late\r\n    Lieut.-Colonel Harvey, of Thorpe Lodge, where his portrait was\r\n    preserved during the lifetime of that gentleman.  It has since been\r\n    engraved in the very interesting series of portraits of the more\r\n    eminent inhabitants of Norfolk, of whom no likenesses have yet\r\n    appeared, a work now in course of publication, under the\r\n    superintendence of Mr. Ewing.  With such, Kirkpatrick is deservedly\r\n    associated.  He died childless.  Of his family, nothing more is known\r\n    than that he had a brother of the name of Thomas, who is mentioned by\r\n    Blomefield as being chamberlain of Norwich at the time he wrote.  The\r\n    account books of the corporation contain several entries in reference\r\n    to both the one and the other, but not of sufficient interest to\r\n    warrant the quoting of them at length.  Of the latter, they shew that\r\n    he was elected chamberlain with a salary of thirty pounds per annum,\r\n    in the room of Matthew King, in 1732; that in the same year, the\r\n    freedom of the city was conferred upon him; and that twelve years\r\n    subsequently he was removed from his office, by reason of\r\n    irregularity of his accounts.  To the antiquary, their testimony is\r\n    invariably honourable; the most frequent notices being, votes of\r\n    money for the service he had rendered in adjusting the different\r\n    accounts of the city.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson Turner further states:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Kirkpatrick was one of the most able, laborious, learned, and\r\n    useful antiquaries whom the county has produced.  He was especially\r\n    an indefatigable searcher into local antiquities, and had his life\r\n    been spared to the term allotted by the holy Psalmist to man, it were\r\n    impossible to say how much of what is now irretrievably lost to us\r\n    might have been rescued from oblivion.  He had accumulated copious\r\n    materials, but his early death prevented him from digesting and\r\n    publishing them.  Better far had he contented himself with amassing\r\n    less, and turning what he had got to account; a lesson hard to learn,\r\n    but most important to be borne in mind and acted upon.  As it was, he\r\n    was obliged to leave the fulfilment of his task to others; taking all\r\n    possible care for the safety of his collections, and not doubting\r\n    that those who came after him, seeing what was prepared for their\r\n    hands, would cheerfully undertake the office, perhaps with a\r\n    praiseworthy zeal for communicating information, perhaps with the not\r\n    less natural desire of building their own fame upon the labours of\r\n    their predecessors.  But in his expectations he was sadly mistaken,\r\n    and has but furnished an additional proof how difficult it is for any\r\n    one to enter completely into the objects and ideas of another, and\r\n    consequently how imperative it is upon all, ourselves to finish the\r\n    web we have begun, if we wish to see it come perfect and uniform from\r\n    the loom.”\r\n\r\nBlomefield, who was a contemporary, acknowledges his great obligations to\r\nthe learned Norwich antiquary, and recorded the death of his friend and\r\nhis being buried in St. Helen’s Church, Norwich.  The tomb, a black\r\nmarble monument, by the steps of the altar, bears the following arms and\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n    “_Argent_, a saltier and on a chief,\r\n    _Azure_, three woolpacks of the field,\r\n    _Crest_, a hand holding a dagger proper,\r\n    _Motto_—I make sure.\r\n\r\n    “Here resteth in hope of a joyful resurrection, the body of John\r\n    Kirkpatrick of this city, Merchant, and Treasurer to this Hospital.\r\n    He was a man of sound judgment, good understanding and extensive\r\n    knowledge; industrious in his business, and indefatigable in that of\r\n    the Corporation in which he was constantly employed.  He died, very\r\n    much lamented by all that knew him, on the 20th day of August, in the\r\n    year of our Lord, 1728, aged 42.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. F. Blomefield_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Francis Blomefield, rector of Fersfield, lived some time in this\r\ncity, compiling his history of Norwich, which he brought down to the year\r\n1742.  He was born at Fersfield, July 23rd, 1705.  He was installed\r\nrector of that parish in 1729, when he almost immediately commenced\r\ncollecting materials for a history of his native county, but his work is\r\nmore a topographical survey than a history.  He did not live to complete\r\nit, having caught the small-pox when in London, of which he died, in the\r\n46th year of his age, on January 15th, 1751.  He began printing his great\r\nwork in 1736.  In 1769 it was continued (but not completed) in five folio\r\nvolumes by the Rev. Charles Parker, M.A., rector of Oxburgh.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n_William Anderson_, _F.R.S._, came to Norwich as an excise officer, and\r\nhis great talents introduced him to the most scientific characters of\r\nthis city.  He obtained the situation of clerk to the New Mills, in\r\nHeigham, and was a considerable contributor to Mr. Baker’s works on the\r\nMicroscope.  Many of his papers on Natural History are published in the\r\ntransactions of the Royal Society.  He died in 1767, and was buried in\r\nHeigham churchyard.\r\n\r\n_Anna Letitia Barbauld_, sister of Dr. Aikin, of Yarmouth, resided at\r\nNorwich.  She was the authoress of “Evenings at Home,” and other valuable\r\nworks for children, and died in 1825.\r\n\r\n_Peter Barlow_, the celebrated mathematician, and author of many of the\r\narticles in Rees’ Encyclopædia, and the Encyclopædia Metropolitana, was\r\nthe son of a warper of this city.  He was born October, 1766, in the\r\nparish of St. Simon and Jude.\r\n\r\n_Sir William Beechey_, the eminent painter, resided in this city in the\r\nearly part of his life, and executed several of the paintings in St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall, particularly the celebrated portrait of Lord Nelson.  He\r\nwas knighted by George III., and appointed portrait painter to his\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\n_Hancock Blythe_, schoolmaster, mathematician, and teacher of languages,\r\nresided in Timberhill, and was the author of several small works on\r\nastronomy.  He died in 1795, aged 73 years.\r\n\r\n_John Brand_, _B.A._, was a native of this city.  His father was a\r\nsaddler in London Lane.  Young Brand, having a turn for study, went for\r\nsome years to the continent, where he acquired the languages and customs\r\nof the people so strongly, that on his return to England he received the\r\nsoubriquêt of Abbè Brand.  In 1744 he was reader at St. Peter’s Mancroft.\r\nHe was the author of several articles in the _British Critic_.  He was\r\nrector of St. George’s, Southwark, and of Wickham Skeith, in Suffolk.  He\r\ndied in February, 1809.\r\n\r\n_Henry Cooper_, barrister at law, was born in the parish of St. Peter’s\r\nMancroft.  He was sent to sea in the early part of his life, but was\r\nafterwards called to the bar, and was made attorney general of the\r\nBermudas.  After a brilliant career, in which he rapidly became one of\r\nthe leaders of the Norfolk circuit, he died, after being twelve years at\r\nthe bar, in 1825.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Reuben Deave_ was a large manufacturer in this city, who, in\r\nDecember, 1769, became the fortunate possessor of a prize in a lottery\r\nworth £20,000.  The number was 42,903.  It came into his possession in\r\nthe following singular manner.  His foreman, who was in a confidential\r\nposition, had bought two tickets in a lottery, and after some time\r\nthought he had speculated too far, and told his employer that he feared\r\nhe had done a very foolish thing.  Mr. Deave, being informed of the\r\ncircumstance, thought so too, but offered to buy one of the tickets.  His\r\nforeman took them out of his pocket and gave Mr. Deave his choice.  Mr.\r\nDeave, however, said he would make no choice, and bought the one offered\r\nto him.  Shortly afterwards the lottery was drawn, and this ticket proved\r\nto be a fortunate number for £20,000, while the other was a blank.  Mr.\r\nDeave, who had paid for the ticket, gave his foreman a cheque for £500,\r\nbut the poor man was so vexed at losing the prize that he hung himself on\r\nthe next day.  Mr. Deave was much grieved at this, and often said\r\nafterwards that the prize never did him any good, for he gave a power of\r\nattorney to a man to draw the money in London, and that man bolted with\r\nit, and was never heard of afterwards.\r\n\r\n_William Enfield_, _LL.D._ an eminent literary character, was for many\r\nyears the minister at the Octagon Chapel here.  He was much beloved by\r\nhis congregation, and died November 2nd, 1797, aged 57, and was buried in\r\nthe chapel, where there is a monument to his memory.\r\n\r\n_Sir John Fenn_, the editor of the “Paston Letters,” was born here in\r\n1739; on presenting the first two volumes of these letters to George III.\r\nin 1787, he was knighted.  He died October 14th, 1796.\r\n\r\n_John Fransham_, the Norwich Polytheist, a very eccentric character, was\r\nborn in St. George’s Colegate.  He was an excellent mathematician, and\r\nwas a great admirer of the ancient writers on this science.  He\r\nfrequently took rapid solitary walks, with a broad brimmed hat slouched\r\nover his eyes, and a plaid on his shoulders, and was supposed to sleep\r\noften on Mousehold Heath.  He died on February 1st, 1810.  His biography\r\nwas written by his pupil, Mr. Saint.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Hall_, _Esq._, a merchant, lived in the early part of this\r\nperiod.  He founded a monthly sacramental lecture, left several legacies\r\nto the charities, and £100 for a gold chain to be worn by the Mayor of\r\nNorwich, and which is now worn by the Deputy Mayor.  He died on December\r\n17th, 1715, and was buried with great funeral pomp at St. George’s\r\nColegate.  A portrait of this pious and liberal benefactor was presented\r\nby John and Edward Taylor, Esqs., to the corporation, and placed in the\r\ncouncil chamber, May, 1821.\r\n\r\n_John Hobart_, Earl of Buckinghamshire, sat as member of parliament for\r\nthis city from 1747 to 1756, when he succeeded to the peerage.  He was a\r\nliberal benefactor to the city.  He was born August 17th, 1723, and died\r\nSeptember 3rd, 1793.\r\n\r\n_James Hooke_, a celebrated musician, author of more than 2400 songs, 140\r\ncomplete works or operas, one oratorio, and many odes, anthems, &c., was\r\nborn in this city.  At the early age of four years he was capable of\r\nplaying many pieces, and at six he performed in public.  He died in 1813,\r\nleaving two sons by his first wife.  One of them was Dr. James Hooke,\r\nDean of Worcester, who died in 1828.  The other was the celebrated author\r\nof “Sayings and Doings.”\r\n\r\n_David Kinnebrook_, an eminent mathematician, was born here.  He was\r\nmaster of one of the charity schools for forty years, and never absented\r\nhimself a single day until his last illness.  He died March 23rd, 1810,\r\naged 72.\r\n\r\n_John Lens_, _Esq._, _M.A._, ancient sergeant at law, is believed to have\r\nbeen born in the parish of St. Andrew’s, and was educated here.  In 1781,\r\nhe was called to the bar.  He first practised in the Courts of King’s\r\nBench, but being made a sergeant, confined himself chiefly to the common\r\npleas.  He was afterwards made King’s and next King’s Ancient Sergeant.\r\nOn more than one occasion he declined the offer of the bench.  He died\r\nAugust 6th, 1825, in his 69th year.\r\n\r\n_Richard Lubbock_, _M.D._, was born here in 1759, and was educated at the\r\nFree Grammar School.  He obtained his degree at Edinburgh in 1784.  On\r\nhis return to Norwich he practised with great success.  He died September\r\n1st, 1808, and was buried at Earlham church.\r\n\r\nThe _Right Rev. Jacob Mountain_, _D.D._, was the first protestant bishop\r\nin the Canadas.  He was born in the parish of St. Andrew.  He presided\r\nover the church in the two Canadas for thirty-two years, and died June\r\n16th, 1825, in the seventy-fifth year of his age.\r\n\r\n_Samuel Parr_, _LL.D._, was master of the Free Grammar School from 1778\r\nto 1792, when he resigned on being presented to the rectory of Buckden,\r\nin Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n_Edward Rigby_, _M.D._, was born at Chawbent, in Lancashire, December\r\n9th, 1749.  He was under the tuition of Dr. Priestley until he was\r\nfourteen, when he was apprenticed to Mr. David Martineau of this city.\r\nIn 1805 he was elected mayor, and died Oct. 27th, 1822.  In August, 1818,\r\nthe corporation voted him and his lady a piece of plate of the value of\r\ntwenty-five guineas, as a memento of the memorable birth of their four\r\nchildren at one time, and the event was recorded in the city books.  Two\r\nof the children lived to be nearly twelve weeks old, and the other two\r\nnot quite seven weeks.\r\n\r\n_William Saint_, one of the mathematical masters of the Royal Military\r\nAcademy, at Woolwich, was a native of St. Mary’s Coslany.  He wrote the\r\n“Life of Fransham,” and was a contributor to the “Lady’s Diary.”  He died\r\nJuly 9th, 1819.\r\n\r\n_George Sandby_, _D.D._, chancellor of the diocese of Norwich, personally\r\npresided in the consistorial court of the Lord Bishop of Norwich for\r\nnearly thirty years, during the whole of which time no decree of his was\r\nreversed by a superior court.  He died March 17th, 1807, aged ninety-one.\r\n\r\n_William Say_, an eminent mezzotinto engraver, was born at Lakenham in\r\n1768.\r\n\r\n_Frank Sayers_, _M.D._, an eminent physician and literary character, who\r\nfor many years resided in this city, was born in London, March 3rd, 1763.\r\nHe was the author of “Dramatic Sketches of the Ancient Northern\r\nMythology,” “Poems,” “Disquisitious, Metaphysical and Literary,” “Nugæ\r\nPoeticæ,” and “Miscellanies, Antiquarian and Historical.”  He died August\r\n16th, 1817, and a mural monument is erected to his memory in the\r\nCathedral, with a Latin inscription by the Rev. F. Howes.  His works were\r\ncollected and edited by the late William Taylor of this city.\r\n\r\n_Sir James Edward Smith_, _M.D._, _F.R.S._, president of the Linnæan\r\nSociety, London, and of the Norwich Museum, and member of several foreign\r\nacademies, was born in St. Peter’s Mancroft, December 2nd, 1759.  He\r\nreceived his education here, and graduated as a physician at Leyden, in\r\n1786.  He assisted materially in the establishment of the Linnæan\r\nSociety, in 1788, of which he was the first president, and he continued\r\nto preside over the society until his death, March 15th, 1828.  He was\r\nthe author of several admirable botanical works.\r\n\r\n_William Stevenson_, _F.S.A._, who was for many years proprietor of the\r\n“Norfolk Chronicle,” and who edited a new edition of “Bentham’s History\r\nof Ely Cathedral,” was born at East Retford, in 1750, and died at his\r\nhouse in Surrey Street in this city, May 13th, 1821, aged seventy-one.\r\nHe was, in the early part of his life, an artist of no mean pretension;\r\nand was esteemed an antiquarian and numismatist of considerable knowledge\r\nand research.\r\n\r\n_John Taylor_, _D.D._, was a native of Lancaster.  He came to Norwich in\r\n1733, and was a minister to the Presbyterian dissenters in 1757.  He was\r\nthe author of several theological works, and died at Warrington, March\r\n5th, 1761, aged sixty-six.\r\n\r\n_William Taylor_, a celebrated German scholar, and a very eccentric\r\ncharacter, author of an “Historical Survey of German Poetry,” and a\r\ntranslator of several German works, was born in this city, and resided\r\nfor many years in Upper King Street.  He died in 1836, aged sixty-nine.\r\n\r\n_Edward Baron Thurlow_ was born at Bracon Ash, in this county.  He\r\nreceived the rudiments of his education at the Free Grammar School here.\r\nHe rose successively to be appointed solicitor general, attorney general,\r\nmaster of the rolls, and lord high chancellor of Great Britain, and was\r\ncreated Lord Thurlow in 1778.  In 1793 he resigned the seals.  He died at\r\nBrighton, September 12th, 1806.\r\n\r\n_William Wilkins_, _sen._, architect, was born in the parish of St.\r\nBenedict, about the year 1744 or 1747.  He received but a limited\r\neducation, but possessed an admirable taste for design, and his plans and\r\ndrawings were very beautiful.  He was the author of a clever essay in\r\nVol. xii. of the “Archæologia,” on the Venta Icenorum.\r\n\r\n_William Wilkins_, _M.A._, son of the above, was born in St. Giles’\r\nparish.  He was educated at the Free Grammar School here.  He was\r\nemployed in the erection of several public buildings in London, and\r\nnumerous private mansions.  His literary labours were confined to the\r\nsubject of architecture, and his “Magna Græcia” is considered to be an\r\nexcellent work.\r\n\r\n_William Windham_.  This eminent statesman represented the city in\r\nseveral parliaments.  He was born in London in 1750, and first sat for\r\nNorwich in 1780.  In 1783 he was appointed secretary to the lord\r\nlieutenant of Ireland, and made his first speech in parliament in 1785.\r\nHe died in 1806.\r\n\r\n_Sir Benjamin Wrench_, an eminent physician, who practised here for sixty\r\nyears, lived in St. Andrew’s.  His house occupied the site of the present\r\nCorn Exchange.  He was lord of the manor of Little Melton in Blomefield’s\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the present age of political progress, and\r\nmaterial prosperity; the age of inventions, railways, newspapers, and\r\ntelegraphs; the age of expansion and general intelligence.  George III.,\r\nGeorge IV., and William IV., have reigned in this century, and have been\r\nsucceeded by our beloved Queen Victoria.  Under her benign sway the old\r\nsemi-barbarous state of society has passed away like a dream, and we live\r\nin a new social era, the result of the progress of education, of the\r\nmarch of improvement, and of the spread of true religion.\r\n\r\nAs it has been often stated by local historians that Norwich formerly\r\ncontained a very large population, and as this statement is very\r\ngenerally believed, we may here correct the mistake by giving the\r\nreturns, which show a very gradual, and very slow increase from the\r\nearliest period to the present time.  The parochial returns show that in\r\n1693 the population was only 28,881; in 1752 it had increased to 36,169;\r\nand in 1786 to 40,051.  This was the greatest number up to the end of the\r\nlast century.  In 1801 it was 36,832, not including 6,000 recruits for\r\nthe army, navy, and militia; making the total number 42,832.  This\r\nindicates a very slow increase of population.  The following are the\r\nreturns for the present century: 1801, 36,832; 1811, 37,256; 1821,\r\n50,288; 1831, 61,116; 1841, 62,294; 1851, 68,713; 1861, 74,414, being an\r\nincrease of about 500 yearly.  Norwich in 1752 contained only 7131\r\nhouses, and in 1801 8763, of which 1747 were returned as empty.  In 1831\r\nthe number was 14,201, of which 13,132 were inhabited.  Now the number is\r\nover 21,000, and the rateable value is £178,882.\r\n\r\nWe must now leave the stately march of history for a more broken and\r\ninterrupted step.  There is some difficulty in detailing the events of\r\nthis period, for every reader is more or less acquainted with it, and has\r\nviewed it in relation to his own interests and prejudices.  The records\r\nof facts are so voluminous, that every reader may think that there is\r\nsomething omitted, or misrepresented, or exaggerated.  It is impossible,\r\nhowever, to mention every local occurrence which some one may think\r\nimportant, every accident, or fire, or crime, or every grand concert or\r\nentertainment.  We have to deal with events more connected with general\r\nhistory; and we shall first state the more remarkable occurrences of a\r\ncivil or municipal character, reserving political matters for a\r\nsubsequent chapter.  But in order to render our narrative of local\r\nevents, and especially local elections, more intelligible, it will be\r\nnecessary to give a brief account of the old corporation, whose\r\nproceedings occupy so large a part of our records.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH CORPORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis body claims a prescriptive origin.  Certain privileges were granted\r\nto the city by the charters of different sovereigns, the first being that\r\nof Henry I., which was annulled and again renewed by Stephen.  The\r\nparticular privileges conceded by it cannot now be ascertained.  The next\r\ncharter is that of the 5th Henry II., but this is only confirmatory of\r\nformer grants, and the original is still preserved in the Guildhall.  One\r\ngranted by Richard I. contains some estimable clauses.  The most\r\nprominent are, that no citizen shall be forced to answer any plea or\r\naction in any but the city courts, except for those concerning\r\npossessions out of the city; that the citizens should have _acquittance_\r\nof _murder_, which is equivalent to granting them a coroner; that they\r\nshould not be forced to _duel_, that is, should be exempt from the\r\ngeneral law which was then in force, of deciding causes by single combat;\r\nthat they should be free from toll throughout all England; and that they\r\nshould have other liberties, all highly important, and no doubt justly\r\nappreciated by the citizens of that period.  King John’s charter is\r\nsimilar to the preceding, and that of Henry II., with the addition that\r\nall persons living in the city, and participating in the liberties of the\r\ncitizens, shall be talliated or taxed, and pay as the aforesaid citizens\r\nof Norwich do, when tollages and aid shall be laid upon them.  It is\r\nprobable that the principal authority was invested in bailiffs, instead\r\nof a provost, in 1223, as there is no evidence of the existence of such\r\nofficers before that time.\r\n\r\nTwo deeds of Henry III., and several of succeeding kings, all either\r\nconfirmed or enlarged the privileges granted to the city; but our\r\nattention is most attracted by the concessions of Henry IV., which\r\nestablished the constitution of a mayor, sheriffs, &c.  The original\r\ncharter is lost, but those of his son and more modern princes have\r\nsufficiently preserved the spirit of it.  The charter of Henry V. made\r\nthe extensive territory within the corporation limits a county of itself,\r\nexcepting only the castle, which belonged to Norfolk.  This territory\r\nwas, by the boundary act, included for the purposes of representation.\r\nTwenty-five charters, the latest by James II., are known to have been\r\ngranted, and probably others existed and have been lost.  When the\r\ninnovations, made in old establishments during the Commonwealth, were\r\ngradually reformed, the citizens petitioned for a renewal of their\r\nrights.  The charter of 15th Charles II. was obtained, and under it the\r\ncity was governed till the passing of the Municipal Reform Act.  Most of\r\nthe old charters were granted in consideration for sums of money given or\r\nlent to kings to enable them to carry on wars.  Many of the charters were\r\nmore injurious than beneficial to the city, as they created monopolies of\r\none kind or other, or gave powers to the old corporation which were\r\nfrequently abused.  Those who wish to study those old documents more\r\nminutely may find them in Blomefield’s history.\r\n\r\nThe old corporation was more ornamental than useful to the city for 400\r\nyears.  Under it the sanitary state of the city was so bad, the drainage\r\nof the city so defective, and the supply of water so insufficient, that\r\nplagues and pestilences, which carried off thousands of the citizens,\r\nwere of frequent occurrence.  Ward elections were so often contested,\r\nthat bribery, treating, and intimidation, were quite common, and the\r\ncorruption of the freemen and lower classes was universal.  Physically\r\nand morally the city was for centuries in the worst possible condition.\r\nThe ward elections were carried on with a spirit which was surpassed in\r\nno other place.  They were considered as trials of strength between\r\ndifferent parties; and if they happened at a period when a general\r\nelection was anticipated, an enormous sum of money was spent in treating\r\nand bribery.  Indeed, it has been asserted on good authority that no less\r\na sum than £16,000 was wasted in the contest for a single ward in 1818!\r\nThe city was divided into four great wards, each of which was subdivided\r\ninto three small wards.  The mayor was elected by the freemen on May 1st,\r\nand sworn into his office on the Guild day, which was always the Tuesday\r\nbefore Midsummer day.  He was chosen from the aldermen, and afterwards he\r\nwas a magistrate for life.  One of the sheriffs was chosen by the court\r\nof aldermen, the other by the freemen on the last Tuesday in August.  The\r\ntwenty-four aldermen were chosen for the twelve smaller wards, two for\r\neach ward, whose office was to keep the peace in their several divisions.\r\nWhen anyone of them died, the freemen of that great ward in which the\r\nlesser ward was included, for which he was to serve, elected another in\r\nhis place within five days.  The common councilmen were elected by the\r\nfreemen dwelling in each of the four great wards separately; for\r\nConisford great ward on the Monday; Mancroft on the Tuesday; Wymer on the\r\nWednesday; and the Northern ward on the Thursday in Passion week, thence\r\ncalled “cleansing” week.  They chose a speaker yearly, who was called\r\nspeaker of the commons.  The old freemen therefore formed the whole of\r\nthe local constituency for municipal purposes.\r\n\r\nMemoirs are often the best sources of information respecting public\r\nmatters, as they let us behind the scenes and show us what the actors\r\nreally thought and did.  A good memoir of the late Professor Taylor,\r\nwhich appeared in the _Norfolk News_, of March 28th and April 4th, 1863,\r\ncontained the following, “So far back as 1808 we find Mr. Taylor\r\nrecording that he was ‘elected a common councilman for the fourth time.’”\r\nHe also states that the contest for nominees in the Long ward was “the\r\nseverest ever remembered.”  Few people now-a-days could realize the\r\nimport of those few words.  Few understand how much was implied by the\r\nonce common phrase “a battle for the Long ward.”  The combatants would\r\nhave scorned such mealy-mouthed appellations, as “conservative” and\r\n“liberal,” or indeed any name but that of the colors under which they\r\nfought.  They were “blue-and-whites,” or “orange-and-purples;” the former\r\nbeing what would now be called the “liberal,” and the latter the\r\n“conservative,” party.  To be a blue-and-white or an orange-and-purple,\r\nwas to be an angel or a devil, as the case might be; the angels being of\r\ncourse those of your own side, to whichever you belonged.  Great was the\r\npotency of colors: though not supposed to be worn at municipal elections,\r\nthey were a rallying cry, and they were always at hand to be flouted,\r\nlike a red rag at a turkey, in the face of the enemy.  Even housemaids\r\nand children concealed them about their persons, in readiness to show\r\nthem slyly from some window, both to encourage their friends and\r\nexasperate their enemies, whenever a procession passed.  Great were the\r\npreparations for the contest.  A sort of civic press-gang prowled the\r\nstreets by night for the purpose of “cooping chickens,” which, being done\r\ninto English, means carrying men off by force, and keeping them drunk and\r\nin confinement, so that if they could not be got to vote “for” it would\r\nbe impossible for them to vote “against.”  If they could not be safely\r\nsecured in the city, they were “cribbed, cabined, and confined” in\r\nwherries on the river, or the broads, or even taken to Yarmouth and\r\ncarried out to sea.  When the day of battle came, great was the shouting,\r\nthe drinking, the betting, the bribing, and the fighting, till the\r\nlongest purse contrived to win the day.  Of course, the dirty work was\r\ndone by dirty men.  But leading men on both sides were so used to see\r\nthis sort of thing, that they considered it only as a necessary part and\r\nparcel of an election.  It was regarded rather as a limb which could not\r\nbe safely severed from the body, than as a shabby coat which disgraced\r\nthe wearer.  Besides, palliating rhetoric was not absent.  Better do a\r\nlittle evil than surrender a cause essential to the welfare of the state!\r\n“What we did,” we honest orange-and-purples, or we pure blue-and-whites,\r\n“was done in mere self-defence.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEADING EVENTS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1801.  January 1st, 1801, being the first day of the nineteenth century,\r\nand the day on which the Union of Great Britain and Ireland took place,\r\nthe 13th Regiment of Light Dragoons dismounted, and the Militia fired a\r\n_feu de joie_ in the Market Place.\r\n\r\nJanuary 3rd.  The old Theatre (built in 1757) was re-opened after\r\nextensive improvements.  The alterations were executed after the designs\r\nof William Wilkins, Esq., the patentee.  This theatre was formerly a good\r\nschool for young actors, and many promising performers have first\r\nappeared on these boards.  Of late, operatic performances appear to be\r\nmost in favour with the gentry.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24th.  Charles Harvey, Esq., the steward, was unanimously\r\nelected Recorder of Norwich, vice Henry Partridge, Esq., resigned.\r\n\r\nApril 4th.  Mrs. Lloyd, widow of the Rev. Dean Lloyd, died at Cambridge,\r\naged 79.  This lady painted the Transfiguration, and other figures in the\r\neastern windows of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn April, the ward elections were the causes of great contention.  In\r\nconsequence of objections being made to the elections of two nominees of\r\nthe Wymer ward, and three of the Northern ward, on the ground of their\r\nbeing ineligible under the corporation act, having omitted to receive the\r\nsacrament within a year previous to the election of the common council,\r\nthe mayor did not make the returns till several days after the usual\r\ntime.  At a court held April 4th, after the objections had been fully\r\nheard by counsel, the recorder (Mr. Harvey) declared that the persons\r\nobjected to who had the majority of votes, having omitted to come into\r\ncourt according to summons, were not duly elected, but as no regular\r\nnotice had been given previous to the election, the candidates in the\r\nminority could not be returned.  A new election for the above wards\r\naccordingly took place on May 25th and 26th.\r\n\r\nJune 16th.  Jeremiah Ives, Esq., of Catton, was elected mayor a second\r\ntime.  There was no guild feast this year at St. Andrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\nJune 25th.  An awful fire, which lasted two hours, broke out on the roof\r\nof the Cathedral, and in less than an hour, 45 feet of the leaded roof,\r\ntowards the western end of the nave, were consumed.  Some plumbers had\r\nbeen at work repairing the roof, and set fire to it either accidentally\r\nor intentionally.  The damage was about £500.  The Lord Bishop (Dr.\r\nSutton) was present, and distributed refreshment to the soldiers and\r\npeople who assisted in arresting the progress of the conflagration.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1802.  Peace was proclaimed throughout the city on May the 4th, in due\r\nform; and the mayor and corporation went in procession from the hall\r\nthrough the principal streets.  There was a general illumination at\r\nnight.  At a quarterly assembly of the council, a congratulatory address\r\nto his majesty on the restoration of peace, was voted unanimously.\r\n\r\nOn May 21st, the city address was presented to the king, at the levee at\r\nSt. James’ Palace, by Jeremiah Ives, Esq., Junr., the mayor, and Sir\r\nRoger Kerrison.\r\n\r\nOn May 29th, a county meeting was held, when a similar address was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nOctober 4th to 7th.  A grand musical festival was held in Norwich, under\r\nthe direction of Messrs. Beckwith and Sharp of this city, and Mr. Ashley\r\nof London.  Mrs. Billington, Mr. Bartleman, and Mr. Braham, were the\r\nprincipal performers.\r\n\r\nOctober 21st.  There was a severe contest for the election of an alderman\r\nin the great northern ward, in the room of Francis Colombine, Esq.,\r\nresigned.  The numbers were—for E. Rigby, Esq., 261; Jonathan Davey,\r\nEsq., 259.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1803.  February 8th.  At a full meeting held at the Guildhall, a\r\ncommittee was appointed to prepare a bill to be laid before a future\r\nmeeting, for better paving, lighting, watching, and cleansing the city.\r\nA petition to the house of commons for leave to bring in a bill, was\r\nafterwards presented, but it was strongly opposed as not being then\r\nexpedient.  An act was, however, ultimately carried.\r\n\r\nMarch 7th.  At a special assembly of the corporation, an address of\r\ncongratulation was adopted, to be presented to his majesty, on the\r\nprovidential discovery of the late traitorous conspiracy against his\r\nroyal person and government, entered into by Colonel Despard and six\r\nother persons, who were executed on the top of the New Surrey prison, in\r\nHorsemonger Lane.  The high sheriff and grand jury of Norfolk, at\r\nThetford, also voted an address of congratulation to the king, and a\r\nsimilar address was adopted at a county meeting held at the Shirehall.\r\n\r\nMarch 21st.  The portrait of Captain John Harvey, of the Norwich Light\r\nHorse volunteers, painted by Mr. Opie, at the request of the troop, was\r\nplaced in St. Andrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\nApril 27th.  A public dispensary was established in Norwich, and has been\r\na great benefit to the poor people of the city.\r\n\r\nAugust 16th.  France having again threatened to invade this kingdom, a\r\nmeeting of the inhabitants of the city was held at the Guildhall, for the\r\npurpose of forming a regiment of volunteer infantry under the regulations\r\nof the Acts for the defence of the realm, when resolutions to that effect\r\nwere adopted, and upwards of £6400 subscribed, and 1400 citizens enrolled\r\nthemselves under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Harvey.  A rifle corps was\r\nalso formed, of which R. M. Bacon, Esq., then editor of the Mercury, was\r\nappointed Captain.  Both parties manifested the greatest enthusiasm, but\r\nfortunately the services of the local warriors were not required.  On\r\nSeptember 29th, a new telegraph was erected on the top of Norwich Castle,\r\nto communicate with Strumpshaw Mill, Filby Church, and Yarmouth, so as to\r\ngive notice of any danger.  In October, the Norfolk and Norwich volunteer\r\nregiments agreed to perform permanent duty at Yarmouth in case of\r\ninvasion, and many of them were stationed in the port during the\r\nsucceeding two months.  The victory of the Norfolk hero, Lord Nelson, at\r\nTrafalgar in 1805, discouraged Napoleon I., and he relinquished his\r\nintention to invade this land of freedom.  In July 1806, the local\r\nmilitia act was passed, and many of the volunteers transferred their\r\nservices to that body.  The volunteer corps of Norwich and Norfolk were\r\ndisbanded on March 24th, 1813.  The West Norfolk militia returned to\r\nNorwich from Ireland, on May 11th, 1816, and were disembodied on June\r\n17th in that year.  A long peace of 40 years ensued, but the old trade of\r\nNorwich destroyed by the war, never revived.  In January, 1817, upwards\r\nof £3000 were contributed to relieve the poor, many of whom were employed\r\nin making a new road to Carrow, and in other public works, the trade of\r\nthe city being in a state of stagnation.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1804.  January 18th.  The city of Norwich Regiment of Volunteer Infantry,\r\n600 strong, commanded by Lieut. Col. Harvey, received their colours.  The\r\nbanners, given by the mayor and corporation, were first consecrated in\r\nthe Market Place, by the Rev. E. S. Thurlow, prebendary of Norwich, with\r\na suitable address and prayer, and were afterwards presented by the\r\nmayor, John Morse, Esq., to the colonel in due form.  The king’s and\r\nregimental standards were then delivered to the ensigns.  The Artillery,\r\nunder Capt. Fyers, stationed on the Castle Hill, fired salutes; the\r\nRegiment fired three vollies; and St. Peter’s bells rang merry peals.\r\n\r\nJune 1st.  The city of Norwich (or 7th) Regiment of Norfolk Volunteer\r\nInfantry, commanded by Lieut. Colonel Harvey, entered on one month’s\r\npermanent duty in Norwich.  The Regiment mustered 500 strong, exclusive\r\nof officers.\r\n\r\nJune 4th.  The anniversary of His Majesty’s birthday was celebrated in\r\nNorwich by the grandest military spectacle ever witnessed here.  Upwards\r\nof 1700 men of the Royal Artillery, 24th Regiment of Foot, and the\r\nNorwich Volunteer Corps, assembled on the Castle Hill and fired a _feu de\r\njoie_ with fine effect.  During this year the citizens were often\r\nentertained with military displays.  June 18th, Major General Money was\r\nappointed to the staff of the eastern district; in which a force of\r\n32,000 men was now fully completed for the reception of any invading\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nJune 18th.  The corporation granted the site of the Blackfriars, in St.\r\nAndrew’s, to the court of guardians, for 200 years at their old rent for\r\nthe purpose of improving the same, and repairing the Old Workhouse for\r\nthe poor, the plan of erecting a New Workhouse having been abandoned.\r\nSubsequently, large sums of money were wasted in repairing the old house,\r\nsufficient to build a new one, and ultimately it was found to be\r\nabsolutely necessary to build a new house, which was done at a cost of\r\n£30,000.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1805.  January 17th.  At a public meeting held at the Guildhall, it was\r\nresolved to establish an hospital and school for the indigent blind, in\r\nNorwich and Norfolk.  Towards the foundation of this admirable\r\ninstitution, Thomas Tawell, Esq., contributed a house and three\r\nand-a-half acres of land in Magdalen Street, valued at £1050.  Mr.\r\nTawell, who was unfortunately blind, introduced his humane proposal in an\r\nable speech, appealing for subscriptions.  A large sum was at once\r\nsubscribed.  The hospital was opened on the 14th October following.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2nd.  Dr. Charles Manners Sutton, bishop of Norwich, was\r\nnominated by the king, and chosen, February 12th, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury.  On the 13th, His Grace arrived at the palace, Norwich, from\r\nLondon.  On the 15th, the mayor and court of aldermen proceeded in state\r\nfrom the Guildhall to the Bishop’s Palace, where the recorder, Mr.\r\nHarvey, delivered an address of congratulation to the archbishop on his\r\ntranslation, to which His Grace returned a dignified answer.  Next day,\r\nthe clergy of Norwich waited on His Grace, when the Rev. Dr. Pretyman,\r\nprebendary, addressed the archbishop in an appropriate speech, to which\r\nHis Grace made an impressive reply.  On the 17th His Grace preached his\r\nfarewell sermon in the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24th.  The clergy of Norwich having intimated an intention of\r\napplying to Parliament for an increase of their incomes, then very small,\r\nby assessment, the council, at a quarterly assembly, resolved to oppose\r\nthe application; the citizens, in vestry meetings, being unanimous\r\nagainst the measure, which was never carried out.\r\n\r\nMarch 18th.  Dr. Henry Bathurst (one of the prebendaries of Durham) was\r\nelected bishop of Norwich by the dean and chapter.  He soon made himself\r\nuniversally beloved by the clergy and the citizens.  Professor Taylor\r\ngave the following account of the late and also of the newly appointed\r\nbishop:—\r\n\r\n    “In 1805, Dr. Bathurst succeeded Dr. Sutton as bishop of Norwich.\r\n    The latter, who had been translated to the See of Canterbury, was a\r\n    man of polished manners, extravagant habits, and courtier-like\r\n    address.  He was too polite to quarrel with anybody and too prudent\r\n    to provoke controversy.  He neither felt nor affected to feel any\r\n    horror of Unitarians.  He invited them to his table, and at the\r\n    request of the mayor, he preached a charity sermon at St. George’s\r\n    Colegate, knowing that my father had been asked and had consented to\r\n    write the hymns.”\r\n\r\n    “Dr. Bathurst removed from Durham to Norwich, and as he was a\r\n    stranger in his new residence, never having taken any prominent part\r\n    as a public man, little expectation was excited as to his future\r\n    conduct.  He was known to owe his elevation to his relation, Lord\r\n    Bathurst; and it was generally taken for granted that his views on\r\n    public affairs were similar to those of the administration of which\r\n    that noble lord was a member.  Curiosity led me to the Cathedral to\r\n    hear the new bishop’s primary charge, and I soon found the spirit it\r\n    breathed to resemble the benevolence that beamed from his\r\n    countenance.”\r\n\r\n    “What the bishop preached he also practised.  He never shrunk from\r\n    appearing to be what he really was, nor while he received a dissenter\r\n    in his study with politeness would he pass him unnoticed in the\r\n    street.  He was to be seen walking arm-in-arm with persons, of all\r\n    persuasions, whom he respected, in the streets of Norwich.  He was\r\n    not afraid of shaking ‘brother Madge,’ as he called him, by the hand,\r\n    nor of welcoming Unitarians to his table.  What he was as a member of\r\n    the house of peers, on all occasions in which the great principles of\r\n    religious liberty were concerned, is well known.  I have only here to\r\n    speak of his conduct as a resident in Norwich.”\r\n\r\nSept 3rd.  The committee of the court of guardians appointed to examine\r\nthe poor rates of the city and hamlets, for the purpose of obtaining a\r\nmore equal assessment, made their report, in which they stated that an\r\nincrease of £16,000 stock and £1800 rent, calculating on the half rental\r\nonly, might be made, and recommended a general survey and new valuation\r\nto be taken, in consequence of the great alteration which had taken place\r\nin property since 1786, when the previous survey was taken.\r\n\r\nDecember 17th.  There was a grand entertainment at the Assembly Rooms, in\r\nhonour of Lord Nelson’s glorious victory off Cape Trafalgar; more than\r\n450 ladies and gentlemen of the city and county were present.  The rooms\r\nwere decorated with transparencies and brilliantly illuminated for a\r\ngrand ball and supper.  The victory so celebrated, and which had been won\r\non October 21st, was dearly purchased by the death of Viscount Nelson.\r\nThe last order given before the action began, was by the newly-invented\r\ntelegraph:—“England expects every man to do his duty.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1806.  January 9th.  This day the great bells of the several churches in\r\nthe city were tolled from twelve till two o’clock, it being the day on\r\nwhich the remains of the immortal Lord Nelson were interred under the\r\ndome of St. Paul’s Cathedral.  The body, after lying in state in the hall\r\nof Greenwich Hospital, was brought thence on January 8th by water to\r\nWhitehall stairs, and carried on a bier to the Admiralty Office, and\r\ndeposited in the Captain’s room for the night.  Next day the corpse was\r\nremoved on a funeral car, drawn by six horses, to St. Paul’s.  The Duke\r\nof York headed the procession, the grandest ever witnessed; 500 persons\r\nof distinction attended at the funeral.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24th.  At a quarterly assembly of the corporation, a loyal\r\naddress was unanimously adopted, to be presented to His Majesty,\r\n“expressive of their gratitude for the paternal affection which he has\r\nshown to his subjects, by waiving every consideration, but the public\r\ngood, in the appointment of men of the first abilities in the country to\r\nthe high offices of state!”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1807.  March 4th.  A committee of the House of Commons declared Mr.\r\nWindham and Mr. Coke not duly elected, and another election took place\r\nfor two members for the county.  Sir J. H. Astley, Bart., and Edward\r\nCoke, Esq., (of Derby) were returned without opposition.  Mr. Windham\r\nafterwards took his seat for New Romney, and Mr. Coke was returned for\r\nDerby _vice_ his brother, who had previously accepted the Chiltern\r\nHundreds.\r\n\r\nMay 14th.  The anniversary of the birthday of that illustrious statesman,\r\nthe Right Hon. Wm. Windham, was celebrated at the Angel Inn (now Royal\r\nHotel) by a large party of his numerous friends.  William Smith, Esq.,\r\nM.P., presided.\r\n\r\nJune 16th.

The first meeting was held of the revived Norfolk Club at\r\nthe Angel Inn, Norwich.  Sir John Lombe, Bart., was in the chair.  The\r\nHon. Colonel Fitzroy, Mr. W. Smith, and Mr. Windham were also present.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1808.  January.  By the telegraph, orders from the Admiralty Office were\r\nreceived at Yarmouth, in 17 minutes.  The chain of communication was by\r\nStrumpshaw, Thorpe Hills, Honingham, Carlton, and Harling, and from\r\nthence proceeded between Thetford and Bury, over Newmarket Heath to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Manby’s invention for rescuing persons stranded on a lee shore,\r\nwas approved by the Lords of the Admiralty.  Parliament rewarded Captain\r\nManby at different times with grants amounting to £6000, and adopted his\r\napparatus at many parts of the coast.\r\n\r\nJuly 29th.  At a special assembly of the corporation of Norwich, an\r\naddress to his majesty was agreed to unanimously, on the subject of the\r\nnoble struggle of the patriots of Spain and Portugal against the Ruler of\r\nFrance, and of the generous aid given to their endeavours by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1809.  January.  In consequence of Colonel Robert Harvey not being joined\r\nby a sufficient number of the Volunteers under his command to become a\r\nlocal Militia Battalion, he resigned the command of the Norwich Volunteer\r\nRegiment, and was succeeded by Colonel De Hague.\r\n\r\nMay 9th.  The six Regiments of Norfolk Local Militia first assembled to\r\nperform 28 days’ exercise.  They were stationed at Norwich, Yarmouth,\r\nSwaffham, and Lynn.\r\n\r\nOctober 15th.  The Norwich corn merchants demanded of the farmers a\r\nmonth’s credit, instead of paying ready money for their corn as\r\nheretofore, but it was resisted by the growers, and ultimately abandoned\r\nby the merchants.\r\n\r\nNovember 2nd.  After an interval of seven years, there was a grand\r\nmusical festival here, combining oratorios at St. Peter’s Church, and\r\nconcerts at the Theatre, under the direction of Mr. Beckwith, eldest son\r\nof the late Dr. Beckwith.  Professor Hague, of Cambridge, led the band.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1810.  January 20th.  The disputes between the corn growers and buyers in\r\nthe city and county, having been amicably adjusted, a reconciliation\r\ndinner took place at the Maid’s Head Inn.  Amongst the toasts was, “Fair\r\nPlay—ready money on both sides, or ready money on neither.”\r\n\r\nFebruary 4th.  Died at Gunton, in his 77th year, the Rt. Hon. Harbord\r\nLord Suffield.  He represented Norwich from 1756 to 1786.  He was much\r\nrespected by his constituents.\r\n\r\nApril 26th.  The first stone of the new bridge at Carrow was laid by the\r\nmayor, T.

Under Mr. Valpy, the school attained great\r\ncelebrity, and here Rajah Brooke and other eminent men were educated.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1811.  January 15th.  Mr. Thomas Roope was convicted at the sessions of\r\nhaving sent a challenge to Mr. Robert Alderson, Steward of the\r\nCorporation, to provoke him to fight a duel; and was sentenced to pay a\r\nfine of 40/- to the king, and to be imprisoned for one month.\r\n\r\nJune 29th.

Strange as it may\r\nseem now, contests often took place for the office of mayor, during the\r\nold corporation.\r\n\r\nJuly 17th.  At a meeting of noblemen, gentry, and clergy, held at the\r\nShirehall, (Lord Viscount Primrose in the chair,) the Norfolk and Norwich\r\nSociety for the education of the poor in the principles of the Church of\r\nEngland, was established.

Harvey were returned as the two highest; but on May 3rd, an objection\r\nwas made to Alderman J. Harvey, as being ineligible, from his not being a\r\nresident inhabitant of the city, as required by charter.  Counsel’s\r\nopinion was obtained in favour of that objection, and another election\r\ntook place on June 7th, when another contest ensued, and after a spirited\r\npoll the numbers were—for Alderman Leman, 797; Alderman Davey, 801.  The\r\nCourt of Aldermen elected the former gentleman.\r\n\r\nJuly 4th.  Great rejoicings took place here on the arrival of the news of\r\nthe great victory obtained by the British army commanded by the Marquis\r\nof Wellington, over the French army, under Joseph Buonaparte, at Vittoria\r\nin Spain, on June 21st, when the enemy lost 151 pieces of cannon, 415\r\nwaggons, all his baggage, and many prisoners.

The scrutiny commenced on the 12th, and continued till\r\nthe 19th, when Alderman Davey declined proceeding further.  Aldermen\r\nRobberds and Back were then returned to the Court of Aldermen, who\r\nelected J. W. Robberds, Esq., to serve the office of Mayor.\r\n\r\nJune 3rd.

The poor in\r\ntheir several parishes participated in the general joy, and were regaled\r\nwith plentiful dinners, paid for by subscriptions.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1815.  March 4th.  The late Professor Taylor stood a contest, for the\r\nthird time, for nominee of St. Peter’s Mancroft ward.  Of course he was\r\nbeaten, this being an orange-and-purple ward, but he polled 107 votes.\r\nHowever, he was soon afterwards elected a common councilman, without\r\ndifficulty, in the Northern ward, where the blue-and-whites had always a\r\nlarge majority.  This was on March 16th, and on May 3rd he was elected a\r\nmember of the court of guardians.  He took a very active part in local\r\npolitics, and was the first man who ever reported and published the\r\nproceedings of the common council.\r\n\r\nJune 23rd.  The glorious news was received in Norwich, with triumphant\r\nrejoicings, of the ever memorable victory obtained by the Duke of\r\nWellington over the French army, commanded by Buonaparte in person, at\r\nWaterloo, near Brussels, on the 18th.  Buonaparte fled to Paris, leaving\r\nupwards of 200 pieces of cannon in the hands of the allied armies.\r\n\r\nJune 27th.  Rejoicings were renewed here on the news being received of\r\nthe second abdication of Buonaparte, the immediate consequence of the\r\ngrand victory of La Belle Alliance.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1816.

At the 51st anniversary of the Castle corporation, Thomas\r\nBack, Esq., alderman, presented two medals to be worn by the recorder and\r\nsteward of the society.  Each medal bore a good likeness of Mr. Pitt, on\r\na beautiful cameo; the motto round which was _Non Sibi sed Patriæ Vixit_.\r\nOn the reverse were the words, “Presented by Thomas Back, Junior, Esq.,\r\nto the Castle Corporation, Norwich, in commemoration of the great victory\r\nof Waterloo, obtained on the 18th June, 1815, by the Allied Armies under\r\nthe command of Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington;” and around this was\r\nthe motto, “In memory of the Right Hon. William Pitt; died the 23rd\r\nJanuary, 1806, aged 47.”\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th.  Died, aged 86, Robert Harvey, Esq., called the Father of\r\nthe City of Norwich, for his great benevolence and liberality and\r\npromotion of trade.\r\n\r\nFebruary 20th.  A numerous meeting was held at the Guildhall, Norwich,\r\nwith the mayor, J. H. Yallop, Esq., in the chair, when resolutions\r\nagainst the property tax, and a petition founded thereon, were passed\r\nunanimously.  Similar petitions were sent from Lynn, Yarmouth, and other\r\ntowns.  County meetings were also held to petition against the tax.\r\n\r\nMarch 29th.  At a public meeting held at the Guildhall, Norwich, with the\r\nmayor in the chair, it was resolved to establish a bank for savings,\r\nwhere servants and others might deposit a portion of their earnings.  It\r\nwas opened on April 29th, and has continued to be very prosperous.\r\n\r\nApril 3rd.  A meeting of merchants, manufacturers, and others, was held\r\nat the Guildhall, Norwich, John Harvey, Esq., presiding, when resolutions\r\nwere passed to instruct the city members to watch and oppose the intended\r\nmeasure for allowing the exportation of wool free of all restrictions.\r\nThis measure was for the time relinquished.\r\n\r\nApril 4th.  At a public meeting held under the presidency of the mayor, a\r\npetition to parliament was adopted for the repeal of the Insolvent\r\nDebtors’ act as being injurious to trade and commerce.  It was not\r\nrepealed for a long time.\r\n\r\nMay 11th.  The West Norfolk militia returned to Norwich from Ireland, and\r\nwere disembodied on the 17th of June.\r\n\r\nMay 16th.  A number of riotous persons, chiefly youths, broke into the\r\nNew Mills, in Norwich, threw some of the flour into the mill pool, and\r\ncommitted several outrages on persons and dwellings before they\r\ndispersed.  The pretext for the disturbance was the want of employment.\r\nThey assembled again on the next evening, but were dispersed by the\r\nmagistrates and military, and several of the rioters were taken into\r\ncustody.  Similar proceedings took place at Downham and other places in\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\nJune 17th.  At a quarterly assembly of the corporation, an address of\r\ncongratulation to the Prince Regent was voted, to be presented to his\r\nRoyal Highness, on the occasion of the marriage of the Princess Charlotte\r\nof Wales, and Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg.  The address was presented\r\nby the city members.  The marriage took place on May 2nd.\r\n\r\nJune 18th.  This day being the anniversary of the glorious victory of\r\nWaterloo, the non-commissioned officers and privates of the First Royal\r\nDragoons, and other soldiers quartered in Norwich, were treated with a\r\nhandsome dinner in the cavalry riding school, several gentlemen having\r\nentered into a subscription for that purpose, the corporation adding the\r\nsum of £10.  Robert Hawkes, Esq., first suggested the entertainment.\r\n\r\nJuly 10th.  An address of congratulation was voted by the court of\r\nmayoralty of Norwich, to be presented to the Princess Charlotte and\r\nPrince Leopold on their marriage.\r\n\r\nOctober 14th.  A public meeting was held in St. Andrew’s Hall (Mr.\r\nSheriff Bolingbroke in the chair), when certain resolutions, and a\r\npetition to parliament founded thereon, were agreed to.  The petition was\r\nfor the greatest possible retrenchment of the public expenditure, and for\r\na Reform of the House of Commons.  Thus early began the Reform movement,\r\nand it continued to extend all over the country.  It became stronger and\r\nstronger, till at last it overcame all opposition.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1817.  January 1st.  At a public meeting in the Guildhall, with the\r\nmayor, William Hankes, Esq., presiding, a subscription was commenced to\r\nrelieve the labouring poor, which amounted to £3050.  The poor people\r\nwere employed on works of public improvement, and were supplied with\r\nsoup, &c.  Upwards of £1000 was also raised at Yarmouth for the same\r\nlaudable purpose, and 460 men were employed in forming roads to the Bath\r\nHouse, Jetty, &c.  The committee in Norwich granted £270 to be expended\r\nfor labour on cutting a road through Butter Hills to Carrow Bridge, which\r\nwas effected in the course of the summer.\r\n\r\nMarch 26th.  The severest contest took place ever known for nominees of\r\nWymer, or the Long ward, very few votes remaining unpolled.  Some of the\r\nfreemen came in post-chaises from Thetford to poll.  The numbers were,\r\nMessrs. S. Mitchell, 306; J. Reynolds, 305; A. Thwaites, 292; Messrs. W.\r\nFoster, 297; R. Purland, 288; C. Higgen, 283.  Mr. Foster was successful,\r\nhaving five votes above Mr. Thwaites, one of the old nominees.\r\n\r\nApril 4th.  On Good Friday morning, Wright’s Norwich and Yarmouth steam\r\npacket had just started from the Foundry Bridge, when the boiler of the\r\nengine burst with a tremendous explosion, by which the vessel was blown\r\nto atoms, and of 22 persons on board, five men three women, and one child\r\nwere instantly killed.  Six women with fractured arms and legs were\r\nconveyed to the hospital, where one died.  The remaining seven escaped\r\nwithout much injury.  A subscription amounting to £350 was raised for the\r\nsufferers.  Soon afterwards, a packet was introduced on the river, worked\r\nby four horses, as in a thrashing machine; the animals walking in a path\r\n18 feet in diameter.  The vessel was propelled from six to seven miles an\r\nhour, as wind and tide favoured.  This packet did not long run, and steam\r\npackets were again introduced, which went from Norwich to Yarmouth daily.\r\n\r\nSeptember 26th.  A meeting was held in St. Andrew’s Hall, when an\r\nauxiliary association to the London Society for Promoting Christianity\r\namongst the Jews was established.  The Lord Bishop of Norwich was\r\nappointed president.  Annual meetings have been held ever since to\r\npromote the objects of the society.\r\n\r\nDecember 3rd.  At a special meeting of the corporation, two addresses of\r\ncondolence, one to the Prince Regent, and the other to Prince Leopold, of\r\nSaxe Coburg, were voted, expressive of the grief of the citizens on the\r\ndeath of the Princess Charlotte.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1818.  January 5th.  The court of guardians having determined to proceed\r\nin the valuation of the property in the city and hamlets, Messrs. Rook,\r\nAthow, and Stannard were appointed to make such valuation.  They were to\r\nbe paid £850 for their trouble.\r\n\r\nA repository was established in Norwich for the sale of articles of\r\ningenuity, to increase the funds of the society for relieving the sick\r\npoor in Norwich.  The first exhibition took place on Tombland fair day,\r\nat Mr. Noverre’s room.\r\n\r\nMarch 11th.  This year, the several wards in Norwich (except the Northern\r\nward) were strongly contested, particularly the Wymer ward.  After a\r\nspirited poll for nominees of the common council, the numbers were for\r\nMr. Foster, 361; Mr. Higgen, 357; Mr. Purland, 355; Mr. Mitchell, 345;\r\nMr. Culley, 340; Mr. Beckwith, 322.  The liberal party at last obtained\r\nthe ascendancy, but had to pay for it.  The expenditure at this local\r\ncontest was estimated at some thousands.  From £15 to £40 were given for\r\nvotes, and the freemen were brought in carriages from the country.\r\n\r\nMay 16th.  This being Guild-day, Barnabas Leman, Esq., was sworn in mayor\r\nof Norwich for the second time.  The corporation went in procession to\r\nthe Cathedral, preceded by the Blue and White Clubs, the freemen wearing\r\nthose colours in their hats, which was considered improper and ill-timed.\r\nMr. William Smith, before the procession started, after recommending his\r\nfriends to abstain from this display of party feeling on such a day,\r\npulled his colours from his hat and put them in his pocket.  It being\r\nquite a matter of taste, his example was not followed.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1819.  This year some important meetings were held, and a good deal of\r\npolitical excitement prevailed in the city.  Mr. E. Taylor was elected\r\nsheriff after a contest with Mr. T. S. Day.  The former was evidently the\r\npopular candidate, the numbers being for Taylor 807, for Day 530.  In\r\nacknowledging the honour which had been conferred upon him he said,—\r\n\r\n    “There are times, gentlemen, when the post of honour is the post of\r\n    duty—times when it is the duty of every man to stand forward to\r\n    maintain and uphold the laws of his country, and prevent them from\r\n    being outraged.  Such, gentlemen, are the present.  Scenes have\r\n    recently been exhibited in a distant part of this country which I\r\n    blush to mention.  The laws have there been outraged and trodden\r\n    under foot, not by the people, but by the magistrates, whose duty it\r\n    was to protect them.  At Manchester we have seen a merciless\r\n    soldiery, or rather, I should say, persons wearing red coats, and\r\n    pretending to be soldiers, let loose to butcher men, women, and\r\n    children in cold blood who were peaceably and legally met to\r\n    discharge a duty which they owed to their country.  The right of\r\n    petitioning is a right which, till lately, we have enjoyed\r\n    uninterruptedly, none daring to make us afraid; and where is the man\r\n    who will tell me that these people did not legally and\r\n    constitutionally meet?  But, gentlemen, they have been treated in a\r\n    manner so brutal and inhuman, that our history furnishes no\r\n    parallel.”\r\n\r\nHe alluded to the “Peterloo Massacre” as it was then called, and which\r\nexcited universal indignation throughout the country.\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th.  The birthday of Mr. Fox was commemorated, by nearly 250\r\ngentlemen, at the Assembly rooms.  The earl of Albemarle presided,\r\nsupported by Mr. Coke and Viscount Bury.  The high sheriff was at the\r\nhead of the right hand table, and Mr. Wm. Smith of the left.  After\r\ndinner, speeches were delivered, setting forth the views of the Liberal\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nApril 15th.  A public meeting was held in St. Andrew’s Hall, when a\r\npetition to the House of Commons against the duty on coals (6s. 6d. per\r\nchaldron) was adopted by acclamation.  R. H. Gurney, Esq., M.P., assured\r\nthe meeting that he should support the prayer of the petition, and do\r\neverything in his power towards alleviating the burdens of his\r\nfellow-citizens.  The tax was ultimately abolished.\r\n\r\nApril 22nd.  The duke of Sussex arrived in Norwich and lodged at the\r\nhouse of William Foster, Esq., in Queen Street, where his royal highness\r\nwas waited upon by the mayor and corporation.  Mr. Steward Alderson, in\r\nan address of congratulation on his arrival, informed his royal highness\r\nthat the whole body corporate had voted to him the freedom of the city,\r\nwhich the royal duke was pleased to accept, at the same time returning a\r\ndignified answer.  On the next day a grand meeting of the Masonic\r\nbrethren, 320 in number, was held in Chapel-field house.  The large\r\nAssembly room was decorated in the most splendid style.  At 10.30 a.m.,\r\nthe duke of Sussex (as grand master of England) installed Thomas Wm.\r\nCoke, Esq., M.P., as provincial grand master, with the accustomed Masonic\r\nceremonies.  His royal highness delivered an impressive charge, on\r\ninvesting Mr. Coke with the jewel, apron, and gloves.  After this\r\nceremony a procession was formed, every officer and member of the\r\nassembled lodges wearing his full masonic costume and jewels, and the\r\nbanners were carried in the procession to the Cathedral.  In the evening,\r\nthere was a sumptuous banquet in St. Andrew’s Hall, at which the royal\r\nduke presided, supported by Mr. Coke and I. Ives, Esq., the deputy\r\nprovincial grand master.  About 254 persons dined, and many ladies were\r\npresent to witness the festive scene.  Toasts were proposed in right\r\nroyal style, and duly responded to.  Next day His Royal Highness was\r\nadmitted to the honorary freedom of the city at the Guildhall, where he\r\ntook the customary oaths.  After visiting the exhibition of the Artists’\r\nSociety, the royal duke left Norwich about noon and proceeded to Holkham,\r\npaying a visit to Sir George Jerningham, at Cossey Hall, on his way\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nMay 28th.  The anniversary of the birthday of the Rt. Hon. Wm. Pitt was\r\ncommemorated at the Assembly rooms, Norwich, by a very numerous company\r\nof noblemen, gentlemen, and citizens.\r\n\r\nJune 4th.  The anniversary of the birthday of the long afflicted\r\nsovereign, George III., who had entered on the eighty-second year of his\r\nage, was celebrated for the last time in Norwich, Yarmouth, Lynn, and\r\nother towns, with the accustomed demonstration of loyalty and attachment.\r\n\r\nJuly 15th.  Meetings were held in Norwich, and resolutions were passed,\r\nand petitions to parliament adopted, against the proposed additional\r\nduties on malt and on foreign wool.  Petitions were also presented to\r\nparliament praying for an alteration in the corn laws, in consequence of\r\nthe depressed state of agriculture.\r\n\r\nSeptember 16th.  A public meeting was held in St. Andrew’s Hall, in order\r\nto take into consideration the late disastrous transactions at\r\nManchester, on August 16th.  The mayor, R. Bolingbroke, Esq., presided,\r\nwhen resolutions were adopted asserting the right of the subject to\r\npetition the king, and the legality of the late meeting at Manchester,\r\ncensuring the conduct of the magistrates and yeomanry, and recommending a\r\nsubscription for the relief of the sufferers.  An address to the prince\r\nregent was agreed to for the removal of ministers from his presence and\r\ncouncils for ever.  The address was afterwards presented by the city\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nOctober 18th.  A public meeting was held by adjournment at the Guildhall\r\nto take into consideration the propriety of erecting a bridge over the\r\nriver, near the Duke’s Palace, to connect Pitt Street with the Market\r\nPlace.  A proposition to that effect was negatived, but a bill for\r\nerecting the bridge was introduced into parliament and ultimately passed.\r\nNearly £9,000 were proposed to be raised, by shares of £25 each, to\r\ncomplete the same.  The bridge was built in course of time, and toll had\r\nto be paid for many years.  By the exertions and influence of the late T.\r\nO. Springfield, Esq., the bridge was made a free thoroughfare, greatly to\r\nthe convenience of the citizens.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1820.  January 5th.  At a special meeting of the Diocesan Committee of\r\nthe Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, held in Norwich, (the Lord\r\nBishop presiding) resolutions were adopted to counteract the evil effects\r\nof infidel and blasphemous publications, by issuing tracts of the Parent\r\nSociety at very reduced prices, and a subscription was entered into for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24th.  The anniversary of the birthday of the Right Hon. C. J.\r\nFox was commemorated by a grand public dinner in St. Andrew’s Hall by 460\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen, amongst whom were the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, the Earl of Albemarle (who presided), Viscount Bury, Lord\r\nMolyneux, and many other leading gentlemen of the liberal party.  The\r\nhall was handsomely decorated, and the names of FOX and ALBEMARLE\r\nappeared in variegated lamps, and in a semi-circular transparency was\r\nthat of SUSSEX, in letters of gold upon a ground of purple silk.\r\n\r\nJanuary 30th.  A messenger from London brought to Lord and Lady\r\nCastlereagh (who were at Gunton Hall) the melancholy tidings of the death\r\nof King George III., which became known in Norwich on the following\r\nmorning, when nearly all the shops were closed, and the bells of the\r\nchurches were tolled for three hours.  The king died on January 29th, in\r\nthe 82nd year of his age, and the 60th of his troubled reign, during\r\nwhich long wars desolated Europe, doubled our national debt, and\r\nimpoverished the country.  His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, (who\r\nwas appointed regent on February 6th, 1811,) immediately ascended the\r\nthrone.  King George IV. was soon afterwards seriously indisposed with\r\ninflammation in the lungs, but happily recovered from the attack in the\r\ncourse of a week.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1st.  King George IV. was proclaimed on the Castle Hill by the\r\nHigh Sheriff, Sir William Windham Dalling, Bart., amid the cheers of\r\nthose assembled.  On the same day His Majesty was proclaimed in the city\r\nin full form and with great rejoicings.\r\n\r\nMarch 6th.  A spirited contest took place for the gown, vacant by the\r\ndeath of Starling Day, Esq., alderman of Wymer ward.  At the close of the\r\npoll the numbers were for Henry Francis, Esq., 413; John Lovick, Esq.,\r\n372; majority for Mr. Francis 41, who was declared duly elected.  In this\r\nmonth Messrs. Mitchell, Beckwith, and Culley were elected nominees for\r\nthe long ward without opposition.  The other three wards were contested.\r\nAfter the elections for Wymer and the Northern wards, processions took\r\nplace at night to celebrate the triumph of the two contending parties.\r\n\r\nAugust 2nd.  A common hall was held for the purpose of getting up an\r\naddress to be presented to Queen Caroline.  Mr. Alderman Leman presided,\r\nand Mr. Sheriff Taylor introduced the subject, declaring that their duty\r\nwas not merely to vote an address to Her Majesty on her accession, but to\r\nprotest against the proceedings adopted by His Majesty’s ministers,\r\nagainst her “whom we ought to honour as our Queen, and esteem as a\r\nwoman.”  He denied the imputation that this meeting was held for factious\r\nand seditious purposes.  He reviewed the various charges which had been\r\nbrought against Her Majesty, and mentioned several instances of noble\r\nconduct on her part.  He regarded the erasure of her name from the\r\nliturgy as a gross insult, and spoke of the firmness, and sagacity, and\r\njudgment which characterised her determination to return to England.  He\r\nreminded his hearers of the enthusiasm which attended her entry into\r\nLondon.  But no sooner was she arrived than a large green bag was laid on\r\nthe table.  Now he had an instinctive horror of a green bag, as he had\r\nonce the honour of occupying a small corner of one.  He then challenged\r\nthe ministers, through Mr. Coke, to prove any one of the charges brought\r\nagainst him in the green bag; and he received an answer that it was all a\r\nmistake, and that Norwich should not have been inserted.  The resolutions\r\nwere carried by acclamation, and he afterwards presented an address to\r\nthe Queen at Brandenburgh house.\r\n\r\nThere was but one opinion here as to the character of George IV., and\r\nwith respect to the Queen, all the world agreed that she was much to be\r\npitied.  Men’s passions were so strongly excited, that whichever side\r\nthey took, whether for her or against her, her conduct was viewed through\r\na false medium.  Nothing showed this more strongly than the behaviour of\r\nthe two parties upon her death.  The blue-and-whites, many of whom had\r\nnever put on black for a royal personage before, were to be seen dressed\r\nin black and white, while on the other hand the orange-and-purples, not\r\ncontent with appearing in their ordinary attire, flaunted about in the\r\ngayest colours.\r\n\r\nDecember 12th.  In consequence of the numerous robberies committed in the\r\ncity and county, public meetings were held, and resolutions passed to\r\ngrant high rewards to watchmen who might apprehend offenders.  More\r\nburglaries had been committed in that year than in the preceding twenty\r\nyears.  Increased poverty had produced crime, and the “Old Charlies” were\r\nof little use.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1821.  March 7th.  E. T. Booth, Esq., (sheriff) was elected an alderman\r\nof Great Wymer ward in the room of the late William Foster, Esq., who had\r\ndied on March 3rd.  There was an opposition; at the close of the poll the\r\nnumbers were, for Mr. Booth 444, Mr. R. Shaw 433.\r\n\r\nMarch 31st.  The freedom of the city having been voted at the quarterly\r\nassembly of the corporation on the 24th ult., to be presented to Captain\r\nWilliam Edward Parry of the Royal Navy; that gallant officer attended in\r\nfull uniform, and was sworn in at a full court of mayoralty.  The\r\nparchment containing the freedom of the city was presented to him in a\r\nbox formed of a piece of oak, part of the ship Hecla, with an appropriate\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nApril 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th.  Cleansing Week ward elections took place.\r\nConisford ward no opposition, Messrs. J. Kitton, J. Angel, and J. P.\r\nCocksedge (nominees); Mancroft ward no opposition, Messrs. P. Chamberlin,\r\nJ. Bennett, and J. Goodwin, (nominees); Wymer ward, Mr. A. A. H. Beckwith\r\n432, Mr. J. Culley, 432, Mr. J. Reynolds 423 (nominees), Mr. J. Parkinson\r\n254, Mr. Newin 249, Mr. R. Purland 236, Mr. S. Mitchell 45; Northern\r\nward, Mr. T. Barnard 418, Mr. T. O. Springfield 416, Mr. S. S. Beare 416,\r\n(nominees), Mr. G. Morse 231, Mr. Troughton 230, Mr. T. Grimmer 231.\r\n\r\nMay 1st.  The election for mayor came on.  At the close of the poll the\r\nnumbers were for Alderman Rackham 986, Alderman Hawkes 950, Alderman\r\nMarsh 630, Alderman Yallop 631.  The former two were returned to the\r\ncourt of aldermen, who elected William Rackham, Esq., to serve the office\r\nof chief magistrate.\r\n\r\nJune 18th.  This being Guild day, William Rackham, Esq., was sworn in\r\nmayor, on which occasion he gave a sumptuous dinner to about 650 ladies\r\nand gentlemen in St. Andrews Hall, the hall having previously undergone\r\nvarious alterations and improvements.\r\n\r\nJuly 27th.  The coronation of George IV. was celebrated here in a very\r\nsplendid manner, and gave occasion for a display of the exuberant loyalty\r\nof the citizens.  This king, called “the finest gentleman in Europe,” had\r\ngoverned the realm for nearly ten years, and visited the city in 1812.\r\nHis reign was peaceful and prosperous, and he was a great promoter of the\r\narts and sciences.  The most important event of his reign was the passing\r\nof the act for Roman Catholic emancipation, by which Roman Catholics\r\nbecame entitled to all the rights and privileges enjoyed by the rest of\r\nthe community, a measure strongly supported here by the liberal party.\r\nDuring this reign the citizens of Norwich took a very active part in all\r\nthe great movements of the age—the Roman Catholic Emancipation movement,\r\nthe Anti-Slavery movement, and the Reform agitation.  Strong contests at\r\nelections took place on all these questions.  Bribery, corruption,\r\ntreating, cooping, and intimidation, were resorted to by both parties on\r\nevery occasion, as will appear in a subsequent chapter, on our political\r\nhistory.  Party spirit never ran higher in any town than in Norwich.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1822.  January 24th.  The anniversary of the birthday of the Rt. Hon. C.\r\nJ. Fox was commemorated by a public dinner of the liberal party at the\r\nAssembly Rooms.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24th.  At a quarterly meeting of the corporation it was\r\nunanimously resolved, that a piece of plate, of the value of 150 guineas,\r\nbe presented to Charles Harvey, Esq., the recorder of Norwich, as a\r\ntestimony of the high appreciation entertained by that assembly of his\r\nupright and impartial conduct in the performance of the duties of his\r\noffice, and of his zeal on all occasions for the interests of the city.\r\n\r\nMarch.  When the elections came on in Cleansing Week, there was no\r\nopposition for the Conisford and Mancroft wards, and the\r\norange-and-purple party maintained their ascendancy.  Wymer ward, Mr. J.\r\nReynolds 401, Mr. A. A. H. Beckwith 401, Mr. J. Culley 401, (nominees);\r\nP. Greenwood 56, W. Simmons 56, R. Widdows 54.  Northern ward, Mr. A.\r\nShaw 379, Mr. S. S. Beare 368, Mr. E. Taylor 200, (nominees); W. G.\r\nEdwards 189, A. Beloe 193, T. Grimmer 190, St. Quintin 190.\r\n\r\nMay 1st.  The election of mayor came on.  At the close of the poll the\r\nnumbers were for Alderman Hawkes 957, Alderman J. S. Patteson 908,\r\nAlderman Thurtell 364, Alderman Yallop 318; the former two were returned\r\nto the court of aldermen, who elected Robert Hawkes, Esq., to serve the\r\noffice of chief magistrate.\r\n\r\nJune 18th.  This being Guild day, Robert Hawkes, Esq., was sworn in as\r\nmayor, and he gave a grand dinner to the citizens in St. Andrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\nSeptember 27th.  The weavers, 2,361 in number, subscribed for, and\r\npresented a piece of plate to John Harvey, Esq., as a testimony of the\r\nhigh esteem in which they held him; and he deserved it, for he was a\r\ngreat promoter of the manufactures of the city, and a friend of the\r\noperatives.  They were then in a prosperous state, and well employed by\r\nmany large firms who executed orders for the East India Company to the\r\nextent of 20,000 pieces of camlets yearly.

At a meeting held in the Old Library Room, St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall, a society was formed for supplying the poor with blankets\r\nat a reduced price; and upwards of 1100 were distributed during the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24th.  At a quarterly assembly of the corporation a lease was\r\ngranted to the magistrates of the city, for 500 years, of the piece of\r\nland outside of St. Giles’ Gates, on which it had been decided to build\r\nthe new jail, at the annual rent of £50.\r\n\r\nMarch 4th.  At a meeting held at the Guildhall, petitions to parliament\r\nwere adopted against the Insolvent Debtors Act.\r\n\r\nMarch.  Cleansing Week for the ward elections passed off without any\r\nopposition; the orange-and-purple party kept the Conisford, Mancroft, and\r\nWymer wards, and the blue-and-white the Northern ward.\r\n\r\nApril 14th.  At a special assembly of the corporation, a petition to His\r\nMajesty was adopted, praying for two jail deliveries in the course of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nApril 25th.  At a meeting held at the Guildhall, to take into\r\nconsideration the state of the West India Colonies, with a view to\r\npromote the abolition of slavery, resolutions in favour of the object\r\nwere carried.\r\n\r\nMay 1st.  The election of mayor took place, and at the close of the poll\r\nthe numbers were, Alderman J. S. Patteson 835, Alderman Francis 774,\r\nAlderman Leman 101, Alderman Yallop 94.  The two former were returned to\r\nthe court of aldermen, who elected J. S. Patteson, Esq., to serve the\r\noffice of chief magistrate.\r\n\r\nMay 3rd.  At a quarterly assembly of the corporation, the freedom of the\r\ncity was voted to the Hon. John Wodehouse, lieutenant of the city and\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nJune 17th.  This being Guild day, J. S. Patteson, Esq., was sworn in\r\nmayor; and he gave a splendid dinner to a large party in St. Andrew’s\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1824.  In September of this year the first Norfolk and Norwich Musical\r\nFestival was held in St. Andrew’s Hall, and the concerts given were well\r\nattended by the nobility and gentry of the county.  This Festival was\r\nvery much promoted by Mr. Edward Taylor, Mr. R. M. Bacon, then editor of\r\nthe _Mercury_, and other amateurs in the city, and proved eminently\r\nsuccessful, the hospital receiving the sum of £2,399 out of the profits.\r\nIn 1825, King George IV. presented the hospital with a copy of Arnold’s\r\nedition of Handel’s Works.  It was determined that a triennial festival\r\nshould be held in aid of the funds of the institution, and that the\r\nNorwich Choral Society should be maintained in an efficient state for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nNorwich Navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT this time a very important movement took place in the city, with\r\nthe view to make “Norwich a port,” and many meetings were held to promote\r\nthat object.  Here, therefore, will be a proper place to review the\r\nproceedings in reference to our navigation to Yarmouth and Lowestoft.\r\nThe history will show the grasping selfishness of the old corporation at\r\nYarmouth, which always tried to tax the trade of the city, and opposed\r\nevery improvement, even when it was for the benefit of both towns.\r\n\r\nNorwich, no doubt, derived its mercantile and carrying trade from its\r\noriginal situation as a sea-port.  In ancient times the _Gariensis\r\nOstium_, or mouth of the Yare, extended in breadth from Burgh Castle to\r\nCaister, the two Roman camps being opposite each other.  The spot on\r\nwhich Yarmouth now stands was then covered by water, and a broad arm of\r\nthe sea extended all over the present marshes to the city, which was then\r\na sea-port, before Yarmouth had any existence.  This appears from the\r\nlegal contests that took place in later times between the burgesses of\r\nYarmouth and the citizens of Norwich.\r\n\r\nNorwich had long been a mercantile and trading town, and one of the royal\r\ncities of England, and ships came up by an arm of the sea to an open\r\nmarket, which was held every day in the week.  Public marts or fairs were\r\nheld twice a year, with all manner of merchandise for sale to citizens,\r\nstrangers, or foreigners.  The traders for centuries used this right of\r\nbuying and selling, loading and unloading all their goods and\r\nmerchandise, free of all tolls and dues.  Foreign merchants paid at\r\nNorwich 4d. on every ship of bulk, 2d. for every boat, and all other\r\ncustoms for their merchandise.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the 14th century Yarmouth began to be a rival port\r\nto Norwich, and some legal contests took place between the two towns\r\nrespecting their rights and privileges.  In 1327, a suit was commenced,\r\nand in 1331 it was renewed, between the citizens of Norwich and the\r\nburgesses of Yarmouth, relating to certain tolls which the latter imposed\r\non goods, claiming the right to do so under the charter of Edward I.,\r\nwhich made Yarmouth a port.  Indeed, they appear to have been so incensed\r\nat the city becoming a staple that they proceeded so far as to stop all\r\nvessels coming through from their port to Norwich.  A very remarkable\r\ncontest consequently arose, and terminated in favour of the city.  The\r\nresult of the suit was, that the bailiffs of Yarmouth were commanded to\r\nmake proclamation in their town, “That if any hindered or in any way\r\nmolested the merchant vessels of what kind soever from passing and\r\nre-passing through the port of Yarmouth, to and from the city of Norwich,\r\nthey should forfeit all their goods and chattels, forfeitable, for so\r\ndoing.”  Yarmouth was, therefore, prevented for a time from levying\r\nduties, but subsequently regained the power of doing so to a great\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nIf Norwich in former ages was an important seaport, the question\r\nnaturally arises how it ceased to be so.  There is sufficient evidence\r\nthat after the year 500, the arm of the sea became narrower, though at\r\nthat period the water came up close to the Castle Hill.  After 1050, the\r\nriver was much reduced in breadth, and a new town arose round the\r\nfortress.  Centuries elapsed and the river became still narrower, and\r\nstreets were extended on each side.  At length the stream became so\r\nshallow that it was no longer navigable for sea-borne vessels, and the\r\nancient trade of the city began to decline.  The citizens, occupied by\r\npolitical contests, did not keep up the navigation for sea-borne vessels,\r\nas they might easily have done.  Attempts were made in this (19th)\r\ncentury to retrieve the long neglect of former ages by some schemes of\r\nimprovement, but these attempts almost entirely failed.  Still the city\r\nowed many trading advantages to its river, which is navigable for\r\nwherries and packets to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe navigation between Norwich and Yarmouth has not been, for centuries,\r\nsuited for sea-borne vessels, owing, chiefly, to the shallowness of the\r\nchannel over Breydon.  The embouchure of the river into the sea has been\r\nfrequently blocked up by shifting sands, and vessels have been detained\r\nfourteen days before they could get into the river.  Indeed, at the\r\npresent time there is great danger of the mouth of the harbour being\r\nblocked up at Yarmouth altogether.\r\n\r\nPrior to the year 1762, the quantity of coals brought from Yarmouth to\r\nNorwich, annually, was 26,000 chaldrons.  Of these, nearly 5000 chaldrons\r\nwere carried out of Norwich into the surrounding district, so that 21,000\r\nchaldrons were consumed in the city.  At that time, the king’s dues and\r\nthe Yarmouth dues amounted to 8s. 1d. per chaldron, which was felt by the\r\nconsumers to be a grievous tax.  A cheap and plentiful supply of coal has\r\nalways been of the utmost importance to the citizens, not only for\r\ndomestic purposes, but also as fuel for manufacturers, dyers, hot\r\npressers, lime burners, brewers, and maltsters.  Yet, at the period\r\nreferred to, this necessary commodity was heavily taxed, to the extent of\r\n£1200 yearly, more than was paid on an equal consumption in London.  This\r\ntax was rendered more grievous by the illegal measurement at Yarmouth.\r\nThe legal chaldron consisted of thirty-six bushels; but, at Yarmouth the\r\nchaldron was estimated not by bushels, but by a measure called a mett,\r\nsixteen of which were computed to contain a chaldron, but did not.  As\r\nmay be supposed, the injustice naturally caused considerable\r\ndissatisfaction among the Norwich coal merchants and other citizens, and\r\nfrequent complaints were made of the grievance which was ultimately\r\nabolished.  This was important, for formerly, from the north of England,\r\nimmense quantities of coal and heavy goods were brought by sea, _viâ_\r\nYarmouth to Norwich, for distribution over the eastern side of Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk.  The importation of coal, by this route, has, however, been\r\ngreatly diminished; not only by the opening of railways in every\r\ndirection, but also by the working of the central coal fields of England.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 12th George I., c. 15, commonly called the Tonnage Act,\r\nthe corporation obtained the power to levy tolls on all goods brought\r\ninto the city by any boat, keel wherry, lighter, buoy, or other vessel as\r\nfollows:—4d. for every chaldron of coals, for every last of wheat, rye,\r\nbarley, malt, or other grain, for every weight of salt, for every\r\nhogshead of sugar, tobacco, molasses, or hogshead packed with other\r\ngoods, for every three puncheons of liquor, for every two pipes of wine,\r\nspirits, &c., for every eight barrels of soap, raisins, oil, pitch, tar,\r\n&c.  For five years prior to May, 1836, the average amount of revenue\r\nderived from the tonnage dues was £970, showing that a very large\r\nquantity of goods was brought by river to the city.  After June 24th,\r\n1836, the tolls were let by auction for £1375; in 1838, for £1210; in\r\n1840, for £1220; in 1847, for £1000; in 1850, for £1050 yearly.  This\r\nshows that after the opening of railways the dues were reduced, but not\r\nso much as might have been expected; the wherries continued to bring in a\r\nlarge proportion of the heavy goods.\r\n\r\nThe project of opening a communication between Norwich and the sea, for\r\nsea-borne vessels, originated with Alderman Crisp Brown, who in 1814,\r\nsubmitted to the corporation a plan for making Norwich a port by way of\r\nYarmouth.  After this, surveys were made, and a report was published in\r\n1818, by Mr. Cubitt, who recommended avoiding Breydon by a new cut on the\r\nsouth side.  In the same year he made another survey, to ascertain the\r\npracticability of opening a communication with the sea at Lowestoft, and\r\nin 1821 this report was laid before the public.  As the Yarmouth\r\ncorporation had signified their determination to oppose either of these\r\nplans, it was at length determined to carry out the communication to\r\nLowestoft, although the expense was double that of the Yarmouth plan.\r\nThis turned out to be a very unfortunate undertaking.  Subscriptions were\r\nraised and fresh surveys were made; and in 1826, a company having been\r\nformed, an application was made to Parliament for an Act; but being\r\nopposed by the Yarmouth corporation and timid owners of the marsh lands,\r\nwho were fearful of an inundation, it was lost by a majority of five.\r\nThis act, however, was finally passed in 1827, after £8000 had been spent\r\nby the corporation of Yarmouth in opposing it.  Of course, the object of\r\nthat body was to retain the monopoly of the Norwich trade, which was then\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nOn May 23rd, 1827, the bill for making Norwich a port having been passed\r\nthrough both houses of Parliament, the navigation committee, with the\r\nmayor (their chairman), were met at Hartford Hill, on their return from\r\nLondon, by thousands of their fellow-citizens who were assembled to\r\nwelcome them; and a grand procession having been formed, they marched\r\nthrough the city, while guns were fired in all directions.  The\r\ncelebration concluded with a bonfire at night.\r\n\r\nIn effecting the great undertaking of a communication with Lowestoft, the\r\nriver Yare was deepened near Norwich and the navigation was continued by\r\nthat river as far as Reedham, whence it was carried across the marshes by\r\na new cut, two miles and a-half long, to the river Waveney, along which\r\nit passed to Oulton Dyke, which was widened and deepened to Oulton Broad,\r\nwhence by a short cut the canal entered Lake Lothing, through which it\r\npassed to the shore at Lowestoft, where, by cutting through the bank, the\r\ntides were freely admitted into the lake.  Here a large harbour was\r\nformed, covering 160 acres, nearly three miles in length, and averaging\r\nfrom fifteen to seventeen feet in depth at high water.  In this work the\r\ncompany spent their whole capital of £150,000.\r\n\r\nOn September 30th, 1833, the Norwich and Lowestoft navigation was opened,\r\nwhen two vessels came from the latter place and arrived at the wharfs\r\nwithout once touching ground.  This caused great rejoicing, and the\r\nadvantages of the undertaking were soon apparent.  But the company wanted\r\nmoney, and were obliged to borrow it from the Exchequer Loan\r\nCommissioners, into whose hands the port fell in 1842.  Norwich traders\r\nmight afterwards have recovered possession of the port for a small sum by\r\na combined effort, but they lost the opportunity.  The commissioners\r\ndisposed of the port and navigation to a new company at Lowestoft, and\r\nthat company, after expending large sums in repairs, sold the harbour and\r\nnavigation to Mr. Peto for almost a nominal price.  He, with other\r\ngentlemen, organised another company, raised a capital of £200,000\r\n(afterwards doubled), and obtained an act of parliament for the formation\r\nof a new harbour, and a railway to Reedham in connection with the line to\r\nNorwich.  The new harbour was made, and the railway was opened in 1847,\r\nfrom which year the carrying trade of the port gradually increased.\r\nBefore 1850 the importation of coal and the harbour dues increased\r\nfive-fold, and the importations of corn increased 10,000 quarters yearly.\r\nThe number of vessels was doubled, and of course employment increased in\r\nproportion.  The harbour and railway contributed a large traffic to the\r\nEastern Counties lines.  Norwich traders made great use of the port, and\r\nthrough it brought quantities of coal and heavy goods to the city.  There\r\nis every mechanical facility afforded for the loading and unloading of\r\nvessels; and port dues are lower than at Yarmouth.  In 1851, the number\r\nof vessels that entered the harbour was 1,636, or 131,767 tons, showing\r\nan increase of 23,000 tons.  In the same year there was an increase of\r\n6,997 tons in the coal imported.  Of course, as the shipping trade of the\r\nport increased, the railway traffic increased also.  One of the chief\r\nsources from which the additional revenue was derived was from the fish\r\ntraffic; for in 1851 the packages were 78,000 in number, and produced a\r\nfreight of £3,739.  The traffic also in coal and goods has greatly\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nBetween 1840 and 1850 the corporation of Norwich, aided by the city\r\nmerchants, made a most determined effort to improve the navigation to\r\nYarmouth.  A large subscription was raised for this purpose, and Mr.\r\nCockburn Curtiss, the engineer, was engaged to make a survey of the river\r\nYare, and to prepare plans.  He did so, and his plans were approved by\r\nthe citizens generally; but the corporation of Yarmouth gave notice of a\r\nstrong opposition.  Application was made to parliament for a bill giving\r\nthe corporation here jurisdiction over the river down to the mouth of the\r\nHaven.  The bill was opposed and lost, and the Norwich corporation were\r\ndefeated after an expenditure of some thousands of pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nLeading Events (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nWE resume our chronological list of the leading events of the century:—\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1825.  January 5th.  At a public meeting held at the Guildhall, a\r\nMechanics’ Institution was established, and it was continued for some\r\nyears in the rooms above the Bazaar, St. Andrew’s.\r\n\r\nMarch.

At a public meeting, held in St. Andrew’s Hall, a petition\r\nfor a revision of the Corn Laws was adopted unanimously.  The petition\r\nafterwards received 14,385 signatures, and was forwarded on the 26th to\r\nbe presented to parliament.  As yet it was not proposed to _repeal_ the\r\nCorn Laws, which were then a monstrous injustice.\r\n\r\nMay 1st.  The election for mayor took place, and the numbers were for\r\nAlderman Day, 679; Alderman Booth, 597; Alderman Leman, 152; Alderman\r\nBurt, 150.  Thomas Starling Day, Esq., was elected.\r\n\r\nMay 3rd.  The corporation adopted a petition against the Catholic claims,\r\nthe members going quite out of their way to perpetuate a great wrong.\r\n\r\nMay 31st.  The anniversary of the birthday of the Rt. Hon. William Pitt\r\nwas celebrated by the members of the castle corporation.\r\n\r\nJune 11th.  The first stone of the new theatre was laid, and it was\r\nerected on the present site.  The building is only a piece of patch-work,\r\nand has no pretensions to architectural design.  It is no credit to the\r\ncity in any respect.  It was opened on March 27th, in the following year.\r\n\r\nJune 21st.  The mayor (T. S. Day, Esq.,) was sworn into office; he\r\nafterwards gave a dinner to upwards of 460 gentlemen in St. Andrew’s\r\nHall.\r\n\r\nAugust 30th.

The corporation presented a piece of plate, of the value\r\nof 100 guineas, to William Simpson, Esq., chamberlain, in testimony of\r\ntheir high esteem for the ability and integrity displayed in the\r\ndischarge of his official duties; and of their unanimous approbation of\r\nhis long and faithful services.\r\n\r\nNovember 2nd.  Sir Thomas P. Hankin, Lieut. Colonel of His Majesty\r\nregiment of Royal North British Dragoons, was interred in the Cathedral\r\nwith military honours.\r\n\r\nNovember 21st.  At a public meeting, held in St. Andrews Hall, a Society\r\nwas formed for promoting the Abolition of Colonial Slavery.  The late J.\r\nJ. Gurney and all his family were great advocates of negro emancipation,\r\nbut the diabolical injustice of slavery continued for many years to be\r\nthe disgrace of England.  At many meetings held in this city, the late J.\r\nJ. Gurney denounced the atrocities of the slave trade, and advocated its\r\nabolition.  This object was at last accomplished after a violent\r\nagitation throughout the country, at a cost of twenty millions sterling!\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1826.

The former was returned.\r\n\r\nNovember.  Parish meetings were held in many parts of the city, and votes\r\nof thanks were passed to Crisp Brown, Esq., for his strenuous exertions\r\nin preventing impositions in paying public money for the new jail, then\r\nconsidered a job.\r\n\r\nNovember 21st.  William Simpson, Esq., was elected town clerk and clerk\r\nof the peace for this city, in the room of the late Elisha De Hague,\r\nEsq., who died on the 11th inst., at the age of 72.\r\n\r\nDecember 6th.

At the election for mayor, Aldermen Bignold and Turner were\r\nreturned to the court without opposition, and S. Bignold, Esq., was\r\nchosen to serve the office.  On the Guild day he was sworn in, and on\r\nthis occasion he gave a magnificent banquet to about 1100 ladies and\r\ngentlemen in St. Andrew’s Hall.  The same place was the scene of great\r\nfestivity on June 20th and 21st, when dinners were given to the electors\r\nin the orange-and-purple interest, those in the Conisford and Northern\r\nwards to the number of 750 on the first day, and those of the Wymer and\r\nMancroft wards 912 on the following day.  Great was the rejoicing, but it\r\nwas of short duration.  The days of the old corporation were numbered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nThe Reform Era.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM IV. ascended the throne in 1830, in a period of great political\r\nexcitement.  During his short reign of seven years, there was the\r\ngreatest political agitation ever known in this country about a Reform of\r\nParliament, a measure which the people had long and earnestly desired.\r\nMany meetings were held in this city, and petitions were adopted in\r\nfavour of reform, long called for and long deferred.  In fact, the king,\r\nduring the early part of his reign, had other and more pressing causes of\r\nanxiety.  His accession to the throne brought him an inheritance of the\r\njealousy, to which the country had been gradually roused, on the subject\r\nof the extravagance and corruption of the old systems of government.  In\r\nthe effort to reduce a vast expenditure, the House of Commons was in no\r\nmood to be so liberal to the new sovereign as he thought he had a right\r\nto expect.  The ministry were withheld, by the very forcible opposition\r\nof one of its members, from asking the house to grant the expenses of the\r\nqueen’s outfit, and the king himself had to submit to the mortification\r\nof finding the pensions charged on the public by former monarchs sharply\r\ncriticised, and even his own household expenses commented on with\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nOn September 8th, 1831, the grand ceremony of the coronation of the king\r\ntook place in Westminster Abbey.  The auspicious event was celebrated in\r\nNorwich in a most loyal and joyous manner.  The festivities of the day\r\ncommenced with the merry chime of St. Peter’s bells, and the waving of\r\nbanners from all the public buildings.  The mayor and members of the\r\ncorporation went in procession from the Guildhall to the Cathedral.\r\nAfter their return to the hall, the regiment of the First Royals marched\r\ninto the Market Place and fired three vollies.  The electors who had\r\nsupported Gurney and Grant received £1 each, and a dinner was given to\r\n600 of the freemen, who voted for Wetherell and Sadler, at Laccohee’s\r\ngardens.  The citizens, in fact, have never lost an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying their loyalty, but they always expected something in return.\r\nSeveral petitions were sent from Norwich in favour of the Reform Bill;\r\nand the passing of the bill was celebrated here with great rejoicings,\r\nfestivities, and a public procession on July 5th, 1832.  This brief reign\r\nwas remarkable, moreover, for the abolition of the slave trade after a\r\nviolent agitation which convulsed the whole country, and ended in the\r\npassing of an act of emancipation of the slaves in the West Indies, at a\r\ncost of twenty millions; and it is also noted for the suppression of the\r\nrebellion in Canada, and the restoration of tranquillity to that colony.\r\n\r\nAn Act of Parliament received the royal assent on June 23rd, 1832,\r\nremoving the assizes from Thetford to Norwich; and the corporation passed\r\na vote of thanks to John Stracey, Esq., for his exertions in obtaining\r\nthat measure, and also a vote of thanks to the lord chancellor for having\r\ngranted two jail deliveries in the year.  Since then the city assizes\r\nhave been held at the Guildhall, and the Norfolk assizes at the\r\nShirehall.  The city sessions are held every quarter at the Guildhall,\r\nand the petty sessions daily at the same place.\r\n\r\nThe reformed House of Commons having presented an address to His Majesty,\r\npraying for the appointment of a commission to inquire as to the existing\r\nstate of municipal corporations in England and Wales; the king, on July\r\n18th, 1833, complied with the address, by issuing a commission; and\r\nnotice was subsequently given to the mayor of this city, S. Bignold, Esq.\r\n(now Sir Samuel Bignold), of the intention of the commissioners appointed\r\nto investigate the affairs of the Norwich corporation, in compliance with\r\na request from a meeting of 300 citizens, held on the 13th of May\r\npreceding.  A special meeting of the corporation was at once convened to\r\nconsider the course to be pursued, and the assembly determined on a\r\nreluctant submission to the inquiry, so far as regarded the production,\r\nby the corporate officers, of all “charters, books, deeds, accounts,\r\npapers, and muniments of title,” but at the same time protested against\r\nthe commission as illegal and unconstitutional, and against the right of\r\nthe commissioners to make any inquiry whatsoever.  As may be supposed,\r\nthe dominant party in the city did not like it, and the sheriffs\r\nespecially protested against it.  They declined to attend at the proposed\r\nenquiry, or to recognize the authority of the commissioners by any act,\r\nand addressed a letter to that effect to the commissioners, signing their\r\nnames, W. J. UTTEN BROWNE, and EDWARD STEWARD, sheriffs of Norwich.  Of\r\ncourse the commissioners were not very pleased at this ostentatious\r\nopposition to their authority, and in the course of their enquiry showed\r\nan evident hostility to the predominant party.  Witnesses were allowed to\r\nmake statements reflecting on the characters of the living and the dead,\r\nand every facility was afforded for the gratification of political,\r\nperhaps of _private_, revenge.  This will appear in the following summary\r\nof the evidence, taken from the Digest, published soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INQUIRY RESPECTING THE OLD CORPORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis inquiry was conducted by George Long and John Buckle, Esqs., and\r\ncommenced on November 25th, 1833, at the Guildhall.  Nearly all the\r\nofficials of the corporation were examined, and many influential\r\ngentlemen.  Some strange statements were made as to the effects of party\r\nspirit, and the enemies of the old corporation alleged, amongst their\r\nfavourite charges, that the magistrates were biassed by party spirit, and\r\nthat the funds of the corporation had been devoted to electioneering\r\npurposes.  Evidence, however, was given to the contrary.\r\n\r\nJ. J. GURNEY, ESQ., said, “I believe that there are many most laborious\r\nand useful magistrates in the city, and no persons would be so fit as\r\nmany of those who have already been accustomed to the business.  I do not\r\nfind the slightest fault with the application of the magisterial power.\r\nIt is my most decided opinion that the magisterial authority has been\r\nimpartially exercised.”\r\n\r\nW. SIMPSON, ESQ., said, “Whatever money may have been spent, it certainly\r\nhas not been the money of the corporation.”\r\n\r\nALDERMAN BOLINGBROKE said, “I have been an alderman near twenty years; I\r\ndo not know of any corrupt application of the corporate funds to\r\nelections or any other purposes.  I do not think any misapplication of\r\nthe corporate funds could have taken place without my knowing it.”\r\n\r\nAs the inquiry proceeded, however, evidence was given of the influence of\r\nparty spirit in the distribution of patronage, appointments, and\r\nemployments, and also in admissions to freedom.  It was proved that the\r\npolice were very inefficient, and often refused to act in cases of riot,\r\nand when the mob were pulling down polling booths.  As to the expenditure\r\nof money at local elections,\r\n\r\nThe Mayor, S. BIGNOLD, Esq., said, “I am quite sure that if respectable\r\npersons were to offer themselves at local elections, it would repress the\r\nexcesses which sometimes take place.  The local elections are attended\r\nwith considerable expense.  I am not aware that the aldermen interfere in\r\nthese elections.  I am not aware of anything which would prevent the\r\naldermen interfering in the promotion of sheriffs.  They consider the\r\noath as debarring in the one case and not in the other.  Committees are\r\nformed on the occasion of elections in the different wards.  I cannot say\r\nwhether the aldermen are frequently members of those committees.  I have\r\nnot had any opportunity of witnessing unfair exertions.  I cannot say\r\nwhether any subscriptions are made on those occasions.  I have never\r\nsubscribed a shilling.  I cannot say whether notes are given by the\r\naldermen or others.  I never saw such a note as the one produced before.\r\nI have heard of notes purporting to get certain persons into the\r\nhospitals, being given by aldermen on the occasions of municipal\r\nelections.  I have never seen any such notes.  My knowledge of them has\r\narisen in this way.  I have been asked myself and told that A and B have\r\ngiven them, but never fulfilled their promise.”\r\n\r\n“Question.  Do you think that the mode in which the local elections are\r\ncarried on tends to keep out respectable and intelligent persons from\r\nfilling the various offices?\r\n\r\nAnswer.  I am sorry to say that those respectable and intelligent persons\r\nhave contributed to the system.\r\n\r\nQ.  Has that been the case generally?\r\n\r\nA.  I should say, generally, with the leading persons in this city on\r\nboth sides, connected and unconnected with the corporation.\r\n\r\nQ.  Have the members of the court of aldermen contributed to your\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nA.  Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nQ.  Is it your belief that they have or have not?\r\n\r\nA.  I think they would not in the election of an alderman, but they might\r\nfor sheriff or common councilmen.\r\n\r\nQ.  On what ground is that distinction made?\r\n\r\nA.  The aldermen consider that they are not to interfere in the election\r\nof their brethren, in consequence of the oath they have taken.\r\n\r\nQ.  The oath makes no distinction?\r\n\r\nA.  There is an impression to the contrary.\r\n\r\nQ.  If there had been an extraordinary excitement at elections, can you\r\nsay that in no case that excitement was enlarged by the aldermen?\r\n\r\nA.  I should say in no case.\r\n\r\nQ.  What do you consider the intention of the aldermen in subscribing to\r\nthe funds?\r\n\r\nA.  I can only answer that question in general terms, that the excitement\r\nhas never been increased by any act of the aldermen.\r\n\r\nQ.  Are you acquainted with the case of Hornigolds with reference to the\r\nelections?\r\n\r\nA.  In no other way than by your drawing my attention to it.  I know of\r\nno other note to that effect.  No improper persons have been admitted\r\ninto the hospitals on account of their votes.\r\n\r\nQ.  Have they in all cases been fit and proper persons?\r\n\r\nA.  Certainly they have.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do you think the same persons would have been introduced if they had\r\nnot been political supporters?\r\n\r\nA.  Not identically the same persons.\r\n\r\nQ.  Are there instances where persons have been put in by the aldermen,\r\nwho have not been political supporters?\r\n\r\nA.  Yes.  I have put an individual in myself who was not a political\r\nsupporter in any way.\r\n\r\nQ.  Are such instances rare or frequent?\r\n\r\nA.  I am only able to answer from information I have derived from my\r\nseniors; I should say they are frequent.\r\n\r\nQ.  Are the great majority of persons admitted freemen?\r\n\r\nA.  Yes.  I think they are.\r\n\r\nQ.  Are the exceptions few?\r\n\r\nA.  I do not know.\r\n\r\nQ.  You said all the freemen introduced to the hospitals were fit and\r\nproper persons: have they been introduced as the political friends of the\r\naldermen?\r\n\r\nA.  Yes.  I should certainly introduce my political friends in\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do you consider the power of the aldermen to have been exercised\r\n_bonâ fide_, or for influence at the elections?\r\n\r\nA.  Certainly, _bonâ fide_.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do you think this privilege is frequently exercised in favor of\r\npolitical opponents?\r\n\r\nA.  No.  There are twenty-four aldermen, and the patronage is about\r\n15–24ths on the Tory side to 9–24ths on the Whig side.\r\n\r\nQ.  Is it your opinion that more urgent cases have been passed by, and\r\nothers taken on account of political services?\r\n\r\nA.  I think not; I think very pressing cases have had the preference over\r\npolitical supporters.\r\n\r\nQ.  Is it, in your opinion, a justification if a person is put into the\r\nhospital under such a promise, or a more pressing case; and would the\r\nalderman exercising the power, do it under an impression that he was not\r\nguilty of any breach of duty, or of violating his moral feelings?\r\n\r\nA.  I think where an alderman had made such a promise, he would be\r\nperfectly justified in performing it, provided the person was a fit and\r\nproper object.\r\n\r\nQ.  The alderman, so promising, in the event of a more pressing case,\r\nwould he change his turn?\r\n\r\nA.  It is done frequently for the express purpose in pressing cases; and\r\nthose changes are made with political opponents.”\r\n\r\nALDERMAN NEWTON examined, said, “I have no doubt there have been large\r\nsums of money expended at local elections.  It has been a common thing to\r\nmake subscriptions for local elections.  Sometimes the subscriptions have\r\nfar exceeded the necessary expenses.  In some cases, but not generally,\r\nthe subscriptions have been under the management of a committee.  An\r\nindividual mostly takes the management.  He has the whole of the funds\r\nunder his care, and is not accountable to anyone.  The committee never\r\ninterfere.  It is left to one individual to manage the funds.  The mode\r\nof distributing the money is known to members of the committees, who are\r\ngenerally members of the corporation.  I do not know of aldermen being\r\nmembers of the committees.  Aldermen have subscribed, but very rarely, at\r\ncontested elections.  A good deal of money has been expended on those\r\noccasions.  The general supporters of the parties have been subscribers,\r\nincluding the common council, but not the aldermen.  The scenes at\r\nelections have been very disgraceful sometimes.  I recollect the election\r\nof Alderman Marshall.  I have heard that the scene on that occasion was\r\nvery disgraceful.  I have heard that much money was spent, but I think\r\n£1000 would be the outside.  I recollect the election of Alderman\r\nSteward.  Money was spent on that occasion, but nothing like £1000.  I\r\nremember the election of Mr. Steward for sheriff.  I have heard that\r\nmoney was then spent.  I heard that the Whig party gave a large sum for\r\nthe last six votes that they polled, and I believe it to a certain\r\nextent.  No doubt there was money spent by the Tory party to a large\r\nextent.  I have heard that from £10 to £15 were given for a vote.  There\r\nwas a large subscription by members of the council, but not by the\r\naldermen.  I think Mr. Steward subscribed, but I do not know to what\r\namount.  On other occasions subscriptions have been made for the same\r\noffice.  Money was given to the freemen, but the far greater amount was\r\nspent in giving them beer and tobacco on either side.  It has been\r\ncarried to a greater extent by the Gurneys than by any other persons.  I\r\nhave no doubt that the money was given for bribery.”\r\n\r\nJ. J. GURNEY, Esq.; stated that the assertion as to bribery by the\r\nGurneys was utterly false as to him; that he had never given a farthing\r\nfor the purpose of bribery; nor had the firm done so; nor had they any\r\nloans; nor had their clerks been employed for such a purpose; had the\r\ndeepest impression of the sin, guilt, and misery, involved in our local\r\nelections; and he would rather have his arm cut off than promote them\r\ndirectly, or in any way whatsoever.  Not only had there been bribery, but\r\na system of demoralization to a fearful extent; but treating was the root\r\nof the mischief here.  He believed the root of the evil was the election\r\nof the magistrates and corporate officers by popular means.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners asked, What mode of election do you consider would be\r\npreferable? and Mr. J. J. Gurney replied:—\r\n\r\n    “I think that the magistrates, being the representatives of the king,\r\n    ought to be appointed by the executive government; I mean those\r\n    officers connected with the government of the town.  The parties here\r\n    are evenly balanced, and it therefore becomes a close contest.\r\n    Nothing gives us rest but the predominance of one party.  We are at\r\n    rest now solely owing to the predominance of the Tory party.”\r\n\r\nA good deal of evidence was given of the great extent to which the system\r\nof cooping was carried on at elections.  Voters had been frequently taken\r\naway by force a dozen miles, locked up in public houses and half-starved\r\nin them, and otherwise ill-treated.  This system was carried on by both\r\nparties.  The worst proceedings of this sort seem to have occurred at the\r\nelections of Alderman Angell and Alderman Springfield, when there was a\r\nvast amount of bribery, treating, and cooping.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAM WILDE, afterwards coroner, gave evidence as to the election\r\nof Alderman Springfield, in November, 1821.  He was one of the committee\r\nfor conducting that election.  Mr. Ives, a retired clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England, was the other candidate.  The Northern ward was then\r\ntwo to one in favour of Springfield.  About 440 to 240 would have been a\r\nfair poll if no money had been given.  When the vacancy occurred, Mr.\r\nSpringfield was not in Norwich.  Mr. Wilde continued, “I sent for him\r\nexpress, and when he returned we heard from good authority that great\r\nsums had been offered by Ives’s party first.  We generally sent out\r\nfreemen to see how markets were going.  Springfield was returned, though\r\nit was generally reported that Ives’s party meant to buy the ward.  But\r\nSpringfield said he would not be bought out.  We went then into a regular\r\nsystem of buying, they buying all the men of ours they could, and we\r\nbuying all of theirs we could.  About £10 was a regular price.  We spent\r\n£600 or £700 in buying votes.  On the morning of the election, Mr. Ives’s\r\nparty commenced by giving two sovereigns each at the polling place.  Mr.\r\nSpringfield paid his men the same.  In consequence more than 300 out of\r\n430 who voted for Springfield took two sovereigns at the booths.  Persons\r\ndraw a distinction between money paid at the booths, and a bribe at any\r\nother place.  Many who take money at the booths will not accept bribes in\r\nany other shape.  Springfield’s election cost £1530.  The money at the\r\nbooths is openly given, and it is not considered a crime to take it.  I\r\nthink about 60 or 70 persons sold their votes at £10 apiece.  Small\r\nshopkeepers are not a bit better than freemen.  I have stood openly in\r\nthe market to buy votes with money in my hand.  This system is generally\r\nacted upon at all contested elections where the money can be found.\r\nNothing but poverty of purse makes purity of election in Norwich.  At\r\nAlderman Angell’s election the same system was followed.  It is the same\r\nat ward elections.  I have given £30 for a vote at an election for common\r\ncouncil only for a year, but there are few instances of such a high\r\nprice.  I once gave the father of a nominee £20 for his vote.  That sum\r\nis frequently given.  I have known promissory notes given for votes.  I\r\ndo not recollect an instance of notes given by aldermen, but 1 have no\r\ndoubt of the fact.  The usual plan is for a person to say ‘My family wall\r\nnot vote unless you give a turn at the hospital,’ and application is then\r\nmade to an alderman.  I think the effects of what I have been stating are\r\nmost debasing and demoralising.  I have known poor men who have for years\r\nwithstood the temptations offered them at elections; and when once they\r\nhave fallen into the snare, I have observed their conduct to alter, and\r\nthey have been much changed.  I am perfectly satisfied of the evil\r\ntendency of the course pursued hitherto, and in very few instances has\r\nthe money given been any benefit to the freemen, but quite the contrary.\r\nThe effect has been the same with both the giver and receiver of bribes.\r\nI should be sorry to bring up any of my children in the course which I\r\nhave pursued.”\r\n\r\nCommissioner Buckle then thanked Mr. Wilde for the very open and candid\r\nmanner in which he had given his evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN RISING STAFF said that on Alderman Angell’s election, for two\r\ndays and two nights previous the town was in a state of great disorder,\r\noccasioned by large parties of men employed by each party going about the\r\nstreets molesting any persons whom they met of the opposite party,\r\nattacking freemen personally, and by improper intrusions into their\r\ndwelling houses or other places where they were supposed to be concealed.\r\nIn some instances where they were in search for a voter, and could not\r\nfind him at his own residence, they went into the residence of other\r\npersons, not in the ward where the election was to take place, to search\r\nfor individuals.  Witness gave several instances of cooping.\r\n\r\nALDERMAN BOLINGBROKE also stated instances of cooping that came under his\r\nnotice as a magistrate.\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN FRANCIS said, “I have been a manufacturer in Norwich many years,\r\nand I consider the acts of the corporation to have engendered every\r\nspecies of bribery and strife.  Its patronage is invariably exercised in\r\nfavour of political adherents.  During the last ten years our commercial\r\ninterests have materially suffered from it.  It creates disunion between\r\nthose gentlemen where friendship would otherwise exist.  The local\r\nelections are pregnant with evil; they take men from their work, those\r\nwho are not free as well as those who are free; and in case of a contest\r\nit is impossible to get any work done for six weeks after; and this in\r\nthe spring time of the year when work is brisk and calls for close\r\nattendance.  The consequence is that the masters suffer materially.  I\r\nnever engaged in bribery at elections, except at the late election for\r\nsheriff, when I bought a bunch of four in the market for £8; I also\r\noffered another man £5, but he wanted £10, which I thought too much.  The\r\nnumbers, however, were running close, and I went to buy him at that\r\nprice, but I found that he had been settled for and voted.  Therefore I\r\nsaved £10.”\r\n\r\nMr. A. BARNARD said, “At the election of Mr. Foster as sheriff, I bought\r\nabout forty votes at from 30s. to £4 apiece.  I know personally of no\r\ninstances of bribery by an alderman.  I have known instances of an\r\nalderman saying, ‘You may make use of my turn in the hospital to get a\r\nvote.’  I have known this five or six times.  These promises were given\r\nby three aldermen.  I decline to give their names.  I have no objection\r\nto say they were Whigs.  I have acted frequently as paymaster at\r\nelections.  Aldermen have often subscribed for ward elections.  Both\r\nparties are pretty much alike.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE PALMER was examined very closely, and he stated that he had always\r\nvoted in the Whig interest, and that he had received a note from Alderman\r\nSpringfield for four shillings weekly till his brother’s child could be\r\ngot into the hospital.  The note was written and signed by a Mr. Batson\r\nin Mr. Springfield’s presence, and by his order.  It was given to witness\r\nfor his vote in favour of Mr. Foster at the election of sheriff in 1832.\r\nWitness had never been offered the hospital by any alderman on the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nA great deal more evidence was adduced as to notes of admission to the\r\nhospital given by both parties.  The last part of the inquiry was the\r\nmost important, relating as it did to the effect of local elections on\r\nthe trade of the city.\r\n\r\nJ. J. GURNEY, ESQ., said, “I can assure the commissioners that they have\r\nno notion of the sin, guilt, wickedness, and poverty, which our local\r\nelections inflict upon this city.  I wish to add an expression of my\r\nconviction, that if the election of magistrates and other officers was\r\naltered, the whole city would be benefitted, and no persons more so than\r\nthe poor freemen.  I was lately informed by a principal manufacturer, who\r\nhas large dealings with the poor, that it was his firm conviction that\r\none single ward election does more harm than all the preaching in all the\r\nchurches and all the meeting houses in all the year does good; and I\r\nbelieve it to be true.  I would observe that I make no distinction of\r\nparties; both, to my knowledge, are equally guilty; and whenever the\r\nmanagers find a purse, they fly to it as an eagle does to a carcase.”\r\n\r\nMR. H. WILLETT was of opinion that the local elections were an injury to\r\nthe lower orders, notwithstanding the money they received.  There was\r\nless work done on account of these elections.  Party had a very injurious\r\neffect on the trade of the city.  He thought Norwich suffered from\r\ncarrying on trade in a different manner to that pursued in other towns.\r\nThe trade had not paid in previous years, and capital was not employed\r\nbecause it did not pay.  The trade was carried on upon such a system that\r\nthere was no inducement to employ capital.  An open rate of wages would\r\ncause capital to be more beneficially employed.  A great deal of capital\r\nhad been lost to the city.  At that time there was less capital employed\r\nin this city than in any manufacturing town of its size in the kingdom.\r\nHe thought the city had been brought into this state by a fixed rate of\r\nwages, and the trade had been gradually leaving the city for years.  The\r\nfixed rate operated against the workmen, because it prevented their being\r\nemployed regularly.  In consequence of this small capitals were employed.\r\nThe men thought they would be injured by a fluctuating scale, but he\r\nbelieved the contrary.  While the country generally was never more\r\nflourishing, the city was never in a worse state.  Manufacturers feared\r\nso much annoyance, that they would not risk altering the present system.\r\nMany influential men were of his opinion as to the fixed rate of wages,\r\nbut dared not avow it, lest they should lose their political influence.\r\nHe dared not adopt the varied rate.  He did not choose to subject himself\r\nto the consequences.  The weavers were the only operatives who had a\r\nfixed rate.  He believed that a fixed rate was kept up by municipal\r\nelections, because the leading men were afraid of losing their influence.\r\nMost of the influential men were unconnected with manufactures.  He\r\nbelieved politics to be the first consideration with all of them.  He\r\nbelieved that the apprehension of violence deterred all the manufacturers\r\nfrom attempting to alter the fixed rate of wages; but wages were reduced,\r\nor else the whole trade would have left the city.  This caused such a\r\ndisturbance that he dared not go home.  The civil power was not\r\nsufficiently strong at the time, and the Dragoons were called out to\r\nenable him to go home.  His warehouse was attacked, and his windows were\r\nbroken.  The magistrates rendered all the assistance in their power, and\r\nmeasures were adopted to prevent any further injury.  His premises were\r\nguarded by special constables for two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nMR. WRIGHT, one of the largest manufacturers of the city, said he was\r\nattacked in consequence of his reducing wages.  Vitriol was thrown on his\r\nface, by which he lost the sight of one of his eyes.  A majority of the\r\nmanufacturers considered a reduction of wages to be necessary, but some\r\nof them became alarmed and did not acknowledge it.  The reduction\r\nprevented a further decrease of a declining trade.  But for the reduction\r\nthere would have been a greater decline of the trade.  Formerly the trade\r\nwas very flourishing when there was a fixed rate of wages, but that was\r\nwhen there was a great demand for Norwich crapes, then very much worn for\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN FRANCIS, a manufacturer, said he did not quite agree with Mr.\r\nWillett.  He did not think a fixed scale of wages advisable; but they\r\nwere not in a condition to alter it.  He thought the alteration would\r\ncreate more strife between masters and men.  He considered a fixed scale\r\nto be a disadvantage to the men, but it was not too high.  He believed\r\nthat the local elections prevented capital being employed, and disunited\r\nthe people.  But for these local elections there would have been more\r\ntrade.  Both parties had united in promoting one establishment, but six\r\nsuch mills would not supply all the yarns wanted for Norwich\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN ATHOW regarded the local elections as the cause of the ruin of\r\nthe city, as far as such ruin had taken place; as ruinous both to\r\nproperty and morals.  The mode in which the elections were then conducted\r\nhad contributed to the poverty and depravity of the city.  He believed\r\nthat the streets were in a more disgraceful state than in any other town,\r\nfrom what he had seen, and from what he had heard from commercial men\r\nvisiting Norwich.\r\n\r\nMR. R. M. BACON, then editor of the _Norwich Mercury_, believed that the\r\nprosperity of the city and private intercourse were all poisoned by the\r\nparty spirit engendered by frequent municipal elections.\r\n\r\nMR. J. W. ROBBERDS, a manufacturer, connected with the corporation from\r\n1807 till 1827, said that during that period he had seen the working of\r\nthe municipal system, and witnessed the strife of parties.  He believed\r\nthat by the contests in the different wards the character of the whole\r\npopulation of the city had been greatly deteriorated; that a great\r\ndepravity among the lower classes had been produced; and that the\r\ncharacter of the whole corporation had been affected.  He knew that\r\nindividuals had entered the corporation, not from any consideration of\r\npublic duty, but to serve their own private interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION OF STORMONT AND SCARLETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the inquiry of the commissioners, evidence was taken as to the\r\ngeneral election of the previous year.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS RUST stated, “Mr. Grimmer, in order to induce me to vote for\r\nStormont and Scarlett, offered to pay me £50 down, and to procure me £50\r\nof the city money after Christmas.  He promised distinctly to procure the\r\ncity money.  I have taken an active part at general elections.  I believe\r\nthere was great bribery at the last election for members of parliament.\r\nI do not think there was any bribery previous to the last election.  I do\r\nnot know any instance of it.  I saw some bribery at the last general\r\nelection.  I was up two nights working for the party.  I never had money\r\noffered to me at local elections, but I was offered £100 at the last\r\ngeneral election to go out and buy votes.  The proposition was made by\r\ntwo leading partizans of Stormont and Scarlett.  One of the parties\r\nproduced a large quantity of promissory notes.  I told him that he was\r\nplaying a dangerous game.  The partizan said ‘Can’t I lend money to whom\r\nI like?’  I replied, ‘I think not; it depends on the conditions.’  The\r\ngentleman who made the proposition said, “This is the way we do\r\nbusiness.”  The proposers were not members of the corporation.  They went\r\naway and called again.  One of them pulled out a large bag of sovereigns,\r\nand said he would not only lend me £100, but give it to me to join the\r\nparty, and to do what I could in the Northern ward.  They declared more\r\nthan once that they were determined to buy it.  They were guardians of\r\nthe poor.  There was no distinction as to the voters to be bought;\r\nfreemen as well as others.”\r\n\r\nHENRY BUSH said, “Alderman Turner authorized me to give £6 to a voter, to\r\nvote for Lord Stormont and Sir James Scarlett, and said that was the most\r\nmoney they were then giving.  I would not take the money as I said it was\r\nnot enough.”\r\n\r\nMR. ALDERMAN TURNER declared on oath that the statement was false.\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN HAYES said, “On the second day of the last general election, Mr.\r\nGeorge Liddell gave me three sovereigns for my vote, but never told me in\r\nwhich interest I was to vote.  Mr. Wortley, one of the common council,\r\nalso gave me three sovereigns to vote in the interest of Stormont and\r\nScarlett.  I took the sovereigns but voted in the Whig interest, and\r\ncarried the money to the committee and gave it to Mr. Beare and Mr.\r\nSpringfield.  It was returned to me in four months afterwards.”\r\n\r\nMR. WORTLEY denied the statement, but several persons were named who were\r\npresent when Mr. Wortley paid the money.\r\n\r\nMR. COZENS was examined as to the evidence which had been given before\r\nthe House of Commons’ committee by Mr. W. J. U. Browne, then sheriff, who\r\nwhen asked whether there was any committee for conducting the election of\r\nLord Stormont and Sir James Scarlett, replied, “Certainly not;” and the\r\nmanuscript was produced of a letter which appeared in the _Mercury_, in\r\nanswer to one sent out by Mr. Robberds, in which Mr. Browne spoke of “the\r\ncommittee for conducting the election,” and signed himself as chairman.\r\n\r\nMR. J. FRANCIS mentioned circumstances to prove that there was a\r\ncommittee, and produced a note.\r\n\r\nMR. WILLIAM COOPER, deposed, “There was no formal committee.  If anybody\r\nhad asked him for a committee man, he could not have stated one.  He\r\nshould say the whole party formed the committee.  He was active during\r\nthe election, but he was not aware that he belonged to any committee.”\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER BUCKLE:—“We have a letter in Mr. Browne’s own handwriting,\r\nin which he states that the committee was not dissolved, and he signs\r\nhimself chairman.”\r\n\r\nMR. COOPER observed, “Mr. Browne has given his own explanation of that.\r\nI am not prepared to give any other interpretation to the circumstance.\r\nI have given my opinion and my belief as to the existence of the\r\ncommittee.”\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER LONG said, “I have no doubt, Mr. Cooper, you have spoken\r\nperfectly correct.  At some elections there are committees, and at others\r\nit is thought better to avoid them.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter the prolonged inquiry, a special meeting of the corporate body was\r\nheld on January 9th, 1834, to determine what should be done in\r\nconsequence of the course pursued by the commissioners.  A great deal of\r\nvirtuous indignation was expressed, and it was resolved—\r\n\r\n    “That it is the confirmed opinion of this assembly, that this\r\n    corporation would have been perfectly justified in refusing their\r\n    sanction to the attendance of their members and officers, and in\r\n    declining to allow the production of their charters and muniments\r\n    before the commissioners, considering themselves well advised in\r\n    regarding the commission as an assumption of power contrary to law,\r\n    and as an exercise of prerogative, totally at variance with those\r\n    constitutional principles which, in defining the limits of regal\r\n    authority, guarantee alike the public rights and the private of the\r\n    subject.”\r\n\r\n    “That on these grounds, and influenced solely by a strong sense of\r\n    duty, the assembly of the 15th November last, recorded their protest\r\n    against a commission so dangerous in precedent, so menacing to the\r\n    privileges of chartered institutions, and so hostile to the cause of\r\n    civil liberty.  Yet, at the same time, animated with reverential\r\n    attachment to the king, unwilling to be deficient in proper respect\r\n    towards functionaries acting in the sovereign’s name, and above all\r\n    being unconscious of having, either in a corporate or magisterial\r\n    capacity, done any act calculated to prejudice the interests of the\r\n    city, or to bring discredit on themselves as a body, the assembly of\r\n    the 15th November last, ordered that the town clerk and other\r\n    officers should give the fullest documentary information for which\r\n    the commissioners might think fit to call.”\r\n\r\n    “That this corporation not only by such order, but also by\r\n    subsequently permitting oral evidence to be given by their members\r\n    and officers, now feel themselves the more imperatively called upon\r\n    to express their mingled sentiments of regret and disapproval at the\r\n    course of examination pursued, an examination governed by no rules of\r\n    evidence recognised in any English courts of law, but carried on in a\r\n    manner irregular, vague, and arbitrary, precluding the slightest hope\r\n    of arrival at such a conclusion as can possibly conduce to the ends\r\n    of truth and justice, still less such as can prove congenial to the\r\n    good feelings of any well-regulated, candid, and impartial mind.”\r\n\r\n    “That this assembly, considering that the great mass of information\r\n    received by the commissioners, emanated from the most decided and\r\n    unscrupulous partizans; that many of them were intimately connected\r\n    with, and implicated in the transactions to which allusions were\r\n    made; that those allusions involved charges against highly respected\r\n    and honourable individuals, since deceased, whose representatives had\r\n    no means of refuting the aspersions cast upon their memories; that\r\n    many also of those who came forward as the most material witnesses to\r\n    impugn the conduct and character of the corporate body, stand\r\n    self-convicted as the active unblushing agents of gross corruption,\r\n    and by their own admissions have proved themselves unworthy of\r\n    credit—considering all these things, and looking moreover to the\r\n    incontrovertible fact, that not one farthing of the corporate funds\r\n    has been either appropriated to electioneering purposes or diverted\r\n    from its originally destined and legitimate, object”—\r\n\r\n    “Do PROTEST against any report being made by the municipal\r\n    commissioners respecting the corporation of Norwich, based on\r\n    statements so utterly unfit to justify parliament in legislating on\r\n    so important a subject, and do most respectfully towards the crown,\r\n    but with firmness and fidelity to the obligation of their oaths as\r\n    corporators, deem it their duty to resist every attempt to exact from\r\n    them a surrender of the charters of the city and, therewith, of the\r\n    rights and privileges of the freemen of Norwich.”\r\n\r\n    “That this assembly invite the various corporations throughout the\r\n    kingdom to make common cause with them in endeavouring by every\r\n    lawful and constitutional means of resistance to defeat any design\r\n    that may be in contemplation for wresting from them their ancient\r\n    charters, franchises, and liberties.”\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed for this purpose, and to devise means for\r\nprotecting the charters, rights, and privileges of the corporation.  But\r\nall this opposition proved to be of no avail, and the Municipal Reform\r\nAct came into operation in 1835.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1835.  In January, 1835, the number of registered voters was 4018.  At\r\nthe election in this month, the bribery oath was administered to every\r\nvoter.  Sir James Scarlett, who had represented the city in parliament\r\nfrom 1832 to 1834, on being made Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer,\r\nwas raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Abinger of Abinger, in\r\nthe county of Surrey, and of the city of Norwich.  He took for his motto,\r\n“_Stat viribis suis_,” and on application to the corporation, was\r\npermitted to use the two angels, supporters to the city arms, as\r\nsupporters to his own.\r\n\r\nOn January 28th, the first _conversazione_ of the Norfolk and Norwich\r\nMuseum was held, and was well attended.  On the 27th and 28th, a dinner\r\nwas given to the electors who voted for the defeated candidates, Messrs.\r\nHarbord and Martin, at the late election.  About 1000 dined on the first\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMarch 23rd.  A meeting of the hand-loom weavers was held in the Cellar\r\nHouse, at St. Martin’s at Oak, to petition the legislature to establish\r\nlocal boards of trade.\r\n\r\nIn April an alteration was made in the conveyance of letters to and from\r\nLondon, being transmitted by the Ipswich instead of the Newmarket Mail,\r\nby which means the citizens got their letters earlier.  On the third of\r\nthis month the mayor and corporation waited on Lord Abinger, at the\r\nlodgings of the judges, with an address of congratulation on his first\r\nvisit to the city in his judicial capacity.\r\n\r\nJune 16th.  William Moore, Esq., was sworn into office as mayor of the\r\ncity.  This was the last Guild day under the old corporation.  It was\r\ncelebrated with all the customary civic splendour.  The Latin speech was\r\ndelivered at the porch of the Free School by Master Chambers, son of John\r\nChambers, Esq., of the Close, and he was presented with books to the\r\nvalue of £5 5s., as was also Master Norgate, the orator of the preceding\r\nyear.  At the dinner in St. Andrew’s Hall about 800 ladies and gentlemen\r\nsat down to a sumptuous repast.\r\n\r\nJuly 14th.  A meeting of the freemen was held in St. Andrew’s Hall to\r\npetition parliament to preserve to them and their children the privileges\r\nthey had so long enjoyed, but they soon lost their exclusive privilege of\r\nvoting for members of the corporation.  The Municipal Reform Bill passed\r\non September 8th, and received the royal assent on the following day.  On\r\nSunday, September 27th, the mayor and corporation attended divine service\r\nin the Cathedral for the last time under the old charters.  The Hon. and\r\nVery Rev. the Dean (Dr. Pellew) preached the funeral sermon of the old\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\nMichaelmas day this year passed over without the customary ceremony,\r\nowing to the new Municipal Act coming into force.  From 1403 it had been\r\ncustomary to swear the sheriffs into office on that day, and for many\r\nyears they had given inauguration dinners.  Mr. Winter, the last speaker\r\nof the old corporation, was presented with a handsome piece of plate by\r\nthat body on October 21st; and at a special assembly held on December\r\n17th, a vote of thanks was passed to the mayor, William Moore, Esq.  This\r\nwas the very last meeting of the old corporation under the ancient\r\ncharters of the city.\r\n\r\nOn December 26th, the day fixed by the Municipal Act, the first election\r\nof councillors took place under the new law.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1836.  January 1st.  T. O. Springfield, Esq., was chosen the first mayor\r\nof the new corporation.  He had been a very active partizan in the\r\nLiberal interest.  He was a member of the council nearly all his long\r\nlife; his influence was very great in promoting the return of candidates\r\nof his own party.  On the occasion of his going out of office, a dinner\r\nwas given to him in St. Andrew’s Hall.  About 600 sat down to a sumptuous\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\nMarch 1st.  The new police, eighteen in number, made their first\r\nappearance under Chief Constable Yarington.\r\n\r\nOn September 20th, 21st, and 22nd, the Norfolk and Norwich Musical\r\nFestival was held in St. Andrew’s Hall, when the concerts were well\r\nattended, and realised a large sum for the charities.\r\n\r\nDecember 1st.  S. Bignold, Esq., was the chief promoter of the Norwich\r\nYarn Company, which had a large capital, the whole of which was lost to\r\nthe shareholders.  On the occasion of laying the first stone of the yarn\r\nfactory, the pageant in honour of “Bishop Blaize” was revived, on\r\nDecember 1st, 1836.  The whole affair was cleverly got up, and admirably\r\nconducted.  The procession having completed a tour of the city, returned\r\nto St. Edmund’s, whence they proceeded to the site of the new building,\r\nwhere S. Bignold, Esq., laid the first stone.  This being done, the\r\nprocession set out to St. Andrew’s Hall, where 900 persons, men, women,\r\nand children, sat down to an excellent dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nReign of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN VICTORIA was proclaimed here in the usual manner, on June 23rd,\r\n1837, amid great rejoicing.  On Thursday, August 17th, Dr. Stanley was\r\nenthroned in the Cathedral; he was the sixty-sixth bishop of the diocese,\r\nand the thirty-third since the reformation.  After the installation about\r\na hundred of the gentry, clergy, and laity dined at the Norfolk Hotel.\r\nThis bishop was a great promoter of the education of the poor.  An\r\nepiscopal chapel was opened in Heigham on August 10th, and afterwards\r\nconsecrated by the bishop under the name of “Trinity Chapel.”  His\r\nlordship also consecrated the new church at Catton.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1838.  January 3rd.  A meeting was held in St. Andrew’s Hall to petition\r\nparliament to abolish the apprenticeship of negroes in the colonies.  On\r\nthe 5th the new district schools were opened in St. Augustine’s.\r\n\r\nOn July 11th, a very numerous meeting of the camlet weavers was held, for\r\nthe purpose of resisting the proposed reduction of wages.  About this\r\ntime some differences existed between the men and their employers\r\nrespecting wages.  Col. Harvey was requested to mediate between them, and\r\nhe did so, but without any good result.  The city was much disturbed in\r\nconsequence of these disagreements.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1839.  On May 18th, a meeting was held at the Norfolk Hotel to consider a\r\nbill about to be presented to parliament for the improvement of the city,\r\nand to give the citizens an opportunity of objecting to any of its\r\nclauses.  On June 19th this bill passed, but very little was done under\r\nit in the way of improvement.  A great part of the city remained\r\nundrained, and the pavements continued in a bad state.\r\n\r\nOn August 16th, the Norfolk and Norwich Art Union opened their exhibition\r\nof pictures at the Bazaar in St. Andrew’s.  About 400 pictures were\r\nexhibited, some of them of great merit.\r\n\r\nAbout this time much excitement prevailed in the city respecting the\r\ndesigns of the Chartists, who, although they were not numerous, were\r\nconsidered dangerous, as they were known to possess arms, many guns and\r\npikes having been taken from them by the police.  On Sunday, August 18th,\r\nthe Chartists attended divine service at the Cathedral, when the bishop\r\nmade a spirited appeal to them.  Many meetings of the Chartists were\r\nheld, and exciting harangues were delivered, advocating the five points\r\nof the charter, including universal suffrage, and vote by ballot, which,\r\nsome of their opponents said, meant “Universal suffering, and vote by\r\nbullet.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1840.  On February 10th, Queen Victoria’s wedding day was kept as a\r\nholiday, and addresses were adopted, to be presented to Her Majesty and\r\nPrince Albert.  The poor of the various parishes were substantially\r\nregaled, and the citizens were admitted free to the pit and gallery of\r\nthe theatre.  On many subsequent occasions, on the birth of a prince or\r\nprincess, the citizens have shown their loyalty by presenting addresses\r\nof congratulation.\r\n\r\nOn February 25th, a meeting was held in St. Andrew’s Hall to consider the\r\nnecessity of a bill then before parliament, for “repealing and altering\r\nthe existing paving acts,” and to oppose the same, if necessary: when a\r\npetition was adopted to be presented to the House of Commons, praying\r\nthat the bill might not pass.  The Marquis of Douro presented the\r\npetition.\r\n\r\nOn June 15th, at a meeting in the Guildhall, addresses of congratulation\r\nwere agreed on, to be presented to the Queen and Prince Albert, on their\r\nhappy escape from an attempt at assassination.\r\n\r\nThe first annual meeting of the Norfolk and Norwich Protestant\r\nAssociation was held on October 15th in St. Andrew’s Hall, when 2000\r\npersons were present.  Addresses were delivered advocating the Protestant\r\ncause.  Subsequently many similar meetings were held in this city.  The\r\nspeakers always raised the cry of “no popery,” explaining that they\r\nmeant, “No withholding of the bible from the people; no worshipping of\r\nGod in a dead language; no bowing down before images as helps to\r\ndevotion; no divine homage offered to a human being, though the mother of\r\nour Lord; no prayers to saints; no priests pretending to offer the\r\nsacrifice of Christ continually in the mass; no polluting confessional;\r\nno persecuting inquisition; no Jesuits with their hidden works of\r\ndarkness; no licenses for doing evil that good may come; no absolution\r\nfor the worst of crimes; no power of a priesthood over courts of law; no\r\ncanon law to overrule the statutes of the realm; no cursing with bell,\r\nbook, and candle; no enforced celibacy; no nunneries where women are\r\nburied alive; no convents for lazy, vicious monks; no masses for the\r\ndead; no fictitious purgatory; no power of priests to forgive sins,” &c.,\r\n&c\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1841.  In June this year the census of the united kingdom was taken, and\r\nthe result, as regarded this city, showed but a small increase of the\r\npopulation, the total number being 62,294, while in 1831 the number was\r\n61,304.  The number of hand-loom weavers had been greatly diminished by\r\nthe competition of steam power.  Many of them left the city, and others\r\nwent into the boot and shoe trade, which had now become of some\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThis year many political meetings were held in the city, of Tories,\r\nWhigs, Radicals, and Chartists.  The prospect of a general election kept\r\nthe city in a state of great excitement.  The leaders of the two former\r\nparties tried to prevent a repetition of such scenes as had taken place,\r\nby a compromise, which was a most hateful thing to the freemen, and\r\nworking men generally.  When the election came on in June, Mr. Dover, a\r\nChartist, nominated Mr. Eagle, a Chartist, of Suffolk, and afterwards, it\r\nwas said, received a bribe of £50 to withdraw the nomination.  In\r\nconsequence of this, a riotous mob assembled in the Market Place, and\r\nDover had to be protected by the police from their violence, for if they\r\nhad got hold of him, they seemed as though they would have torn him in\r\npieces.  On the following day the mob having learned that Dover was at a\r\npublic house in St. George’s Colegate, went there and dragged him thence,\r\nthreatening to throw him into the river.  He was much injured, and would\r\nprobably have lost his life but for the timely arrival of the police.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1843.  On August 9th, a dreadful storm of hail, rain, wind, and thunder,\r\npassed over the city and county, and did immense damage to property,\r\nespecially to the growing crops.  Parochial subscriptions were raised to\r\nthe amount of £5,622, and private subscriptions £4,391, towards\r\ncompensating the sufferers for their losses.  An immense number of\r\nwindows were broken by the hail in the city, and many places were\r\nflooded.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1844.  This year the railway was opened between Yarmouth and Norwich, and\r\nin the next year the line was opened from Norwich to Brandon,\r\nsimultaneously with the Eastern Counties line from London to Ely.  This\r\ncaused an entire change in the mode of travelling, and in the carrying\r\ntrade of the district.  All the old stage coaches were of course\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR LAW REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n1846.  About the year 1846, the high rates in Norwich became the subject\r\nof complaint and discussion.  A good deal of alarm was excited in the\r\ncity in consequence of a proposal of Sir Robert Peel, then prime\r\nminister, to alter the law of settlement, so that all persons who had\r\nresided five years in any place should have a permanent settlement there.\r\nAs many families belonging to the county parishes were then resident in\r\nNorwich, it was feared that they would become chargeable to the city and\r\nbe a permanent burden on the rate-payers.  This apprehension proved to be\r\nwell founded, for after the passing of the Poor Removal Act, hundreds of\r\ncounty families did become chargeable to the city, and have been so ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nMr. G. Gedge, of Catton, instituted inquiries on the subject; and being a\r\nmember of the court of guardians, often called attention to it.  He was,\r\nin fact, the first in this city to advocate a general or national rate as\r\nthe most effectual remedy for the evils of the then existing system of\r\nrating.  He spared neither time, trouble, nor expense in promoting his\r\nviews, which were generally approved by the more influential citizens.\r\nHe employed Mr. Hutchinson, an eminent statist in London, on the\r\nrecommendation of Mr. Wakley, to collect information respecting the gross\r\ninequalities of the system of rating all over England, and this\r\ninformation was published and circulated in a valuable work, from which\r\nnearly all the statistics on the subject have been derived and quoted by\r\nmembers of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Gedge introduced the question of a national rate at many meetings of\r\nthe court of guardians in 1846.  He showed that the poor rates then\r\ncollected annually amounted to about five millions.  Nearly the same sum\r\nwas raised by the property and income tax; and it followed that if only\r\nthose were rated who paid the latter tax, the charge throughout England\r\nand Wales for the support of the poor would not amount to more than\r\nsevenpence in the pound.  But including all the parties not then\r\nchargeable to the property and income tax, and who would be fairly liable\r\nto the poor rates, the annual rate would not amount to more than half\r\nthat sum.  This would be a most important difference to the great mass of\r\nthe rate-payers, whose payments to the relief of the poor would be\r\ngreatly diminished, whilst they would have the pleasure of knowing that\r\nthe poor would be better cared for, and that those comforts which they\r\nhad a right to expect, as producers of wealth, would be placed more\r\nimmediately within their reach.\r\n\r\nMr. Gedge explained that, as all the parishes in the city were\r\nincorporated in regard to the relief of the poor, a general rate being\r\nraised from all those parishes for that purpose, his proposition was that\r\nthis general mode of rating should be extended over the whole country,\r\nand that a general rate should be raised to be applied for the relief of\r\nthe poor wherever they were located.  He showed that if each parish in\r\nthis city supported its own poor, the rating would be very unequal, and\r\nsome of the richest parishes would pay least, while the poorest and more\r\npopulous would pay most.  To prevent this inequality, all the parishes\r\nhad been incorporated.  This had been found to be a great improvement,\r\nand it should be further extended.  Many persons, fund-holders and\r\nothers, living in lodgings, were exempted from poor rates.  Many large\r\nestablishments in Cheapside and the middle of London paid no poor rates,\r\nbecause the poor did not live in those localities.  Many persons living\r\nin fashionable towns also escaped poor rates, for the same reason, while\r\nthe industrious and the middle classes had to bear the burden.  He\r\ntherefore maintained that there should be a national rate.\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the court of guardians concurred with these views,\r\nand ultimately a petition to Parliament was adopted in favour of a\r\nnational rate.  The petition was duly presented in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, June 10th, 1846, an important meeting of the rate-payers of\r\nthe city was held in the sessions court, at the Guildhall, to petition\r\nParliament against the Poor Law Removal Act, which had been lately\r\nintroduced into the House of Commons.  The mayor, J. Betts, Esq.,\r\npresided and opened the proceedings.  Mr. S. Bignold, Mr. T. Brightwell,\r\nMr. J. G. Johnson, Mr. E. Willett, Mr. A. A. H. Beckwith, Mr. Banks, Mr.\r\nNewbegin, Mr. Hardy, & Mr. G. Gedge, addressed the meeting in support of\r\nresolutions, and a petition was adopted against the proposed alteration\r\nin the Law of Settlement and the Poor Law Removal Bill.  Mr. G. Gedge\r\nmoved a resolution,—\r\n\r\n    “That this meeting is decidedly of opinion that the only effectual\r\n    alteration of the law of settlement, by which free scope would be\r\n    given to the labour of the people, would be to abolish the present\r\n    law of settlement and rating, and to substitute a general national\r\n    tax on real and personal property, and that a petition founded on\r\n    this resolution be presented to the House of Commons.”\r\n\r\nHe showed the very injurious operation of the law then existing, and\r\nexpressed his belief that a national rate, if obtained, would prove a\r\ngreat benefit to the city.  Mr. Sheriff Colman seconded the resolution,\r\nwhich was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nAfter this meeting, two petitions were presented to Parliament, from this\r\ncity, in favour of a national rate; one from the court of guardians, and\r\none from the citizens at large.  These petitions, however, had no effect,\r\nand the Poor Law Removal Bill was passed into a law.  The consequence\r\nwas, that about 1500 families belonging to county parishes, who had lived\r\nfive years in the city, obtained a settlement in it, and most of them\r\nsoon applied for relief.  This greatly increased the expenditure for the\r\nrelief of the poor.\r\n\r\nAt the monthly meeting of the court of guardians, held on December 1st,\r\n1846, Mr. G. Gedge moved a resolution of which he had given notice at the\r\nprevious court, in respect to a national rate, and he urged the usual\r\narguments in favour of that measure.  He wished the support of the court\r\nto a petition to be presented to Parliament during the following session,\r\nfor the total repeal of the mode of rating to the relief of the poor,\r\nthen in operation, and the substitution of a national rate.  He believed\r\nthat public opinion was now fixed on this question, and that a national\r\nrate must come.  A petition was adopted, _nem con._\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1847.  A meeting of the city operatives was held on Wednesday, March\r\n23rd, in St. Andrew’s Hall, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament to\r\nabolish the law of settlement then in operation, and to establish a\r\nnational poor rate.  The meeting was numerously attended by working men,\r\nwho manifested a great interest in the question.  Several of them\r\ndelivered speeches against the law of settlement and in favour of a\r\nnational rate, and a petition to Parliament was adopted.  Mr. Gedge spoke\r\nat some length in favour of the measure, which he believed would be\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nA public meeting of the citizens was held on December the 2nd, 1847, to\r\nconsider the evils arising from the alteration of the law of settlement.\r\nThe mayor (G. L. Coleman, Esq.) presided, and many influential gentlemen\r\naddressed the meeting in support of resolutions deprecating the\r\nalteration in the law, and in favour of a more equitable system than that\r\nin operation.  Sir S. M. Peto, M.P. for the city expressed his\r\nconcurrence, and the resolution was carried unanimously.  Subsequently,\r\nseveral meetings were held in Norwich in favour of a national rate.\r\nDuring the same year, also, an association was formed in London, having\r\nthe same object in view; and, eventually, the movement resulted in the\r\npassing of an Act of Parliament, by which a union poor rate was\r\nestablished in every county in England.  This has proved to be a vast\r\nimprovement of the old system, and a great advance in the direction of a\r\nnational rate, but still the poor rate is levied on real property only.\r\nThe most equitable system would be for every man to pay according to his\r\nability, whether he be a landowner, a shipowner, a houseowner, a\r\nfund-holder, or an artisan.\r\n\r\nBefore the Removal Act passed, the Norwich guardians were quite aware of\r\nthe effect it would have on the city.  In order to prove that their\r\napprehensions were well founded, they caused a census to be taken in the\r\ncity and county of those paying a yearly rental of £6 and under, and an\r\ninquiry to be instituted as to the settlement of the tenants of those\r\nhouses.  They found, after a full investigation, that more than a third\r\nof the houses were occupied by persons not having a settlement in\r\nNorwich, but in other districts.  The operation of the act was to throw\r\nthe expense of the maintenance of such persons on the city, at an\r\nestimated cost of £5000 yearly.  This was represented to the government,\r\nwho paid no attention to it, and the Act passed nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nLeading Events (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the autumn of 1848, the Royal Agricultural Society of England held a\r\nmeeting in this city.  The exhibition of stock and implements took place\r\nin a large field near the Newmarket Road, and attracted thousands of\r\nvisitors.  The trials of implements took place on land near the city.\r\nLectures were delivered by the Rev. E. Sidney and others at the\r\nShirehall.  The members of the Society and their friends dined together\r\non two occasions, in St. Andrew’s Hall.  Addresses were delivered by\r\nProfessor Sedgwick and other eminent men on various subjects.  S.\r\nBignold, Esq., was mayor during this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDER OF THE NORWICH RECORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate on the night of November 28th, 1848, the city was startled by the\r\nintelligence of the murder of Isaac Jermy, Esq., the Recorder of Norwich,\r\nand his son.  His son’s wife (Mrs. Jermy Jermy), and her servant, Eliza\r\nChastney, were also fired at and wounded by the same murderous hand.  The\r\nfirst news of these murders and attempted murders excited universal\r\nhorror.  They appeared to be so inhuman and atrocious, that public\r\nfeeling was wrought up to the highest pitch; and all the reports\r\npublished in the local and metropolitan journals were read with the\r\ngreatest avidity.  James Blomfield Rush, a farmer, well known in Norfolk,\r\nand a tenant under Mr. Jermy, was at once suspected and apprehended.  He\r\nwas examined before the magistrates, committed, tried, found guilty, and\r\nexecuted.  We give a short account of this terrible tragedy.\r\n\r\nMr. Jermy, with his wife and family, lived at a mansion called Stanfield\r\nHall, about two miles distant from Wymondham, and Rush lived at a\r\nneighbouring farm house, known as Potash Farm.  The Preston family, of\r\nwhich the recorder was a descendant, originally came from the village of\r\nPreston, in the hundred of Babergh, Suffolk, and settled at Beeston St.\r\nLawrence, in the hundred of Tunstead, in Norfolk.  In 1837, the Rev. G.\r\nPreston died, leaving his son, the recorder, heir to Stanfield and his\r\nother entailed property.  The recorder, previous to his father’s death,\r\nwas called Mr. Preston; but soon after that event, he took the necessary\r\nsteps for complying with the stipulation in the will of Mr. Wm. Jermy,\r\nfrom whom the property had descended, that the possessor of the estate\r\nshould assume his name and arms, and accordingly he took the name and\r\narms of Jermy by license from the crown.  He was a county magistrate and\r\none of the chairmen at quarter sessions, recorder for Norwich, and a\r\ndirector of the Norwich Union Insurance Office.  Indeed, he had been all\r\nhis life closely connected with the city.\r\n\r\nThere had been some disputes relative to the Stanfield property.  It was\r\nsaid that one of the male relatives of William Jermy had disposed of his\r\nreversionary interest in these estates for the trifling consideration of\r\n£20.  This occurred in the year 1754.  In June 1838, when the Rev. George\r\nPearson’s furniture and library at Stanfield Hall were advertised for\r\nsale, a person named Thomas Jermy, a grandson of John Jermy, with a\r\ncousin of his, named John Larner, put in a claim to the estate, and\r\nserved notices both upon Mr. Jermy and the auctioneer to stop the sale.\r\nLarner then attempted to obtain possession of the hall, but was shortly\r\nafterwards ejected by Rush, (who was then acting as bailiff for Mr.\r\nJermy,) with a party of labourers.  Larner then cut down some timber and\r\ncarted it away; and he and his party were apprehended for the offence,\r\nbut he himself was acquitted, though his accomplices were convicted in\r\npenalties.  Shortly afterwards placards were posted in the neighbourhood,\r\nstating their intention to obtain forcible possession.  This they\r\nattempted to do, but they were apprehended and committed to the assizes.\r\nThey pleaded _guilty_, and were sentenced to various periods of\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nRush, being aware of all these circumstances, may have thought that he\r\ncould perpetrate the murder in disguise, and that suspicion would rest on\r\nthose who claimed the estate.  It was stated and believed that he was a\r\nnear relation to the recorder, who, when he came into possession of his\r\nestates, employed Rush as his steward, but rescinded his leases, having\r\nfound that they were illegal.  This created the first ill feeling between\r\nthe parties.  The recorder granted new leases to Rush, but, as the latter\r\nalleged, at higher rent.  Rush soon afterwards took the Potash Farm in\r\nHethel, under Mr. Calver; this farm adjoining the Stanfield estate, and\r\nbeing very convenient for his occupation.  It being for sale, Mr. Jermy\r\nwished to become the purchaser, and he authorised Rush, who fixed the\r\nvalue at £3,500, to buy it for him.  Rush attended the sale, and having\r\nbid £3,500 for Mr. Jermy, bade £3,750 for himself.  The recorder, though\r\nmuch annoyed by this transaction at first, was induced to lend Rush the\r\nmoney, on mortgage, to complete the purchase.  The equity of redemption,\r\nor the ownership, therefore belonged to him.  A number of mortgage deeds\r\nwere executed, the last of which was dated September 28th, 1844, and it\r\nrecited several prior mortgages.\r\n\r\nThe effect of it was, that a sum of £5000 in all was charged upon the\r\nestate, by way of mortgage, in favour of the recorder, and it contained a\r\nprovision that the money was to remain on the security of that estate\r\n_until the_ 30_th_ _November_, 1848.  The interest on the £5000 was 4 per\r\ncent. or £200 per annum, and Rush became tenant so as to enable the\r\nrecorder to distrain for rent.  Rush now held three farms, and in\r\nOctober, 1847, he was in arrear of rent for the Stanfield farm, and the\r\nrecorder put in some distresses.  Rush being ejected went to live at\r\nPotash farm house.  Mr. Jermy also brought an action against Rush for\r\nbreach of covenants.  This action was tried at the March assizes, 1848,\r\nand it, as well as the previous distresses, seemed to have occasioned\r\nrancourous feelings in Rush’s mind towards Mr. Jermy.  He published a\r\npamphlet which professed to be a report of the trial, calling Mr. Jermy a\r\nvillain, and stating that he had no right to Stanfield Hall.  This showed\r\nthat Rush cherished malignant feelings towards his victim.\r\n\r\nRush appears to have for some time premeditated the murder of Mr. Jermy\r\nand his whole family; and he ultimately resolved to carry out a deep-laid\r\nscheme, both of murder and robbery.  He got a young woman named Emily\r\nSandford into his service as governess, and seduced her.  He then\r\nemployed her to draw up some quasi legal documents, as she could write\r\nlike a lawyer’s clerk.  According to one of these documents, signed\r\n“Isaac Jermy,” that gentleman gave up all claim on Rush, if the latter\r\ngave up all papers and documents relating to the Stanfield estate.  The\r\nsignature was of course forged.  After the murder these documents were\r\nfound concealed under the floor of a bed-room in Rush’s house, ready to\r\nbe produced had he escaped suspicion.\r\n\r\nRush’s conduct before the murders had been observed.  He had taken every\r\nprecaution to throw off suspicion.  During the latter part of November,\r\nhe had been in the habit of going out at night, pretending to be on the\r\nlook-out for poachers.  He ordered a quantity of straw to be littered\r\ndown from his homestead to the fields towards Stanfield Hall.  A portion\r\nof the path which had never before been littered with straw, was then\r\nlittered by his direction, and the straw ceased where the green sward\r\nbegan, so that he could walk from his house towards the recorder’s\r\nmansion, without any danger of his footsteps being traced.  Before\r\nNovember 28th, he had caused everybody to leave his house except Emily\r\nSandford and a lad named Savory.  On that day he returned home about 5\r\np.m., and asked when the dinner would be ready.  Emily Sandford said it\r\nwould be ready soon, upon which he remarked, “There is just time for me\r\nto go into the garden and fire off my gun;” and he went into the garden\r\nand discharged his gun accordingly.  This was intended to account for his\r\ngun having been recently used.  He had bought a double-barrelled gun in\r\nLondon the last time he was there.  After tea he appeared to be extremely\r\nagitated.  He went up-stairs to his bedroom and put on a disguise; one\r\npart of which was for the whole person, being in fact a widow’s dress,\r\nwhich was quite new.  Another part was a black crape bonnet with a double\r\nfrill hanging by it; and the frill rendered it difficult for any one to\r\ndiscern the wearer’s features.  He enveloped himself with a large cloak,\r\narmed himself with his double-barrelled gun, and went out to do his work\r\nof murder between seven and eight o’clock.  Nobody saw him leave the\r\nhouse.  The night was dark and windy and well suited for the deeds of an\r\nassassin.\r\n\r\nSoon after eight o’clock, the recorder’s dinner being over, he was\r\nsitting alone in the dining-room, little dreaming of the doom that\r\nawaited him and his son.  His son and his son’s wife, who had retired to\r\nthe drawing-room, were about to partake of tea and to amuse themselves\r\nwith a game of picquet, the cards being on the table.  Mr. Jermy was in\r\nthe habit of going outside the hall after dinner, and on this evening he\r\nleft the dining-room and walked to a porch in front of the mansion.\r\nRush, who knew the recorder’s habits and expected him to come out, was\r\nstanding near the porch in disguise holding his loaded gun in his hand.\r\nAs soon as Mr. Jermy reached the porch, Rush presented his gun, fired,\r\nand shot him through the heart.  He fell backwards, groaned, and\r\ninstantly expired.  Rush immediately ran to the side door, entered, and\r\nproceeded along the passages leading to the staircase hall.  He passed\r\nclose to the butler, who, affrighted at the appearance of an armed man in\r\ndisguise, retired to his pantry.  Rush passed on to the door opening into\r\nthe staircase hall.  Mr. Jermy, jun., who had heard the report of a gun,\r\nopened the door at that very moment.  They met; Rush drew back, presented\r\nthe gun, and fired; and young Mr. Jermy fell dead in the hall.  The\r\nassassin then passed on into the dining-room, no doubt with the intention\r\nof exterminating the whole family.  Mrs. Jermy, still in the\r\ndrawing-room, on hearing the second report, immediately went into the\r\nhall, and passed over the dead body of her husband.  Eliza Chastney, one\r\nof the female servants, on hearing her mistress screaming for help, ran\r\nup to her, and holding her by the waist cried out, “My dear mistress,\r\nwhat is the matter?”  At this moment, Rush came out of the dining-room,\r\nand seeing the two women opposite to him, levelled his weapon and fired\r\ntwice, wounding Mrs. Jermy in the arm and her servant in the leg.  The\r\nmurderer then made his escape by the side door, leaving death, misery,\r\nand woe behind him.  He did not escape, however, before some of the\r\nservants had made their observations of him.  Eliza Chastney had marked\r\nthe man, and she afterwards identified him at the trial.  Strange to say,\r\nseveral persons were standing at the gate close to the bridge, heard the\r\nreports of a gun, and heard the alarm bell ringing, but did not imagine\r\nthat anything serious had happened.  Some people are so stolid that an\r\nearthquake would scarcely arouse them.  A man who had been employed in\r\nthe stables, hearing the reports, thought that the hall was attacked by a\r\nband of ruffians, went to the back, swam over the moat which surrounds\r\nthe hall, and ran to the house of a neighbouring farmer (Mr. Colman), and\r\nhaving obtained a horse rode to Wymondham, spreading the alarm as he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the scene at Stanfield Hall was one of utter dismay.\r\nThe cook had fled to the coach house with little Miss Jermy, the daughter\r\nof Mr. Jermy, jun.  The cowardly butler, who might have seized the\r\nassassin in the passage, rushed to Mr. Gower’s, another farmer, for\r\nassistance.  The maid servants conveyed their wounded mistress upstairs\r\nto bed.  Eliza Chastney was lying wounded on the ground; Mr. Jermy, sen.,\r\nwas lying dead in the porch, everybody being then uncertain as to his\r\nfate; and Mr. Jermy, jun., was lying dead in the hall.  Mr. Colman, Mr.\r\nGower, and Mr. Gower’s two sons, having received some vague information,\r\nhad hurried to the hall, and were the first who discovered what had\r\nhappened.  The servants were all panic-stricken.\r\n\r\nWhat was the conduct of the assassin after the murders?  Emily Sandford,\r\nwhom he had seduced, though at first she told a false story, revealed it\r\nall in the course of the inquest and the examinations before the\r\nmagistrates.  Between nine and ten o’clock on that same night, Rush’s\r\nknock was heard at his own door.  Emily Sandford went to the door to open\r\nit, but without a light, and she did not see him come in.  He went\r\nupstairs to his own room, put off his disguise which was found there by\r\nthe police, and in a short time came down again without his boots and\r\ncoat.  He told Emily Sandford to make haste and put out her fire and go\r\nto bed; and before he left her he said, “If any inquiry is made about me,\r\nsay I was not out more than ten minutes.”  She followed, after she had\r\nput out the fire, and asked him where she should sleep.  He told her that\r\nshe was to sleep in her own room; that being the first night she had done\r\nso for a long time.  She went to bed, and between two and three o’clock\r\nin the morning Rush, who had heard voices outside, rapped at the door of\r\nher room and desired her to let him in; and she did so.  He came\r\ntrembling to her bedside and said, “Now you be firm, and remember that I\r\nwas out only ten minutes.”  She was extremely agitated and inquired what\r\nwas the matter; but he would only tell her that she might hear of\r\nsomething in the morning.  Taking hold of his hand she observed that he\r\ntrembled violently.  Next morning the police, who had watched the house\r\nall night, apprehended him, and on the same day he was examined before\r\nthe magistrates.  Emily Sandford also underwent a lengthened examination,\r\nand persisted in stating that Rush was out only a quarter of an hour on\r\nthe previous night; but at the inquest subsequently held by Mr. Press at\r\nWymondham, she confessed that her first statement was false, admitting\r\nthat Rush did not return home till after nine o’clock, and that he told\r\nher to say he had been out only ten minutes.  She also gave evidence as\r\nto all that passed between her and Rush that night, as already related.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the murder the police searched Potash farm house,\r\nand found two double-barrelled guns in the closet in Rush’s bed-room, but\r\nthese were not the weapons he used.  The gun he had used was afterwards\r\nfound under a manure heap.  In the house the police found a black dress,\r\na grey and black frontlet, female wig, and a long black veil, as for a\r\nfemale head-dress.  These were hidden in a closet in Rush’s bed-room.\r\nConcealed under the floor of a closet a number of documents were also\r\nfound, which turned out to be the forged deeds before alluded to.  These\r\nformed an extraordinary link in the case, and after repeated examinations\r\nthe prisoner was committed to the assizes for trial.  The bodies of his\r\nvictims were consigned to their last resting place at Wymondham on\r\nDecember 5th, in the presence of a vast concourse of spectators.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Rush excited universal interest all over England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland.  It commenced at the Shirehall, Norwich, on Thursday, March\r\n29th, 1849, before Baron Rolfe.  It continued six days, and each day the\r\ncourt was crowded to excess.  He was not defended by counsel.  Mr.\r\nSergeant Byles stated the case for the prosecution, and then called a\r\nnumber of witnesses who clearly proved the facts.  Having in the\r\npreceding part of this narrative stated all the particulars, it is\r\nunnecessary to give the evidence.  The documents which were found in a\r\nsecret place under the floor of the bed-room closet in the prisoner’s\r\nhouse were produced, and several of them were proved to be forgeries,\r\nwhich, if carried into effect after the recorder’s death, would have\r\nplaced the prisoner in a very good position with respect to the farms\r\nwhich he occupied, and would have rid him of all his liabilities.  A\r\npowerful motive for the commission of the murders was therefore apparent.\r\nThe servants at the hall, who had seen the disguised armed man there, all\r\ndeposed that they believed the prisoner to be the man, as they had known\r\nhim before, and as they had recognised him by his height, form, walk, and\r\ngait.  Eliza Chastney, who had been severely wounded by the assassin, was\r\nbrought into court on a couch, attended by medical men.  When asked if\r\nshe saw the assassin in court, she pointed to Rush and said, “That is the\r\nman.”  She had seen him several times at the hall.  When he fired at her,\r\nshe saw the whole form of his head and shoulders, and she knew no one\r\nelse having a similar appearance.  Emily Sandford entered the box\r\napparently in a weak state.  She was examined at great length, and she\r\nstated with much clearness all that had passed between her and Rush and\r\nother parties in reference to the documents produced.  She also gave a\r\nfull account of the prisoner’s conduct on the night of the 28th, as\r\nalready narrated.\r\n\r\nWhen the prisoner commenced his cross-examination of this witness there\r\nwas a profound silence in the court, all present being anxious to know\r\nhow he would treat the unfortunate female whom he had seduced, and who\r\nhad given evidence against him.  He appeared to be under the influence of\r\nstrong emotion, so much so as at times, as to stifle his utterance; and\r\nhe was frequently on the verge of bursting into tears, yet he mastered\r\nhis feelings, and put his questions mildly in an assumed endearing\r\nmanner, trying to rouse any affection that she might have left for him.\r\nShe gave her answers in a low tone, and sometimes weeping, which excited\r\nthe pity of the spectators.  Nearly all the questions put by the prisoner\r\nwere irrelevant to her evidence in chief, but not all the blandishments\r\nand frequent adjurations of the questioner could elicit answers to suit\r\nhis purpose.  At length he put questions which roused her indignation,\r\nand she reproached him for his perfidy in not marrying her as he\r\npromised.  If he had done so, she could not have given evidence against\r\nhim.  Four days were occupied with the case for the prosecution.  On the\r\nfifth day the prisoner commenced his defence, and he spoke on that and\r\nthe following day fourteen hours without making any impression whatever\r\nin his favour.  He began by admitting a guilty knowledge that something\r\nwas about to take place in the hall on that night.  He said parties had\r\nconsulted him as to the expediency of taking forcible possession of the\r\nhall, as had been done some years before.  He advised them not to do so,\r\nbut still he apprehended that something serious would happen.  He left\r\nhis house at eight or half-past eight o’clock on the night of the\r\nmurders, and he went to the boundary of his own land.  When he got to the\r\nfence leading to the hall, he waited a few minutes and thought he would\r\ngo back as he felt ill, but at that moment he heard the report of a gun\r\nor pistol in a direct line from the hall.  He then heard two more, and\r\nwas struck with amazement, as the parties to whom he alluded had always\r\nsaid, if they took firearms it would only be to intimidate, not to use\r\nthem.  He then heard the bell rung violently, and he hastened back to his\r\nhouse as quickly as he could, and he went through the garden into the\r\nhouse.  Having given this account of himself on that night, he proceeded\r\nto comment on the evidence with a view to show contradictions.\r\n\r\nMr. Sergeant Byles replied, showing that the prisoner had only\r\nstrengthened the case against him.\r\n\r\nThe learned judge summed up in a lucid manner, the jury soon returned a\r\nverdict of guilty of wilful murder, the prisoner was sentenced to be\r\nhung, and the dread sentence was executed on the bridge in front of\r\nNorwich Castle on the morning of Saturday, April 21st, in the presence of\r\nmany thousands of spectators.  The unhappy man remained impenitent to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nLeading Events (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT this time the two parties in the council became nearly equal in\r\nnumbers, and the Liberals found a difficulty in selecting a mayor and\r\nsheriff every year from their own party.  They accordingly proposed that\r\neach party should nominate a mayor and sheriff alternately.  In 1848 S.\r\nBignold, Esq., was nominated a second time, and elected unanimously to\r\nserve the office of mayor.  From that time to the present the chief\r\nmagistrate and the sheriff have been selected from each party\r\nalternately.  This has also led to the members of the various committees\r\nbeing selected so as to represent all parties fairly, and the former\r\nexclusive system has been discontinued.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1850.  In 1850, in consequence of a memorial to the General Board of\r\nHealth, established under the (1848) Public Health Act, Mr. Lee, a civil\r\nengineer and government inspector, came to Norwich and commenced an\r\ninquiry respecting the sanitary state of the city.  The inquiry lasted a\r\nfortnight, and Mr. Lee heard evidence given by all the officials and\r\nother parties.  He afterwards prepared a very elaborate report, showing\r\nthat the supply of water was insufficient, that the drainage was\r\ndefective, and that many causes of preventible disease existed.  He\r\nadvised the application of the Public Health Act, which was ultimately\r\ndone.  A company had been previously formed with a large capital, and had\r\nconstructed works for the supply of water from the river Wensum to all\r\nparts of the city.  The abundant supply of pure water proved very\r\nbeneficial to the health of the inhabitants, and entirely relieved the\r\nLocal Board of Health from all trouble on that point, and they had only\r\nto contract for the supply of water to water the roads and streets during\r\nthe summer months.\r\n\r\nIn January of this year Jenny Lind gave two concerts in St. Andrew’s\r\nHall, which was quite filled, at high prices, by fashionable audiences,\r\nmore than 2000 being present at each concert.  The proceeds, amounting to\r\n£1253, were generously given by the celebrated songstress for the\r\nfoundation of the Jenny Lind Infirmary for Children in Pottergate Street.\r\nIt was established in 1853, and visited by the Queen of Song in 1856,\r\nwhen she was so much pleased with the management that she added £50 to\r\nher former gifts.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1851.  The Great Exhibition of 1851, which was opened in May, attracted\r\nthousands of the citizens to London, where many of them spent weeks in\r\nviewing the wonders at the Crystal Palace.  Norwich manufacturers sent\r\nmany specimens of their shawls and textile fabrics.  Amongst the\r\nexhibitors were Messrs C. and F. Bolingbroke and Jones; Messrs. Middleton\r\nand Answorth; Messrs. Towler, Rowling, and Allen; Messrs. Willett and\r\nNephew; Messrs. Clabburn, Sons, and Crisp; and Messrs. Grout and Co.; all\r\nof whose productions were much admired and commended.  A very large\r\nnumber of our operatives were conveyed by special train free to London to\r\nsee the Exhibition, where they had an opportunity of inspecting the best\r\nproductions of art of the whole world.  This wonderful exhibition was\r\nsupposed to be the harbinger of universal peace, but it was soon followed\r\nby the Russian war, which greatly depressed the trade of the city and of\r\nthe whole country.  It cost about a hundred millions of money, destroyed\r\nthousands of brave soldiers, and spread a general gloom over the minds of\r\nmen.  It ended in the fall of Sebastopol, and the triumph of the allied\r\narmies.  Russian aggression was stopped for a time; but was the rotten\r\nTurkish empire worth the waste of men and money?\r\n\r\nThe census, which was taken in this year, showed that the population of\r\nNorwich had increased to 68,713 persons who were in a comparatively\r\nprosperous condition, for trade was good and provisions were cheap.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1853.  On November 1st, S. Bignold, Esq., was elected mayor of Norwich\r\nfor the third time, and he filled the office with great approbation\r\nthroughout the year.  He lent the money required in the first instance\r\nfor the new building erected for the Free Library and the School of Art,\r\nand which afforded additional accommodation for the Museum and Literary\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1854.  At a meeting of the corporation held on May 4th, the mayor, S.\r\nBignold, Esq., in the chair, he announced that Her Majesty had been\r\ngraciously pleased on the previous day to confer the honour of knighthood\r\nupon him, on the occasion of his presenting the addresses, voted by the\r\ncouncil on the 20th of April last, pledging their loyalty to the Queen\r\nwhen Her Majesty declared war against Russia.  It was thereupon resolved\r\nunanimously, on the motion of A. A. H. Beckwith, Esq.\r\n\r\n    “That this council beg to offer their hearty congratulations to Sir\r\n    S. Bignold, the mayor of Norwich, on his accession to the dignity\r\n    which Her Majesty has graciously bestowed upon him, and wish him many\r\n    years to enjoy the honour so worthily conferred.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1856.  The New Cemetery was opened by the Board of Health, and the east\r\nside of it was consecrated by the bishop.  The other side was assigned to\r\nthe Nonconformists.  Since then about 20,000 bodies have been interred in\r\nthe spacious area of thirty-five acres next the Earlham Road.  The\r\ngrounds have been well laid out and planted with trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1857.  The Yare Preservation and Anglers’ Society was founded, for the\r\nimprovement of the angling in the rivers Wensum and Yare.  This society\r\nhas done good service for the lovers of angling on the two rivers, which\r\nformerly abounded with fish near Norwich.  But on account of the\r\npollution of the stream, anglers are obliged to go down as far as Coldham\r\nHall or Cantley to fish with any prospect of success.\r\n\r\nThe Russian war having been brought to a close, peace was celebrated here\r\nwith great rejoicings and illuminations.  Major General Windham, “the\r\nhero of the Redan,” visited the city, and a grand banquet was given to\r\nhim in St. Andrew’s Hall, where he delivered an eloquent address on the\r\nevents of the war and its successful termination.\r\n\r\nIn August the annual congress of the British Archæological Association\r\nmet in Norwich.  Meetings were held in the Guildhall, St. Andrew’s Hall,\r\nthe Public Library, and other buildings.  Addresses were delivered by\r\nProfessor Willis, Mr. Britton, and many other gentlemen.  The members and\r\nfriends visited the Cathedral, where Professor Willis gave a description\r\nof the edifice.  They also made excursions to Ely, Dereham, Binham,\r\nWalsingham, and other places of interest.  On their return to Norwich\r\nthey dined together at the Swan Inn.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1858.  The Local Government Act came into operation, and gave the\r\ncorporation full power to carry out all necessary improvements.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1859.  On November 19th, the Norwich Battalion of Volunteers was formally\r\nenrolled, 300 strong, in three companies, under the command of Colonel\r\nBrett, a highly-esteemed officer.  The other officers were, Capt.\r\nMiddleton of the first company, Capt. H. S. Patteson of the second\r\ncompany, and Captain Hay Gurney of the third company.  The force\r\ngradually increased in number till the battalion became 530 strong, in\r\nsix companies.  Colonel Brett resigned on account of ill health, and\r\nColonel Black was appointed to the chief command; next to him Major\r\nPatteson; Capt. Henry Morgan first company, Capt. John Steward second,\r\nCapt. Peter Hansell third, Capt. Charles Foster fourth, Capt. J. B.\r\nMorgan fifth, Capt. E. Field sixth; Lieut. H. Pulley, Quarter Master;\r\nJohn Friar Clarke, Quarter Master Sergeant; T. W. Crosse, Surgeon; Rev.\r\nF. Meyrick, Chaplain.  The corporation subsequently granted a piece of\r\nland at the north-west corner of Chapel Field, and a company of\r\nshareholders built the Drill Hall for the use of the members of the\r\ncorps, which has the reputation of being very efficient.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1861.  A meeting was held on January 10th to consider the best means of\r\nrelieving the distress which had for some time prevailed, owing to the\r\ndepression of trade; and within a month, more than £4,000 were raised for\r\nthe relief of the poor.  Since then the weavers have gradually found\r\nemployment in some other branches of industry, especially the boot and\r\nshoe manufacture, which has greatly increased.  Hundreds of operatives\r\nare also employed in iron manufactures, and in making machines for\r\nagricultural and horticultural purposes.\r\n\r\nThis year a census of the population was taken, showing a great increase,\r\nthe total number being 74,891 persons, viz., males, 33,863; females,\r\n41,028.  Inhabited houses, 17,112; uninhabited houses, 739; building,\r\n103.\r\n\r\nThe parishes within the city, together with their respective population\r\nin 1861 and their real property in 1860, were as follows:—\r\n\r\nAll Saints                      667     £2,280\r\nSt. Andrew                      978      7,828\r\nSt. Augustine                 1,890      4,281\r\nSt. Benedict                  1,381      1,869\r\nSt. Clement                   3,961      7,554\r\nEarlham                         195      1,845\r\nEaton St. Andrew                930      8,759\r\nSt. Edmund                      753      1,706\r\nSt. Etheldred                   614      1,559\r\nSt. George Colegate           1,607      4,983\r\nSt. George Tombland             687      4,865\r\nSt. Giles                     1,586      6,391\r\nSt. Gregory                     934      4,936\r\nHeigham                      13,894     36,799\r\nSt. Helen                       507        901\r\nSt. James                     3,408      5,384\r\nSt. John’s Maddermarket         537      4,959\r\nSt. John Sepulchre            2,219      4,452\r\nSt. John Timberhill           1,302      2,496\r\nSt. Julian                    1,361      3,142\r\nLakenham                      4,866     15,745\r\nSt. Lawrence                    877      2,421\r\nSt. Margaret                    664      1,608\r\nSt. Martin at Oak             2,546      3,789\r\nSt. Martin at Palace          1,085      3,267\r\nSt. Mary Coslany              1,498      3,081\r\nSt. Mary in the Marsh           451      4,289\r\nSt. Michael Coslany           1,365      3,052\r\nSt. Michael at Plea             379      3,504\r\nSt. Michael at Thorn          2,121      4,617\r\nSt. Paul                      2,907      4,391\r\nSt. Peter Hungate               399      1,105\r\nSt. Peter Mancroft            2,575     22,615\r\nSt. Peter Mountergate         2,868      7,567\r\nSt. Peter Southgate             457      3,337\r\nSt. Saviour                   1,532      3,805\r\nSt. Simon and St. Jude          283      1,221\r\nSt. Stephen                   4,191     15,321\r\nSt. Swithin                     699      2,174\r\n\r\nThere are also within the city jurisdiction the hamlet of Hellesdon,\r\npopulation 393, belonging to Hellesdon parish; Thorpe hamlet, population\r\n2,388, belonging to the parish of Thorpe St. Andrew; Trowse Millgate,\r\nCarrow, and Bracondale, population 687, belonging to Trowse parish;\r\npopulation 249, extra parochial.

In 1862 the Great Exhibition in London afforded some of our city\r\nmanufacturers another opportunity of exhibiting their productions, and\r\nmaking known the skill of our artisans.  Messrs. Clabburn, Son, and Crisp\r\nwon the gold medal for their superfine fillover shawls, which are made by\r\na patented process, so as to display a perfect design on each side.\r\nMessrs. C. and F. Bolingbroke and Jones gained a medal for their poplins\r\nand poplinettes.  The shawls of Messrs. Towler, Rowling, and Allen\r\nobtained honourable mention.  So much for what are usually regarded as\r\nthe staple products of Norwich.  But Norwich won for itself the\r\nadmiration of the world in some other matters.  Messrs. Barnard and\r\nBishop, for instance, were spoken of far and wide for their splendid park\r\ngates in ornamental wrought iron, which were subsequently purchased and\r\npresented to the Prince of Wales, and now adorn one of the entrances to\r\nHis Royal Highness’s park at Sandringham.  Of course also Messrs. Colman\r\ntook high prizes for their world-renowned mustard and starch—the medal\r\ngiven them for mustard being the only medal granted in the United Kingdom\r\nfor this article of commerce.  As publishers, Messrs. Jarrold and Sons\r\nreceived honourable mention for their educational works, and publications\r\nof high moral excellence.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1863.  H. S. Patteson, Esq., was mayor in 1863, when on March 10th the\r\ncitizens again displayed their enthusiastic loyalty by processions,\r\nilluminations, balls, &c., on the occasion of the marriage of the Prince\r\nand Princess of Wales.  Their Royal Highnesses have made themselves very\r\npopular in this county, by living part of the year at Sandringham, and\r\nparticipating in all the festivities and amusements of the gentry and\r\ninhabitants.  On the occasion of the marriage of their Royal Highnesses,\r\nseven of the principal manufacturing firms presented, through the\r\ncorporation to the Princess Alexandra, specimens of the elegant fabrics\r\nfor which Norwich has so long been famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this year the Court of Guardians of this city obtained a new act of\r\nparliament for an improved management of the poor, and repealing all\r\nformer acts.  Under the new act the present Board of Guardians is\r\nconstituted with a reduced number of guardians, and the whole management\r\nis more in accordance with the New Poor Law system.  Norwich is now a\r\nunion of parishes, divided into districts, each having medical\r\nattendants.  By this new act all former acts, including the Norwich Small\r\nTenements Act of 1847, were repealed, and the city was brought under the\r\noperation of the General Poor Law, and all other statute and laws from\r\ntime to time in force with respect to the poor in England.  The union is\r\nnow divided into sixteen districts, viz.:—\r\n\r\n1.  St. Peter Mountergate, St. George of Tombland.\r\n\r\n2.  St. Mary in the Marsh, St. Martin at Palace, St. Helen, St. Michael\r\nat Plea.\r\n\r\n3.  St. Peter Hungate, St. Simon and Jude, St. Andrew.\r\n\r\n4.  St. John Maddermarket, St. Gregory, St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n5.  St. Margaret, St. Swithin, St. Benedict, St. Giles.\r\n\r\n6.  South Heigham. 7.  North Heigham.\r\n\r\n8.  St. Peter Mancroft.\r\n\r\n9.  St. Stephen and the Town Close.\r\n\r\n10.  Eaton, Earlham, and Hellesdon.\r\n\r\n11.  St. John Sepulchre, St. Michael at Thorn, St. John Timberhill, and\r\nAll Saints.\r\n\r\n12.  Trowse, Carrow, Bracondale, St. Peter Southgate, St. Julian, and St.\r\nEtheldred.\r\n\r\n13.  Lakenham.\r\n\r\n14.  Thorpe, Pockthorpe, St. Paul, and St. James.\r\n\r\n15.  St. Saviour, St. Clement, St. Edmund, St. George.\r\n\r\n16.  St. Michael at Coslany, St. Mary at Coslany, St. Martin at Oak, St.\r\nAugustine.\r\n\r\nThe board consists of forty-two guardians, elected for the sixteen\r\ndistricts as follows:—\r\n\r\nFor each of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, eleventh, and\r\ntwelfth districts, two guardians; for each of the sixth, seventh, ninth,\r\nthirteenth, fourteenth, and sixteenth districts, three guardians; for the\r\neighth district five guardians.  For the purpose of this act with respect\r\nto the limits of the palace of the bishop of Norwich, the same are deemed\r\nto be locally situated within the parish of St. Mary in the Marsh.\r\n\r\nThe following are the qualifications for voting in the election of\r\nguardians:—\r\n\r\nA.  Occupiers of rateable property who respectively are rated in respect\r\nthereof on a gross assessment of ten pounds and upwards.\r\n\r\nB.  Owners of rateable property, who respectively are rated in respect\r\nthereof on a net assessment of ten pounds or upwards.  Provided, that\r\nwhere two or more persons are jointly rated, one only of them shall be\r\nentitled to vote, and in every case the rating shall have been in the\r\nlast two rates, each made at least two months before the day of election,\r\nand in respect of property in the district in which the person votes, and\r\nthe rates shall have been paid at least fourteen days before the day of\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nAt every election of guardians the rate-payers voting have votes in\r\naccordance with the following scale:—\r\n\r\nA.  If rated at £10 and under £25, one vote.\r\n\r\nB.  If rated at £25 and under £50, two votes.\r\n\r\nC.  If rated at £50 and under £75, three votes.\r\n\r\nD.  If rated at £75 and under £100, four votes.\r\n\r\nE.  If rated at £100 and under £150, five votes.\r\n\r\nF.  If rated at £150 or upwards, six votes.\r\n\r\nAnd no rate-payer at any election of guardians for any one and the same\r\ndistrict have more than six votes.\r\n\r\nAll the compounding provisions of the act were abolished by the Reform\r\nAct of 1867.\r\n\r\nThe old court of guardians had the management of lunatic paupers, who\r\nwere maintained in an asylum in St. Augustine’s.  Great care appears to\r\nhave been taken of them, and many of them were cured, more in proportion\r\nthan in any other town.  Nevertheless, the lunacy commissioners who\r\nvisited the asylum reported that the place was unhealthy and unfit for\r\nlunatics, and recommended, or rather demanded that a new asylum should be\r\nbuilt in a more healthy situation.  This the old court of guardians\r\nconsidered to be quite unnecessary, and the whole matter was transferred\r\nto the council under the Lunatic Asylums Act of 1853, that body having\r\nthe option of taking the matter in hand.  The council, already\r\nover-loaded with municipal business, Board of Health business, drainage,\r\npaving, lighting, watering the roads, &c., actually undertook the\r\nmanagement of the lunatic paupers, in 1863.  After many discussions a\r\nmajority of the members decided that a new asylum was unnecessary, and\r\nrefused to build one.  The Lunacy Commissioners, however, made a strong\r\nreport to the Secretary of State on the subject, who sent down an order\r\nto the council to build an asylum.  Since then land has been purchased\r\nfor its site, which is likely to cost from £30,000 to £40,000!\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1864.  In 1864 the operatives made a very laudable effort to improve\r\ntheir depressed condition by establishing an “Industrial Weavers’\r\nCo-operative Society,” and held many meetings to promote that object.\r\nThe Rev. C. Caldwell, and other gentlemen, advocated their cause.  The\r\nsociety was supported by donations, and J. H. Gurney, Esq., advanced a\r\nsum which had been left by his father for the benefit of the weavers, the\r\nprincipal with interest amounting to £1100.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1865.  The Norfolk Chamber of Agriculture was instituted, and frequent\r\nmeetings of the members have been held at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich.\r\nThe objects of the chamber are to watch over all measures affecting\r\nagriculture both in and out of parliament, to co-operate with the General\r\nChamber thereon, and to take such action as may be for the benefit of\r\nagriculturists.  At the meetings of the members interesting questions\r\nhave been discussed, and C. S. Read, Esq., M.P. for East Norfolk, has\r\ngenerally presided, and given much valuable information.\r\n\r\nThe most important event in this diocese of late years was the holding of\r\na Church Congress in Norwich.  A preliminary meeting to consider the\r\nproposal was held in the Clerical Rooms on Saturday, December 10th, 1864.\r\nWhen this was announced there was no little apprehension in Low Church\r\ncircles, but the proposal was approved by most of the clergy, and they\r\nrequested the Lord Bishop to preside over the Congress, which was held in\r\nOctober, 1865.  After some delay his lordship reluctantly consented, and\r\nnever before was there such a gathering of clergy in the city.  St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall was filled every day for a week in October, 1865.  High\r\nchurchmen throughout the country made it a point of duty to attend the\r\ncongress; and the proceedings at the daily meetings were of a very\r\ninteresting character to churchmen generally.  Addresses were delivered\r\nevery day on very important subjects; and the bible history was ably\r\nvindicated against the objections of geologists and freethinkers.  The\r\nchurch as an establishment was well defended by her champions.  Three\r\nlocal newspapers were published daily, containing full reports of the\r\nproceedings.  Dr. Pusey read a discourse of great interest in defence of\r\nthe Old Testament narratives.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n1866.\r\nTHE ROYAL VISIT TO NORWICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November the Prince and Princess of Wales travelled from their seat at\r\nSandringham to Cossey on a visit to Lord and Lady Stafford, who\r\nentertained their Royal Highnesses in a princely style.  Their Royal\r\nHighnesses, during their sojourn at Cossey, visited this city, entering\r\nby way of the Dereham Road and St. Giles’ Road, and passing under\r\ntriumphal arches amid the acclamations of thousands of the citizens, it\r\nbeing a general holiday.  They stopped at the Guildhall and received an\r\naddress from the corporation.  Then they proceeded to St. Andrew’s Hall\r\nand attended a morning concert of the musical festival.  Their Royal\r\nHighnesses, on leaving the hall, rode along the principal streets,\r\nthrough the Market Place, and up St. Stephen’s to the Chapel Field, where\r\nthey were joyously received by the Manchester Unity of Odd Fellows, and\r\nwhere they planted two trees in memory of their visit.  Their Royal\r\nHighnesses thence proceeded to the new Drill Hall, which the Prince of\r\nWales formally opened.  After this ceremony their Royal Highnesses\r\nreturned to Cossey Hall.  They were accompanied by the Queen of Denmark\r\n(mother of the Princess of Wales), and by Prince Alfred (the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh).  In the evening the city was brilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1867.  The Norwich Industrial Exhibition was held for six weeks, from\r\nAugust 15th till October 20th, 1867, in St. Andrew’s Hall.  About 1000\r\nexhibitors sent specimens of works of art and useful articles, which\r\nquite filled the hall.  Hundreds of splendid paintings were lent for the\r\noccasion, and the show attracted many thousands of visitors.  The\r\nindustrial part of the exhibition was most creditable to the working men\r\nof Norwich, many of whom gained medals and money prizes for the best\r\nspecimens of useful and ornamental articles.  The mayor, F. E. Watson,\r\nEsq., distributed the prizes on November 5th.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1868.  The great event of the year 1868 was the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science in the city.  It commenced on\r\nAugust 19th and continued till the 26th.  The old city was filled with\r\ndistinguished visitors from all parts of Europe; and the hotels, inns,\r\nand lodging houses were crowded with strangers.  Norwich gave a\r\nhospitable welcome to the Society.  Dr. Hooker, who by association and\r\ndescent is a Norfolk man, delivered the inaugural address.  The various\r\nscientific sections held daily meetings at different public places.  The\r\nproceedings were reported in daily issues of the _Norfolk News_ and the\r\n_Norfolk Chronicle_, and also in the regular issues of the _Norwich\r\nMercury_.\r\n\r\nOn November the 9th, J. J. Colman, Esq., retired from the office of\r\nmayor, and E. K. Harvey, Esq., was elected as his successor; John\r\nRobison, Esq., was at the same time chosen as sheriff, as successor to\r\nRobert Fitch, Esq.  As this is the last act of the council which we shall\r\nhave to chronicle, we take the opportunity of adding a few words on the\r\npresent state of the corporation.  By the Municipal Reform Act all\r\nprevious charters remain in force, except so far as they are rendered\r\ninconsistent with the provisions of that act, and the city is now divided\r\ninto eight wards, and incorporated under the style or title of the\r\n“Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the city and borough of Norwich.”  The\r\ncorporate body consists of sixteen aldermen and forty-eight councillors.\r\nThe mayor is chosen annually on the 9th of November from the members of\r\nthe council, who also on the same day choose the sheriff from the same\r\nbody, or from persons qualified to vote for councillors, and who are\r\neligible to the office of councillor.  The members of the council are\r\nchosen annually on November 1st by the inhabitant householders of three\r\nyears’ successive occupation, the freemen having been disfranchised for\r\nmunicipal purposes.  The aldermen are elected by the council, and go out\r\nof office every three years.  Committees of the council are appointed for\r\nconducting the business of the corporate body.  The corporation is\r\npossessed of various estates, tolls, and dues, the profits and proceeds\r\nof which are placed to the Borough Fund, under the act, and are applied\r\ntowards the reduction of the rates levied on the citizens.  Several large\r\nestates which were in the hands of the corporation for charitable\r\npurposes are now vested in charity trustees.  The corporation still pay\r\nfee farm rents to the crown, over £100 yearly.  There is in trust of the\r\ncorporation an estate of 112 acres, situated outside of St. Stephen’s\r\nGate, called the “Town Close,” on which the burgesses had the right of\r\ncommonage formerly, but in lieu of which right the freemen receive a few\r\nshillings yearly.  The meetings of the corporation are held in the\r\nCouncil Chamber in the Guildhall almost every fortnight for the despatch\r\nof business, and meetings of the committees are held almost daily.  The\r\nbody corporate, as a Council and Board of Health, levies rates as we have\r\nalready said to the amount of £45,000 yearly.  The Board of Guardians\r\nsits in the same room, and raises by poor rates about £30,000 yearly,\r\nmaking the local taxation amount to £75,000 per annum.  The City Police\r\nand Fire Brigade, under direction of Mr. R. Hitchman, the chief\r\nconstable, occupy the basement of the Guildhall.  The force, comprising\r\nnearly a hundred men, is considered to be very efficient.\r\n\r\nThis year an extensive scheme was begun for an effective drainage of the\r\ncity.  We subjoin a brief history of the proceedings which led to this\r\nmovement, and take the opportunity at the same time of giving some\r\ndetails as to the general operations of the Local Board of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW DRAINAGE SCHEME.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long ago as 1862, complaints were made of the impurity of the river in\r\nconsequence of all the sewage of the city and of all the water closets\r\nbeing poured into the stream.  In 1863, many inhabitants of Thorpe became\r\nurgent in their demands that some immediate steps should be taken to\r\ndivert the sewage from the river, but this was more easily asked than\r\ndone.  The Board of Health, however, requested their then surveyor (Mr.\r\nBarry) to report on the subject; and subsequently Mr. Bazalgette visited\r\nNorwich and surveyed the stream.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1865 Mr. Bazalgette’s report was received.  It\r\nrecommended a plan of conveying the sewage through main drains to Crown\r\nPoint to irrigate the land there.  The board discussed the report and\r\nappointed a sewerage committee, who entered into negotiations with R. J.\r\nH. Harvey, Esq., M.P., for irrigating part of his estate at Crown Point.\r\nMr. Harvey was to pay the cost of preparing the land for irrigation, and\r\nthe annual cost of pumping; but after a preliminary notice had been given\r\nof the intention of the board to apply for an act of parliament, the\r\nboard determined not to proceed at that time with the application for the\r\nact.\r\n\r\nThe board subsequently entered into contract with Mr. Hope, of London, to\r\nsell him the sewage for thirty years; and the necessary works were\r\nordered to be commenced on March 20th, 1866.  The board, however, being\r\npressed by a strong opposition to the scheme, in a few days afterwards\r\nrescinded the contract.  In consequence of this, proceedings in chancery\r\nwere commenced, and an injunction was ultimately obtained.\r\n\r\nOn May 31st, 1866, the board resolved, “That it is absolutely needful at\r\nonce to take measures to divert the sewage from the river.”  Negotiations\r\nwere entered into for the hire of part of the Crown Point estate, the\r\nagreement for which was confirmed by the board on July 10th, 1866.  By\r\nthis agreement the board took on lease 1290 acres of land at Crown Point,\r\nat £3 5s. per acre, for thirty years—the whole sewage of the city to be\r\nconveyed to Trowse and pumped over the land.  Many objections were made\r\nto this measure, that the rent was too high, and that the experiment\r\nwould prove a failure.  Pursuant, however, to a resolution of the board,\r\npassed on October 9th, in the same year, the committee took the necessary\r\nsteps to obtain an act of parliament, and did obtain it in June, 1867.\r\n\r\nAfter the act was obtained, Mr. Morant, the city engineer, by direction\r\nof the committee, proceeded with the preparation of the necessary\r\ndrawings and specifications for the drainage works, and by order of the\r\nboard the following contracts were entered into, namely:—\r\n\r\n                                                                £\r\n1.     For the steam engines (with Mr. John Clayton of            6435\r\n       Preston)\r\n2.     For iron pipes (the Staveley Coal and Iron                 3500\r\n       Company)\r\n3.     For laying such pipes (Mr. John Downing of                  549\r\n       Norwich)\r\n4.     For the erection of engine houses (Mr. Daniel              6988\r\n       Balls of Norwich)\r\n5.     For the construction of the main intercepting            28,830\r\n       sewers (Mr. Thomas Wainwright of London)\r\n6.     The ground for the pumping works was purchased for         2000\r\n                                                               £48,302\r\n\r\nOther sums are required for constructing drains, sewers, penstock\r\nchamber, and other subsidiary works, and the entire scheme is proposed to\r\nbe carried out under the sanction of the act of Parliament, at the\r\nestimated cost of £60,000.\r\n\r\nA very powerful opposition was raised against the scheme.  A memorial,\r\nvery numerously signed, was presented to the board of health against it.\r\nPublic meetings were held at which the whole thing was condemned as\r\nunnecessary, expensive, and likely to be a failure.  Eventually, after\r\nmuch discussion, with a large minority against it, and in opposition to\r\nthe opinions of the citizens expressed in common hall, the board resolved\r\nto carry out the scheme, and the works are now in progress.  The general\r\nplan is to construct two main drains, one on each side of the river\r\nWensum, to intercept the sewage and to carry it to Trowse, where a\r\npumping station has been erected, and engines will be set to work to pump\r\nall the sewage over the land hired at Crown Point estate.\r\n\r\nThe drainage expenditure, though so enormous, has been only a part of the\r\nexpenditure of the board, upon which the duty falls of repairing all the\r\nstreets and roads, lighting, watering, &c.  In the first half year of\r\n1867, the estimated expenditure was as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                  £      _s._   _d._\r\nRepairs to streets and roads       2008      7      0\r\nLighting the same                  1776     11      9\r\nSalaries                            442      1      5\r\nSundries                            475      5      6\r\nInterest on loans                  1336     16      0\r\nInterest on bonds                   372      0      0\r\n                                  £6411      1      8\r\n\r\nTwice that sum would be £12,822 3s. 4d. for the year, quite irrespective\r\nof the drainage works.\r\n\r\nThe annual abstract of the accounts of the board issued in 1867, shows\r\nthe receipts and payments from September 1st, 1866, to September 1st,\r\n1867.  The receipts amounted to £15,873 3s. 6d., the payments to £15,323\r\n18s. 2d., which sum included £1204 16s. 7d. sewage expenses, (chiefly law\r\ncharges).  Of course the receipts were derived almost entirely from the\r\nhalf-yearly rates.  The expenditure included £3314 9s. 8d. for interest,\r\nthe rest being for repairs to streets and roads, paving, lighting,\r\nsewerage works, salaries, &c.\r\n\r\nMr. Morant, the present able engineer to the Board of Health, made his\r\nfirst annual report in May, 1867, and showed the expenditure in his\r\ndepartment for the year preceding April 5th, 1867, to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n                      £      _s._   _d._\r\nRepairs to roads       2192      4     11\r\nPaving                  870      0      0\r\nSewers                  576      2      2\r\nUrinals                  86     13      0\r\n                      £3725      0      1\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s next report was for the year ending April 5th, 1868, and\r\nwas divided into three heads.  Repairs to roads; repairs to paving; and\r\nrepairs to sewers.  First with respect to roads.  The cost of the\r\nmacadamised roads had been £2329 12s. 7d., being an increase of £137 7s.\r\n8d.  Some new roads had been taken by the board, and were repaired and\r\ncleansed, and all the roads were stated to be in good order.  Second,\r\nwith respect to paving.  The expenditure had been £1088 8s. 10d., being\r\nan increase of £218 13s., but a part of the Market Place had been newly\r\npaved with granite at a cost of £216.  Third, with respect to the sewers.\r\nThe cost of repairs, &c., had been £546 5s. 5d., being a decrease of £29\r\n16s. 9d.\r\n\r\nSince 1850 the annals of the city consist chiefly of proceedings of the\r\ncorporation as a council or Board of Health.  Meetings have been held\r\nalmost every fortnight for the transaction of public business, which has\r\nbeen largely increased.  The proceedings of one single year, even if\r\nsummarised, would fill a volume.  The corporation has levied rates to the\r\namount of £45,000 yearly! and the expenditure has been of equal amount.\r\nThis has been caused by many public improvements, by widening old streets\r\nand opening new ones, and by the extension of the area of the Cattle\r\nMarket.\r\n\r\nMr. Morant gives the following account of the drainage works:\r\n\r\n    “The drainage of the city of Norwich flows into the river at numerous\r\n    places, as is commonly the case; it is the object of the new works\r\n    now in progress to intercept all the old sewers, to prevent the\r\n    sewage flowing into the river, and to convey it to one point.  For\r\n    this purpose several deep sewers are being constructed, varying in\r\n    size from 18 inches in diameter to 6 feet high by 4 feet wide, of\r\n    oval shape.\r\n\r\n    “The point selected for the pumping station is between the railway at\r\n    Trowse Station and the river Yare; and a large piece of garden ground\r\n    has been purchased, and engine and boilerhouses, workshops, &c., have\r\n    been erected.  Adjoining the engine-well are the grating tank and\r\n    penstock chamber, and with these the principal main sewer\r\n    communicates.  This sewer, which is 6 ft by 4 ft., is intended to be\r\n    carried under the bottom of Bracondale, Carrow Hill, and along King\r\n    Street to near Messrs. Morgan’s brewery, where it will receive the\r\n    high-level sewer.  This sewer will be from 30 ft. to 80 ft. below the\r\n    surface of the ground.  From this point it will be 5 ft. 3 in. by 3\r\n    ft. 6 in., and will be continued along King Street to the top of Rose\r\n    Lane; here one branch will turn off to the right under Rose Lane,\r\n    beneath the bottom of the river near Foundry Bridge, under the towing\r\n    path, to beyond Bishopgate Bridge, where it will unite with the\r\n    present outfall sewer, and receive the whole of the drainage of the\r\n    northern portion of the city.  From Rose Lane the main will continue\r\n    to Tombland, where a branch will extend to Bishopgate Bridge, with\r\n    subsidiary branches to Quay Side, &c.; it will then turn to the left\r\n    under Prince’s Street, St. Andrews Broad Street, Charing Cross, and\r\n    Lower Westwick Street, and will unite with the present sewer emptying\r\n    itself at the New Mills.\r\n\r\n    “From the end of the principal main near Messrs. Morgan’s in King\r\n    Street the high-level sewer will commence with a flight of granite\r\n    steps, about 30 feet in height, and continue 4 ft. 6 in. by 3 ft.,\r\n    gradually reducing, and carried under King Street to Rose Lane,\r\n    across the Bull Ring, where it will be about 44 feet below the\r\n    surface, under Opie Street, Bedford Street, Pottergate Street, West\r\n    Pottergate Street, Mill Hill, Rose Valley, Mount Pleasant, Town Close\r\n    Road to Ipswich Road, and will provide for the sewage of a very large\r\n    district hitherto entirely undrained.\r\n\r\n    “Self-acting Storm Overflows are provided at several convenient\r\n    points, and also numerous shafts for access to, and ventilation of,\r\n    the sewers.  At the pumping station at Trowse the sewage, after\r\n    passing through gratings to prevent sticks and other substances from\r\n    choking the pump valves, will pass into the engine-well, from whence\r\n    it will be pumped through cast-iron pipes 20 inches in diameter, laid\r\n    under the Kirby Road to near the cross road leading to the Bungay\r\n    Road, and then be led in a main conduit across the centre of the land\r\n    hired by the Board, and by means of small feeders to every part of\r\n    the farm.\r\n\r\n    “The steam engines will be three in number, and of the kind known as\r\n    condensing rotative beam engines, with steam cylinders of 35 in.\r\n    diameter and 6 ft. stroke.  Each engine will be provided with a high\r\n    lift pump connected with the pumping main, and also with a low lift\r\n    pump; the object of the low lift pumps is to enable the rain water to\r\n    be pumped into the overflow sewer in time of heavy storms, when the\r\n    sewage is so greatly diluted as to be little more than soiled water;\r\n    the first scouring of the sewers will be pumped by the high lift\r\n    pumps on to the land.\r\n\r\n    “Four boilers, each 27 ft. 6 in. long and 7 ft. diameter, with two\r\n    flues, are provided to produce the steam necessary for working the\r\n    engines, and the chimney shaft to remove the smoke is 140 feet in\r\n    height.\r\n\r\n    “The foundation of the engine had to be carried down 29 feet below\r\n    the surface, and much difficulty was found in getting in the walls on\r\n    account of the force of the springs, the bottom being 22 feet below\r\n    the water level in the adjoining river, and from the same cause\r\n    considerable difficulty is met with in driving the tunnels for the\r\n    sewers.  In Trowse for example, the soil proved to be running sand\r\n    and mud, which was very troublesome to overcome; the same soil exists\r\n    under Rose Lane, Foundry Bridge, and Bishopgate Street, but nearly\r\n    everywhere else the tunnels will be in the chalk.\r\n\r\n    “Irrigation by sewage is no doubt quite in its infancy, but from the\r\n    very satisfactory results arrived at at Barking, Croydon, Norwood,\r\n    Edinburgh, Banbury, Rugby, and other places, there is good reason to\r\n    hope that eventually the Board’s Sewage Farm at Crown Point will\r\n    prove a success.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nNorwich Musical Festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the year 1824, musical festivals have been held in this city\r\ntriennially, for the benefit, originally, of the hospitals, and lately of\r\nvarious other charities also, and for the promotion of musical science.\r\nThese celebrations have been so successful on the whole that the total\r\nsurplus receipts over the expenditure have amounted to more than £10,000.\r\nWorks of the greatest composers have been well performed by the most\r\neminent instrumentalists and vocalists of the day, and thereby a taste\r\nfor music has been diffused throughout the city and county.\r\n\r\nThe patrons of the festivals have included the Queen, the late Prince\r\nConsort, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duchess of Kent, the\r\nDuchess of Cambridge, the Duke of Cambridge, the Princess Mary of\r\nCambridge, the Duke of Wellington, the Marquis of Lothian, the Earl of\r\nRoseberry, the Earl of Gosford, the Earl of Orford, Lord W. Powlett, Lord\r\nStanley, Lord Walsingham, Lord Wodehouse, and many others of the\r\nnobility.  The committee of management have included the Lord Lieutenant\r\nof the county, the Earl of Albemarle, Lord Ranelagh, Lord Sondes, Lord\r\nHastings, Lord Stafford, Lord Suffield, Lord Bayning, Hon. W. C. W. Coke,\r\nHon. H. Walpole, Hon. W. Jerningham, Sir J. P. Boileau, Bart., Sir W.\r\nFoster, Bart., Sir S. Bignold, and others.\r\n\r\nThe first musical performance for charitable purposes is said to have\r\nbeen on the anniversary of the Sons of the Clergy, in 1709; some fifteen\r\nyears after which period, the meeting of the three choirs of Gloucester,\r\nHereford, and Worcester, was instituted, those cathedral cities sending\r\ntheir choristers to each place in alternate years.  These early music\r\nmeetings, however, were held in the evening, and seem to have been\r\nlimited to the performance of Anthems and the Te Deum.  The first\r\noccasion of an Oratorio having been performed in the morning appears to\r\nhave been at Hereford in 1759, when the Messiah was given.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham Triennial Festival was instituted about the year 1778, and\r\nthat of Norwich, as now held in St. Andrew’s Hall, in 1824, previously to\r\nwhich the Norwich festival consisted of the yearly performance of an\r\nOratorio in the cathedral for the benefit of the Norfolk and Norwich\r\nHospital.  The performances of later years have been on a much grander\r\nscale.  The festivals at Birmingham and Norwich now stand pre-eminent\r\namong provincial musical meetings, both for the excellence of the\r\nperformances, and for the special interest given to the programmes by the\r\nfirst production of new or little-known works.  Among other claims to\r\nhonourable distinction in this respect, it is the chief and will be the\r\nlasting honour to Norwich that Dr. Spohr’s sacred Oratorios were first\r\nperformed here, his earliest production being conducted by himself in\r\nperson before a large audience.\r\n\r\nThe selection of works and music to be performed has always occupied a\r\ngreat deal of the time and attention of the committees, who have made it\r\nan object to bring out some new work at every festival.  Most of Handel’s\r\nbest Oratorios have also been performed, including, of course, the\r\n“Messiah,” which is never omitted from the programme.  Haydn’s “Creation”\r\nand “Seasons” have also been frequently given, while Dr. Spohr’s\r\n“Calvary,” “Fall of Babylon,” and “The Last Judgment.”  Dr. Bexfield’s\r\n“Israel Restored,” Pierson’s “Jerusalem,” and Molique’s “Abraham” were\r\nfirst performed in this city.  The programmes have also included\r\nSterndale Bennett’s “May Queen,” which won all hearts; Benedict’s\r\nbrilliant “Undine,” and many other approved compositions.\r\n\r\nThe committees, acting on the principle of securing the highest talent,\r\nhave generally engaged the best vocal performers whose services were\r\navailable.  In proof of this we need only mention the names of the\r\nfollowing female vocalists:—Madame Viardot Garcia, Madame Caradori Allan,\r\nMadame Clara Novello, Madame Sainton-Dolby, Madame Alboni, Madame\r\nMalibran, Madlle. Tietjens, Madame Patti, Madame Lemmens-Sherrington,\r\nMadame Rudersdorf, Miss Louisa Pyne, Madame Grisi; and among the male\r\nvocal performers may be mentioned Signor Lablache, Herr Formes, Mr.\r\nWeiss, Signor Rubini, Signor Belletti, Signor Morini, Mr. Santley, Mr.\r\nSims Reeves, Mr. Cummings, Signor Gassier, Signor Giuglini, Signor Mario,\r\nMr. Phillips, Mr. Lockey, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Choral Society, comprising 300 members having good voices,\r\naltos, tenors, and basses, has contributed greatly to the success of the\r\nfestivals by the excellence of the choral performances, especially in\r\ngrand Oratorios.  The Choral Society was established in 1824, and had its\r\norigin in the establishment of the musical festivals, Professor Taylor\r\nbeing its chief promoter.  In 1825 the Professor removed to London, and\r\nthe direction of the society was confided to the Rev. R. F. Elwin.  The\r\nmanagement of affairs was entrusted to a committee of twelve, who were\r\nannually elected by ballot at a general meeting.  The practice was held\r\nin the Old Library Room or in St. Andrew’s Hall.  The society has\r\nundergone many changes, but has always maintained its high reputation for\r\nchoral performances.  A memoir of the late Professor Taylor, which\r\nappeared in the _Norfolk News_, contained some information as to the part\r\nhe took in promoting the festivals.  We give the following extracts:—\r\n\r\n    “We learn from the _Quarterly Musical Review_, which was edited by\r\n    the late Mr. R. M. Bacon, that at the Festival of 1824, ‘Mr. Bacon,\r\n    Mr. Taylor (late Professor Taylor), and Mr. Athow, were nominated as\r\n    a committee for the entire conduct of the musical department.’  Vol.\r\n    VI. p. 434.  The same authority says a little further on, ‘Mr. Taylor\r\n    undertook the formation of a Choral Society, which he accomplished\r\n    with a degree of knowledge, skill, and perseverance, that cannot be\r\n    too highly praised.’  Again ‘The musical committee then decided on\r\n    the following vocalists and instrumentalists, &c.’  From all which it\r\n    seems that the triumvirate managed the musical department.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Fitch once wrote to Mr. E. Taylor requesting him to state what\r\n    share he had in the management of the first festival.  The following\r\n    was Mr. Taylor’s reply, dated March 25th, 1847.  ‘When the Norwich\r\n    Festival was resolved on in 1823, I made the entire selection\r\n    (morning and evening).  I engaged every performer; I selected the\r\n    entire band, and I formed and trained the Choral Society.  I have\r\n    done the same for every subsequent festival (until the last, 1845,)\r\n    with the exception of having nothing to do with the Choral Society,\r\n    or any of the country performers.  Every Oratorio brought out (and a\r\n    new one was always brought out) was translated and prepared for\r\n    performance by me.’  These were the following performed for the first\r\n    time here.  ‘The Last Judgment,’ Spohr; ‘The Crucifixion,’ Spohr;\r\n    ‘The Fall of Babylon,’ Spohr; ‘The Deluge,’ Schneider; ‘Redemption,’\r\n    Mozart; ‘The Death of Christ,’ Graun; ‘The Christian’s Prayer,’\r\n    Spohr.\r\n\r\n    “It will be seen by the above how little Mr. E. Taylor left for\r\n    anybody else to do.  Mr. Taylor’s two associates, like the wings on a\r\n    stage sylph, were more for ornament than use.  His statement is\r\n    confirmed by the _Musical Review_, which says, ‘The Hospital Board\r\n    presented to Mr. Taylor a piece of plate, of fifty guineas value, for\r\n    his services in raising and instructing the Choral Society, and for\r\n    his general assistance.’”\r\n\r\nThe memoir before mentioned further states:—\r\n\r\n    “At the Norwich Festival of 1830, Mr. Taylor introduced Spohr’s\r\n    Oratorio of ‘The Last Judgment’ for the first time into this country,\r\n    the words being translated and adapted to the music by Mr. Taylor\r\n    himself.  This was followed at subsequent festivals by other\r\n    oratorios of the same composer, which for originality, richness, and\r\n    beauty, are unrivalled in their way.  After the performance of ‘The\r\n    Last Judgment,’ Mr. Taylor became personally acquainted with Spohr,\r\n    and one day, getting an invitation from Mendelssohn to visit him and\r\n    his family at Dusseldorf on the Rhine, where Spohr then was, the\r\n    invitation was accepted, and thus Mr. Taylor first became known to\r\n    the illustrious composer, with whom he formed a friendship which\r\n    lasted as long as they both lived.\r\n\r\n    “At the Norwich Festival of 1836, the expenses exceeded the receipts\r\n    by £231 5s. 10d.  We give an extract from a letter, written in the\r\n    following year by Mr. Taylor to Mr. Henry Browne, which will be read\r\n    with pain, because it shows that Mr. Taylor received far other\r\n    treatment than he deserved at the hands of the committee of\r\n    management.  Mr. Taylor said, ‘I hear of the discord engendered by\r\n    the winding up of the Festival with much concern, and which seems to\r\n    threaten the existence of future ones.  How it happened that the last\r\n    terminated so unprofitably has always been a mystery to me.  I think\r\n    it ought not.’”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Taylor goes on to state the amount of work which he himself did\r\nfor nothing.\r\n\r\nAll the festivals had been hitherto successful.  The first, in 1824,\r\nproduced a surplus of £2399 to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  The\r\nsecond, in 1827, afforded that institution £1672; the third, in 1830,\r\nyielded £535 to the hospital; the fourth, in 1833, was also successful;\r\nbut in 1836 the expenses of the Festival, as has been shown, exceeded the\r\nreceipts by £231, and a general board of the hospital resolved that no\r\npart of the funds belonging to the institution should be used for any\r\npurpose connected with the Festival.\r\n\r\nAt the Sixth Musical Festival, held on the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th\r\nSeptember, 1839, Dr. Spohr conducted his own new Oratorio of “Calvary,”\r\nbefore a very large audience, in St. Andrew’s Hall.  The performance was\r\nvery grand, and produced a thrilling effect on the audience.  The\r\nselection of such a subject as the Crucifixion for an Oratorio drew forth\r\na good deal of criticism, but there could be no doubt of the musical\r\nmerits of the composition.\r\n\r\nAfter the performance of “The Crucifixion,” Spohr and Mr. Taylor were\r\ntravelling outside the coach to London, when the former expressed a wish\r\nto write another oratorio for Norwich, but said that he was at a loss for\r\na subject.  Mr. Taylor then suggested The Fall of Babylon.  This led to a\r\nchat about the effects which might be introduced in the way of contrast,\r\n&c., and ultimately Spohr promised to write the oratorio if Taylor on his\r\npart would write the words.  The bargain was struck, and the result was a\r\nwork which will live to the end of time.\r\n\r\nThe Festival of 1842 was by far the most brilliant that had been held.\r\nOf course Dr. Spohr’s “Fall of Babylon” was the chief attraction.  It was\r\nperformed in the presence of the largest and most fashionable audience\r\never seen in St. Andrew’s Hall.  Numbers of the gentry could not obtain\r\nadmission.  People stood under the long galleries, and along the\r\npassages, and in every corner of the building.  The performance was a\r\nsplendid success, and greatly added to the fame of the composer.\r\nProfessor Taylor translated the Libretto, and was the conductor of the\r\nOratorio.  On the following day he conducted the performance of Handel’s\r\nOratorio of “Samson,” to which he added selections from Handel’s works.\r\nThis caused a good deal of adverse criticism, but it was not without\r\nprecedent.  On Friday morning the Professor conducted a performance of\r\nHandel’s “Messiah.”\r\n\r\nThe Festival of 1845 commenced on Tuesday evening, September 16th, and\r\ncontinued on the 17th, 18th, and 19th.  The programme included\r\nmiscellaneous concerts on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings; a\r\nselection of sacred music, and Haydn’s Oratorio “The Seasons,” on\r\nWednesday morning; another selection of sacred music, and Spohr’s\r\nOratorio “Calvary,” on Thursday morning; and Handel’s sacred Oratorio\r\n“Messiah,” with additional accompaniments by Mozart, on Friday morning.\r\nAll the concerts were well attended.  The principal vocalists were Madame\r\nGrisi, Miss Dolby, Madame Caradori Allan, Miss Poole, Signor Mario,\r\nSignor F. Lablache, Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Machin, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Bradbury, and\r\nHerr Staudigl.  Mr. Benedict was conductor; Mr. J. Hill, chorus master;\r\nMr. F. Cooke, leader of the band; Mr. Turle, organist.  The chorus\r\ncomprised the usual number of voices.  The band included the best\r\ninstrumentalists in England, and the festival was very successful.\r\n\r\nThe Festival of 1848 commenced on Tuesday, September 12th, with a\r\nmiscellaneous concert, followed by similar concerts on Wednesday and\r\nThursday evenings.  On Wednesday morning the programme comprised a sacred\r\nCantata, by L. Spohr, “The Christian’s Prayer,” and Haydn’s Oratorio\r\n“Creation.”  On Thursday morning Mendelssohn’s Oratorio of “Elijah” was\r\nperformed.  On Friday morning “David Penitent,” a sacred Cantata by\r\nMozart, was given, followed by Handel’s “Israel in Egypt,” one of the\r\nbest of his numerous productions.  The principal vocalists were Madame\r\nCastellan, Madame Alboni, Madame Viardot Garcia, Miss A. Williams, Miss\r\nM. Williams; Signor Lablache, basso; Mr. Sims Reeves, tenor; Mr. H.\r\nPhillips, basso; Mr. Whitworth, tenor; Mr. Lockey, tenor.  Mr. Benedict\r\nwas conductor; Mr. H. Blagrove, leader of the band; Mr. Harcourt,\r\norganist.  Professor Taylor translated “The Christian’s Prayer” for this\r\noccasion.  Mr. J. F. Hill was chorus master.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1852, the Festival again comprised grand miscellaneous\r\nconcerts on the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings, which concerts\r\nwere well attended.  On the first evening, Mrs. Fanny Kemble read the\r\n“Midsummer’s Night’s Dream,” but the reading was a failure, as she could\r\nonly be heard a short distance from the orchestra.  On the Wednesday\r\nmorning a new Oratorio, “Israel Restored,” by Dr. Bexfield, was performed\r\nfor the first time at a festival.  On Thursday morning Mr. H. H.\r\nPierson’s Oratorio, “Jerusalem,” was performed for the first time, and\r\noccupied nearly four hours.  On Friday morning the “Messiah” was\r\nperformed as usual.  The principal vocalists were Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss\r\nAlleyne, Miss Dolby, Madame Viardot Garcia, Madame Fiorentini, Signor\r\nGardoni, Signor Belletti, Mr. Weiss, Mr. Lockey, Herr Formes, Mr. Sims\r\nReeves.  Mr. Benedict was conductor; Mr. H. Blagrove, leader of the band\r\nin the morning performances, and Mons. Sainton in the evening\r\nperformances; Mr. J. F. Hill, chorus master.  At the close of the\r\nperformance on the Wednesday morning (September 22nd), a short selection\r\nfrom Handel’s Oratorio of “Samson” was given as a tribute of respect to\r\nthe memory of the late Duke of Wellington.  Madame V. Garcia sung the\r\nsolo—\r\n\r\n    “Ye sons of Israel, now lament,\r\n    Your spear is broke, your bow unbent,\r\n          Your glory’s fled.\r\n          Among the dead,\r\n    Our hero lies,\r\n    For ever closed his eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe “Dead March” was played and the chorus sung—\r\n\r\n    “Glorious hero, may thy grave\r\n    Peace and honour ever have;\r\n    After all thy pains and woes,\r\n    Rest eternal, sweet repose.”\r\n\r\nThe Festival in September, 1854, again comprised miscellaneous concerts\r\nin the evenings, and Oratorios in the mornings.  On Tuesday morning,\r\nSeptember 12th, the programme included Rossini’s “Stabat Mater,”\r\nMeyerbeer’s “91st Psalm,” and a selection of sacred music.  On Wednesday\r\nmorning Beethoven’s Service in C, and Haydn’s “Creation” were brilliantly\r\nperformed.  On Thursday morning Mendelssohn’s “Elijah” attracted a very\r\nlarge audience.  On Friday morning the “Messiah” was given, with the\r\nadditional accompaniments by Mozart.  The principal vocalists were Madame\r\nClara Novello, Madame Angelina Bosio, Madame Castellan, Madame Weiss,\r\nMiss Dolby, Mr. Sims Reeves, Signor Gardoni, Herr Reichardt, Signor\r\nLablache, Signor Belletti, and Mr. Weiss.  Mr. Benedict was conductor;\r\nMons. Sainton and Mr. H. Blagrove, instrumental solo performers; Herr\r\nHausman, violoncello; Mr. J. F. Hill, chorus master.  On Tuesday evening\r\nthe concert included a descriptive and characteristic Cantata, called\r\n“Tam o’ Shanter,” the words by Burns and the music by Macfarren.  It\r\nconsisted of a solo and chorus, which were sung with great applause.\r\nIndeed, nothing so comic and lively had ever been heard before at any\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the attractions of this festival it proved a failure\r\nin a financial point of view, and it was feared that these triennial\r\nmusical meetings would no longer answer, but their promoters determined\r\nnot to give them up.  A committee was appointed; efforts were made to\r\nsecure by all proper means success in future; and several of the county\r\nnobility joined as members of the committee.  That this determination was\r\nmade on good grounds, was fully proved by the success of the three\r\nsubsequent festivals of 1857, 1860, and 1863, the surplus from which was,\r\nin round numbers, severally, £425, £916, and £1221.  From these sums no\r\nless than £2000 were distributed amongst the charities.\r\n\r\nThe Festival of 1857 commenced on Tuesday evening, September 15th, with a\r\nmiscellaneous concert, and similar concerts were given on Wednesday and\r\nThursday evenings.  On Wednesday morning the programme comprised a sacred\r\nCantata by Louis Spohr, “God Thou art Great,” a Hymn of Praise\r\n(Lobgesang) by Mendelssohn, and the “Requiem” of Mozart, his latest work.\r\nOn Thursday morning Beethoven’s Sacred Cantata, “The Mount of Olives,”\r\nand Haydn’s Oratorio, “The Seasons” were performed.  The “Messiah” was\r\ngiven on Friday morning, and concluded the festival.  The principal\r\nvocalists were Madame Clara Novello, Madlle. Leonhardi, Madame Weiss,\r\nMrs. Lockey, Madlle. Piccolomini, Signor Gardoni, Signor Giuglini, Signor\r\nBelletti, Mr. Lockey, Mr. Miranda, and Mr. Weiss.  Mr. Benedict was\r\nconductor; Mons. Sainton, H. Blagrove, and Herr Hausman, were\r\ninstrumental solo performers; Mr. J. F. Hill was chorus master.\r\n\r\nThe Festival of 1860 was under very distinguished patronage and eminently\r\nsuccessful.  The programme included Haydn’s “Creation,” Handel’s\r\n“Messiah,” Dr. Spohr’s “Last Judgment,” Herr Molique’s “Abraham,” and\r\nHandel’s “Dettingen Te Deum,” all sacred music of the highest class,\r\nassigned to the morning performances.  The evening concerts comprised\r\nGlück’s “Armida,” Professor Sterndale Bennett’s Pastoral, “The May\r\nQueen,” Benedict’s Cantata, “Undine,” besides selections from the most\r\npopular operas, part songs, madrigals, symphonies, and overtures, all of\r\nwhich were admirably rendered and highly applauded.\r\n\r\nThe choice of so large a work as Hadyn’s “Creation,” one of the finest of\r\nhis productions, on the first evening, was considered desirable, as it\r\ngave full employment at once for the principal vocalists, the chorus, and\r\nthe band.  As many persons could not attend in the morning, an oratorio\r\nin the evening gave them an opportunity of hearing a great work well\r\nperformed, and the lovers of sacred music readily seized the opportunity\r\npresented to them of attending the performance, which was never more\r\nperfect.  No band could have possibly played it more exquisitely, no\r\nchorus could have sung it more honestly or earnestly, and the solos were\r\nbeyond all praise.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning was assigned to performances of a sacred and very\r\nsolemn character; Handel’s “Dettingen Te Deum,” and Spohr’s “Last\r\nJudgment.”  Handel composed five Te Deums, but the finest is that written\r\nin 1743, in celebration of the victory at Dettingen, then thought a great\r\nevent.  The victory was rather unexpected, and as George II. commanded in\r\nperson, the rejoicings in England were very general.  Horace Walpole\r\nwrote, “We are all mad; drums, trumpets, bumpers, bonfires!  The mob are\r\nwild, and cry ‘Long live King George and the Duke of Cumberland!’”  After\r\nthe “Te Deum,” there was a short interval preceding the performance of\r\nDr. Spohr’s great work “Die Letzten Dinge” (The Last Things), the\r\nearliest of the composer’s three oratorios.  In 1825 it was brought over\r\nfrom Germany by Professor Taylor, and it was first performed before an\r\nEnglish audience at the Norwich Festival on September 24th, 1830, under\r\nthe title of “The Last Judgment,” which does not convey a very correct\r\nidea of the work.  It was received with the greatest possible favour,\r\nlike all other works of the same master, in this city.  The grand theme\r\nis set forth in a series of paraphrases of scripture texts referring to\r\nthe final consummation of all things.\r\n\r\nThe novelties at this festival were Professor Sterndale Bennett’s\r\nPastoral “The May Queen,” and Benedict’s brilliant Cantata, “Undine,”\r\nboth of which were performed with great success.  The Pastoral was\r\nproduced with complete success at the Leeds Musical Festival, in\r\nSeptember, 1858.  Mr. Chorley composed the poem, and he deserves some\r\ncredit for the verses, as well as for the dramatic character of the\r\npiece.  The overture is a beautiful composition, and the whole work\r\ndisplays a marvellous combination of simplicity and ingenuity.  Herr\r\nMolique’s new Oratorio, “Abraham,” was performed here for the first time,\r\nand conducted by the composer, who at the close was greatly applauded.\r\nThe words are taken from the Old Testament, and the characters personated\r\nare Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Isaac, Angel, and Messenger, who in turn\r\ndepict the different scenes in the life of the patriarch.  He is\r\nexhibited as a saint, as a warrior, and as a great sufferer.  Full scope\r\nis given for the display of human passion in almost every phase, from\r\ntriumphant joy to a sorrow that borders on despair.  The incidents are\r\npicturesque, striking, and varied, calling all the powers of the\r\norchestra into play.  The principal vocalists were Madame Clara Novello,\r\n(her last appearance in Norwich,) Madame Weiss, Miss Palmer, Madame\r\nBorghi Mamo, Madlle. Tietjens, Signor Giuglini, Signor Belletti, Mr. Sims\r\nReeves, Mr. Wilbye Cooper, Mr. Santley, Mr. Weiss.  Instrumental solo\r\nperformers, Miss Arabella Goddard, piano; Mr. Sainton, Mr. H. Blagrove,\r\nSignor Piatti, violoncello; Mr. Benedict, conductor; Mr. J. F. Hill,\r\nchorus master.\r\n\r\nThe Festival of 1863 commenced on Monday evening, September 14th, with a\r\nperformance of Handel’s grand Oratorio, “Judas Maccabæus,” which was\r\neminently successful.  The large audience seemed to be carried away by\r\nthe martial music.  On the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings,\r\nmiscellaneous concerts were given.  On Wednesday morning Mr. Silas\r\nconducted a performance of his own sacred drama, “Joash,” with success.\r\nThis was followed by a “Scene at the Gates of Nain,” from the Oratorio\r\n“Immanuel,” by Henry Leslie; also selections from the Stabat Maters of\r\nHaydn, Pergolesi, and Rossini, and a selection of sacred music.  “Elijah”\r\nwas performed on Thursday morning, and the “Messiah” on Friday morning.\r\nAnother novelty at this festival was a Cantata, entitled “Richard Cœur De\r\nLeon,” composed expressly for the occasion, and performed on Thursday\r\nevening with immense applause.  This Cantata embodied the romantic story\r\nof the warrior king in captivity, being discovered by the minstrel\r\nBlondel, who at last caused the liberation of the monarch.  The principal\r\nvocalists were Madlle. Tietjens, Madame Lemmens Sherrington, Madame\r\nWeiss, Miss Wilkinson, Miss Palmer, Madlle. Trebelli, (her first\r\nappearance in Norwich,) Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. Montem Smith, Mr. Santley,\r\nMr. Weiss, Signor Bettini, (his first appearance here,) Signor Bossi,\r\n(his first appearance here).  Mr. Benedict was conductor.  Instrumental\r\nsoloists, M. Paque, violoncello; Mr. H. Blagrove and Mr. Sainton,\r\nviolins.  Mr. J. F. Hill, chorus master.\r\n\r\nThe Festival of 1866 was deferred till November, very unwisely, in\r\nanticipation of a visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales on the\r\noccasion.  This caused a larger attendance on the day their Royal\r\nHighnesses were expected, and a smaller on all the other days.  The\r\narrangements for the visit were also injudicious, to say the least.\r\nTheir Royal Highnesses should at once have proceeded to the Wednesday\r\nmorning’s performance, but they were detained at the Guildhall to hear an\r\naddress from the corporation, and then they were allowed to go to St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall in the middle of a performance, which was greatly\r\ninterrupted.  Their Royal Highnesses, therefore, could not possibly have\r\nappreciated Costa’s Oratorio from hearing only half of it.  The festivals\r\nhave been always patronized by royalty, and by the nobility, gentry, and\r\nclergy, and have never failed to attract the county families; but this\r\nyear (1866) was the first in which members of the royal family were\r\nactually present.\r\n\r\nThe general programme for 1866 when issued, presented some points of\r\npeculiar attraction, including “Israel in Egypt,” by Handel, on Monday\r\nevening; an Anthem by Dr. Spohr, and the Oratorio of “Naaman,” by Costa,\r\non Wednesday morning; “St. Cecilia,” a new Cantata by Benedict,\r\nselections from the Passion Music of Handel, and first and second parts\r\nof the “Creation,” by Haydn, on Thursday morning; and the “Messiah” on\r\nFriday morning.  Most lovers of sacred music would have preferred Haydn’s\r\nentire Oratorio to the sombre Passion Music.  The committee, acting on\r\nthe principle of securing the highest talent, made engagements with\r\nMadlle. Tietjens, Madame Rudersdorff, Miss Edith Wynne, Madame De Meric\r\nLablache, Madlle. Anna Drasdil, three of them appearing for the first\r\ntime in this city; also with Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. Cummings, Signor\r\nMorini, Mr. Santley, Mr. Weiss, and Signor Gassier, all well-known\r\nvocalists.  The instrumentalists were all first-class performers.  The\r\nchoral body was much improved and strengthened, and included 62 of the\r\nbest trebles ever selected, 24 contraltos, 35 altos, 59 tenors, and 67\r\nbasses.\r\n\r\nHandel’s Oratorio, “Israel in Egypt,” was splendidly performed on the\r\nMonday evening; the solos were in the hands of first-class vocalists, but\r\nthe absence of Mr. Sims Reeves was a disappointment.  Mr. George\r\nMacfarren had improved the instrumentation by the addition of parts to\r\nthe original score.  He had no occasion to apologize for doing for\r\n“Israel,” what many musicians have done for other productions.  It is not\r\npresumptuous to have recourse to the resources of more modern\r\ninstrumentation, so long as the character of the work is not altered.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, as we have said, the Prince and Princess of Wales\r\nwere present.  The performances commenced with Dr. Spohr’s Anthem “O\r\nblessed, for ever blessed, are they,” the first time of performance, and\r\nit was admirably rendered.  Mr. Costa then conducted a splendid\r\nperformance of his own Oratorio of “Naaman,” founded on a part of Old\r\nTestament history, relating to the restoration from death of the son of\r\nthe Shunamite by the prophet Elisha; a subject not very well adapted for\r\nmusical purposes.  All Oratorios are cast more or less in the Handelian\r\nmould, but Mr. Costa has introduced more of the secular clement than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning the hall was well filled by a large audience desirous\r\nof hearing a performance of Handel’s Passion Music, and Mr. Benedict’s\r\nnew work, “St. Cecilia.”  As to the former, we may state that there are\r\ntwo works of Handel entitled “Passion Music,” one produced, it is\r\nbelieved, in 1704, the other in 1716.  Dr. Chrysander caused the\r\npublication of both these works by the Leipzig Handel Society in 1860 and\r\n1863.  It is strange that these two productions should have slumbered so\r\nlong unheard and unknown till the selection was performed in Norwich.\r\nInteresting as the Passion Music might be, the all-important event of\r\nthis morning’s concert was, the production of Mr. Benedict’s new Cantata.\r\n“St. Cecilia” has long been a favourite subject with both poets and\r\ncomposers.  Among the former, Fletcher, Dryden, Pope, Addison, Congreve,\r\nand a host of versifiers, have contributed Odes in honour of the\r\npatroness of music.  Many of these Odes are still in existence, with\r\ntheir accompanying music, of various degrees of merit; the principal\r\nbeing those by Purcell and Handel.  These are great names, but the\r\nconstruction of the older works is entirely different from the Cantata\r\nnow performed for the first time with great applause.  After a short\r\ninterval the concert was continued with the “Creation,” which could not\r\nhave been better performed or with a stronger cast.\r\n\r\nFriday morning has been always assigned to the performance of the\r\n“Messiah,” and to hear it every seat in the hall was this time occupied,\r\nand numbers could not obtain admission.  We have heard this sublime\r\nOratorio scores of times, in London and in many large towns, and here at\r\nevery festival since 1840, but we never heard it rendered with greater\r\neffect than the last time (in 1866).\r\n\r\nNorwich has in many ways obtained credit and advantage from the Musical\r\nFestivals.  Their high character has placed the city in a very eminent\r\nposition in the musical world, and many of the citizens cherish a just\r\npride in endeavouring to qualify themselves for the maintenance of that\r\ndegree of excellence which the festivals enable them to exhibit in the\r\nchoral performances, which the best judges have pronounced second to none\r\nin the kingdom.  On the whole the festivals have contributed largely to\r\nthe funds of important charities, and will no doubt continue to do so if\r\nconducted with judgment and economy.  They have always attracted large\r\nnumbers of visitors to the old city, for the same facilities which make\r\nit easy for _us_ to go elsewhere to hear good music, enable others to\r\ncome hither for the same purpose.  Many persons will always come from\r\ndistant places to hear a well-trained Norwich chorus.  And besides all\r\nthis, not the least of the benefits derived from these triennial\r\nmeetings, is that they encourage an interchange of good feeling and\r\nhospitality between the city and county, and afford to those who enjoy\r\nmusic such an amount of pleasure as must contribute, at least for a time,\r\nto cheerfulness and happiness in their social intercourse with their\r\nfellow creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nEminent Citizens of the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Professor Taylor_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR TAYLOR claims the first place in our notices of the eminent\r\ncitizens of this period, as a politician, a musician, and a public man.\r\nAfter his death a memoir of him appeared in the _Norfolk News_ of March\r\n28th, and April 4th, 1863, and from it we derive the following details:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Edward Taylor was the great grandson of the celebrated Dr. John\r\n    Taylor, a man not less beloved for the kindliness of his disposition,\r\n    than he was venerated for his vast learning.  Dr. Taylor was born at\r\n    Lancaster in the year 1694, and came to Norwich (according to Mr.\r\n    Edward Taylor’s account) in 1733.  Here he remained till 1757, and\r\n    here it was that he produced many of his works, amongst others his\r\n    famous Hebrew Concordance, which was published in two large volumes,\r\n    folio, and was the labour of fourteen years.  Many copies of the\r\n    frontispiece (a fine portrait engraved by Houbraken) are still extant\r\n    in this city.  Dr. Taylor must have been fond of music, and must also\r\n    have made it a personal study.  This we infer, less from his having\r\n    published ‘A Collection of Tunes in Various Airs’ for the use of his\r\n    Norwich congregation, than from his having been able to Prefix\r\n    thereto ‘Instructions in the Art of Psalmody.’  The airs themselves\r\n    have no other accompaniment added than an unfigured bass, but the\r\n    collection contains many of the finest melodies which are now in use.\r\n    The instructions were intended to enable a student to sing at sight.\r\n\r\n    “When Dr. Taylor quitted Norwich, his only surviving son, Richard,\r\n    remained, and carried on the business of a manufacturer in St. George\r\n    Colegate.  Mr. John Taylor, father of the subject of this memoir, was\r\n    born the 30th July, 1750.  In 1773, he entered into the business of a\r\n    yarn maker, in partnership with his brother, in the parish where\r\n    their father had lived.  If not a musical composer, John had the\r\n    reputation of being at least a tolerable poet, and he was peculiarly\r\n    happy in writing words for music.\r\n\r\n    “In April, 1777, Mr. John Taylor married Susannah, the youngest\r\n    daughter of Mr. John Cook of Norwich.  Mr. Edward Taylor was born on\r\n    the 22nd of January, 1784, in the parish of St. George Colegate.\r\n\r\n    “In his boyish days, Edward Taylor was made to imbibe the usual\r\n    quantity of Greek and Latin, and the cask ever after retained the\r\n    flavour of the wine.  But music even then was his chief delight.\r\n    When arrived at manhood he was tall and well formed; he had a fair,\r\n    though by no means a pallid complexion, a penetrating eye, and a\r\n    majestic voice, which sounded in conversation like the roll of a bass\r\n    drum.  In whatever part of the world he had been met, it would have\r\n    been said at a glance, ‘That’s an Englishman.’  He had that\r\n    unmistakeable stamp of bluntness and sturdy independence which seems\r\n    to be an Englishman’s birthright.  He was proud, not altogether\r\n    without reason, of his ancestors, whose religious and political\r\n    opinions he inherited.  Hence, he was a Dissenter of the Unitarian\r\n    School, and what was then called a Radical Reformer.  Deeming himself\r\n    to be in the right, he of course considered all those who differed\r\n    from him to be in the wrong.  But being himself consistent, he knew\r\n    how to respect consistency in others.  His hostility was confined to\r\n    men’s doctrines and measures; it was never extended to their persons.\r\n    In a word, he was generous, manly, and sincere, and he therefore\r\n    enjoyed the friendship of good and true men, whatever might be their\r\n    party or creed.  Mr. Taylor married, in 1808, Deborah, daughter of\r\n    Mr. William Newson, of Stump Cross, in this city, a man of upright\r\n    and honourable character, and a successful tradesman.”\r\n\r\nThe memoir contains a sketch of Mr. Taylor’s political doings, which we\r\nshall give in another part of this work, and it then proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    “On the 19th January, 1824, he had the honour of dining with the Duke\r\n    of Sussex, at Kensington Palace.  The next year, 1825, terminated Mr.\r\n    Taylor’s residence in his native city, though to the end of his life\r\n    he continued to take a warm interest in whatever concerned its\r\n    welfare.  On the 21st of May, having already made arrangements for\r\n    giving up his business in Norwich, he went up to London to prepare\r\n    for making it his future abode.  On the 5th of August, he served on\r\n    the Norwich grand jury for the last time, and the next day took his\r\n    final departure.  On the 15th, he joined his brother Philip and his\r\n    cousin John Martineau in their business, as civil engineers, having\r\n    hired a house for that purpose in York Place, City Road.\r\n\r\n    “On the 3rd of January, 1826, the year after Mr. Taylor finally left\r\n    the city for London, he came down to a dinner which was given at the\r\n    Rampant Horse Hotel in his honour.  The original intention had been\r\n    to place his portrait in St. Andrew’s Hall, and Sir James Smith had\r\n    actually written some lines to be placed under it, beginning—\r\n\r\n    ‘Avaunt, ye base, approach ye wise and good,\r\n    Thus in this hall once Edward Taylor stood.’\r\n\r\n    But that idea was abandoned, and a presentation of a service of plate\r\n    was determined upon by his fellow-citizens.  The proposition\r\n    originated with the strongest of his political antagonists in the\r\n    Corporation.  The plate was given at this dinner at the Rampant\r\n    Horse, the chairman being Henry Francis, Esq., against whom Mr.\r\n    Taylor had entered the lists in the severest contest ever known in\r\n    the Mancroft Ward.  This rendered the compliment greater.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Edward Taylor’s first music master was the Rev. Charles Smyth, a\r\n    man who was equally remarkable for his eccentricity and musical\r\n    learning.  Mr. Taylor always spoke with great respect of Mr. Smyth’s\r\n    musical knowledge.  How long the lessons continued we have no means\r\n    of ascertaining, but we afterwards find Taylor gaining instruction\r\n    with the Cathedral boys under Dr. Beckwith at the music room in the\r\n    Cathedral.  He also had lessons in the vestry room of the Octagon\r\n    Chapel; and he acquired some skill upon the flute and oboe from Mr.\r\n    Fish.  But we believe that his musical education was throughout\r\n    gratuitously bestowed, out of respect to himself and his family.\r\n    Doubtless he was greatly indebted for his extensive knowledge of the\r\n    art, as well as of the German and Italian languages, to his own\r\n    perseverance in solitary study.”\r\n\r\nThe author of the memoir, after giving a sketch of the “Hall Concert”,\r\nnotices Mr. Taylor’s labours on behalf of the Musical Festivals in this\r\ncity, as already related in our brief account of those celebrations.  Mr.\r\nTaylor was one of their chief promoters, and he worked hard to make them\r\nsuccessful.  In reference to Mr. Taylor’s career in London, the author of\r\nthe memoir says,—\r\n\r\n    “It has been before stated that on the 15th August, 1825, Mr. Taylor\r\n    entered upon a new course of life, in London, in connection with his\r\n    brother Philip and Mr. John Martineau, who were civil engineers.  Had\r\n    the business proved lucrative, there is no reason to suppose that Mr.\r\n    Taylor would have left it.  It is certain that when he went to live\r\n    in London, nothing was further from his thoughts than that he would\r\n    ever embrace music as a profession.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Taylor began anew the battle of life by taking private pupils.\r\n    From the first moment of his entering the musical profession, his\r\n    classical attainments, his skill as a translator, his superior mental\r\n    powers, and his extensive musical research, were honestly and fully\r\n    recognized.  On the 29th March, 1827, Mr. Taylor made his first\r\n    appearance before a London audience as a public singer.  His debût\r\n    was at Covent Garden, at the Oratorios under the management of Sir H.\r\n    R. Bishop.  The song he chose was ‘The Battle of Hohenlinden,’\r\n    composed by C. Smith, and the reception he received from a very\r\n    crowded audience was exceedingly favourable.”\r\n\r\nAfter quoting some very eulogistic notices of Mr. Taylor’s subsequent\r\nperformances, the writer of the memoir continues:—\r\n\r\n    “In this year (1828) was published ‘Airs of the Rhine,’\r\n    accompaniments by William Horsley, Mus. Bac., Oxon, the poetry\r\n    translated by Edward Taylor.  Of Mr. Taylor’s brief sketch of German\r\n    music prefixed to this collection, the _Quarterly Musical Review_\r\n    (conducted by Mr. R. M. Bacon) says, ‘It is so agreeably written, and\r\n    contains so many authentic and interesting particulars, that we must\r\n    do him the justice to give it a place at length.  It will speak more\r\n    for the publication than anything we can say to interest the reader.’\r\n\r\n    “In 1837, Mr. Taylor was elected Gresham Professor of Music.  The\r\n    place had been for 200 years a mere sinecure, generally held by\r\n    persons totally ignorant of music, but he did much to render it\r\n    useful to the art.  In 1838 he published his ‘Three Inaugural\r\n    Lectures,’ which he dedicated to the Trustees of Gresham College.  He\r\n    was not content with reading his lectures, however good.  He\r\n    illustrated them by having some compositions of the master who might\r\n    be under discussion, well sung in parts by a competent choir.\r\n    Amateurs of distinction and professional men lent their aid, and this\r\n    attracted large audiences to the theatre.\r\n\r\n    “In 1843, Professor Taylor, who had been musical critic for the\r\n    _Spectator_ for fourteen years, retired from that department, and he\r\n    received a very complimentary letter from Mr. Rintoul the editor, who\r\n    said, ‘I can bear my willing testimony to the high aims, the great\r\n    ability, the persevering zeal, and undeviating punctuality with which\r\n    you have upheld the cause of good music in my journal for the long\r\n    period of fourteen years.  I believe that a selection from your\r\n    writings in the _Spectator_ would comprise a body of the soundest and\r\n    best musical criticism in the language; and when you retire, I know\r\n    not that any second man in England is qualified to sustain the\r\n    elevated standard that you have raised, &c.’  High praise indeed, but\r\n    well deserved.\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1845, Professor Taylor published, in the _British and\r\n    Foreign Review_, an article headed ‘The English Cathedral Service;\r\n    its Glory, its Decline, and its Designed Extinction.’  This was\r\n    subsequently published by permission of the proprietor in the form of\r\n    a thin octavo volume.  It was a masterly defence of the musical\r\n    services of our Cathedrals, and of the choirs, against the spoliation\r\n    of the deans and chapters, which had been silently and surely going\r\n    on ever since the time of Queen Elizabeth.  It made a strong\r\n    sensation at the time, and even now, whoever would strike a blow for\r\n    the cause of Cathedral music, (which in Professor Taylor’s opinion is\r\n    the salt which can alone save the musical taste of the people from\r\n    corruption) will find the best weapons ready to his hand contained in\r\n    this little volume.\r\n\r\n    “Professor Taylor, who had been long a widower, died (March 12th,\r\n    1863,) with the utmost tranquillity, at his house at Brentwood.  He\r\n    had three children, all of whom survive him; a son, Mr. John Edward\r\n    Taylor, who was with him in his last moments, and two daughters, one\r\n    of whom is married and lives in Germany, her sister living with her.\r\n\r\n    “We believe that Mr. Taylor left injunctions that his manuscripts\r\n    should not be published, which is surely to be regretted.  If his\r\n    rare and valuable musical library, the acquisition of which was the\r\n    labour of a life, should be sold, we trust that it will not go\r\n    piecemeal to the hoards of individual collectors, but be bought for\r\n    the use of Gresham College and its future musical professors.”\r\n\r\nThe compiler of this history had some long interviews with Professor\r\nTaylor when he last visited Norwich in 1857, and he then stated that he\r\nhad large collections of music, and a large number of lectures on the\r\nmusic of every period.  He delivered a very splendid lecture on the music\r\nof the Elizabethan age, in aid of the funds of the Free Library, before a\r\nlarge audience, in the Lecture Hall, St. Andrew’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. Mark Wilks_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mark Wilks, who lived in the last, and in the early part of the\r\npresent century, was a very remarkable character as a politician and a\r\npreacher.  From his biography, written by his daughter and published in\r\n1821, we derive the following particulars.  He was the son of a\r\nsubordinate officer in the army, and was born at Gibraltar on February\r\n5th, 1748.  When his father and family returned to England they lived at\r\nBirmingham, where young Mark was brought up to a trade, and where he\r\nbecame an itinerant Baptist preacher, without any chapel.  The Countess\r\nof Huntingdon heard of his exertions, and invited him to her college at\r\nTrevecca, to which he removed in 1775, and studied there for a year.  In\r\n1776 the Countess appointed him to be minister of the Tabernacle in\r\nNorwich, which became the scene of his most continued and concentrated\r\nexertions.  The first sermon he preached here was on a Sunday evening to\r\na crowded congregation, and he made a great impression.  He preached in\r\nthe same pulpit that Whitfield once occupied, and the simplicity of the\r\nnew minister’s appearance, and the negligence of his exterior, surpassed\r\nthat of the apostle of Calvinism.  His long hair fell carelessly over his\r\nshoulders; his meagre person and ruddy countenance gave him at mature age\r\nthe aspect of youth.  The whole of his demeanour was illuminated by the\r\nfire of affectionate zeal, and by an earnestness of manner, evincing that\r\nhe was honest in the sacred cause of truth.  From this time he continued\r\nhis ministry till 1778, when in the spring of that year he married\r\nSusannah Jackson of Norwich.  This was an event which he ever justly\r\nestimated as the happiest of his life, but it severed his connexion with\r\nthe patroness of the Tabernacle.  Her rule was to dismiss the students of\r\nher college on their marriage.  The Countess of Huntingdon regretted the\r\nseparation and recommended him to several destitute congregations, none\r\nof which, however, were then suited to his views.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling about for some time in Wiltshire, where he preached in\r\nseveral chapels, he returned to Norwich, and on January 1st, 1780, his\r\nnew meeting place was opened, and he became a pastor under the\r\ndenomination of Calvinistic Methodist, without the customary form of\r\nordination.  During the interval which elapsed between his return to\r\nNorwich and his establishment as a Baptist minister, his congregation\r\nrapidly increased, and continued to increase from 1780 till 1788.  He\r\nlived in retirement, and performed with satisfaction and marked\r\npunctuality the duties of his ministry.  His congregation was formed into\r\na regular Baptist church in May, 1788, and it remained so all his life.\r\nOn this change many of his former supporters left him, so that his income\r\nwas reduced.  He therefore took a farm in the neighbourhood of Norwich,\r\nand commenced farming on an extensive scale.  Employment or poverty was\r\nhis only alternative, and he followed the example of the apostle Paul by\r\nsupporting himself.\r\n\r\nWe now approach a period in his life in which he distinguished himself\r\nnot only as a pastor, but also as a citizen and patriot; for in the year\r\n1790 commenced those great events in France which laid the foundation of\r\nthe long war between this country and that unfortunate empire, a war\r\ndisastrous to both.  On July 14th, 1791, Mr. Wilks preached two eloquent\r\ndiscourses to commemorate the leading features of the first French\r\nRevolution, before crowded congregations, composed of the most\r\ninfluential persons in the city and its neighbourhood.  The propriety of\r\nsuch discourses from the pulpit may be doubted, but they caused great\r\nexcitement, as the preacher defended the revolution, which was then\r\nviewed with terror by many people.  We shall notice this, however, more\r\nat length in the political part of our narrative, in which we shall have\r\nto speak of the very active part which Mr. Wilks took in political\r\naffairs both in the city and county.  That Mr. Wilks was a rather violent\r\npartisan, and more of a Radical than a Whig, will appear by an extract\r\nfrom his biography, respecting a county election.\r\n\r\n    “When the Honourable William Wyndham first offered himself as a\r\n    candidate for the county of Norfolk, he came in the character of a\r\n    Whig, and a professed friend of civil and religious liberty.  Mr.\r\n    Wilks then warmly supported him, and to his exertions Mr. Wyndham\r\n    attributed his success.  But the revolution in France effected a\r\n    strange change in the principles of Mr. Wyndham; and on his second\r\n    appearance as candidate for Norfolk, he presented himself in the\r\n    character of a ‘war minister,’ and the enthusiastic abettor of the\r\n    most disgraceful and perilous measures ever pursued by weak and\r\n    wicked men.  Instead, therefore, of receiving support, he met with\r\n    the most determined opposition from those who had been before his\r\n    active friends.  As Mr. Wilks on his former election had supported\r\n    him by the most vigorous exertions, he now appeared foremost in the\r\n    ranks of his opponents; and Mr. Wyndham regarded him with fear and\r\n    jealousy.  The following anecdote will show with what gratitude he\r\n    returned the former services of him whom he had called his friend.\r\n    One morning, as a very intimate friend of Mr. Wilks was passing by\r\n    the house of a poor man, he was unexpectedly invited in, and was\r\n    informed by the man that his wife had just found an open letter, the\r\n    contents of which were of the greatest importance to Mr. Wilks.  It\r\n    indeed proved so.  It was a letter from Mr. Wyndham to one of his\r\n    friends at Norwich, desiring him to be most vigilant in watching the\r\n    movements and expressions of Mr. Wilks; and if at any time he uttered\r\n    anything which might be made to appear treasonable, to make him\r\n    acquainted with it, assuring him that he would take the most prompt\r\n    and severe means for his conviction.  No sooner had Mr. Wilks read\r\n    this letter than he hastened with it to the printer’s, and in a few\r\n    hours the perfidy of Mr. Wyndham was publicly known in every part of\r\n    the city, and the original letter returned to its proprietor, to his\r\n    inexpressible dismay and confusion.  The family and friends of Mr.\r\n    Wilks regarded this circumstance as an interposition of a watchful\r\n    Providence.  But for this circumstance a few days might have seen him\r\n    the inmate of a dungeon, and his life devoted, through the\r\n    incautiousness of a sentence, to the treachery of an enemy.  This\r\n    supposition may appear less improbable when it is known, that at that\r\n    time some who had been less active and less violent than himself, had\r\n    been snatched from their families during the stillness of the\r\n    midnight hour, and had been conveyed to prison without any form or\r\n    reason assigned to them.  This attempt upon the liberty, and perhaps\r\n    the life, of Mr. Wilks had the beneficial effect of making him more\r\n    vigilant over his words, and more cautious, although not less bold\r\n    and decisive in all his proceedings.  Yet his wife and friends\r\n    entertained so great an anxiety for his safety, that they strongly\r\n    importuned him to seek an asylum under the calmer skies of America,\r\n    but he resisted their importunities.\r\n\r\n    “It must be mentioned, as an instance of the generosity of Mr. Wilks’\r\n    disposition, as well as a proof that his political conduct originated\r\n    in genuine principles of patriotism, that when Mr. Wyndham again\r\n    returned as a candidate for Norfolk as conjoint supporter of the Whig\r\n    interest in union with Mr. Coke, Mr. Wilks never suffered the\r\n    recollection of his private wrongs to interfere with the principles\r\n    that Mr. Wyndham had come forward to maintain, but supported him with\r\n    the same firmness and ardour as he had ever done.\r\n\r\n    “But it is necessary to return to those incidents of his life, the\r\n    order of which has been neglected in pursuing the chain of his\r\n    political character, and which he considered of far greater\r\n    importance than any other.  In the year 1792, the Baptist Missionary\r\n    Society was established by Carey, Fuller, Pearce, and Ryland.  Those\r\n    incomparable men, in a small room at Kettering, planted the germ of\r\n    that tree which has since spread its branches into the remotest\r\n    corners of the earth.  The Indian Banyan is famed for its fertility;\r\n    it is planted, it grows, and its branches descending, strike root,\r\n    and reproduce another tree; its branches again descend, and produce\r\n    another tree; trees succeed in endless multiplication, till a far and\r\n    wide-spreading beauteous forest is formed from the vast trunk of what\r\n    was once a single plant.  In India flourishes a moral Banyan; it has\r\n    been planted by the hand of a Carey, a Fuller, a Pearce, a Ryland,\r\n    and a Wilks; watered and cultivated by their labours and their\r\n    prayers, its roots have taken a deeper and deeper root, and the day\r\n    is approaching when the sultry clime of India shall be covered by its\r\n    shadows, cheered by its verdant foliage, and refreshed by its\r\n    heavenly fruits.\r\n\r\n    “It is well known that Mr. Wilks’ devotion to the missionary cause\r\n    was early and invincible.  Whether he was present at its\r\n    establishment is rather doubtful; but from its commencement he\r\n    regarded it as the dawn of happiness to the world, and put into\r\n    action all his powers and his influence in promoting so benevolent an\r\n    end.  But it was not in the mission alone that he evinced his\r\n    benevolence and his disinterestedness.  Nine years had elapsed since\r\n    he first commenced farming, and during that time and the succeeding\r\n    year he preached regularly, and fulfilled all the duties incumbent on\r\n    his station, without receiving for his services the smallest\r\n    remuneration.  Whether in this instance he acted in all respects with\r\n    prudence has frequently been doubted by himself as well as his\r\n    friends.  His conduct originated in feelings of the purest\r\n    benevolence, although perhaps it lost its excellence in losing its\r\n    justice.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1797 Mr. Wilks was obliged to quit his farm, the lease of\r\nwhich had expired.  He immediately engaged another at Aldborough, a\r\nvillage near Harleston in Suffolk, and went there to reside with his\r\nfamily in March, 1797.  The distance of that place was seventeen miles\r\nfrom Norwich; yet although he was necessarily obliged to omit the\r\nweek-day preaching, he never once neglected the regular performance of\r\nhis pastoral duties on Sunday.  In every kind of weather he constantly\r\ntravelled thirty-four miles every Sunday to preach to a congregation from\r\nwhom he received no remuneration.  This course of exertion, however,\r\ncould not be long continued.  With the engagements of his farm, which\r\nwere at this time very considerable, and the care attendant on a large\r\nfamily of twelve children, he found it was necessary either to give up\r\nhis church or to leave his farm.  Though his farm was a very profitable\r\none, he did not hesitate which course to pursue; and he took another farm\r\nat Cossey, near Norwich, where he continued for some time, and where he\r\noften preached to the people in the village.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1802, he purchased a farm at the village of Sprowston, only two\r\nmiles from Norwich.  Here he enjoyed the society of his friends in the\r\ncity, and in every respect his own comfort and that of his family were\r\nimproved by this removal.  His congregation increased, and the chapel in\r\nwhich he preached became too small for all who wished to attend his\r\nministry.  His friends were therefore desirous of erecting a more\r\ncommodious one, and purchased a piece of ground for its erection.  In\r\nSeptember, 1812, he laid the first stone, and Mr. Andrew Fuller preached\r\non the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, he went on a begging tour for his meeting house, and travelled\r\nthrough the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Cambridgeshire, and\r\nthence to London.  In six weeks he collected about £400, but his\r\nexertions brought on a serious illness.  After his return his family\r\nscarcely hoped for his recovery.  On May 4th, 1814, the new meeting\r\nhouse, in St. Clement’s, Norwich, was opened by Mr. M. Wilks of London,\r\nand Mr. A. Fuller.  The pastor was present, but in a very feeble state of\r\nhealth.  He recovered slowly in a few weeks, and when his health was\r\nsufficiently restored, he made another effort to diminish the debt on the\r\nnew chapel.  Though he frequently considered himself to be in a dying\r\nstate, yet at every interval of ease he pursued his work with unremitting\r\nardour.  It is unnecessary to relate all the details of the few latter\r\nyears of his life; the long journeys he took in the years 1815 and 1816,\r\nwere a proof of the generosity of his heart.  His last two years he spent\r\nin retirement, yet in the performance of his ministerial duties; and ever\r\nready to advance the interests of his church, of his family, and of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nHe was ill only four days previous to his death, which took place on\r\nFebruary 5th, 1819.  When it was publicly known in the city that he was\r\nno more, hundreds of people went to his house to take a last look of him\r\nwhom living they had so much loved and respected.  And the bitter tears\r\nof his surviving relatives, the deep affliction of his friends, and the\r\nsorrow of mourning multitudes, bore a sad testimony to his worth as a\r\nhusband, a father, a friend, a minister, a neighbour, and a christian.\r\n\r\nHe died on his birthday, when he had attained the age of seventy-one.\r\nHis much valued friend, the Rev. W. Hull of Norwich, spoke at his\r\ninterment to a large assembly of sincere mourners, and to a great\r\nconcourse of spectators.  The Rev. Mark Wilks of London, his nephew,\r\npreached a funeral sermon on Sunday, February 14th, before a large\r\ncongregation.  The deceased was buried under the pulpit where he had\r\npreached the gospel for forty years.  Of his family of twelve children,\r\nincluding his four sons, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, none of them and\r\nnone of their descendants now live in Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. John Alexander_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Alexander was the pastor of the Independent Congregation in\r\nPrince’s Street for a period of fifty years.  He was much beloved by all\r\nwho knew him for his kindly disposition and genuine piety.  Bishop\r\nStanley often spoke of him in terms of the highest commendation as a\r\nchristian minister.  He took an active interest in all the philanthropic\r\nand educational movements of the district, and was for some time the\r\nChairman of the Board of Management of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.\r\nAfter his death, on July 31st, 1868, a short memoir of him appeared in\r\nthe _Norfolk News_; and this memoir contained nearly the whole history of\r\nPrince’s Street Chapel in this city.  We give the following extracts:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Alexander was born at Lancaster in 1792.  Of his father, the\r\n    Rev. William Alexander, our deceased friend published an interesting\r\n    _Memoir_; and, as showing his own appreciation of the excellencies of\r\n    his parents, he placed on the title page these lines of Cowper’s:—\r\n\r\n    ‘My boast is, not that I deduce my birth\r\n    From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;\r\n    But higher far my proud pretensions rise,\r\n    The son of parents passed into the skies.’\r\n\r\n    In the same volume we find him thus writing in reference to his early\r\n    days:—‘The reader will, I trust, perceive that our domestic\r\n    discipline, union, and affection, together with the sweet influences\r\n    of religion, rendered us a happy family.  The recollections and the\r\n    love of home, too, and our reverence for holy parents, became a\r\n    shield of protection to us, and “a way of escape” in the day of\r\n    evil.’  With an atmosphere like this surrounding his childhood, we\r\n    wonder not that he became in early life the subject of deep religious\r\n    convictions.  In 1807 he entered a large commercial establishment\r\n    connected with a household in which ‘the most beautiful domestic\r\n    order was combined with everything that was pure and lovely in\r\n    religion.’  This privilege was greatly prized by him, and he ever\r\n    cherished a grateful sense of the goodness of God in placing him\r\n    there.  During this period he attended the ministry of the Rev. P. S.\r\n    Charrier of Liverpool, and joined the church under his care.  For\r\n    some time he had cherished a desire, and entertained a hope, in\r\n    reference to the christian ministry, which was now soon to be\r\n    realised.\r\n\r\n    “The celebrated Dr. Edward Williams, one of the tutors at Rotherham\r\n    College, happened just then to visit Liverpool, and unexpectedly\r\n    spoke to him on the subject, offering him the advantages of the\r\n    institution over which he presided.  This incident naturally made a\r\n    deep impression on his mind, and led him very seriously and\r\n    prayerfully to consider the matter.  Of course, he lost no time in\r\n    communicating his thoughts to his father, who urged on him the\r\n    greatest caution, saying, ‘God forbid you should take it up, except\r\n    in compliance with the will of God.’  Nothing daunted, however, by\r\n    the somewhat discouraging aspect of the ministry set before him in\r\n    his father’s letters, he intimated to him, in reply to his inquiries,\r\n    that he retained an unalterable ‘determination to give himself to the\r\n    work, believing he had been called of God to it;’ and in 1814 he was\r\n    admitted as a student into Hoxton College.  Here the amiable\r\n    qualities which distinguished him all through life soon endeared him\r\n    to every fellow-student, and one still surviving speaks of hours\r\n    spent with him as ‘the happiest, holiest, and most profitable spent\r\n    under the college roof.’\r\n\r\n    “In his _Thirty Years’ History of the Church and Congregation in\r\n    Prince’s Street Chapel_, he gives us an account of his first visit to\r\n    and subsequent residence in this city.  From that source we learn\r\n    that early in the year 1817 he received an invitation to preach for a\r\n    few Sabbaths in the Tabernacle, and that on Friday, April 4th, 1817,\r\n    (the day on which a fatal steam-packet catastrophe occurred by which\r\n    many lives were lost), he entered Norwich.  On the following Sunday\r\n    evening he preached from the text, ‘Therefore be ye also ready; for\r\n    in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.’  The place\r\n    was crowded; and, says he, ‘The Lord stood by me and strengthened\r\n    me.’  At the expiration of three Sabbaths he returned to London,\r\n    promising to visit Norwich again and preach during the whole of the\r\n    Midsummer vacation.  He resumed his labours with very great\r\n    encouragement at the Tabernacle on July 6th; and some legal\r\n    difficulty occurring as to the power of appointing the minister, he\r\n    consented, with the approbation of his tutors, to continue them till\r\n    the disputed point was settled, which was not till the following\r\n    December.  The legal decision was such as necessitated him to give\r\n    notice the very day it arrived, that in the evening he should preach\r\n    his last sermon in the Tabernacle.  On that occasion he chose as his\r\n    text, words which the people believed to have been divinely suggested\r\n    to his mind, ‘Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the\r\n    morning.’  That text, it was often afterwards remarked, built the new\r\n    chapel.  The prospect, however, of the toil connected with the\r\n    establishment of a new church and congregation, and the building of a\r\n    chapel, was such that he shrank from it, and took his place in the\r\n    coach to return to London on his way to Kidderminster, where he had\r\n    been requested to supply, with a view to settlement.\r\n\r\n    “But so deep was the impression his services had produced, and so\r\n    warm the interest and affection created, that the people would not\r\n    part from him.  On the day of his departure, a deputation waited on\r\n    him and pressed on him an invitation to become their minister with\r\n    such affectionate earnestness, that, says he ‘I felt the appeal to be\r\n    irresistible, and I promised to lay the whole matter before my tutor\r\n    and friends, and to make it the subject of serious and prayerful\r\n    re-consideration.’  The result was that he returned, and for some\r\n    time preached in the Lancasterian School-room.  At length the site on\r\n    which Prince’s Street Chapel now stands was purchased, and the\r\n    foundation stone laid on the 16th of March, 1819.  It was opened on\r\n    December 1st in the same year, and thenceforward, for the space of\r\n    about five and forty years, it continued to be the scene of the\r\n    living and life-quickening ministry of one whose ‘praise is in all\r\n    the churches.’  Of the characteristics of Mr. Alexander’s preaching\r\n    this is not the place to speak beyond saying it was truly evangelical\r\n    and eminently successful.  But he was not the preacher only.  He was\r\n    the faithful pastor, the unswerving friend, and the cheerful\r\n    companion as well.  Hence in times of sorrow or of joy he was a\r\n    welcome guest, either in the family meeting or at more social\r\n    gatherings.  He carried summer and sunshine with him into every\r\n    circle, and never left any without leaving a longing in every heart,\r\n    young and old, for the next visit.  When he crossed the threshold,\r\n    the young loved to caress and to be caressed by him, whilst to the\r\n    others the cares of life seemed lessened, and the burden lightened,\r\n    as he spoke to them a few words of loving sympathy or wise counsel,\r\n    and left them with his soft tones of benediction treasured in their\r\n    hearts and vibrating on their ears.\r\n\r\n    “Time rolled on, ever finding him at his work, till thirty years had\r\n    gone, when his friends gathered round him in St. Andrew’s Hall to\r\n    testify their high appreciation of his excellencies, and their deep\r\n    and strong affection for him as their pastor and their friend.  On\r\n    that occasion it was the desire of the people to present a purse to\r\n    him as a substantial token of their esteem, but there being at that\r\n    time a debt of £400 remaining on the chapel, he, with that\r\n    characteristic unselfishness which ever marked him, urgently\r\n    requested that they would abandon the purse, but remove the debt.\r\n    But it must not be supposed that Mr. Alexander’s energies were\r\n    confined to the cause of Christ at Prince’s Street Chapel, or that\r\n    the members of his church and congregation were allowed to claim him\r\n    as exclusively belonging to them.  This was seen when ten years more\r\n    of active service had passed, and troops of admirers, from far and\r\n    near, flocked again to St. Andrew’s Hall to do him honour.  On that\r\n    occasion the Mayor (J. G. Johnson, Esq.,) represented the city, and\r\n    the Rev. S. Titlow the Church of England, in most eulogistic\r\n    speeches.  The Baptist Churches of the county presented him with an\r\n    address, whilst brethren of his own denomination, and others, lay and\r\n    ministerial, seemed to vie with one another in magnifying ‘the grace\r\n    of God’ in him.  The desire entertained ten years before was now\r\n    carried into effect, and a purse, with an elegant skeleton timepiece,\r\n    and a memorial engrossed on vellum and framed, were presented to him,\r\n    and a gold watch and chain to Mrs. Alexander.  The timepiece bore the\r\n    following inscription:—\r\n\r\n    Presented to the Rev. John Alexander, together with a purse of 500\r\n    sovereigns, on his commencing the fortieth year of his ministry in\r\n    Norwich, by the members of his congregation and numerous other\r\n    friends, as a memorial of Christian esteem and love.—Norwich, June\r\n    3rd, 1856.\r\n\r\n    From that time the infirmities of age, and the claims of a large\r\n    congregation, led him to desire help, which was secured for him in\r\n    the person of an assistant minister.  With that help he happily and\r\n    zealously worked on in his Master’s service through another decade of\r\n    years, when once more the old Gothic hall resounded with his praises\r\n    and witnessed another outburst of affectionate congratulation.\r\n    Having lived to see the jubilee of his ministry, he now resigned the\r\n    pastoral office, and was presented with an annuity of £200 and a\r\n    magnificent epergne, on which a suitable inscription was engraved.\r\n    With trembling emotion the venerable man read his reply and\r\n    acknowledgment, in which, after recording the goodness of God and the\r\n    kindness of his friends through the long period of fifty years, he\r\n    stated that during his pastorate more than a thousand members had\r\n    been added to the church, two chapels had been added to the one in\r\n    Prince’s Street, four Sunday Schools had been raised and supplied\r\n    with a hundred teachers and with nearly a thousand children, and\r\n    eight members of the church had become ministers of the Gospel.\r\n\r\n    “Seldom is it the lot of the most favoured ministers thus to be\r\n    blessed and made a blessing.  We shall not attempt to describe what\r\n    Mr. Alexander was in the pulpit, on the platform, in the committee\r\n    room, or from the press, nor how he discharged his duties as chairman\r\n    of ‘The Congregational Union of England and Wales,’ and secretary of\r\n    ‘The Association for the Spread of the Gospel in the County.’  Much\r\n    less shall we venture a word on his private or domestic life.  We\r\n    hope another and abler pen will pourtray his character more fully,\r\n    and hence we content ourselves by adding words written by a friend,\r\n    ‘His life is his eulogy.’  It was a holy life, a useful life, an\r\n    honourable life, a happy life.\r\n\r\n    “The last sermon Mr. Alexander preached was delivered in Prince’s\r\n    Street Chapel on April 22nd, 1866, from 2 _Cor._ ii. 14–17.  The last\r\n    time that he spoke in St. Andrew’s Hall was a few months before his\r\n    death, on the occasion of the mayor’s invitation to the Sunday school\r\n    teachers, and the last public religious service he attended was in\r\n    the Old Meeting House on Sunday evening, July 19th, 1868, where his\r\n    presence was ever as welcome as in his own chapel.\r\n\r\n    “Of his history since his retirement into private life, little only\r\n    can be said.  At first the ease and seeming uselessness imposed on\r\n    him by the infirmities of age had a depressing influence on his mind,\r\n    but latterly this gave place to his wonted calm confidence in God,\r\n    and his usual joyousness of heart.  Occasionally, to the grief of his\r\n    friends, the decline of his mental powers was painfully visible, but\r\n    this was often relieved by his still sparkling and felicitous\r\n    utterances, and his fervent devotional exercises.\r\n\r\n    “Some lines written in our album so recently as last November will,\r\n    perhaps, best indicate the state of his mind, and the theme on which\r\n    it delighted to dwell:—\r\n\r\n    Amidst the fragrance richly shed,\r\n       And beauty blooming in the bowers,\r\n    The willow bends its mournful head,\r\n       And seems to weep among the flowers.\r\n\r\n    And so in human life we find,\r\n       How bright soever it appears,\r\n    That grief is rooted in the mind,\r\n       And smiles are mingled with its tears.\r\n\r\n    But there’s a garden in the sky\r\n       Where mourning willows cannot grow,\r\n    Where tears are wiped from every eye,\r\n       And streams of joy unmingled flow.\r\n\r\n    “And now the time drew nigh that he must die.  For only a few days he\r\n    was withdrawn from the outer world.  During that time it was very\r\n    evident that constant intercourse was being carried on with heaven.\r\n    On asking him, two days prior to his death, if the Saviour he had so\r\n    long and faithfully preached to others was now near and precious to\r\n    himself, he replied, ‘Oh, what should I do without Him!’  The day\r\n    before his departure he was much in prayer.  His family were all\r\n    remembered before God, as were also the servants of the household.\r\n    And very touching were the words in which he sought a blessing on the\r\n    ministers of the city, and on their work, with whom he had lived in\r\n    closest and loving fellowship.  And so he passed away, spending his\r\n    last hours, as he had spent his life, in blessing others.\r\n\r\n    “On Tuesday, the 4th of August, he was carried to his grave amid the\r\n    lamentations of a vast concourse of his fellow-citizens, and friends\r\n    from the country, who had known him and esteemed him very highly in\r\n    love for his works’ sake.  The funeral service at the grave was\r\n    conducted by the Revs. G. Gould, J. Hallett, P. Colborne, and G. S.\r\n    Barrett, B.A.; but gathered there were clergymen and ministers of\r\n    every denomination, as well as laymen of all classes, from the mayor\r\n    to the humblest artisan.\r\n\r\n    “And so has passed away from our midst, full of days and honours,\r\n    one, whom it was a privilege to have known, and an impossibility not\r\n    to have loved.  His Christian catholicity, his large-hearted charity,\r\n    his generous liberality, his untarnished reputation, and his fidelity\r\n    to Christian truth, together with other virtues that adorned his long\r\n    life, constrain us to thank God for having given him to Norwich, and,\r\n    now that He has taken him to Himself, constrain us to say ‘Let me die\r\n    the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!’”\r\n\r\nThe funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. John Stoughton, of London,\r\nbefore a large congregation in St. Andrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gurney Family_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of the Gurney family, from an early period, have been\r\ndistinguished by their station, wealth, and intelligence, both in Norfolk\r\nand Norwich.  Memoirs of Joseph John Gurney, with selections from his\r\njournal and correspondence, were edited by Joseph Bevan Braithwaite, and\r\npublished by Mr. Fletcher of this city.  From these memoirs we derive the\r\nfollowing interesting details respecting the family, and the Society of\r\nFriends in Norwich.\r\n\r\n    “The family of Gurney or Gournay is said to have sprung from a house\r\n    of Norman barons, who followed William the Conqueror into England and\r\n    obtained a large estate in this country, chiefly in the county of\r\n    Norfolk.  From them descended a long line of country gentlemen, who\r\n    maintained themselves at Harpley, and West Barsham, in this county,\r\n    for many generations, and from a very early period had one of their\r\n    residences in this city.  The last of these dying without male issue,\r\n    about the commencement of the reign of Charles II., the old family\r\n    estates at that period became dispersed amongst females.  The name of\r\n    Gurney was, however, honourably continued through a descendant of one\r\n    of the younger sons of an earlier generation, John Gurney, the\r\n    ancestor of the present family.  He was born in the year 1655, and\r\n    notwithstanding his family connections, commenced life in Norwich in\r\n    somewhat straitened circumstances.  Devoting himself in his youth to\r\n    the cause of religion, we find him in the year 1678, at the age of\r\n    twenty-three, already connected with the oppressed, persecuted\r\n    Quakers.\r\n\r\n    “The family of John Gurney appear previously to have had some\r\n    connexion with the Puritans.  Henry Gurney, indeed, of West Barsham,\r\n    the representative of the family in the early part of the 17th\r\n    century, had a distaste for Puritanism, if, at least, we are to judge\r\n    from the insertion in his will (proved in 1623) of a special charge\r\n    to his younger son, ‘That none hould any fantisticall or erroneous\r\n    opinions, so adjudged by our bishop or civill lawes.’  But Edmund\r\n    Gurney, rector of Harpley, one of these younger sons, who was a\r\n    person of influence, became known as a zealous Puritan; he declined\r\n    wearing the surplice, and was probably among those who took the\r\n    covenant in 1643.  After him John Gurney successively named two of\r\n    his children.  Others of his connexions were also inclined to\r\n    Puritanism, and some of them, like himself, joined the Society of\r\n    Friends.  In the case of the early Friends generally, their ultimate\r\n    settlement in those gospel principles by which they became\r\n    distinguished from others, was preceded by a state of much religious\r\n    awakening and earnest seeking after God, in which they ‘searched the\r\n    scriptures daily, whether those things were so.’\r\n\r\n    “Through what course of experience John Gurney arrived at his\r\n    conviction, the scanty materials of his history do not inform us.\r\n    Let it suffice us to know that what he became convinced of, was\r\n    precious to him as the truth, and that for it he was prepared to\r\n    suffer.  On the 29th of the ninth month (O. S.), 1682, (so the\r\n    records of the Friends in Norwich inform us,) ‘Friends being kept out\r\n    of their meeting house, met together in the street to wait upon the\r\n    Lord,’ and, being there, John Gurney and another Friend, were\r\n    violently pulled out from among the rest, as if they had been\r\n    malefactors, and carried before a justice of the peace, by whom, as\r\n    they declined giving, on such an account, the required bail, they\r\n    were committed until the next quarter sessions.  In the following\r\n    year, 1683, he was again imprisoned, for refusing to take an oath,\r\n    and continued in prison, under successive recommitments, nearly three\r\n    years.  He died in the year 1721, having greatly prospered in his\r\n    temporal concerns; and, what is far more important, having, according\r\n    to the testimony of those who knew him, taken particular care in the\r\n    religious education of all his children, and continued faithful to\r\n    the end.\r\n\r\n    “His two elder sons, John and Joseph, were both men of marked\r\n    character.  John was gifted with much natural eloquence, and obtained\r\n    considerable reputation by the spirit and ability with which he\r\n    successfully defended the Norwich trade, before a committee of the\r\n    House of Lords, against some apprehended encroachments.  He\r\n    subsequently received from Sir Robert Walpole the offer of a seat in\r\n    parliament, which, however, he declined as inconsistent with his\r\n    religious principles in the then state of the law.  Religion had\r\n    early taken possession of his heart, and about the 22nd year of his\r\n    age, in obedience to the call of apprehended duty, he had yielded\r\n    himself to the work of the public ministry of the gospel, in which\r\n    service he laboured diligently for many years; neither the temptation\r\n    of prosperity nor the kindness and esteem of great men of this world,\r\n    being, in the simple and forcible language of the memorial respecting\r\n    him, ‘permitted to separate him from that truth which the Lord had\r\n    eminently convinced him of.’\r\n\r\n    “Besides numerous other descendants, he was the grandfather of Martha\r\n    Birkbeck, whose daughter Jane became the first wife of Joseph John\r\n    Gurney.  Joseph Gurney, his younger brother, who, towards the close\r\n    of his life, fixed his residence at Keswick, near Norwich, also\r\n    became a valued minister of the gospel among Friends.  His christian\r\n    profession was eminently adorned by a life of humility, benevolence,\r\n    and moderation.  He died in the year 1750, after a suffering illness\r\n    which he bore with exemplary resignation, giving a final evidence of\r\n    the truth of what he then expressed that it had been ‘the business of\r\n    his whole life to be prepared for such a time!’\r\n\r\n    “His eldest son, John Gurney, was a man of great activity and energy,\r\n    and notwithstanding his extensive engagements in business, devoted\r\n    much of his time to the interests of his own religious society, to\r\n    the principles of which he was warmly attached.  In the midst of a\r\n    course of remarkable temporal prosperity, it is instructive to\r\n    observe the fears which he expresses in one of his private memoranda,\r\n    lest his increasing opulence should lead away his children from those\r\n    religious habits and associations in which they had been educated.\r\n    He left three sons, all of whom married and settled near Norwich.\r\n    Richard Gurney the eldest, on his father’s decease, in 1770, became\r\n    the occupant of the family residence at Keswick.  John Gurney, the\r\n    father of J. J. Gurney, had previously to the birth of the latter\r\n    settled at Earlham.  Joseph Gurney, the youngest, resided at Lakenham\r\n    Grove.  The three families were naturally much associated, and\r\n    exercised an important influence upon each other.  At a later period\r\n    especially, the consistency with which Joseph Gurney, of The Grove,\r\n    was enabled to maintain his position as a Friend, and as a christian\r\n    minister, rendered his influence peculiarly valuable.”\r\n\r\nJohn Gurney, of Earlham, is eulogised highly by the editor of these\r\nmemoirs as generous, ardent, and warm-hearted, abounding in kindness to\r\nall, uniting very remarkable activity, both in public and private\r\nbusiness, with an acute intellect and extensive information.  His wife\r\nwas Catherine Bell, a daughter of Daniel Bell of Stamford Hill, near\r\nLondon, her mother being a granddaughter of Robert Barclay, the\r\nwell-known author of the “Apology.”  She is described as a woman of very\r\nsuperior mind as well as personal charms, and as a serious christian and\r\ndecided Friend.  She died in the autumn of 1792, leaving her sorrowing\r\nhusband the widowed parent of eleven children.  The following list of the\r\nnames may be found useful:—\r\n\r\nCatherine died unmarried, 1850.\r\n\r\nRachel died unmarried, 1827.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, married in 1800 to Joseph Fry, of London, became the\r\ncelebrated Mrs. Fry, who died in 1845.\r\n\r\nJohn died in 1814.\r\n\r\nRichenda married in 1816 to Francis Cunningham, who died in 1855.\r\n\r\nHannah married in 1807 to Thomas Fowell Buxton.\r\n\r\nLouisa, married in 1806 to Samuel Hoare, died in 1836.\r\n\r\nPriscilla died unmarried, 1821.\r\n\r\nSamuel, who died in 1856.\r\n\r\nJoseph John, who died in 1847.\r\n\r\nDaniel, still living.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph John Gurney_, _Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the eminent citizens of this century, none will take a higher place\r\nthan the late J. J. Gurney, Esq., the well-known philanthropist.  He was\r\nborn at Earlham Hall on August 8th, 1788.  That hall was one of the\r\nhappiest homes in England.  It was also the birth-place of Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nFry, sister of J. J. Gurney, and almost as celebrated as her brother.\r\nHere they were both trained with religious care, and passed their days of\r\nchildhood and youth in happiness and peace.  In after life they were\r\nassociated together in works of benevolence, and the brother often aided\r\nhis sister in many of her schemes for improving prison discipline.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, soon after he had completed his 15th year, Joseph John was sent\r\nto Oxford with his cousin Gurney Barclay to pursue his studies under the\r\ncare of John Rogers, a private tutor.  Young J. J. Gurney continued at\r\nOxford two years, with the exception of the vacations, which he spent\r\nmostly at home.  His tutor, though resident at Oxford, was not in that\r\ncharacter connected with the university or with any of the colleges.  The\r\nstudent became an excellent classical and oriental scholar, and\r\nultimately the author of several valuable religious works, such as\r\n“Essays on Christianity,” “Thoughts on Habit and Discipline.”  He was\r\nscarcely seventeen when, in August, 1805, he was removed from the care of\r\nJohn Rogers.  He had become attached to his tutor and to his studies, and\r\nhe quitted the place with regret, but there was brightness in the thought\r\nof settling at home.  The bank in which his father was a partner had been\r\nestablished in Norwich in the year 1770.  After that time the concern was\r\nconsiderably extended with branch banks at Lynn, Fakenham, Yarmouth, and\r\nother places.  His elder brother, John, had been placed in the\r\nestablishment at Lynn, and his brother Samuel had been sent up to London,\r\nwhere he had become the head of a district concern; so that circumstances\r\nhad prepared the way for that which J. J. Gurney himself had desired—a\r\nplace in the bank at Norwich.  Here in the enjoyment of daily\r\ncommunication with his father, and a home at Earlham with his sisters,\r\nthe ensuing three years of his life passed in peace and joy.  In the year\r\n1806, he accompanied his father and a large family party in a tour to the\r\nEnglish lakes and through Scotland.  On their return, J. J. Gurney was\r\nregular in his attendance at the bank, but he found time for study at\r\nhome, and he carefully read ancient historians in the original languages.\r\nGradually, however, his attention became unceasingly directed to biblical\r\nliterature, which continued for some years to absorb much of his leisure.\r\nHis habits of study were eminently methodical, exemplifying his favourite\r\nmaxim, which he was afterwards accustomed strongly to inculcate upon his\r\nyoung friends, “Be a whole man to one thing at a time.”  His position and\r\ntastes introduced him to the highly-cultivated society, for which Norwich\r\nwas at the time remarkable, at the house of his cousin Hudson Gurney,\r\nwhere he was accustomed to meet many persons who were eminent for their\r\nparts and learning.  He had early become a favourite with Dr. Bathurst,\r\nthen Bishop of Norwich, and their intercourse gradually ripened into a\r\nwarm friendship, which was maintained unbroken till that prelate’s\r\ndecease, in 1837, at the very advanced age of ninety-three.  Young J. J.\r\nGurney was but just twenty-one when, as one of his father’s executors and\r\nrepresentative at Earlham, and as a partner in the bank, very grave\r\nresponsibilities devolved upon him.  However, he continued to pursue his\r\nstudies with ardour, and he made his first essay as an author in an\r\narticle published in the _Classical Journal_ on September 9th, 1810,\r\nunder the title of “A Critical Notice of Sir William Drummond’s\r\nDissertations on the Herculanesia.”  After this effort his mind became\r\nincreasingly drawn towards the principles of the Society of Friends, and\r\nmany of his allusions to his feelings, in his autobiography, are\r\npeculiarly interesting and instructive, indicating the spiritual phase of\r\nhis mind.  The example of his sister, Elizabeth Fry, as well as of his\r\nsister Priscilla, who like her, had become a decided Friend and a\r\npreacher of the gospel, strengthened his convictions; but the influence\r\nof other members of the family who resided at Earlham, as well as of many\r\nother estimable persons, tended in an opposite direction.  The editor of\r\nthe Memoirs, already referred to, says:—\r\n\r\n    “Whilst Joseph John Gurney’s religious convictions were thus\r\n    gradually drawing him into a narrower path in connection with the\r\n    Society of Friends, his heart was becoming increasingly enlarged in\r\n    Christian concern for the welfare of others.  He had already warmly\r\n    interested himself in the formation of a Lancasterian School in\r\n    Norwich, an institution which long continued to have his effective\r\n    support.  The establishment of an auxiliary Bible Society in this\r\n    city, was an object into which he now entered with youthful ardour.\r\n    The general meeting for its formation was held on the 11th of the 9th\r\n    month, 1811.”\r\n\r\nThe philanthropist was married to Jane Birkbeck on October 10th, 1817, in\r\nhis 29th year, and it appears to have been a very happy marriage.  The\r\nevent took place at Wells Meeting, and, after a short sojourn at\r\nHunstanton, the newly-married couple travelled to their home at Earlham,\r\nwhere they received the visits of many friends, who were most hospitably\r\nentertained.  After his marriage, J. J. Gurney continued at Earlham; and\r\nthe hall, where his father had resided, and in which he himself lived\r\nfrom his birth, was his settled residence.\r\n\r\n    “To this place (with its lovely lawn nested among large trees) he was\r\n    strongly attached all his life.  And they who knew him there can\r\n    still picture him in his study among his books, or in his\r\n    drawing-room among his friends, his countenance beaming with love and\r\n    intelligence, the life of the whole circle; or in his garden amongst\r\n    his flowers, with his Greek Testament in his hand, still drawing from\r\n    the books ‘of nature and of grace’ that lay open before him, new\r\n    motives to raise the heart to the Author of all his blessings.\r\n\r\n    “Placed by circumstances, though not the elder brother, in the\r\n    position which his father had occupied in Norfolk as Master of\r\n    Earlham, and a partner in the bank, it was his delight, as far as\r\n    possible, to continue Earlham as the family house.  Even after his\r\n    marriage, his sisters, Catherine, Rachel, and Priscilla, continued to\r\n    live with him, occupying their own apartments, and it was the custom\r\n    of the other members of the family frequently to meet there as under\r\n    a common roof. * * * Up to the period of his brother John’s decease,\r\n    and for some time afterwards, it was the habit of his brothers and\r\n    himself, with their brothers-in-law, Thomas Fowell Buxton and Samuel\r\n    Hoare, to improve these occasions by a mutual impartial examination\r\n    of their conduct, in which each with brotherly openness stated what\r\n    he conceived to be the brother’s faults.  Happy indeed was such an\r\n    intercourse between such minds. * * * Besides this, to him,\r\n    delightful band of brothers and sisters, his house was, as must have\r\n    been already apparent to the reader, freely opened to a large circle.\r\n\r\n    “Whilst every year strengthened his conviction of the soundness and\r\n    importance of the christian principles which he professed, he\r\n    rejoiced in that liberty wherewith Christ had made him free to\r\n    embrace as brethren all those in whom he thought he could discern\r\n    traces of his heavenly image.\r\n\r\n    “Towards the close of the year (1817) in company with his wife, his\r\n    brother Samuel Gurney, his brother and sister Buxton, and Francis and\r\n    Richenda Cunningham, he took a short tour upon the continent of\r\n    Europe, their principal objects being to establish a branch Bible\r\n    Society in Paris, and to procure information as to the systems of\r\n    prison discipline adopted in the jails of Antwerp and Ghent.  Having\r\n    accomplished their objects, they returned home after an absence of\r\n    about a month.”\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards J. J. Gurney began to preach at meetings of the Friends\r\nin Norwich and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    “Early in the year 1818, private business called him to London.  His\r\n    sister, Elizabeth Fry, had previously entered upon her important\r\n    labours for the benefit of the prisoners in Newgate, and for the\r\n    improvement of prison discipline generally.  Joseph John Gurney\r\n    warmly entered into his sister’s views, and accompanied her to the\r\n    committee of the House of Commons on the occasion of giving her\r\n    evidence, and afterwards to Lord Sidmouth, then Secretary of State\r\n    for the Home Department.\r\n\r\n    “His visit to London and the pamphlet on _Prison Discipline_, soon\r\n    afterward published by his brother-in-law, Thomas Fowell Buxton,\r\n    tended to deepen in his own mind a sense of the importance of that\r\n    subject, and an opportunity soon occurred for endeavouring to\r\n    influence the authorities at Norwich to some exertion respecting it.\r\n    The mayor and corporation, attended by the sheriffs and other\r\n    citizens, whilst perambulating the boundaries of the county of the\r\n    city, were by his desire invited to partake of refreshment in passing\r\n    by the hall at Earlham.  Besides those immediately connected with the\r\n    magistracy many others assembled, the whole company consisting of\r\n    about 800 persons.  On this occasion, Joseph John Gurney, in an\r\n    address to the mayor and corporation, urged the erection of a new\r\n    jail, and its establishment on better principles, with a view to the\r\n    employment of the prisoners, and the improvement of their morals;\r\n    enforcing his appeal by a reference to the extraordinary change that\r\n    had then recently taken place in Newgate, through the exertions of a\r\n    committee of ladies, and concluding by offering a donation of £100\r\n    towards the object.  The effort was not without fruit, though the\r\n    result was not immediately apparent.”\r\n\r\nThe editor of his Memoirs proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    “In the 8th and 9th month of this year (1818), in company with his\r\n    wife, his sister Elizabeth Fry, and one of her daughters, he took a\r\n    journey into Scotland, visiting many of the prisons both there and in\r\n    the north of England, besides attending many of the meetings of\r\n    Friends.  On this occasion, in conformity with the christian order\r\n    established in the Society of Friends, he was furnished with a minute\r\n    or testimonial expressing the concurrence of his Friends of his own\r\n    ‘Monthly Meeting’ in his prospects of religious service.”\r\n\r\nWe have now to view the philanthropist not only in the varied relations\r\nof private life, but also in the very important character of a christian\r\nminister.  He gradually became the most distinguished member of the\r\nSociety of Friends in all England, and he often delivered exceedingly\r\nimpressive discourses in Norwich and other large towns, preaching the\r\ngospel with a peculiar grace of manner which fascinated every audience.\r\nWe have often heard him preach before large congregations of educated\r\npeople in the Meeting House at Liverpool, and always with great effect.\r\nHis journal is full of details of his labours in all parts of England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland.  He became a Home Missionary, working hard at his\r\nown expense; but we must confine this brief sketch to his doings here in\r\nNorwich.  The death of his beloved wife at Earlham on October 6th, 1822,\r\nput his religious principle to the severest test, and in his letters he\r\nexpresses deep sorrow, but he was of too active a disposition to be long\r\nsubdued by grief.  During the few months succeeding his loss, he\r\ncontinued mostly at home in the enjoyment of the society of his sisters,\r\nCatherine and Rachel; his children becoming increasingly the objects of\r\nhis tender solicitude.  In the mean time, besides attending to the\r\nnecessary claims of business, and to the various public objects that had\r\nlong shared his interest, he devoted his leisure to study, finding\r\nrelief, as he intimates, “Not in the indulgence of sorrow, but in a\r\ndiligent attention to the calls of duty.”\r\n\r\nAfter giving many extracts from his journal, Mr. Braithwaite continues in\r\nreference to the anti-slavery agitation:—\r\n\r\n    “Retiring for a few days to Cromer Hall, he found a large and\r\n    interesting circle.  Amongst others, the late William Wilberforce and\r\n    Zachary Macaulay were there, deliberating with his brother-in-law\r\n    Thomas Fowell Buxton on the position and prospects of the\r\n    Anti-Slavery question.  It was the occasion on which the latter\r\n    appears to have arrived at his final decision, to accept the\r\n    responsible post of advocate of the cause as successor to\r\n    Wilberforce.  In this important undertaking, and throughout the\r\n    succeeding struggle, Joseph John Gurney gave him his warm and\r\n    efficient encouragement and support.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. J. Gurney, Mr. Clarkson, Mr. T. F. Buxton, Mr. Wilberforce, and\r\nothers, were earnest advocates for the total abolition of the slave trade\r\nand of slavery; and they attended many public meetings at which they\r\ndenounced and exposed the horrid traffic.  Ultimately, as we all know,\r\ntheir efforts were rewarded, by rousing public indignation to such a\r\npitch as to result in the passing of an act of parliament emancipating\r\nthe slaves in the West Indies, at a cost of twenty millions.\r\n\r\nThe panic in the monetary and commercial world, and the sudden run upon\r\nthe banks in London and the country, have rendered the winter of\r\n1825–1826 memorable.  As a banker, J. J. Gurney did not escape his share\r\nof anxiety, as appears from his journal, but his firm weathered the\r\nstorm.  Another circumstance was at this time deeply interesting to his\r\nfeelings, namely, his attachment to Mary Fowler, daughter of Rachel\r\nFowler, a cousin of his late wife.  After some correspondence he made\r\nMary Fowler an offer of marriage, which she accepted.  On July 18th,\r\n1827, they were married at Elm Grove.  On this interesting occasion, he\r\nremarks in his journal,—\r\n\r\n    “Bright, hopeful, and happy was our wedding day.  We dined on the\r\n    lawn, a large united company, and rejoiced together, I trust in the\r\n    Lord.  Mary and I left the party at Elm Grove, in the afternoon, for\r\n    North Devon.”\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Linton, and thence proceeded to Ilfracombe.  There they\r\nspent the honeymoon, and then the happy husband brought his second wife\r\nhome to Earlham, where they were received with joy.  After this he was\r\nvisited by many eminent characters at Earlham, including Dr. Chalmers,\r\nwho stayed with him several days.\r\n\r\n    “None can have attentively perused the foregoing pages” (says the\r\n    editor of the memoirs) “without perceiving that one leading feature\r\n    of Joseph John Gurneys character was an unweared active benevolence.\r\n    Like his sister, Elizabeth Fry, he seemed continually to live under a\r\n    deep sense of his responsibility towards others.  A cheerful and\r\n    bountiful giver, it was not merely by large pecuniary assistance that\r\n    he proved his interest in objects connected with the welfare of his\r\n    fellow-men: to these objects he was exemplary in devoting no common\r\n    share of his time and personal attention.  The steady devotion to the\r\n    Anti-slavery and Bible Societies is already before the reader.  In\r\n    addition to these great and often absorbing interests, his exertions\r\n    for the distressed labouring population of Norwich were unremitting.\r\n    Year after year, during the winter, or on any occasion when their\r\n    distress was aggravated by want of employment, he was at his post,\r\n    stirring up his fellow-citizens to the necessary measures for the\r\n    alleviation of their wants.  The District Visiting Society, which was\r\n    mainly instrumental in originating the Soup Society and the Coal\r\n    Society, found in him a steady and effective supporter.  Often would\r\n    he say that the painful consciousness of the poverty and suffering of\r\n    many thousands around him, almost prevented his enjoyment of the\r\n    abundant blessings with which he was himself so richly favoured.  On\r\n    one occasion he expended a considerable sum in providing the capital\r\n    for an attempt to supply the poor weavers and mechanics with\r\n    employment during a scarcity of work.  But, though like many similar\r\n    attempts, it failed to answer the expectation of the promoter, and\r\n    was abandoned, it served at least to furnish another proof of the\r\n    sincerity and earnestness with which he laboured for their welfare.\r\n\r\n    “The depressions in trade occasioned by the panic of 1825 will be\r\n    long remembered.  Norwich did not escape its influence.  As a banker,\r\n    Joseph John Gurney was more than usually absorbed in his own\r\n    immediate cares, but his heart at once turned towards his suffering\r\n    fellow-citizens.  ‘The dreadful distress,’ he writes to a friend,\r\n    ‘which prevails in the great mass of our once labouring, now, alas!\r\n    idle population, has been such as to call forth my strenuous efforts\r\n    on their behalf.  In this, success has been mercifully vouchsafed.\r\n    We have raised £3300 in five days.’\r\n\r\n    “One more illustration deserves notice.  In the winter of 1829–30,\r\n    the manufactures of Norwich were again greatly depressed.  The\r\n    weavers became unsettled, holding riotous meetings, and using\r\n    threatening language against their employers.  The state of things\r\n    was alarming.  J. J. Gurney felt it to be his duty to use his\r\n    influence in checking the spirit of discontent that was rapidly\r\n    spreading.  He attended one of the very large and tumultuous meetings\r\n    of the operatives, and endeavoured to persuade them to desist from\r\n    their disorderly proceedings, and quietly to resume their work.  With\r\n    a view of still further winning them by kindness, he invited a\r\n    deputation from those assembled to breakfast at Earlham on the\r\n    following morning.  Between forty and fifty of them came, with Dover,\r\n    a notorious Chartist leader, at their head.  After the usual family\r\n    reading of the Scriptures, they sat down to a plentiful repast which\r\n    had been provided for them in the large dining room, of which they\r\n    partook heartily; and their host afterwards addressed them in a kind,\r\n    conciliatory manner upon the subject of wages, and their duty to\r\n    their employers.  The men conducted themselves in an orderly manner\r\n    and appeared grateful for the attention shown them.  The scene was\r\n    not soon to be forgotten.”\r\n\r\nThe editor gives some illustrations of the philanthropist’s benevolent\r\ncharacter, by narrating instances of his visits to prisoners in the Jail,\r\nand to afflicted inmates of the Bethel and the Norfolk and Norwich\r\nHospital.  A volume might be filled by an account of his acts of private\r\nbenevolence, but we must pass on to more public matters.  He seldom took\r\nan active part in contested elections, but at the election in 1833, after\r\nthe passing of the Reform Act, the Whig candidates, one of whom was his\r\nnear relative, were defeated, chiefly, as was generally believed, through\r\nthe influence of bribery.  On this subject J. J. Gurney wrote,—\r\n\r\n    “As usual, I took little or no interest in the election, but when a\r\n    petition was presented to Parliament against the returned members on\r\n    the score of bribery, I imagined it to be my place to subscribe to\r\n    the object, and wrote a letter in the Norwich newspapers stating the\r\n    grounds of my so doing.  Those grounds were in no degree personal,\r\n    but simply moral and Christian.  But the appearance of evil was not\r\n    avoided.  The measure was construed into an act of political\r\n    partizanship; and I entirely lost ground by it in my own true\r\n    calling, that of promoting simple Christianity among all classes.”\r\n\r\nHe had thought of becoming a candidate for the representation of this\r\ncity, or some other place, in Parliament.  After some long conferences\r\nwith his friends he abandoned the idea and devoted himself to his higher\r\ncalling.  Mr. J. J. Gurney was a well-known Liberal in politics, but he\r\ndid not often speak at political meetings in this city.  His speeches\r\nwere always short and generally pertinent; and showed good sense\r\naccompanied with the seriousness of conviction.  On whatever side of any\r\nquestion he spoke he was listened to very attentively, and all parties\r\nbelieved that he delivered the unbiassed opinion of an honest man.  His\r\nconduct on every occasion gained him the esteem of all friends of civil\r\nand religious liberty.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, he was once more plunged into deep affliction by the long\r\nillness and death of his wife.  Her health had of late years been much\r\nimproved, and she had been unremitting in her attentions to his daughter\r\nduring her illness from typhus fever, without apparently suffering in\r\nconsequence.  The disease was, however, lurking in her constitution, and\r\nafter some time made its appearance.  The fever gradually gained ground,\r\nand she sank under it on Nov. 9th of that year.  She died happily, amid\r\nher mourning friends; and her husband knelt down at her bedside and\r\nreturned thanks for her deliverance from every trouble!\r\n\r\nHis journal contains many details of his visits to Manchester and\r\nLiverpool, of his journeys in Derbyshire and North Wales, of his journeys\r\nin Scotland and the north of England, of his voyage to America, of his\r\njourney to Ohio, Indiana, and North Carolina, of his journey from\r\nRichmond to Washington, of interviews with eminent statesmen, of labours\r\nat New York, of a voyage to the West Indies and proceedings there, of a\r\ntour on the continent, and of his return home.  But we cannot follow him\r\nin all his wanderings in many lands, where he went about doing good,\r\npromoting benevolent objects and preaching the gospel, his heart being\r\ntoo large to be confined to his native country, much less to his native\r\ncity.  On his return from the continent in 1841, he attended a meeting of\r\nthe Bible Society, and delivered his last great speech, which occupied\r\ntwo hours, on the state of religion in Europe.  A shorthand writer took\r\nnotes of that address, which was so full of information that it was\r\nafterwards published in the Journal of the Bible Society.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return home he married Eliza P. Kirkbridge.  The event\r\ntook place at Darlington, on October 10th, 1841, as noted in his journal.\r\nAfter the marriage he delivered an address on the “Victory which is of\r\nfaith.”  The dinner party was cheerful, and concluded with a short\r\nreligious service.  He and his bride parted from their friends, made a\r\nshort tour, and returned to Earlham, which they “reached in health and\r\ngreat peace, the place comfortable and homeish, and the reception from\r\nhis dearest children glowing.”\r\n\r\nJ. J. Gurney signed the total-abstinence pledge at the house of his\r\nfriend, Richard Dykes Alexander, at Ipswich, on April 8th, 1843.  He and\r\nhis wife attended a great “Teetotal Meeting” held at Norwich, on the\r\narrival of Father Mathew, on September 9th, that year.  The lord bishop,\r\nDr. Stanley, was present and requested J. J. Gurney to preside.  He did\r\nso, and declared himself to be a pledged teetotaller.  He spoke fully and\r\ncarefully on the subject, and the lord bishop afterwards expressed his\r\nadmiration of the apostle of temperance as the instrument of effecting so\r\nmuch moral good.\r\n\r\nAs a man of business, Mr. J. J. Gurney was ready, punctual, and\r\nattentive.  He was very modest, but of a candid and social disposition.\r\nThough in large or mixed companies he seldom appeared forward, yet in the\r\nsociety of his friends he was exceedingly agreeable.  In private life no\r\nman was more estimable as a husband, a father, a neighbour, and a friend.\r\nIn Norwich and in the surrounding district he was universally honoured\r\nand beloved.  He was a great reader of the bible, and he was regular and\r\nexact in family worship, but he was a stranger to bigotry, no stickler\r\nfor forms, and no friend to mysticism in matters of religion.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1846 was spent by the philanthropist quietly at home, with\r\nthe exception of engagements connected with the attendance of meetings of\r\nFriends, and with what proved to be a farewell visit to his beloved\r\ndaughter at Darlington, and to his friends in several places on his way\r\nhome.  He attended a committee of the Norwich District Visiting Society\r\non December 28th in that year, and on his return to Earlham he complained\r\nof great exhaustion, feverishness, &c.  A few simple remedies were\r\nadministered, but the uncomfortable symptoms remaining his medical man\r\nwas summoned on the following morning.  He pronounced it a slight bilious\r\nattack, and seemed to have no anxiety about the recovery.  The\r\nphilanthropist, however, gradually sank, apparently from exhaustion, and\r\nhe died on January 4th, 1847, in the 59th year of his age.  The news of\r\nhis death spread a gloom over the city, and the universal lamentations of\r\nthe citizens proved that they regarded him as a father and a friend, as\r\nindeed he had been to thousands of them.  The sensation in Norwich and\r\nits neighbourhood cannot easily be described, and is probably without\r\nprecedent in the case of a mere private individual.  During the entire\r\ninterval of seven days between his decease and the funeral, the\r\nhalf-closed shops and the darkened windows of the houses gave ample proof\r\nof the feelings of the inhabitants.  It furnished the principal topic of\r\nconversation in every family, in every private circle, in every group by\r\nthe wayside.  People of all ranks vied with each other in their eulogies\r\nof their departed friend.  Everyone had his own story to tell of some\r\npublic benefit, or of some private kindness which had been shown to\r\nothers or to himself.\r\n\r\nThe funeral, as might have been expected from this unusual public\r\nemotion, was an extraordinary scene.  All the shops were closed and all\r\nbusiness was suspended in the city.  A number of gentlemen, including the\r\nmayor, the ex-mayor, and the sheriff, went out in carriages as far as\r\nEarlham Hall.  The citizens generally formed the funeral procession, and\r\nfollowed the hearse and plain carriages from the hall to the burial place\r\nat the Gildencroft.  There was no pomp or parade, no mockery of woe.  A\r\nsimplicity in harmony with the character of the departed marked all the\r\narrangements.  As the procession moved on towards the city it was joined\r\nby an increasing number of the inhabitants, who issued forth in a\r\ncontinuous stream to pay their last tribute to the memory of departed\r\nworth.  Silently and sadly many stood while the hearse passed slowly by,\r\nand many a tearful countenance among the crowd bore testimony to their\r\nlove for the dead.  The procession gradually increased in numbers all the\r\nway to the Gildencroft, and after the thousands of people had gathered\r\nround the grave a profound silence ensued, which was at length broken by\r\na Friend repeating the verses, “O death, where is thy sting?  O grave,\r\nwhere is thy victory?” &c.  Another pause then took place, followed by\r\nanother address, and then the body was lowered into its last resting\r\nplace.  The circle of mourning relatives, including J. H. Gurney and his\r\nwife, the surrounding crowd of spectators—persons of all ranks, of all\r\nages, of all communions—magistrates and artizans, clergymen and\r\nNonconformists—representatives, in short, of the whole people of Norwich,\r\nnow took their last farewell of Joseph John Gurney, and slowly turned\r\ntowards the meeting house, where a meeting for worship was to be held.\r\nThe service was deeply impressive, and formed an appropriate conclusion\r\nto the solemn occasion.  At the Cathedral, on the following Sunday, the\r\ngood Bishop Stanley preached a funeral sermon before a large\r\ncongregation.  His text was “Watchman, what of the night?” and after\r\nenlarging on it, he alluded in a most pathetic and impressive manner to\r\nthe virtues of the deceased, and we never before saw so many people so\r\ndeeply moved.  The death of the beloved citizen was also publicly\r\nadverted to in most of the places of worship in Norwich.\r\n\r\nMr. J. J. Gurney was the author of various works, the most popular being\r\none on the _Evidences of Christianity_.  It is a production more\r\ncalculated to confirm the faith of a believer than to convert a free\r\nthinker who may not admit the possibility of anything supernatural.  He\r\nalso published a work on “The Vows and Practices of Friends;” “Essays on\r\nChristianity;” “Essays on the Moral Character of Christ,” and “Love to\r\nGod;” “The Papal and Hierarchical System compared with the Religion of\r\nthe New Testament, &c.”  His last and best work is entitled, “Thoughts on\r\nHabit and Discipline,” an excellent moral treatise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Bathurst_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Bathurst, LL.D., canon of Christchurch, rector of Cirencester, and\r\nprebend of Durham, was installed bishop of Norwich in 1805.  He was a\r\nprelate much esteemed and respected.  His christian deportment,\r\nconciliatory manners, and general benevolence, endeared him to this city\r\nand diocese.  He was eminently distinguished for his liberal sentiments,\r\nand for his attachment to the great principles of civil and religious\r\nliberty.  He was often seen walking arm in arm with Dissenters in our\r\nstreets.  He voted in the House of Peers for the Repeal of the Catholic\r\nDisabilities Bill, and also in favour of the Reform Bill.  This\r\ndisinterested and noble advocacy of liberal principles is thought to have\r\nstood in the way of his promotion to an archbishopric.  He died April\r\n7th, 1837, in the 93rd year of his age, and much lamented.  A statue to\r\nhis memory was placed in the choir of the Cathedral.  This beautiful work\r\nof art was the last work of Sir Francis Chantrey, and is executed in his\r\nmasterly style from a block of the purest Carrara marble.  It is placed\r\non a plain pedestal of white marble, and fixed in the recess at the foot\r\nof the altar steps, on the north side of the choir, commonly called Queen\r\nElizabeth’s seat, because she sat there when she visited Norwich.  The\r\nbishop is represented in a sitting posture, clothed in full\r\necclesiastical costume, and the artist has admirably succeeded in giving\r\nto his face that expression of benevolence for which he was so well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of the Latin inscription on the pedestal:—\r\n\r\n                               To the Memory of\r\n                     The Right Reverend Father in Christ,\r\n                     HENRY BATHURST, Doctor in Civil Law,\r\n                                     Who,\r\n                While for more than 30 years he presided over\r\n                                This Diocese,\r\n                    By his frankness and purity of heart,\r\n     Gentleness of manners, and pleasantness of conversation, attached to\r\n                        himself the good will of all:\r\n                                 His friends,\r\n            In testimony of their regret for one so much beloved,\r\n                    Have caused this effigy to be erected.\r\n                  He died 5 Ap. A.D. 1837, in the 93rd year\r\n                                 Of his age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Stanley_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Stanley was born January 1st, 1779, and became rector of Alderley, in\r\nCheshire.  After twice declining the office, he was installed bishop of\r\nNorwich, August 17th, 1837.  He ruled the diocese for twelve years, and\r\nwas highly esteemed by all sects for his unceasing efforts to promote the\r\nspiritual interests of every class of society, and his readiness on every\r\noccasion to co-operate with Dissenters in every good work.  He often\r\nattended their meetings to promote religious and benevolent objects.  In\r\none of his sermons he quoted the injunction “The servant of the Lord must\r\nnot strive, but be gentle unto all men; in meekness instructing those\r\nthat oppose themselves;” &c.  His subsequent conduct furnished ample\r\nevidence of the sincerity with which he obeyed this injunction; and\r\nalthough some of his clergy were somewhat estranged from him by his\r\nfrequent expressions of unbounded charity, yet all were obliged to esteem\r\nhim for his noble zeal and consistency of character.  He was\r\ndistinguished for his extensive liberality to the poor and his interest\r\nin their education.  He was often seen going about from school to school,\r\nand the kindliness of his heart was so well known to the children that\r\nthey sometimes pulled his coat behind to obtain his benignant smile,\r\nwhich to them was like sunshine after rain.  On all occasions he was\r\nearnest in his advocacy of civil and religious liberty, and active in his\r\nexertions on behalf of all benevolent associations, both of the Church\r\nand of Dissenters.  He was also a promoter of all literary institutions\r\nin the city and elsewhere, and often attended their anniversaries at\r\nwhich he delivered animated addresses.  He did not lay claim to the\r\ncharacter of a man of science; but astronomy, geology, botany, and\r\nnatural history were his favourite studies.  He was the author of two\r\ninteresting volumes on “The History of Birds,” which were published by\r\nthe Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge.  He was elected\r\npresident of the Linnæan Society, and he accepted an appointment as one\r\nof the commissioners chosen to inquire into the state of the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nBishop Stanley was so little of a bigot that he appeared once on the same\r\nplatform with Father Mathew, a Roman Catholic, at a temperance meeting in\r\nSt. Andrew’s Hall.  He then and there eulogised the apostle of\r\ntemperance, and advocated the cause with great eloquence.  On another\r\noccasion he invited Jenny Lind, now Madame Goldscmidt, to the palace,\r\nwhen she visited this city.  At the palace one evening, she sang before a\r\nlarge company.  When it became known that the lord bishop of the diocese\r\nhad actually entertained an operatic singer, great was the indignation of\r\nsome of the clergy.  This however did not at all distress the good\r\nbishop, who held on the even tenor of his way, doing good whenever he had\r\nan opportunity.  By his frequent earnest discourses in many churches in\r\nthis diocese, he caused quite a revival of religion among the clergy and\r\nchurch-going people.  He died, much lamented, on September 6th, 1849, in\r\nthe 70th year of his age, and he was buried in the middle of the nave of\r\nthe Cathedral, in the presence of thousands who had known and loved him.\r\nA short time after his decease, a slab to his memory was laid over his\r\ngrave, bearing the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n                          In the love of Christ\r\n                       Here rests from his labours\r\n                             EDWARD STANLEY,\r\n                   Thirty-two years Rector of Alderley,\r\n                     Twelve years Bishop of Norwich,\r\n                        Buried amidst the mourning\r\n                  Of the Diocese which he had animated,\r\n                      The City which he had served,\r\n                      The Poor whom he had visited,\r\n                    The Schools which he had fostered,\r\n                      The Family which he had loved,\r\n                         Of all Christian people\r\n               With whom, howsoever divided, he had joined\r\n                In whatsoever things were true and honest,\r\n                     And just, and pure, and lovely,\r\n                           And of good report.\r\n                         Born January 1st, 1779.\r\n                       Installed August 17th, 1837.\r\n                    Died September 6th, 1849, Aged 70.\r\n                       Buried September 21st, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Hinds_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Hinds, D.D., succeeded Bishop Stanley.  He was the sixty-seventh\r\nbishop of the diocese, and was installed on January 24th, 1850.  He was\r\nthe son of Abel and Elizabeth Thornhill Hinds, born Dec. 23rd, 1793, in\r\nBarbadoes; and at the age of twelve he was sent to England, to the school\r\nof Mr. Phillips, at Frenchay, near Bristol.  He entered at Baliol\r\nCollege, Oxford, but for want of rooms removed to Queen’s, graduated in\r\nhonours 1815 (second in classics), and in the year following he obtained\r\nthe Latin essay.  He returned to Barbadoes as a missionary and remained\r\nthere five years, the three latter as vice-principal of Codrington\r\nCollege.  After he returned to England he became vice-principal of Alban\r\nHall, Oxford; and he accompanied Archbishop Whately to Ireland, as his\r\nprivate chaplain.  He was subsequently presented with the living of\r\nYardley, in Herts., by Dr. Coplestone, bishop of Llandaff.  Dr. Hinds\r\nagain returned to Ireland, having been preferred to the living of\r\nCastlenock by Archbishop Whateley, and was chosen private chaplain to\r\nLord Clarendon, lord lieutenant of Ireland.  Hence he removed to the\r\ndeanery of Carlisle, but was scarcely settled there when he was appointed\r\nto the bishopric of Norwich.  He had previously refused the bishoprics of\r\nNew Zealand and Cork.  He laboured in this diocese for seven years, often\r\npreaching in the churches, attending religious meetings, and delivering\r\naddresses of a high character.  He generally preached at the\r\nanniversaries of the Church Associations in this city.  He resigned the\r\nsee of Norwich in April, 1857, and retired into private life.  His health\r\nis said to have been impaired by his arduous labours in conducting the\r\nOxford commissions which the government had entrusted to him, and which,\r\nadded to his duties in the diocese and the office of chaplain to the\r\nhouse of lords, proved too much for his constitution.  Dr. Hinds is\r\nperhaps the most learned of modern bishops.  His literary talents are\r\nconsiderable.  He is the author of the “Rise and Progress of\r\nChristianity,” first published in the “Enclyclopædia Metropolitana,” and\r\nconsidered a standard work, highly esteemed for its comprehensive views\r\nof religious truth.  The “Three Temples of the One God;” “Catechists’\r\nManual;” and “Inspirations of the Scriptures,” are works from his pen,\r\nwhich testify to his deep learning and great research.  He is the author\r\nof many beautiful poems and hymns, some of which are familiar to the\r\ncongregation at Norwich Cathedral, from being repeated in the service as\r\narranged to music.  The confirmation hymn is simple and appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Dalrymple_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a brief history of the _Norfolk and Norwich Hospital_, published by\r\nDr. Copeman, we find the following memoir of the subject of this notice:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Dalrymple was a native of Norwich, his father having removed\r\n    thither from Scotland.  He was born in 1772, and at an early age was\r\n    sent to the Grammar School at Aylsham, in Norfolk, from whence he was\r\n    removed to the Free School at Norwich, where he became a favourite\r\n    pupil of its then head master, the celebrated Dr. Parr.  Here he had\r\n    for a schoolfellow Dr. Maltby, and with both, Dr. Parr kept up a\r\n    friendly intercourse of visits to the latest period of his life.  It\r\n    affords a strong proof of Mr. Dalrymple’s early talents and his\r\n    industry in cultivating them, that, although in accordance with the\r\n    then custom of requiring medical apprenticeship to extend to seven\r\n    years, he was obliged to leave school at the age of fourteen, he had\r\n    yet attained such a proficiency in classical reading, and so correct\r\n    an appreciation of its beauties, that, amidst all the urgent and\r\n    various occupations and anxieties of his succeeding life, he found\r\n    the greatest relief to his toils in a recurrence to his favourite\r\n    authors.  His taste was scholarlike as well as scientific; his\r\n    conversation embued with classical allusion, and his felicity in\r\n    quotation remarkable. {527}\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Dalrymple was apprenticed in London, and studied at Guy’s and\r\n    St. Thomas’ Hospitals under Cline and Sir Astley Cooper.  He returned\r\n    to Norwich in 1793, and opened a surgery in his father’s house; and\r\n    although for several years his progress in establishing a practice\r\n    was slow, he at last attained the highest reputation as a surgeon in\r\n    his native city, and for many years enjoyed the confidence,\r\n    friendship, and patronage of a very large number of patients of every\r\n    grade of society and in every district of the county.\r\n\r\n    “In 1812 Mr. Dalrymple was elected assistant surgeon to the Norfolk\r\n    and Norwich Hospital, and two years afterwards succeeded to the full\r\n    surgeoncy, a post which he occupied with great credit to himself and\r\n    benefit to his profession until 1839, a period of twenty-five years.\r\n    He was then in the 67th year of his age, his powers were less\r\n    vigorous, and finding himself no longer equal to his hospital\r\n    practice, he resigned his position there, receiving a cordial\r\n    acknowledgment from the governors, of ‘the able, humane, and\r\n    successful exercise of his official duties,’ and being honoured by a\r\n    request to accept the appointment of honorary consulting surgeon.  In\r\n    1844 Mr. Dalrymple finally retired from professional life, and died\r\n    in London on the 5th of December, 1848, aged 75 years.\r\n\r\n    “From the year 1831 to 1835, I had ample opportunities, as house\r\n    surgeon of the hospital, of observing, and profiting by, the mode in\r\n    which the late Mr. Dalrymple performed his public professional duties\r\n    in that institution; and remember with pleasure and satisfaction,\r\n    that I was sometimes able to render assistance, and save trouble, to\r\n    one so deserving of the gratitude and goodwill of those with whom he\r\n    had to do.  At the period referred to, Mr. Dalrymple was beginning to\r\n    feel the burden of heavy surgical responsibilities more weighty than\r\n    his somewhat feeble frame would bear; his naturally acute sensibility\r\n    was increased by a measure of debility resulting from overmuch\r\n    professional occupation.  The sudden call to perform a serious and\r\n    difficult operation was accompanied sometimes with a degree of shock\r\n    to his nerves, which told upon him injuriously; and the desire he had\r\n    to save the life of the sufferer submitted to his charge (always a\r\n    predominant feeling in his mind,) would well-nigh overpower him with\r\n    emotion.  I have often heard him say that he was not able to sleep\r\n    the night before he had to perform the operation of lithotomy,\r\n    although in such cases his success was great; but he possessed so\r\n    much sympathy for his patient, and felt his own responsibility so\r\n    strongly, that he failed to secure to his mind that rest which alone\r\n    could have enabled him to meet the contingencies of his profession\r\n    with composure.  This nervous sensibility was due in part to original\r\n    constitution, and increased by professional toil.  Sometimes it\r\n    arises from defective knowledge, or from want of success; but so far\r\n    from either being the case with Mr. Dalrymple, his knowledge was\r\n    ample, the result of many years’ industrious application of a mind\r\n    capable of vast acquirements—sufficient to have given him confidence\r\n    in the treatment of any case submitted to his care; his success was\r\n    beyond that of many placed in similar circumstances; such, indeed, as\r\n    might fairly have been expected from one who had so much sympathy for\r\n    suffering humanity, and who devoted the whole energy of his mind to\r\n    devise means to relieve it.  For a long period no one but himself,\r\n    perhaps, was aware of the stress upon his feelings which his\r\n    professional duties, so well performed, were wont to occasion; and\r\n    when it did become apparent to others, it was delightful to witness\r\n    how pleased, how grateful, how kind in expression he was for any\r\n    attention, encouragement, or assistance offered him; and how highly\r\n    he estimated the friendship of those who watched an opportunity to\r\n    perform those little offices of kindness and consideration, which,\r\n    although difficult to be defined, can always be appreciated by a\r\n    sensitive mind and a feeling heart.\r\n\r\n    “The experience of a long and active professional life endued Mr.\r\n    Dalrymple with the valuable qualification of forming a right judgment\r\n    in cases of a complex and difficult nature, which was fully\r\n    appreciated and acknowledged.  The firmness and decision of his\r\n    opinion upon a difficult case, when once formed, could not fail to\r\n    impress the practitioner by whom he was consulted with confidence,\r\n    and his patient with the assurance that dependence might be placed\r\n    upon the result of his deliberations.\r\n\r\n    “No one who had the privilege of Mr. Dalrymple’s acquaintance can\r\n    think of him otherwise than as a kind friend, a highly intelligent\r\n    and well-informed man, an amusing and instructive companion, and a\r\n    profoundly gifted practitioner of the art and science it was the\r\n    business and happiness of his life to pursue.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Greene Crosse_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe make the following extracts from a memoir of Mr. Crosse published in\r\nDr. Copeman’s _History of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital_.\r\n\r\n    “John Greene Crosse was the second son of Mr. William Crosse, of\r\n    Finborough, in Suffolk, and was born on the 6th of September, 1790.\r\n    In order to make known some particulars of his early life and\r\n    education, I cannot do better than quote his own journal, which\r\n    contains many remarks upon the subject evidently intended to have\r\n    formed part of a history of his life.  In April, 1819, he penned the\r\n    following observations.\r\n\r\n    “‘I never went to boarding school, which contributed, with many other\r\n    occurrences of my subsequent life, to fix me in the unsocial habits\r\n    that hitherto never did and never will forsake me.  In my early\r\n    years, no classical learning, not a line of Latin, was taught at the\r\n    proximate market town to which I resorted as a daily pupil; and my\r\n    first lessons of reading, arithmetic, and writing were received from\r\n    a master of whom I entertained the greatest horror, for the ferocity\r\n    of his conduct, the severe discipline by which he drove into us the\r\n    simplest rudimental knowledge.  His stern brow, raucous voice, and\r\n    long cane, are now livelily depicted to my mind: how much I owe to\r\n    him, I am even now, with a long life in retrospect, unable to tell;\r\n    but I was glad when circumstances arose that released me from his\r\n    tutorage.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Very small matters, and such as we have no control over, and call\r\n    accidental because unable to trace the chain of causes giving rise to\r\n    them, influence our mortal destinies.  I had attained my 12th (?)\r\n    year, under such tremendous instruction as is related, when a Welsh\r\n    gentleman making some mistake at college (not implicating his good\r\n    character, an _informality_ I should call it) found it well to\r\n    rusticate; and taking with him his premature wife, sought a living by\r\n    opening a classical school in Stowmarket.  I became one of his early\r\n    pupils; and but for this good, easy man’s settling in the town,\r\n    should never have launched into such studies as Latin and Greek; of\r\n    which, it is true, I did not learn much, nor very accurately.  But he\r\n    was, nevertheless, a plodding, working man; an increasing family made\r\n    him exert his abilities to the utmost; and I got out of him all the\r\n    instruction I ever received as a school-boy in the learned languages.\r\n    When about fifteen years of age, returning from my daily school, in a\r\n    feat in jumping, I had the accident, I ought not perhaps to say the\r\n    misfortune, to break my leg.  The respectable village surgeon\r\n    attended me: he was one of the old school; of fine, soft, soothing\r\n    manners, clean dressed, with powdered head; rode slowly a very\r\n    well-looking horse; in short, he was a gentleman, and commanded the\r\n    respect of every one when he entered the house; he was also a skilful\r\n    and kind surgeon.  What wonder that the idea should be awakened in my\r\n    mind to be of the medical profession! to be as great a man as he—the\r\n    Village Doctor! to whom every one bowed, and who could relieve pain\r\n    and cure injuries so quickly and skilfully.  I had conceived an\r\n    object of ambition, and the idea never deserted me.  I was in a month\r\n    upon my crutches, and soon recovered; a surgical case fixed my future\r\n    destinies.’\r\n\r\n    “‘I persevered a few years longer at Latin, Greek, French, and\r\n    Euclid.  My father was successful and able now to place me out well;\r\n    wished me to be a lawyer, and I was for a time under the instruction\r\n    of a gentleman of that profession—attending bankruptcy meetings, and\r\n    feasting at midnight at the expense of the already distracted\r\n    creditors.  Those were good times for lawyers.  A learned chancellor,\r\n    whom I met on one such occasion, I well remember complimenting me on\r\n    my quickness in counting money; but all would not do, my mind was\r\n    prepossessed—I quitted the law to follow my inclination; I made my\r\n    own choice; it was a pledge to success.  The surgeon who cured my leg\r\n    agreed to take me as his first and only pupil, and I was accordingly\r\n    articled in due form for five years.’\r\n\r\n    “On the 27th of September, 1811, Mr. Crosse went to London for the\r\n    purpose of studying his profession in that Metropolis, and was the\r\n    following day introduced to Mr., afterwards Sir Charles Bell, whose\r\n    pupil he became, with whom he contracted a close intimacy, and of\r\n    whose merits as a teacher and man of science he always spoke in the\r\n    highest terms of respect and gratitude.  In the following January, he\r\n    entered to Abernethy’s Lectures; and in April, 1812, became a student\r\n    at St. George’s Hospital, where his industrious habits and\r\n    intelligence attracted the particular attention and marked notice of\r\n    the medical officers of that noble institution.  In the following\r\n    month, he entered as a pupil at the Lock Hospital; and in the course\r\n    of the year, officiated as House Surgeon during the temporary absence\r\n    of the gentleman who occupied that situation.  In the following\r\n    winter session, commencing October, 1812, he studied under Brodie,\r\n    Bell, Brande, Clarke, Home, and others; and remarks in his journal,\r\n    ‘very industrious all this winter, sitting up constantly till past\r\n    two a.m.’  In March, 1813, he became a dresser to Sir Everard Home at\r\n    St. George’s Hospital; attended Midwifery under Dr. Clarke; and on\r\n    the 16th of April, passed the College of Surgeons in London.  After a\r\n    short holiday, he returned to London on the 13th of May, and attended\r\n    the Eye Infirmary at Charter-house Square.  In June, he resigned his\r\n    dressership under Sir E. Home; became acquainted with the late Mr.\r\n    Travers, Abernethy, Sir W. Blizard, and Dr. Macartney, whom he agreed\r\n    to accompany to Dublin; and much of his spare time during this summer\r\n    was devoted to the study of German, a language he ever after\r\n    cultivated that he might enjoy the profundity and research of the\r\n    professional literature of that country.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Crosse left England for Dublin on the 2nd of October, 1813,\r\n    arriving there the following day.  In December he became Demonstrator\r\n    of Anatomy under Dr. Macartney, and remained there until October,\r\n    1814, when he returned to London, having received a very handsome\r\n    testimonial from the numerous students of the school in which he\r\n    taught, as to his ability and energy in the capacity of their\r\n    instructor in anatomy.\r\n\r\n    “On quitting Dublin, Mr. Crosse returned to Suffolk, and was\r\n    afterwards introduced to the late Dr. Rigby of Norwich.  In December\r\n    he went to Paris, where he remained until the end of February, 1815,\r\n    during which period he took French Lessons, wrote his Diary in the\r\n    French language, and availed himself of every possible opportunity of\r\n    increasing his professional knowledge.\r\n\r\n    “On the 29th of March, 1815, Mr. Crosse came to Norwich; and after\r\n    remaining one year in lodgings, took a house in St. Giles’, in which\r\n    he resided for many years.  He soon after published his “Sketches of\r\n    the Medical Schools of Paris,” and showed, both by his writings and\r\n    the industrious pursuit of his professional avocation, that he was\r\n    destined to arrive at considerable eminence in the locality he had\r\n    chosen for the arena of his future life.  On the 19th of July, 1823,\r\n    he was the successful candidate for the appointment of Assistant\r\n    Surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  So great was his desire\r\n    to become connected with the Hospital, and so strong the competition\r\n    in which he was engaged to obtain this object, that his health gave\r\n    way under the exertions he made to succeed; and he was obliged to\r\n    absent himself for a time, on which occasion he took a trip to\r\n    Holland, visiting Brighton on his return.  The result was favourable,\r\n    and he returned to Norwich in good health.  On the death of Mr. Bond,\r\n    in 1826, he was elected full Surgeon to the Hospital, and thus\r\n    attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition.\r\n\r\n    “The rapid rise and progress of Mr. Crosse’s reputation as a\r\n    professional man, and the large extent of his private practice, are\r\n    too well known to require further notice; but notwithstanding the\r\n    unremitting exertions required to fulfil his private engagements, he\r\n    never allowed them to interfere with his public duties; and the\r\n    devotedness of his service to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital was\r\n    remarkable.  It may be truly said that no private patient received\r\n    more kindness, skill, and attention at his hands, than did those who\r\n    were placed under his care in the wards of the Hospital.\r\n\r\n    “As an operating surgeon, Mr. Crosse had but few superiors, and not\r\n    many equals.  He was possessed of considerable manual tact and\r\n    dexterity, which, coupled with a sound judgment as to the necessity\r\n    for the performance of an operation, stamped him as a surgeon of\r\n    first-rate attainments.  In his early professional life he studied\r\n    anatomy with great assiduity, and his subsequent occupation as\r\n    Demonstrator of Anatomy at Dublin so impressed the subject upon his\r\n    memory, that the constitution and form of the human body were always\r\n    in his mind’s eye; and thus he was rendered equal, at all times and\r\n    upon all occasions, to the serious emergencies of surgery.  In short,\r\n    he obtained and held for a long period the foremost rank in his\r\n    profession in this district; and such was the quality of his mind,\r\n    that he would probably have been pre-eminent in whatever locality it\r\n    might have fallen to his lot to be placed.\r\n\r\n    “In 1819, Mr. Crosse published _A History of the Variolous Epidemic\r\n    of Norwich_, which has been, and is even now, quoted as an excellent\r\n    standard work.  In 1822 he published _Memoirs of the Life of the late\r\n    Dr. Rigby_, prefixed to the valuable Essay which the Doctor had\r\n    published some years before _On Uterine Hæmorrhage_.\r\n\r\n    “In 1835, the Jacksonian Prize was awarded him for his _Essay on the\r\n    Formation_, _Constituents_, _and Extraction of the Urinary Calculus_;\r\n    and in the same year he received, in consequence of this Essay, the\r\n    Diploma of M.D. from the University of Heidelberg.\r\n\r\n    “From 1822 to the close of his life, Mr. Crosse contributed many\r\n    valuable Papers to different medical periodicals, which are of deep\r\n    interest to professional men.\r\n\r\n    “In 1836, Mr. Crosse was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society—a\r\n    distinction which marked him for eminence throughout the whole\r\n    civilized world.  In 1845, the College of St. Andrew conferred the\r\n    Degree of M.D. upon him, and there is scarcely a medical or surgical\r\n    society in Europe of which he was not a member, as well as being an\r\n    honorary member of the most eminent societies in Asia and America.\r\n\r\n    “During the last year of Mr. Crosse’s life (1850), it became\r\n    painfully evident to his friends that he was gradually losing that\r\n    vigour of mind and body which had so long characterized him; and at\r\n    the urgent solicitation of his medical advisers, he was induced to\r\n    leave home for a few weeks, when he took the opportunity of\r\n    consulting Sir B. Brodie and Dr. Watson in London, and spent a short\r\n    time with the late Dr. Mackness at Hastings, of whose kindness he\r\n    afterwards spoke in the highest terms of gratitude.  On his return\r\n    home, he endeavoured to resume his professional and even his literary\r\n    avocations; but although in a degree benefited by his holiday, he\r\n    gradually lost power, and it was clear that his race was almost run.”\r\n\r\nHe died in his 60th year, having been a resident in Norwich 35 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Hooker_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorwich and Norfolk have produced an array of distinguished botanists,\r\nsuch as Smith, Turner, Lindley, and the elder Hooker.  The president of\r\nthe British Association for the Advancement of Science, Dr. Joseph D.\r\nHooker, F.R.S., is the son of Sir William J. Hooker, formerly Director of\r\nthe Royal Gardens at Kew, and he succeeded his father in that very\r\nimportant post on November 12th, 1865.  The present director of Kew\r\nsprung from a race of botanists.  His paternal grandfather, a citizen of\r\nNorwich, devoted his leisure to the cultivation of curious plants.  This\r\ncircumstance, doubtless, helped to create that taste for botany which, in\r\nthe career of his illustrious father, has borne such ripe fruits.  On the\r\nmaternal side, the grandfather of Dr. Hooker was Mr. Dawson Turner, of\r\nYarmouth.  The eldest daughter of this gentleman became the wife of Sir\r\nWilliam J. Hooker in 1814.  Mr. Turner’s is a well-known name in the\r\nannals of British botany; he is the author of various botanical\r\npublications, and it was at his suggestion that a narrative of a visit\r\nmade to Iceland in 1809 by his future son-in-law was given to the world,\r\na work which brought the name of Sir William J. Hooker prominently before\r\nthe scientific world.  So descended Dr. Joseph D. Hooker was born at\r\nHalesworth, in Suffolk, on June 30th, 1817.  Although thus by birth a\r\nnative of Suffolk, he is by descent a Norwich man.  He has been a great\r\nbotanical traveller in many parts of the world, and he has added greatly\r\nto our knowledge of the plants of Asia and India.  On August 19th, 1868,\r\nas President of the British Association, when the meeting took place in\r\nNorwich, he delivered the Inaugural Address in the Drill Hall before a\r\nlarge audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Opie_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmelia Opie was the daughter of Dr. Alderson, a physician in Norwich, and\r\nwas born here in 1769.  The varied circumstances of her early life gave\r\nthe bent to her after career.  In her girlhood she beguiled the solitude\r\nof her father’s summer house by composing songs and tragedies; on her\r\nvisits to London, the superior society into which the graces of her\r\nperson and the accomplishments of her mind introduced her, served to\r\nstimulate her aspirations; and after her marriage, in 1798, to the\r\npainter, Mr. John Opie, she was encouraged by her husband to become a\r\ncandidate for literary fame.  Accordingly, in 1801, she published a\r\nnovel, entitled _Father and Daughter_.  Although this tale showed no\r\nartistic ability in dealing either with incidents or with characters, yet\r\nit was the production of a lively fancy and a feeling heart, and speedily\r\nbrought its author into notice.  She was encouraged to publish a volume\r\nof sweet and graceful poems in 1802, and to persist in the kind of novel\r\nwriting which she had commenced so successfully.  _Adelaide Mowbray_\r\nfollowed in 1804, and _Simple Tales_ in 1806.  The death of her husband\r\nin 1807, and her return to Norwich, did not slacken her industry.  She\r\npublished _Temper_ in 1812, _Tales of Real Life_ in 1813, _Valentine’s\r\nEve_ in 1816, _Tales of the Heart_ in 1818, and _Madeline_ in 1822.  At\r\nlength, in 1825, her assumption of the tenets and garb of the Society of\r\nFriends checked her literary ardour, and changed her mode of life.\r\nNothing afterwards proceeded from her pen except a volume entitled\r\n_Detraction Displayed_, and some contributions in prose and verse to\r\nvarious periodicals.  A good deal of her life was spent in travelling and\r\nin the exercise of Christian benevolence.  When in this city she was\r\noften seen in the assize court, sitting near the judge.  She seemed to\r\ntake a great deal of interest in criminal cases.  She died here in 1853.\r\nA life of Mrs. Opie, by Miss C. L. Brightwell, was published in 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. William Crotch_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celebrated musician, William Crotch, was born in the parish of St.\r\nGeorge at Colegate in this city, July 5th, 1775.  His genius for music\r\nmay be supposed to have commenced with his existence, as his parents did\r\nnot remember any period in which he did not shew a great predilection for\r\nan organ, to which instrument he seemed to have a special attachment.\r\nIndeed he had a _penchant_ for every musical instrument at an early age.\r\nAs soon as he could walk alone, which was at the beginning of his second\r\nyear, he would frequently quit his mother’s breast to hear a tune on the\r\norgan, and when he wanted any particular tune, he would put his finger\r\nupon that key on which the tune began; and as it sometimes happened that\r\nmore than one tune began on the same key, he would strike two or three of\r\nthe first or leading notes of the tune he chose to have played.  Before\r\nhe was two years and a quarter old, he played “God save the King” with\r\nboth hands.  At two years and a half he had played to several ladies and\r\ngentlemen, and was soon afterwards noticed in the public journals.  At\r\ntwo and three quarters he could distinguish any note, and call it by its\r\nproper name, though he did not see it struck.  His memory was so\r\nretentive, that a gentleman only playing to him the Minuet in _Rodelinda_\r\ntwo or three times in the evening, was astonished to hear him perform it\r\nnext morning, as soon as he went to the organ.  Before he was three years\r\nold, he played at Beccles, Ipswich, and other places.  Afterwards he was\r\ntaken to Lynn, Bury, &c., and in October, 1778, to Cambridge.  In\r\nNovember, he was nominated to a degree of Bachelor of Arts, with a small\r\nannuity annexed to it.  In December he went to London, and after\r\nperforming before the foreign ambassadors, maids of honour, &c., in 1779,\r\nhe was introduced to the sovereign, to whom he gave the greatest\r\nsatisfaction, as he had done to the nobility and gentry in general, but\r\nmore particularly to the greatest musicians.  At the early age of 22 he\r\nwas appointed professor of music in the University of Oxford, and there,\r\nin 1799, took his degree of doctor in that art.  In 1800 and the four\r\nfollowing years, he read lectures on music at Oxford.  Next he was\r\nappointed lecturer on music at the Royal Institution; and subsequently,\r\nin 1823, principal of the Royal Academy of Music.  He published a number\r\nof vocal and instrumental compositions, of which the best is his oratorio\r\nof “Palestine.”  In 1831 appeared an octavo volume, containing the\r\nsubstance of his lectures on music, delivered at Oxford and in London.\r\nHe also published “Elements of Musical Composition and Thorough Bass.”\r\nHe arranged for the piano-forte a number of Handel’s oratorios and\r\noperas, besides symphonies and quartetts of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.\r\nHe performed all his public duties laboriously, zealously, and\r\nhonourably, and in private life he was much beloved.  He died on December\r\n29th, 1847, in the house of his son, at Taunton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nNorwich Artists in the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH artists must have flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries, as\r\nproved by their portraits of city worthies in the Guildhall and St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall, but we have few notices of early painters or engravers.\r\nAbout the commencement of the present century, a gentleman named Thomas\r\nHarvey lived at Catton, and was recognised as a very clever amateur\r\nartist.  He painted in oil, admirably, and he induced several of the\r\nleading artists of the day to visit Norfolk, such as Opie, Gainsborough,\r\nSir William Beechey, Collins, and many others, who produced beautiful\r\nworks of art.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1802, a few professional and amateur artists, drawn\r\ntogether by a similarity of taste and inclination, for the advancement of\r\nthe arts of painting and design in their native city, began to associate\r\nto form a regular academy.  Each member in his turn furnished matter of\r\ndiscussion according with his particular view; and by eliciting the\r\nopinions of his brother artists, mutually communicated and received\r\ninformation.  The first exhibition of this society was in 1805, in\r\nWrench’s Court, and contained 223 pictures.  The following is a list of\r\nthe members and exhibitors of the Norwich Society of Artists from the\r\nfirst catalogue of 1805:—Arthur Browne, J. Blake, E. Bell, (engraver)\r\nMrs. Coppin, H. M. M. Crotch, M. B. Crotch, J. Crome, R. Dixon, J.\r\nFreeman, W. Freeman, Rev. Wm. Gordon of Saxlingham, C. Hodgson, W.\r\nHarwin, R. Ladbrooke, W. C Leeds, J. Percy, J. Thirtle, F. Stone,\r\narchitect.  This Society of Artists, after their establishment, within\r\ntwenty years exhibited about 4000 pictures, the productions of 323\r\npainters, very few of which were sold here, but which were readily\r\npurchased in London and other places.  In fact, the local artists were\r\nvery little patronized in the city; and old Crome, one of the very best\r\nlandscape painters in England, was a very poor man all his life, though,\r\nsince his death, his pictures have been sold for thousands of pounds in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nJOHN CROME, sen., was born December 21st, 1769, in the parish of St.\r\nPeter per Mountergate.  He was apprenticed to Mr. Francis Whisler, coach,\r\nhouse, and sign painter, who, in 1783, lived in Bethel Street; but he\r\nfelt the true impulse of genius, and his industry surmounted all\r\nobstacles.  By almost unaided exertions he cultivated drawing and\r\npainting in oil with such ardour and success, that during the latter\r\nyears of his life he had attained an eminence highly creditable, and was\r\nincessantly employed as a master in the one branch by families of\r\ndistinction, and by the principal schools of Norfolk and Norwich.  He\r\npossessed the rare faculty of communicating the ardour he himself felt to\r\nhis pupils, both professional and amateur.  His mind was too acute to\r\nexact from them a servile imitation of his own style; on the contrary he\r\ncontented himself with instilling the more useful principles of art, and\r\nwith giving freedom and spirit to their pencils.  He then invited them to\r\nlet loose the reins of fancy and taste, and to follow unfettered the\r\npromptings of imagination.  The fruits of this wise discrimination were\r\nseen in the reputation of his son, and his companions in excellence,\r\nwhose works for some time attracted much attention in the metropolis to\r\nthe growing talents and promise of the Norwich school of artists.  In the\r\nother department he was seldom without commissions.  He principally\r\ncultivated landscape painting, and he was exceedingly happy in seizing\r\nsmall picturesque local scenes, which he elevated to a degree of interest\r\nwhich they could hardly bear in their natural state.  He was in painting\r\nthe counterpart of Burns in poetry, both delighting in homely scenes.\r\nHis pictures were beginning to be known and appreciated in London, the\r\ngreat mart of talent, and those he last exhibited in the British Gallery\r\ngained him a lasting fame.  He was a man of heart, of impulse and\r\nfeeling, quick, lively, and enthusiastic, and in his conversation\r\nanimated to a high degree, especially when speaking on subjects connected\r\nwith his art, the fond, the incessant, the earliest and latest object of\r\nhis thoughts.  A wide field of enterprise and exertion had just opened\r\nupon his view, the last stage of his ardent ambition had unfolded itself,\r\nwhen he was suddenly seized with an acute disease, which terminated his\r\nlife in the short space of seven days, on April 22nd, 1821, aged fifty\r\nyears.  He was buried in a vault in St. George’s Colegate Church, where\r\nthe last sad offices of respect were paid to his memory by a numerous\r\nattendance of artists and other friends.  Of late years a subscription\r\nwas raised here for a monument to his memory, and after some delay a\r\nsuitable memorial was placed in the church.  (_See page_ 89.)\r\n\r\nThe following list of Mr. Crome’s principal pictures, with their former\r\npossessors, was extracted from the published catalogue of his works:—\r\n\r\n“Lane Scene near Hingham,” 1812; “Lane Scene at Blofield,” 1813; and\r\n“Grove Scene near Marlingford,” 1815—Samuel Paget, Esq., of Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n“View at the back of the New Mills,” 1817—William Hawkes, Esq., Norwich.\r\n\r\n“Wood and Water Scene near Bawburgh,” 1821—Miss Burrows, Burfield Hall.\r\n\r\n“View in Postwick Grove,” 1816—Lord Stafford.\r\n\r\n“Hautbois Common, Norfolk,” 1810—Mr. F. Stone, Norwich.\r\n\r\n“Lane Scene near Whitlingham,” 1820—Mr. Charles Turner.\r\n\r\n“Scene near Hardingham, Norfolk,” 1816—Mr. J. B. Crome.\r\n\r\n“Lane Scene,” 1817—John Bracy, Esq.\r\n\r\n“Carrow Abbey,” 1805—P. M. Martineau, Esq.\r\n\r\n“Cottage and Wood Scene,” 1820—Michael Bland, Esq., London.\r\n\r\n“Landscape—Evening”—Mr. Crome.\r\n\r\n“Grove Scene,” 1820—Mr. F. Geldart, jun.\r\n\r\n“View of the Italian Boulevards at Paris,” 1815; and “Fish Market at\r\nBoulogne,” 1820—R. H. Gurney, Esq.\r\n\r\nA “Wood Scene” was the last picture painted by Old Crome, in April, 1821.\r\nHe painted many others, and etched a number of plates of Norfolk scenery,\r\nsome of which have been printed.  His pictures have been lent for various\r\nexhibitions and always much admired.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nJ. B. CROME, son of the father of the Norwich School of Landscape\r\nPainting, was a landscape painter of moonlights, &c.  The editor of the\r\n_Examiner_ for March, 1828, speaking of this artist’s pictures, says:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Crome’s moonlight is good, and has the grey and brown hues of\r\n    Vanderneer, whose moonlight scenes have been considered the best as\r\n    to natural effects; but except the parts under the immediate light of\r\n    the moon, no specific colour should be seen.  The browns and yellows\r\n    here mingle well into the black shades of night, and have nothing of\r\n    that flat grey blue which justly made coloured moonlights to be\r\n    compared to a shilling on a slate.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Crome’s pictures were “Rouen,” in the possession of Mrs.\r\nSouthwell, Wroxham; “Yarmouth Quay”—T. Cobbold, Esq., Catton; “Yarmouth\r\nBeach, Moonlight”—R. J. Turner, Esq., Catton; “View near Amsterdam,\r\nMoonlight”—J. Geldart, Esq., Norwich; “Norwich by Moonlight”—Hon. General\r\nWalpole; “Moonlight”—C. Turner, Esq., Norwich.  Several others of this\r\nartist’s pictures were exhibited at the Norwich Industrial Exhibition in\r\n1867, and were much admired.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nMISS CROME, daughter of Old Crome, was a painter of fruit and flowers\r\nfrom nature, and painted successfully.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CLOVER was a native of this city, but he resided some time in\r\nLondon.  His first efforts in art were directed to engraving, and by the\r\nadvice of a gentleman named Stocks, he took an impression of one of his\r\nplates to the late Alderman Boydell, in Cheapside, whose remarks on this\r\nperformance discouraged him from following the profession of an engraver,\r\nand he remained for some time undetermined as to his further pursuit in\r\nart, until the following autumn, when being introduced by his uncle to\r\nthe late Mr. Opie, whilst painting a portrait of that relation, he was so\r\nastonished at the facility with which the artist painted, and so\r\ndelighted with his conversation, that he resolved from that moment to be\r\na painter.  He took Mr. Opie’s advice and followed him to town, from\r\nwhich period, namely, April, 1807, being nearly four years, he enjoyed\r\nthat artist’s friendship.  In the year 1806, Mr. Clover was accidentally\r\nintroduced to the late Richard Cumberland, the dramatic poet, who\r\nperceiving that the artist’s health was much impaired by a too close\r\napplication to study, invited him to his house at Ramsgate, and by his\r\nintroduction he painted several portraits, and to the hospitable\r\nresidence of this gentleman he repeated his visits during the summer\r\nmonths for fourteen years.  In Norwich, he painted three full-length\r\nportraits for St. Andrew’s Hall, besides a number of others, and a\r\npicture called “Divided Attention,” for his friend Mr. Turner, of\r\nNorwich.  This first-rate picture excited much interest in London.  Some\r\nof the early pictures of this artist were at Beau Port, the house of the\r\nlate Sir James Bland Burgess, and at Battle Abbey in Sussex.\r\nSubsequently Mr. Clover had the honour of being patronised by the Marquis\r\nof Stafford and other noblemen.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ROBERT DIXON was a native of this city.  His etchings of views in\r\nNorfolk were in the possession of many persons in Norwich.  Mr. Charles\r\nTurner had an interesting collection of his drawings.  As a scene painter\r\nhe was much admired.  He had many tempting offers from the London and\r\nother managers of theatres; but being fondly and firmly attached to his\r\nnative city and a choice circle of friends, no allurements could induce\r\nhim to leave them.  He was very popular as a teacher of drawing.  He died\r\nOctober 1st, 1815.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nCHARLES HODGSON, a native of this city, was a painter of interior\r\narchitecture, particularly of the early English style, and of\r\nconsiderable reputation for his excellent drawing and correct perspective\r\nin water colours, which subjects he was afterwards induced to paint in\r\noil, in which he excelled.  He was a constant exhibitor in the London\r\nexhibitions.  His pictures were in the possession of several gentlemen in\r\nthe city and county.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nDAVID HODGSON, son of the above, a native also of this city, was a\r\npainter of exterior architecture, landscape, &c.  Some of his pictures of\r\ninteriors of churches were in the possession of William Herring, Esq.,\r\nNorwich; Pair of Landscapes, W. Roberts, Esq., of Birmingham; Large\r\nLandscape, Rev. J. Hollingworth, Newcastle; Small Landscape, Wm. Gate,\r\nEsq., Carlisle; Market Scenes, T. Bignold, Esq., Norwich; Landscape, Mr.\r\nS. Coleman; Pair of Small Landscapes, Mr. Stone, Norwich; Tombland, Mr.\r\nStone; Landscape, Mr. G.

His subjects were generally finely chosen, and\r\npainted with all the truth and transparency of nature.  The grouping of\r\nhis vessels displayed an admirable taste, and they were embellished with\r\nthe most correctly-drawn figures, highly characteristic of the stations\r\nthey occupied.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nMRS. STANNARD, wife of the above, was a painter of fruit, flowers, fish,\r\nstill life, &c.  Her maiden name was Coppin, and her mother was rewarded\r\nby the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, for several copies of\r\npainting.  The daughter’s productions were highly esteemed by the lovers\r\nof art.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nALFRED STANNARD.  The talents of this artist, at an early period of his\r\nlife, gained him the approbation of the critics of the London\r\nJournals—which noticed works of fine arts as exhibited in the National\r\nGallery.  The _Literary Gazette_ of March, 1828, contained this notice,—\r\n\r\n    “No. 152, Trowse Hall, Norwich, painted on the spot by A. Stannard.\r\n    We think that this work partakes more of the Flemish style of art\r\n    than legitimately belongs to a picture painted on the spot; its\r\n    elaborate finish must necessarily have required considerable time in\r\n    the execution; and the character of our climate is much too variable,\r\n    day after day, to paint from the same hue of atmosphere, and the same\r\n    effect of Chiaroscuro.  Be that as it may, the excellence of the\r\n    performance, however it may have been achieved, is an abundantly\r\n    sufficient passport to regard of this artist’s picture.  No. 431,\r\n    Sluice Gate, on the river Wensum, shews the close resemblance of\r\n    character and execution between the works of some of our artists and\r\n    the best pictures of the Flemish school.”\r\n\r\nThe critic might have added that most of the people of Norwich are of\r\nFlemish or Danish extraction, and that the Norwich school of painting\r\nseems to have been derived from the Flemish school.  The subjects\r\npainted, and the style of treatment are very similar.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nJAMES STARK was articled to the senior Crome for three years, from 1810\r\nor 1811, at the expiration of which time he went to London and drew at\r\nthe Royal Academy, which place he was obliged to leave from ill health.\r\nThe first picture which he exhibited at the British Gallery, represented\r\n“Boys Bathing,” purchased by the Bishop of Oxford.  His other pictures\r\nwere “Flounder Fishing,” in the possession of Sir J. Grey Egleton, Bart.;\r\n“Penning the Flock,” the Marquis of Stafford; “Lambeth,” the Countess de\r\nGrey; “Grove Scene,” Thomas Phillips, Esq.; “Grove Scene,” Francis\r\nChantrey, Sculptor; besides many others in the possession of George\r\nWatson Taylor, Esq., M.P.; Mr. Davenport, M.P.; Charles Savill Onley,\r\nEsq., M.P.; Onley Savill Onley, Esq.; &c., &c.  In 1827, this artist\r\ncirculated proposals for printing “Scenery of the Rivers Yare and\r\nWaveney,” with engravings from his own paintings, and the work was\r\nbeautifully carried out.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nJ. S. COTMAN became one of the most celebrated artists in the Water\r\nColour Society, and attained a very high position in London, where he was\r\nappointed Drawing Master at King’s College; he published Views in\r\nNormandy, and also a work on the Sepulchral Brasses of this locality.\r\nHis pictures have always commanded high prices.  His two sons also became\r\neminent artists.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1830, there was something like a School of Art commenced\r\nin Norwich, where artists and amateurs could study art in a proper\r\nmanner, from the best casts of the finest statues.  Before then, artists\r\nhad to study as they best could, and their education was very imperfect.\r\nThey are much indebted to John Barwell, Esq., for promoting their\r\ninterests in this respect, and rendering them great assistance by his\r\nknowledge of art.  Amongst the members of the new society were the\r\nBarwells, father and son, the Cotmans, the Freemans, T. Geldart, A.\r\nSandys, S. Miers, and many others who studied art either from the cast or\r\nthe life.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk and Norwich Art Union opened their exhibition of pictures on\r\nAugust 16th, 1839, at the Bazaar, in St. Andrew’s Broad Street.  About\r\n400 pictures were exhibited, many of them being of a high order of merit.\r\nAt subsequent exhibitions, many pictures of local artists were exhibited,\r\nincluding some of the Cromes, the Ladbrookes, the Stannards, the Cotmans,\r\nHodgson, Stark, Vincent, Downes, Sandys, Capt. Roberts, and others much\r\nadmired.  A Fine Art Association has also been recently established.  It\r\nheld its first exhibition in August, 1868.  A large number of the\r\npictures were disposed of on the principle of an Art Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nThe Commercial History of Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT has been the trade of the city, from the earliest period up to the\r\npresent time, is an interesting subject of inquiry to the inhabitants.\r\nThe sources of information are very scanty, for local historians of\r\nformer days did not trouble themselves much about trade, but were content\r\nwith simply recording passing events and the proceedings of public\r\nbodies.  From old charters and acts of parliament, and details of local\r\ntaxation, we may, however, learn something about the industry and trade\r\nof by gone ages.  We may discover how people lived, how they were\r\nemployed, and what sort of clothes they wore; and we shall find a\r\nremarkable sameness from age to age.  The trade of any country, or\r\ncounty, or town, arises from productive industry in agriculture or\r\nmanufactures, or in mercantile business, or in carrying goods from one\r\nplace to another, or in all three combined.  All three have existed in\r\nthis city and county; and it is important to inquire into the past and\r\npresent state of our trade, and the causes which have promoted or\r\nretarded its progress or decline.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXTILE FABRICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn tracing the rise and progress of manufactures in this city, it will be\r\nnecessary to refer to many sources of information respecting the garments\r\nworn by the people of every period.  The Roman writers supply some\r\ninformation relating to the Iceni and other aborigines of this island;\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon illuminations represent the costumes of a later period;\r\nmonumental effigies exhibit the clothing of the middle ages; and many\r\nacts of parliament allude to the manufactures of modern times.  The arts\r\nof spinning, weaving, dyeing, and dressing wool, linen, and silk, were\r\nknown to all ancient civilized nations.  The Gauls taught those arts to\r\nthe ancient Britons in this island.  Of the kinds of cloth made in Gaul,\r\naccording to Pliny, one was made of fine wool dyed in several colours.\r\nThis wool, being spun into yarn, was woven in stripes or checquers, of\r\nwhich the Gauls made their summer garments.  Here we have the origin of\r\nthe Scotch plaid or tartan, which is called the garb of old Gaul to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the ancient British females may be ascertained from the\r\naccount by Dion Cassius of the appearance of Boadicea, Queen of the\r\nIceni, who inhabited this eastern district.  Her light hair fell upon her\r\nshoulders.  She wore a torque of gold, a tunic of several colours all in\r\nfolds, and over it a robe of coarse stuff, fastened by a brooch.  The\r\ncommonalty and the less civilized tribes, inhabiting the interior of the\r\nisland, went about simply clad in skins.  The Druids wore white dresses,\r\nand the Bards a robe of sky blue, emblematic of peace.  The Ovates,\r\nprofessing to know medicine, wore green, the symbol of learning.  Julius\r\nAgricola being appointed to the command in Britain, A.D. 78, soon\r\nsucceeded in establishing the Roman sway, and introducing the Roman\r\ncostume, manners, and language; and before the close of the first century\r\nthe British habit was regarded as a badge of barbarism.  Tacitus says,\r\n“The sons of the British chiefs began to affect our dress.”  The southern\r\nand eastern Britons disused the Broccoe, and wore the Roman tunic\r\nreaching to the knee, with the cloak or mantle.  The female garb was\r\nsimilar to that of the Roman women, who wore two tunics.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo Saxons, Jutes, and Danes, when located in different parts of\r\nEngland, spun and wove most of the materials now used for dress.  The\r\nwoollen, linen, and silk yarns were all home-spun, and the textile\r\nfabrics were home-made.  The civil costume consisted of a linen shirt, a\r\ntunic of linen or woollen, worn according to the season, descending to\r\nthe knee, and having long loose sleeves.  It was made like the shirt, and\r\nopen at the neck, and put on in the same manner.  It was sometimes open\r\nat the sides and confined by a belt or girdle at the waist.  Over this a\r\nshort cloak was worn fastened with brooches, sometimes at the breast,\r\nsometimes on both shoulders.\r\n\r\nMr. Strutt remarks that the silence of the Anglo-Saxon writers on the\r\nsubject of Danish dress, while they are profuse in the description of the\r\ndress of their countrymen, proves a similarity of costume.  According to\r\nDanish ballads, black was the colour of the ancient Danish dress.  Saxon\r\nchronicles allude to the Danes by the name of the “Black Army.”  Black\r\namongst them had no funeral associations.  This sombre hue may have been\r\ntheir national colour, their standard being a raven.  After becoming\r\nsettled in Norwich and Norfolk, they doffed the black colour, and became\r\neffeminately gay in their dress, and often changed their attire.\r\n\r\nThe Normans and Flemings who came over with the Conqueror into England,\r\nand those who followed him in great numbers, were remarkable for their\r\nlove of finery, according to our early historians.  The dresses of the\r\ncommon people of course continued to be much the same from age to age,\r\nbut the habits of the nobility were more influenced by fashion; and the\r\nreign of William Rufus is stigmatised by many writers of the period for\r\nshameful abuses.  The king himself set the example, and the clergy and\r\nlaity were alike infected with the love of costly clothing.  After the\r\nNorman Conquest, a sort of cloth was introduced which, though not a new\r\ndiscovery, had not been formerly known in England.  This was quite a\r\ndifferent article to what had been previously called cloth, the\r\npreparation being by a combing instead of a carding process.  By the\r\nformer the wool was drawn out to a very long staple, by the latter to a\r\nvery short staple, the fibres of the fleece being extended the whole\r\nlength in one instance, and broken and intersected in the other.  For\r\n1000 years after the christian era there were no textile manufactures as\r\nwe now understand the terms.  All the yarns were homespun, and all the\r\ngarments were home-made.\r\n\r\nThe female costume in Norwich and other towns, from 1087 to 1154,\r\npresents us with but one striking novelty, and that by no means an\r\nimprovement.  The rage for lengthening every portion of the dress was not\r\nconfined to the male sex.  The sleeves of the ladies’ tunics, and their\r\nveils or kerchiefs, appear to have been so long in the reigns of William\r\nRufus and Henry I. as to be tied up in knots, to avoid treading on them,\r\nand the trains or skirts of the garments lay in immense rolls at the\r\nfeet.  Over the long robe or tunic a shorter garment was occasionally\r\nseen in the illuminations of the period.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth century is a period in which Norwich began to be particularly\r\nmentioned for its trade arising from manufactures.  It is also a period\r\nwhen a very valuable source of information is opened by the monumental\r\neffigies of the dead, sculptured in their habits as they lived.  The\r\neffigies on brass are numerous in Norwich and Norfolk churches, and\r\nindicate progress in useful arts.  Mr. Stothard is a great authority on\r\nthe monumental effigies of Great Britain, and he presents the coronation\r\nrobes of the kings, and the costumes of the nobles with splendid\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch and the Flemings soon came over the sea, located themselves in\r\nthe city and in different parts of the eastern counties, and introduced\r\nvarious manufactures.  William of Malmesbury states that in the reign of\r\nthe Conqueror’s youngest son, Henry I., a great inundation in the low\r\ncountries drove many more of the Flemings to seek refuge in England; and\r\nBlomefield, in his History of Norfolk, says that several of them settled\r\nat Worstead in Norfolk, and thus early introduced the art of stuff\r\nweaving there; which, as is natural to suppose, soon began to be\r\nextensively adopted in Norwich.  Gervase, of Tilbury, writing of the\r\nFlemings says,—\r\n\r\n    “The art of weaving seemed to be a peculiar gift bestowed upon them\r\n    by nature; yet the new comers were not always well received by the\r\n    native population, and had to be protected by laws made in their\r\n    favour.  Indeed, the natives of Norwich, in every period, have been\r\n    hostile to foreigners, or to any sort of interference with their\r\n    peculiar branch of industry.”\r\n\r\nIn the next reign, that of Henry II., “Guilds” of weavers were\r\nmultiplied, and had their charters of privilege in London, York,\r\nWinchester, and Norwich; and a system of protection, originating with\r\nmanufacturers, prevailed all over the country.  During the next reign,\r\nthat of Stephen, more Flemish weavers came over; and these successive\r\nemigrations were a real blessing to the land.  England had hitherto not\r\nbeen a manufacturing country till the arrival of the Flemings, who\r\nintroduced the preparation and weaving of wool, so that, in process of\r\ntime, not only the home market was abundantly supplied with woollen\r\ncloth, but a large surplus was made for exportation.  The Flemings were\r\nkinsmen of the Danes, and all of them were of the Anglo-Saxon race, and\r\nwere distinguished for that probity in their dealings which afterwards\r\nbecame the characteristic of British merchants.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Richard Cœur de Lion, it is supposed that though the\r\ntrade of the kingdom did not increase, yet some of the artisan soldiers\r\nwho returned from the crusades brought back a knowledge of the eastern\r\nmethod of weaving.  At that time the useful arts flourished in the east.\r\nThe improvements introduced here were, however, of little worth, owing to\r\nthe troubles of the reign of King John, and the equally disturbed reign\r\nof his son Henry III.  Even the wise and resolute king, Edward I., did\r\nnot fully succeed in restoring English trade to its former prosperity.\r\nYet it is clear that this city had been all along prospering, for in the\r\nreign of Edward II., repeated mention is made of its thrift.  That\r\nmonarch granted a patent to John Peacock for measuring every piece of\r\nworsted made in the city or county; but this, being found to check the\r\ntrade, was soon recalled.  In the reign of Edward I. the people of\r\nNorwich, and of England generally, began to adopt the whimsical fashions\r\nof their neighbours on the continent.  Horned head-dresses of frightful\r\nappearance were worn by the ladies, and tight-laced stays.  Gauze, which\r\nis thought to have derived its name from Gaza, where it was first made,\r\nand brunetta or burnetta, with several other fine and delicate stuffs,\r\nare mentioned in this period.  Gauzes were afterwards produced in large\r\nquantities in Norwich.  Tartan was a fine woollen cloth, which was also\r\nmuch used for ladies’ robes, and was generally of a scarlet dye.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the materials for dress became more numerous,\r\nand this period is more remarkable for the splendour of costume than for\r\nchange of form.  Matthew Paris, monk of St. Albany, a contemporary\r\nhistorian, describes the pageantry of the day, and expresses disgust\r\nrather than pleasure at the excessive foppery of the times.  He states\r\nthat the nobility who attended at the marriage of the daughter of Henry\r\nIII. to Alexander king of Scotland, were attired in vestments of silk,\r\ncommonly called comtises, on the day when the ceremony was performed, but\r\non the following day they were laid aside.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III. other foreign clothiers came to England, and\r\nmany of them settled in the eastern parts of Essex.  In 1353, this\r\nmonarch prohibited his subjects from wearing any cloth but such as was\r\nmade in this kingdom; and he also forbade the exportation of wool.  Both\r\nin this reign and in that of Richard II., repeated mention occurs in the\r\noath book and court rolls of wool-combers, card makers, clothiers,\r\nweavers, fullers, &c.  During the reign of Elizabeth a new impulse was\r\ngiven to the trade by the emigration of Protestants and others from the\r\nlow countries, and from France, who introduced important branches of\r\nindustry.  Mr. James, in his History of the Worsted Manufacture in\r\nEngland, says, that king Edward III. so far extended and improved that\r\ntrade, that from his reign may be dated a new era in its history.  This\r\nmonarch could not, with all his sagacity, and the earnest desire he ever\r\nevinced for the welfare and prosperity of his subjects, remain long\r\nunmindful of the great profit and advantage of working up the English\r\nwool for domestic consumption or export, instead of exporting the\r\nmaterial in a raw state.  When, therefore, he espoused Phillippa, the\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Hainault, whose subjects were excellent cloth\r\nmakers, the close connection which the marriage occasioned between the\r\ntwo countries, and probably in part some suggestions of the queen,\r\ninduced the king, in 1331, to invite hither a large number of his\r\ncountrymen, skilful in the art of weaving woollen and worsted.  These\r\nFlemish weavers settled, by the directions of the king, and under his\r\nspecial protection, in various parts of the country, where the wool grown\r\nin the district was suitable for the particular kind of cloth made by\r\nthese artizans.  The worsted weavers were located in Norfolk and Suffolk,\r\nhaving Norwich for their chief seat or mart.  Blomefield, in his history,\r\nsays,—\r\n\r\n    “Under the reign of Edward III., Norwich became the most flourishing\r\n    city of all England by means of its great trade in worsted, fustian,\r\n    friezes, and other woollen manufactures, for now the English wool,\r\n    being manufactured by English hands, incredible profit accrued to the\r\n    people by its passing through and employing so many, every one having\r\n    a fleece, sorters, combers, card spinners, &c.”\r\n\r\nAlluding to the condition of this trade at the same period, old Fuller,\r\nin his Church History, says,—\r\n\r\n    “The intercourse being large betwixt the English and the Netherlands,\r\n    (which having increased since King Edward married the daughter)\r\n    unsuspected emissaries were employed by our king with those\r\n    countries, who brought them into familiarity with such Dutchmen as\r\n    were absolute masters of their trade, (but not masters themselves) as\r\n    either journeymen or apprentices.  These bemoaned the slavishness of\r\n    their poor servants, whom their masters used rather like heathen than\r\n    christians; yea, rather, like horses than men; early up and late to\r\n    bed, and all day hard work, and harder fare, (a few herrings and\r\n    mouldy cheese,) and all to enrich the churls their masters, without\r\n    any profit unto themselves.  But, oh, how happy should they be if\r\n    they would but come over to England! bringing their mystery with\r\n    them, which would provide their welcome in all places.  Here they\r\n    should feed on fat beef and mutton till nothing but their fulness\r\n    should stint their stomach; yea, they should feed on the labour of\r\n    their own hands, enjoying a proportionable portion of their gains for\r\n    themselves.  Persuaded with the promises, many Dutch servants leave\r\n    their masters and come over to England.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Blomefield, the trade continued to increase during the\r\nsucceeding reign, that of Richard II., when laws were passed for\r\nregulating the sale of worsted.  Our ancestors were then a plain homely\r\nsort of people, and like their forefathers, were content with coarse\r\nwoollen cloths for their plain clothes.  In this and succeeding reigns\r\nimportant changes took place in the system of society, especially in the\r\nformation of a middle class, which gradually increased in numbers and\r\ninfluence, and became the great support of trade.  Norman despotism was\r\nrelaxed, and political liberty was advanced, and the darkness of the\r\nmiddle ages was dispelled.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1403, Henry IV. separated the city of Norwich from the county of\r\nNorfolk, and made it a county of itself, which it has been ever since.\r\nThis, of course, has been a great advantage to the city as regards its\r\nself-government.  In this reign it was deemed necessary to appoint\r\nofficers, whose business it should be to inspect the goods; and in the\r\nreigns of Henry V., Henry VI., Edward IV., and Richard III., complaints\r\nwere renewed in acts of parliament and other documents of the great\r\n“crafte and deceite” used in the making of worsteds, says, serges,\r\nfustians, motleys, &c., at Norwich.\r\n\r\nDuring the short reign of Edward VI., the making of “felt and thrummed\r\nhats, dornecks, and coverlets,” had sprung up in consequence of the\r\ndecline of the old stuff manufacture; and in the reign of Mary the\r\nmanufacture of “light stuffs” was introduced.  These were of the same\r\nfabric as “the fustians of Naples,” and seem to have been so similar to\r\nthe bombazines of succeeding years, that they may be considered as the\r\ncommencement of the great staple of Norwich.  During the subsequent\r\nreigns the city does not seem to have advanced in prosperity.  Henry VII.\r\nsucceeded in reviving the trade a little, but in the reign of his son,\r\nHenry VIII., it again declined.  We find by an act passed in that reign\r\n“that the making of worsteds, says, and stammins, which had greatly\r\nincreased in the city of Norwich and county of Norfolk, was now practised\r\nmore diligently than in times past at Yarmouth and Lynn.”  If so, the\r\ntrade soon died out in those towns, as we have no record of any\r\nmanufactures there.\r\n\r\nPhilip and Mary passed an act to encourage the making “of russels,\r\nsatins, satins-reverses, and fustians of Naples.”  From this time it\r\nappears that the stuffs made in the city were exported into foreign\r\ncountries, most probably into Holland and Flanders, and at length partial\r\nrestrictions were laid on the export trades, but still a great amount of\r\nbusiness was done.  As yet no one had promulgated the modern doctrines of\r\nfree trade.\r\n\r\nFrom Cotman’s valuable work, “The Sepulchral Brasses of Norfolk,” we may\r\ngather some information respecting the costumes of people in the middle\r\nages.  With reference to the dresses of the ladies, we may be surprised\r\nat the tardy progress of “fashion” in mediæval times, but a little\r\nconsideration will enable us to solve the difficulty.  In the fifteenth\r\ncentury money was very scarce, and all the articles of female apparel\r\nwere about twelve times more costly than they are at present.  Husbands\r\nand fathers were doubtless “intractable” in proportion.  Hence our fair\r\nbut thrifty ancestresses continued to wear the very same dresses on all\r\nfestive occasions for many years.  Now, however, the facilities of\r\nforeign travel, the introduction of cheaper materials, the results of\r\nmodern ingenuity, and the spirit of the age in which we live, all tend to\r\nrapid, frequent, and capricious changes of costume; but it was not so\r\nthen, and a lady was frequently attired as her grandmother had been\r\nbefore her!  Our ancestors were slow coaches.  Centuries elapsed before\r\nthey achieved the _ruff_, before they discovered the _bonnet_, before\r\nthey perpetrated the _wig_!  They never dreamt of _crinoline_.  Thus, for\r\nexample, we observe the very same form of kirtle or gown—close fitting,\r\nlow waisted, but wide and pleated at the bottom, during a period of more\r\nthan 300 years, there being only a slight variation in the shape of its\r\nsleeves.  The fall, the flounce, and cuffs of fur or some other material,\r\nmust have been also a very long-lived fashion, being observable on many\r\nbrasses from the dates of 1466 to 1537.  But the designers of brasses may\r\nhave adhered for a long time to merely conventional forms.  The Rev. R.\r\nHart, in his Letters to a local magazine, says:—\r\n\r\n    “The wife of Sir Miles Stapleton, in 1365, wears a close-fitting\r\n    tunic over the kirtle, (the sleeves of which, with a row of small\r\n    buttons extending from the wrist to the elbow, are seen underneath;)\r\n    the sleeves of the tunic itself are short, but there are oblong\r\n    narrow pendants almost reaching from them to the ground.  It is\r\n    buttoned at the breast, there are two pockets in the front, and the\r\n    lower part is full and gathered into puckers or folds.  (Cotman pl.\r\n    4).  During the reigns of Henry IV. and V. the ladies wore a sort of\r\n    bag sleeve, tight at the wrist (like that of a modern bishop).  About\r\n    1481, the sleeve became wide and open like that of a surplice.  About\r\n    1528, the sleeves of the kirtle, or under dress, were, in some\r\n    instances, cut or pinked, so as to exhibit a rich inner lining.  In\r\n    1559, there was a tight sleeve ruffled at the wrist, and with an\r\n    epaulet upon the shoulder, pinked; and at the same period we observe\r\n    the earliest specimen of the ruff, and the rudiments of the habit\r\n    shirt.  By far the most remarkable varieties are observed in head\r\n    dresses, which frequently supply valuable indications as to the date.\r\n    On the cup presented by King John to the borough of Lynn, and in the\r\n    small figures upon Branch’s monument, some of the females wear a\r\n    close-fitting cap like a child’s nightcap, and others a sort of hood\r\n    with a long tail to it, which is sometimes stiff and sometimes loose\r\n    like drapery.  The wives of Walsoken and Branch (1349 and 1364)\r\n    exhibit the wimple, covering the throat, chin, and sides of the face,\r\n    and the couverchef (kerchief) thrown over the head and falling upon\r\n    the shoulders.  The next important variety was the forked or mitre\r\n    head dress, which first came into fashion about 1438, and held its\r\n    ground for about twenty-six years, though there is one specimen as\r\n    late as 1492.  This was followed by the pedimental style of head\r\n    dress, which began about 1415, and continued till late into the\r\n    following century.  The butterfly head dress, which was a cylindrical\r\n    cap with a light veil over it, stiffened and squared at the top,\r\n    prevailed from 1466 to 1483.  In 1538 we observe a graceful form of\r\n    head dress, like what is termed the Mary Queen of Scots’ cap.  The\r\n    mantle, which was something like a cope, the jaquette, which may be\r\n    compared to the “flanches of heraldry,” and excellent specimens of\r\n    ancient embroidery, may all be studied in the brass of Adam de\r\n    Walsoken.  About the year 1460 we observe the aumoniere (like a\r\n    reticule) hanging from a lady’s girdle, and also the rosary,\r\n    terminating, not with a cross, but with a tassel.”\r\n\r\nIn reference to the dresses of the male sex, the Rev. R. Hart gives the\r\nfollowing details as to municipal costumes.\r\n\r\n    “On the Lynn cup, already referred to, we observe the jerkin, or\r\n    short coat; also a sort of cape, or short cloak; a larger cloak, and\r\n    three or four sorts of head coverings, viz., a low flat-topped cap;\r\n    another something like a helmet; a hat sloping upwards from the rim,\r\n    and flat at the top; a hood with a tail to it; and another exactly\r\n    resembling what is now termed a ‘wide-awake.’  On the monuments of\r\n    Walsoken and Branch we notice the jerkin, the mantle, cloaks, long\r\n    and short, (in one instance festooned over the right shoulder like\r\n    the plaid of a Highlander,) and another long cloak, curiously\r\n    buttoned all down the front; also several kinds of head-covering,\r\n    some exactly similar to those which have been recently described,\r\n    others with a broad rim turned up, the top being round-pointed or\r\n    flat; and in one instance we observe a hat and feather.  In their\r\n    monumental effigies the laity are usually attired in a long gown,\r\n    which has sometimes bag sleeves, but resembles an albe in all other\r\n    respects.  It is usually girdled with a leathern strap with a rosary\r\n    of much larger beads than we observe on female brasses, and without\r\n    any decads.  Generally speaking, these rosaries have a tassel\r\n    underneath, but on the brass of Sir William Calthorp, 1495, a signet\r\n    ring is attached to the end of the rosary, while a beautiful shaped\r\n    aumoniere also hangs from the girdle.  About the year 1532 we observe\r\n    gowns with hanging sleeves, like those which are still worn by\r\n    masters of arts at our universities; and in other instances, of about\r\n    the same date, we observe a pudding sleeve reaching a little below\r\n    the elbow of the under dress.  The brass of Edmund Green, in\r\n    Hunstanton church, A.D. 1490, is chiefly remarkable from the\r\n    resemblance that his upper garment bears to a pelisse or furred\r\n    surtout.  The short cloak—trunk hose (something like the\r\n    ‘nickerbockers’ of our own time), and also the ruff, are observable\r\n    upon Norfolk brasses between 1610 and 1630.  During the first half of\r\n    the fifteenth century, we observe a frightfully ugly mode of shaving\r\n    of the hair all round, to some height above the ears.  It looks like\r\n    a skull cap, and is an exact inversion of the tonsure.  Burgesses of\r\n    Lynn appear to have worn, in the fourteenth century, long gowns, the\r\n    lower part of which is open in the front about as high as the knees,\r\n    and with wide sleeves reaching to the elbow.  There is a richly\r\n    bordered and hooded cape over the upper part of this gown.  It is not\r\n    unlike an amess.  Aldermen of Norwich wore a mantle open at the right\r\n    shoulder, falling straight behind, but gathered into a slope at\r\n    front, so as to cover a great part of the left arm, while the other\r\n    was exposed.  It had a standing collar, and there were buttons upon\r\n    the right shoulder.  A Judge of the Common Pleas, in 1507, wore his\r\n    hair long and flowing, and was habited in a long wide-sleeved gown,\r\n    open in the front; apparently it was lined, caped, and bordered with\r\n    fur, and there is a purse hanging from the girdle.  On his feet he\r\n    wore clogs of a very remarkable form.  A Judge of the King’s Bench,\r\n    in 1545, wore a wide-sleeved long gown, a mantle open at the right\r\n    shoulder, as in the municipal examples, his head being covered with a\r\n    coif or closely-fitting skull-cap.”\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of the reign of Elizabeth, the Flemings, who fled\r\nfrom the persecutions of the Duke of Alva, settled at Norwich to the\r\nnumber of 4000, and much increased the prosperity of the city by\r\nintroducing the manufacture of bombazines, which were long in great\r\ndemand all over the country.  Black bombazines were universally worn by\r\nladies when in mourning, up to a recent period.  These bombazines were\r\nmixed fabrics of silk and worsted, and were dyed in all colours.  They\r\ndid not wear so long as the more modern paramattas.\r\n\r\nElizabeth gave every encouragement to manufactures; and when more\r\nFlemings sought refuge in England, the city of Norwich gained an\r\naccession of knowledge in the art of weaving with a warp of silk or\r\nlinen, and a weft of worsted, as well as in dyeing and other processes.\r\nAnd now the articles manufactured began to be classed as “bays, arras,\r\nsays, tapestries, mockadoes, stamens, russels, lace, fringes, camlets,\r\nperpetuanas, caffas and kerseys.”  Nothing contributed more to advance\r\nthe prosperity of the city than the arrival of the industrious Dutch\r\npeople, who brought with them arts before unknown in this land.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the action of government in reference to trade was simply\r\nin the way of protection, creating monopolies under charters, and\r\nsometimes for subsidies.  This was especially the case in Norwich, which\r\nwas made one of the royal cities of England, and had a market every day\r\nin the week, as well as annual marts for all sorts of merchandise.  The\r\nmanufacturers first sought and obtained protection for their trade under\r\ncharters.  Hence arose a system which answered very well in the infancy\r\nof society, but which became obsolete in the course of national\r\ndevelopment, and the extension of commerce.\r\n\r\nUnder the miserable rule of Charles I., the persecuting Laud succeeded in\r\ndriving back the industrious Dutch weavers to Holland, and causing others\r\nto emigrate to America in order that they might enjoy religious liberty.\r\nThus the best workers were driven out of England, and a stimulus was\r\ngiven to the Dutch worsted manufacture.  The Commonwealth government\r\nrestored prosperity to trade, and established a corporation of fifty-four\r\npersons in Norwich for the regulation of trade, which then flourished\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles II., we find that “Weavers’ Hall” is mentioned;\r\nand though the king taxed the manufacturers, the Norwich workers\r\nflourished: for Sir John Child, in 1681, declared that, “Such a trade\r\nthere is, and hath been, for the woollen manufactures, as England never\r\nknew in any age.”  Soon afterwards, Louis XIV. revoked the Edict of\r\nNantes, and tens of thousands of French Protestant weavers took refuge in\r\nEngland, giving birth to the silk manufactures of Spitalfields, and\r\nstimulating the trade of Norwich.  These refugees introduced the\r\nmanufacture of crapes, which soon came into very general use for\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eighteenth Century_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the manufacturers of this century were very intelligent men, who\r\nhad gone through the whole routine of their trade, and could do the work\r\nin every process with their own hands.  The worsted goods manufactured at\r\nthis time were calimancoes, plain, flowered, and brocaded; camlets and\r\ncamletees; satins and satinettes; brocaded satins, rosetts, brilliants,\r\nbatavias, Mecklenburghs, hairbines, damasks, duroys, poplins, prunells,\r\nbombazines, serges, florentines, brilliantines, grandines, cameltines,\r\ntabourtines, blondines, callimandres, and other fabrics, all in brilliant\r\ncolours.  The greatest demand for these goods was from 1743 to 1763, a\r\nperiod of twenty years.\r\n\r\nIn or about 1776 Joseph and John Banfather made a few camlets, which were\r\nwoven grey, and after that, dyed of various colours, for a captain of an\r\nEast India vessel, who took them out at his own risk.  About 1782, broad\r\nbombazines were introduced by Ives, Son, and Baseley.  About 1783, Irish\r\npoplins or lustres were made by that firm.  About 1785, spotted camletees\r\nwere introduced by William Martin.  About 1788, single warp callimancoes\r\nwere made and continued for six years.\r\n\r\nMr. James assures us that Norwich attained its highest prosperity during\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, so great was the energy and\r\nfertility of resource displayed by its merchants.  The worsted dyers of\r\nthe city were pre-eminent for skill, and their profits were great.  The\r\ncity merchants sent travellers throughout Europe, and their pattern books\r\nwere shown in every principal town as far as Moscow.  Norwich goods were\r\nintroduced into France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Poland, and there\r\nwas also a large trade with Russia.  The great fairs of Frankfort,\r\nLeipsic, and of Salerno, were thronged with purchasers of Norwich\r\nfabrics.  An _English Gazetter_ published before 1726, contains an\r\narticle on Norwich, in which the writer says:—\r\n\r\n    “The worsted manufacture, for which this city has long been famous,\r\n    and in which even children earn their bread, was first brought over\r\n    by the Flemings in the reign of Edward III., and afterwards very much\r\n    improved by the Dutch who fled from the Duke of Alva’s persecution,\r\n    and being settled here by queen Elizabeth, taught the inhabitants to\r\n    make says, baize, serges, shalloons, &c., in which they carry on a\r\n    vast trade both at home and abroad, and weave camblets, druggets,\r\n    crapes, and other stuffs, of which it is said this city vends to the\r\n    value of £200,000 a year.\r\n\r\n    “The weavers here employ spinsters all the country round, and also\r\n    use many thousand packs of yarn spun in other counties, even as far\r\n    as Yorkshire and Westmoreland.  By a late calculation from the number\r\n    of looms at work in this city only, it appeared that there were no\r\n    less than one hundred and twenty thousand people employed in these\r\n    manufactures of wool, silk, &c., in and about the town, _including\r\n    those employed in spinning the yarn_, used for such goods as are made\r\n    in the city.”\r\n\r\nThe writer of course means to include all the females who spun the yarns\r\nin Yorkshire and Westmoreland, as well as in Norfolk and Norwich.  Even\r\nthen, 120,000 people is an incredible number, for he states the value of\r\nall the goods sold to be only £200,000 yearly, so that the people would\r\nnot earn £2 each per annum.\r\n\r\nSo flourishing was the woollen trade in this city during the second half\r\nof the eighteenth century, that on February 2nd, 1759, the wool-combers\r\ntestified their joy by exhibiting the pageant of bishop Blaise, who lived\r\nunder Dioclesian, A.D. 282, and was a great patron of woollen\r\nmanufactures.  This prosperity was interrupted by a war; but on March\r\n24th, 1783, the citizens were again entertained by the wool-combers’\r\njubilee, on the return of peace, which had a beneficial effect on trade.\r\nThe most prosperous period appears to have been from 1750 to 1780.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Young, in 1771, published his “Tour of England” in the form of\r\nLetters, some of which relate to the eastern counties, and Letter XII. to\r\nNorwich.  It contains a curious statement, derived from some\r\nmanufacturers, respecting their trade.  At that time, the population of\r\nthe city was about 40,000, mostly employed in manufactures, and the\r\nmerchants were rich and numerous.  Mr. Arthur Young says:—\r\n\r\n    “The staple manufactures are crapes and camlets, besides which they\r\n    make in great abundance damasks, satins, alopeens, &c., &c.  They\r\n    work up the Leicestershire and Lincolnshire wool chiefly, which is\r\n    brought here for combing and spinning, whilst the Norfolk wool goes\r\n    to Yorkshire for carding and cloths.  And what is a remarkable\r\n    circumstance, not discovered many years, is, that the Norfolk sheep\r\n    yield a wool about their necks equal to the best from Spain; and is\r\n    in price to the rest as twenty to seven.”\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Young further states that men, women, and boys earned about\r\nfive shillings per week, but that they could earn more if industrious, so\r\nthat wages were not higher a century ago than at present.  In reference\r\nto the exportation of goods, he observes:—\r\n\r\n    “They now do not send anything to North America, but much to the West\r\n    Indies.  Their foreign export is to Rotterdam, Ostend, Middleburgh,\r\n    all Flanders, Leghorn, Trieste, Naples, Genoa, Cadiz, Lisbon,\r\n    Barcelona, Hamburgh, all the Baltic except Sweden, and the East\r\n    Indies.\r\n\r\n    “The general amount of Norwich manufactures may be calculated thus—\r\n\r\nA regular export to Rotterdam, by shipping every six          £480,000\r\nweeks, of goods to the amount of yearly\r\nTwenty-six tons of goods sent by broad-wheeled waggons         676,000\r\nweekly to London at £500 a ton, on an average, 13,000\r\ntons per annum, value\r\nBy occasional ships and waggons to various places              200,000\r\ncalculated at\r\n                                                            £1,356,000\r\n\r\nTherefore the trade had increased in fifty years from £200,000, according\r\nto the “English Gazetteer,” up to £1,356,000!\r\n\r\nMr. Young further observes in reference to the estimates he had given:—\r\n\r\n    “Upon a reconsideration of the table, it was thought that the\r\n    £676,000 by waggons was rather too high.  Suppose, therefore, only\r\n    10,000 tons, it is then £520,000, and the total £1,200,000!\r\n\r\n    “Another method taken to calculate the amount was by adding up the\r\n    total sum supposed to be returned annually by every house in Norwich,\r\n    and this method made it £1,150,000.  This sum coming so near the\r\n    other, is a strong confirmation of it.\r\n\r\n    “A third method taken was to calculate the number of looms (in county\r\n    and city); these were made 12,000; and it is a common idea in Norwich\r\n    to suppose such, with all its attendants, works £100 per annum.  This\r\n    also makes the total £1,200,000, which sum upon the whole appears to\r\n    be very near the real truth.\r\n\r\n    “Respecting the proportion between the original material and the\r\n    labour employed upon it, they have a sure and very easy method of\r\n    discovering it.  The average value of a piece of stuff is 5s.; so the\r\n    material is a tenth of the total manufacture.  Deduct the £120,000\r\n    from £1,200,000, leaves £1,080,000 for labour, in which is included\r\n    the profit of the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n    “The material point remaining is to discover how many people are\r\n    employed to earn the public one million per annum, and for this\r\n    calculation I have one _datum_ which is to the purpose.  They\r\n    generally imagine in Norwich that one loom employs six persons on the\r\n    whole; and as the number is 12,000 (in city and county), there are\r\n    consequently 72,000 people employed in the manufacture.  And this is\r\n    a fresh confirmation of the preceding accounts; for I was in general\r\n    told that more hands worked out of Norwich, for many miles around,\r\n    than in it; and £1,200,000 divided by 72,000, gives £16 each for the\r\n    earnings of every person.”\r\n\r\nThis, Mr. Young confesses, appears to be a large sum for men, women, and\r\nboys to earn.  The population of Norwich being then under 40,000, the\r\nnumber of looms at the time Mr. A. Young wrote could not be 12,000, nor\r\nthe persons employed 72,000 in the city and county.  Six persons to a\r\nloom never were required at one time.  The proportion was more likely\r\nonly half, or three persons to a loom.  Consequently, the number employed\r\nwould be only 36,000 in both city and county.  Divide £1,200,000 by\r\n36,000, and it gives £33 for each adult yearly, including the profits of\r\nthe manufacturer.  Deduct £200,000 for their profits, and it leaves\r\n£1,000,000 for labour; divide that by 36,000 persons, and it leaves only\r\n£28 each, yearly, which is nearer the mark.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Beatniffe, a bookseller in Norwich, copied the statement of Mr. A.\r\nYoung, and published it in his “Tour of Norfolk.”  He said some gentlemen\r\nof intelligence had doubted it, as well they might, but he believed it\r\nwas true.  However, in his last edition of the “Tour,” published in 1807,\r\nhe gave a very different account.  He said that the merchant was shut out\r\nof the home market by fashion and out of the foreign market by war, so\r\nthat the annual value of the goods was estimated at £800,000, and the\r\ncost of labour at £685,000, leaving only £115,000 for the raw material\r\n\r\nMessrs. John Scott and Sons, were manufacturers of woollen and worsted\r\ngoods, in St. Saviour’s, from 1766 to 1800, and produced great quantities\r\nof taborets, floretts, clouded camlets, for Italy; perukeens,\r\nself-coloured camlets, for Germany; and other sorts for Spain.  Some of\r\nthese camlets were eighteen inches wide, and the pieces twenty-seven or\r\nthirty yards in length; some super camlets were twenty-four inches wide,\r\nand thirty yards in length, according to the pattern books yet in\r\nexistence.  These camlets were charged from 50s. to 100s. per piece, or\r\nan average of 80s., as we have seen in old ledgers of the firm, still\r\npreserved and in the possession of a manufacturer.\r\n\r\nOriginally, all the yarns used in Norwich were spun by hand in Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk, thus employing a large number of women, young and old.\r\nAbout 1720, almost the whole female population of Norfolk and Suffolk was\r\nfully employed at the spinning wheel, and this branch of industry\r\ncontinued till the end of the century, and though 50,000 tons of wool\r\nwere produced, it was found necessary to draw supplies from other\r\ndistricts.  Before the end of the eighteenth century, mills were at work\r\nspinning yarns, and in 1812, yarns from the mills in Lancashire were\r\nbrought here and spun in bombazines, which were dyed in various colours.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of mills in Yorkshire, where coal, provisions, and\r\nlabour were cheaper than in Norfolk, gave a heavy blow to the trade of\r\nthe city, which would have been more severely felt, but for the\r\nfluctuations of fashion having created a great demand for bombazines, for\r\nwhich Norwich was famous.  The Yorkshire workmen and the substitution of\r\nmachinery for female hands, reduced the manufacture of the old kinds of\r\ngoods to a low point, and the trade was chiefly maintained by the orders\r\nof the East India Company for large quantities of camlets for the Chinese\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Willett and Nephew have old pattern books full of specimens of\r\nshawl borders of very elegant designs; in fashion at the beginning of\r\nthis century.  These patterns are an imitation of genuine Indian designs,\r\nthe pine-apple being prominent; but great improvements in the designs\r\nwere made by different manufacturers.  Norwich shawls had formerly a high\r\nreputation, and were in great demand in London and all large towns; but\r\nultimately French shawls were preferred, owing to the superiority of the\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nAt two general meetings of the manufacturers, held at the Guildhall on\r\nDecember 14th and 21st, 1790, the prices for weaving were fixed and\r\nprinted in a list, comprising serges, prunelles, satins, satinettes,\r\ncamlets, camletines, florentines, brilliantines, grenadines, blondines,\r\ntabourtines, callandres, &c.  At a general meeting of the manufacturers,\r\nheld on June 13th, 1793, at the Guildhall, it was resolved unanimously\r\nthat they would supply the journeyman weavers they employed with havels\r\nand slaies, free of charge, and without deduction from the prices\r\nestablished in the table of rates fixed in the year 1790.  The list\r\ncontinued in force for some time, even into the next century.  The\r\ncamlets made, excepting those for China, were thirty yards in length, and\r\nabout twenty-eight inches wide, with warp and wift dyed in the hank.\r\nMillions of pieces of camlets were made for exportation, in which nearly\r\nall the manufacturers were engaged.  The orders of the East India Company\r\namounted to a very large sum yearly.  Operatives earned 40s. for each\r\npiece of camlet for the East India Company, or about £1000 weekly on that\r\nsingle article.  Those were the palmy days for the weavers; days that\r\nwill never more return.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the century, the prosperity of Norwich really\r\ndeclined.  The towns of the West Riding of Yorkshire, as already stated,\r\nbecame her successful rivals in worsted fabrics.  The increase of cottons\r\nand their general wear in England left Norwich dependent on the foreign\r\ntrade, which was partly ruined by the American war, and entirely so by\r\nthe war after the first French Revolution, which spread desolation over\r\nall Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Nineteenth Century_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the present century, bombazines, camlets, and\r\nmixed fabrics were the chief manufactures of Norwich.  Soon afterwards\r\ncrapes were produced in large quantities.  Paramattas were next\r\nintroduced, and in the course of time superseded bombazines for mourning.\r\n“Poplins” then came into fashion, and the manufacture has so much\r\nimproved that the demand for this kind of goods has increased every year.\r\nPoplins were followed by a long succession of mixed fabrics, barèges,\r\nbalzarines, gauzes, mousseline de laines, cotton de laines, llamas,\r\nthibets, merinoes, lunettas, organdies, stuffs, cloths, velvets, lustres,\r\nsilks, satins, &c.  The manufacture of shawls was also carried on\r\nextensively, and for a long time Norwich shawls, for excellence of fabric\r\nand elegance of design, were not surpassed by any made in England.  A\r\ngreat trade was done in shawls in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and other\r\nlarge towns.  The trade, however, gradually declined when French shawls\r\ncame into fashion.  French goods of other kinds also grew in favour, and\r\naffected the city trade in many textile fabrics.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, on December 29th, a meeting of weavers was held on Mousehold\r\nHeath to adopt means for keeping up the rate of payment, the operatives\r\nasserting their right to combine to increase wages, as well as their\r\nemployers to combine to reduce them.  The weavers were not paid by time,\r\nbut at a certain rate for piece-work of different kinds.  The rate was\r\naccording to a certain printed scale, to which the operatives wished to\r\nadhere, while it sometimes occurred that the manufacturers desired to\r\nalter it.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the present century Messrs. Ives and Robberds,\r\nof St. Saviour’s, carried on a large trade in worsted goods, chiefly for\r\nexportation to India and China, and to different parts of Europe.  The\r\ngoods made were all stout worsted fabrics, plain, checked, striped, or\r\nfigured, in vivid colours.  They were camlets, camletees, satins,\r\nsatinettes, ladines, tabaretts, calimancoes, swan skins, broad bays, red\r\nkerseys, diamantines, spotted tobines, batavias, hairbines, toys,\r\nRochdale bays, checked paolis, lustrins, dentellos, damasks, dorsettines,\r\npoplins, serges, mazarines, and grenadines.  The same firm received large\r\norders from the East India Company for camlets, in pieces 55 yards in\r\nlength, 30 inches in width, and weighing 20 lbs. each.  Orders were\r\nexecuted by various houses as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Year_   _Pieces_\r\n1812        22,000\r\n1813        22,000\r\n1814        12,000\r\n1815        10,400\r\n1816        16,600\r\n1817        15,200\r\n1818        15,200\r\n1819        15,640\r\n1820        16,000\r\n1821        11,000\r\n1822        14,300\r\n1824        10,000\r\n1825        11,012\r\n1826        13,000\r\n1827       none\r\n1828        12,000\r\n1829        10,000\r\n1830         9,300\r\n1831       none\r\n1832         5,000\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the East India Company suspended their orders, but Mr. Robberds\r\ncontinued to export camlets from Norwich and Yorkshire to China in\r\nexchange for tea, as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Year_     _Norwich_     _Yorkshire_\r\n1841        420 pieces     215 pieces\r\n1842          2,760 ,,         200 ,,\r\n1843          6,610 ,,       5,181 ,,\r\n1844         13,170 ,,       7,928 ,,\r\n\r\nHe also continued to make camlets for wholesale merchants in London till\r\n1848, when he failed in consequence of losses, but afterwards joined a\r\npartner in Halifax, and continued to produce large quantities of camlets;\r\nbut Norwich lost all the trade.\r\n\r\nBesides the camlets supplied to the East India Company, goods of the same\r\nkind were made for private orders by all the manufacturers.  During the\r\nyears 1830, 1831, and 1832, according to ledgers yet remaining, one firm\r\nmade about 7,000 pieces for private orders, and from 1833 to 1837\r\ninclusive, nearly 9,000 pieces.  In 1833 and 1834, mohair camlets were\r\nmade by the same house to the extent of 6,000 pieces, being 22,000 pieces\r\nin four years.  Supposing a dozen other houses to have produced a like\r\nquantity, the total would have been 66,000 pieces yearly.  Messrs. Booth\r\nand Theobald, in Muspole Street, were large manufacturers of worsted\r\ngoods, and at one time employed about 1,000 hands, men, women, and\r\nchildren, in the production of worsted goods, including camlets, for the\r\nEast India Company.  Mr. John Francis, of St. George’s, also made a\r\nvariety of worsted goods and other fabrics, employing a large number of\r\nhands at one time.  Messrs. Worth and Carter, in St. George’s Middle\r\nStreet, and Joseph Oxley and Sons, in St. Augustine’s, produced large\r\nquantities of broad bombazines, which were gradually superseded by\r\nparamattas, to which the ladies gave the preference.  Both fabrics were\r\nmade of worsted and silk; the only difference was that they were\r\ndifferently dressed, the paramattas being dressed flat by hot pressing,\r\nwhich gave a greater flexibility to the cloth.  Messrs. Wright and Son,\r\nformerly on Elm Hill, at one time employed about 1500 hand-loom weavers\r\nin the manufacture of plain and fancy fabrics, mostly mixed.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Grout and Co. began the manufacture of crapes in a small way in\r\nPatteson’s Yard, in Magdalen Street.  John Grout was then the principal\r\npartner, but after the mills were built in Lower Westwick Street, having\r\nrealized a fortune, he retired from business.  George Grout also retired\r\nbefore 1840.  Messrs. Martin and Company became the proprietors of the\r\nmills, and after Mr. Martin died, the firm comprised Messrs. Brown,\r\nRobison, and Hall, who now carry on a large trade in crapes, areophanes,\r\nand gauzes.  The machinery in use is of the most improved construction;\r\nand in these very extensive works may be seen most of the processes\r\nconnected with the manufacture of silk goods.  The silk is imported\r\nchiefly from China and some from India, but a portion is also obtained\r\nfrom Italy.  The demand for crapes used in mourning has, however, a good\r\ndeal diminished.\r\n\r\nThe Albion Mills, in King Street, were erected in 1836 and 1837, for the\r\nspinning of worsted yarns, in consequence of the great demand in Norwich\r\nand the difficulty found by manufacturers in obtaining the yarns which\r\nthey required for their trade.  Mr. George Jay, owner of the mills,\r\nerected new machinery.  And after the trade in worsted yarns declined, he\r\nimported mohair from Asia Minor, and commenced the spinning of mohair\r\nyarns.  He continued this business for some years, while mohair goods\r\nwere in demand.  He added a new wing to the factory and put in another\r\nsteam engine, both the engines being of seventy-horse power.\r\n\r\nDuring the present century, large Mills have been built in this city for\r\nthe spinning of silk, woollen, and mohair yarns, and also for weaving\r\nthose yarns into all kinds of fabrics.  In the year 1833, a company was\r\norganised for those manufactures.  A large capital of £40,000 was raised,\r\nand ultimately two factories were built, one in St. Edmund’s and one in\r\nSt. James’.  The former became a factory for spinning yarns, and the\r\nlatter for weaving goods.  In St. James’ factory two coupled engines of\r\n100-horse power were put up to drive the machinery.  There the city\r\nmanufacturers hired the large rooms and power, and put in the machinery,\r\nfor the production of fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe site of the factory comprises 1a. 2r. 18p., with a frontage of 460\r\nfeet to the river.  Above the basement are six long floors.  There have\r\nbeen sixty-five frames in the mills for spinning yarns, and 500 looms for\r\nweaving fabrics; but the number of looms has been reduced to 300, and\r\nthey are not always at work.  After the erection of the mills, weaving\r\nsheds were built adjoining.  The floors are now occupied as follows;—No.\r\n1. Messrs. Skelton and Co; No. 2. Messrs. Towler, Rowling, and Allen, who\r\nalso hire two of the weaving sheds; No. 3. Messrs. Willett, Nephew, and\r\nCo.; No. 4. Messrs. Skelton and Co.: Nos. 5 and 6. Mr. Park, for spinning\r\nwoollen yarns.  Women and girls are chiefly employed in this factory.\r\nAbout 1000 have been at work at a time, when trade has been good; but of\r\nlate, not half the number have been engaged.  The average earnings have\r\nbeen about 7s. weekly.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, trade was in a very dull declining state, and some differences\r\narose between masters and men, in consequence of a proposed reduction in\r\nthe rate of payment.  This was resisted by the men, who appealed to\r\nColonel Harvey to mediate between them, which he consented to do.  A\r\nmeeting was held, and the delegates who had been sent on the part of the\r\nweavers to the north to inquire into the state of the camlet trade,\r\nreported that they had seen no camlets at all to compare with those in\r\nNorwich.  The north had, however, got the trade.  The question remained\r\nunsettled; but on August 27th, that year, several camlet weavers applied\r\nto the magistrates for protection from the violence of those on strike.\r\nMr. Robberds was willing to give out work, but would not do so unless his\r\nmen were protected.  The application was granted, and a strong body of\r\npolice was sent to the premises of Mr. Robberds, where the weavers\r\nreceived their work, and they were protected in conveying it to their\r\nhomes.  On the Tuesday following, the house of a man named Wells was\r\nbroken open and his work cut out of the loom.  The city was much\r\ndisturbed by these differences, which ultimately produced great injury to\r\nits trade.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Mitchell’s report in 1839, there were in the city and\r\nits vicinity 5,075 looms, of which 1,021 were unemployed; and of the\r\n4,054 looms then at work, there were 3,398 in the houses of the weavers,\r\nand 650 in shops and factories.  Indeed, by far the greater part of the\r\nlooms belonged to families having only one or two.  The operatives at\r\nthese looms comprised 2,211 men, and 1,648 women, with 195 children.  In\r\nthat year two silk mills employed 731 hands; three worsted mills, 385\r\nhands; two woollen mills, 39 hands; and one cotton mill, 39 hands, making\r\neight mills, employing 1,285 persons.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of a census of the Norwich weavers, furnished by a report of\r\nthe commissioners on handloom weavers, published in 1840, will best show\r\nthe nature and the relative amount of the fabrics then made by hand.\r\nBombazines employed 1,205 workers, of whom 803 were men; challis,\r\nYorkshire stuffs, fringes, &c., 1,247, of whom 510 were men; gauzes, 500,\r\nchiefly women; princettas, 242, nearly all men; silk shawls, 166, of whom\r\n74 were men; bandana, 158, of whom 86 were men; silk, 38, including 16\r\nmen; jacquard, 30; worsted shawls, 26; woollen and couch lace, 22 each;\r\ncamletees, 20; horsehair cloth, 17; lustres, 3; sacking, 45.  Total of\r\nweavers 4,054, including 2,211 men, 1,648 women, 108 boys, 77 girls, and\r\n10 apprentices.  Their gross wages, when fully employed, have ranged from\r\n8s. to 25s. weekly; those engaged on fillovers, challis, and fine\r\nbombazines, earning from 15s. to 25s. weekly; but deducting “play time”\r\nand expenses, the net wages did not amount to 8s. weekly.  Mr. Mitchell\r\nreported that the industry and morals of the operatives had suffered much\r\nfrom party spirit, riots, and strikes.  Of late years the workers at\r\ntheir looms have been very industrious and quiet, while they have endured\r\ngreat privations.  Since 1840 a large number of the operatives have gone\r\ninto the boot and shoe trade, which offered better prospect of at least a\r\ndecent livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATE OF THE TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the old worsted fabrics formerly made in such large quantities\r\nhave become obsolete, and lighter mixed fabrics are now produced in great\r\nvariety, in silk, wool, mohair or cotton, or composed of three or four\r\nkinds of yarns.  The goods are known under the names of cloths, kerseys,\r\nlinseys, winseys, coburgs, crapes, gauzes, nets, paramattas, camlets,\r\nbareges, balzarines, grenadines, challis, llamas, poplins, poplinettes,\r\ntamataves, optimes, crinolines, cloakings, and shawls in great variety.\r\nWool, mohair, and cotton yarns are chiefly used in most of the fabrics,\r\nexcept crapes and gauzes.  The larger proportion of the woollen yarns are\r\nmade here from English wool.  Poplins are made of silk and worsted;\r\npoplinettes, of silk and cotton; bareges, of silk and worsted; tamataves,\r\nof worsted and cotton; grenadines, of twisted worsted and silk; coburgs,\r\nof cotton and worsted; paramattas and bombazines, of worsted and silk;\r\nllamas, of an inferior kind of wool with cotton warp; thibet cloths, of\r\nworsted warp and weft; winseys and linseys, of worsted with cotton warp;\r\nbalzarines, with cotton warps and worsted shoot; malabars, of cotton warp\r\nand woollen shoot, thirty-two inches wide.  All the fabrics, however, may\r\nbe included under the three classes of tammies, tamataves, and nets.  The\r\ntammies are woven fabrics, in which the warp and the weft simply cross,\r\nbut in the nets there is a twist in the warp.  The tamataves are partly\r\nthe tammy woven and partly the net.  In former times the trade was\r\ncomparatively steady, because plain fabrics in single colours were more\r\nin demand than any other; but of late years, this branch of business has\r\nbeen very fluctuating, owing to the changes of fashion and the desire for\r\nnovelty, both in the fabric and in the pattern of every article.  New\r\npatterns are now, therefore, constantly being produced.  All preparations\r\nand processes are only for the coming season, and it is found necessary\r\nto alter the pattern, the colouring, the finishing, and even the names of\r\nthe goods, to suit the markets.\r\n\r\nMr. G. Jay is the largest manufacturer of mohair yarns in this city; and\r\nin the years 1867 and 1868 he could not execute all the orders he\r\nreceived.  This arose from the great care bestowed on the preparation of\r\nthe material at the Albion Mills, in King Street, and from the softness\r\nof the water which imparts a glossy, silky appearance to the yarns.\r\nMohair fabrics came suddenly into use, and for some years prior to 1860,\r\nelegant tissues were produced here.  These, however, soon went out of\r\nfashion.  All the yarns spun here are now sent to France and Germany,\r\nwhere they are woven, with silk, into velvets, and then imported into\r\nthis country.  The velvet jackets which are now in fashion have caused a\r\ngreat demand for these yarns, and sixty-five frames at the Albion Mills\r\nare constantly at work.  We are only surprised that the yarns are not\r\nused in the city in the manufacture of velvets, large quantities of which\r\nare imported every year.\r\n\r\nNorwich was the first place in all England where the manufacture of\r\nfillover shawls was carried on to any great extent.  For a long time the\r\nweaving of these shawls was a tedious, slow process.  A great improvement\r\nin the mode of weaving was, however, discovered by a straw-hat maker of\r\nLyons, named Jacquard, in the year 1802, by which means the drawboys were\r\nentirely dispensed with and the tackle simplified.  The new invention was\r\nreceived as a boon in England, and at length was introduced into this\r\ncity, where it has been applied to the production of splendid fillover\r\nshawls, by Clabburn, Sons, and Crisp.  We regret, however, that these\r\nelegant articles of ladies attire have recently gone almost entirely out\r\nof fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Late Mr. T. O. Springfield carried on the wholesale silk business to\r\na very large extent, having almost a monopoly of the market, and he\r\nsupplied with dressed silk almost all the manufacturers in this city.\r\nThis silk was very largely used by Grout and Co., in the manufacture of\r\ncrape, gauzes, aerophanes, &c., and by others in the working up of mixed\r\nfabrics, especially bareges, grenadines, and various light tissues.  The\r\nsame wholesale business is now continued by Mr. O. Springfield, in\r\nNorwich and London.  It is estimated that the annual value of dressed\r\nsilk used in this city is over £100,000.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Middleton, Answorth, and Co., have a large factory in Calvert\r\nStreet, another in Bradford, and a wholesale warehouse in London.  They\r\nformerly made all kinds of mixed fabrics in this city, and now they\r\nproduce large quantities of paramattas, grenadines, opera cloakings, and\r\nfancy cloakings, hair cloth for crinolines, and curled hair for stuffing\r\nsofas.  Crinolines have been made in great quantities by this firm, the\r\nwarp being cotton and the weft horsehair.  The demand for them has,\r\nhowever, somewhat abated.  This firm has largely increased their trade in\r\nhair-cloth, which is used for general stiffening purposes.  In the\r\nsouthern states of America, the gentlemen wear large trousers, which\r\nrequire to be expanded like ladies’ dresses; and, therefore, the larger\r\nportion of these goods are sent to the southern states of America.  The\r\nsame firm has also introduced haircloth in many patterns and colours for\r\ncovering furniture, in sofas, chairs, &c.  There is an enormous\r\nimportation of horse-hair into England from Russia, and from the\r\ncontinent of South America, where horses run wild in the great plains\r\ncalled “Pampas.”  The horses are caught and divested of their tails,\r\nwhich are brought into this country in a very rough state; the hair is\r\ndressed and woven into a variety of fabrics which are in great demand.\r\nThe trade in horse-hair cloth is almost a new trade in the city and might\r\nbe greatly extended.  Some fabrics are made all horse-hair, and some\r\nmixed with spun silk, in stripes, and colours, and very pleasing\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Burrell has built a small mill near the Dereham Road, where he\r\ncarries on the manufacture of horse-hair cloth by means of peculiar looms\r\nand machinery.  He imports horse hair, and prepares it for stuffing seats\r\nof chairs, sofas, &c.  He also weaves horse hair into cloth for various\r\npurposes.  Mr. Gunton also carries on the same kind of manufacture in St.\r\nMiles’; but the trade is yet on a small scale in this city.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Clabburn, Sons, and Crisp, in Pitt Street, manufacture shawls in\r\nevery variety, and also paramattas, bareges, tamataves, balzarines,\r\npoplins, fancy robes, ophines, grenadines, and mixed fabrics generally.\r\nThe fillover long shawls produced by this firm, on a Jacquard loom,\r\ngained the gold medal at the first Paris Exhibition, and also at the\r\nLondon Exhibition in 1862.  No description could convey an adequate idea\r\nof these splendid fillover shawls, which are made by a patented process,\r\nso as to display a self colour and a perfect design on each side.  They\r\nwere on view at the Paris Exhibition, in 1867, but not for a prize, Mr.\r\nW. Clabburn being selected as one of the judges, so that his firm could\r\nnot compete.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Willett and Nephew, of Pottergate Street, are manufacturers on a\r\nlarge scale.  The factory itself is not very extensive, for most of the\r\nweavers work for the firm at their own houses; and there, in humble\r\ndwellings, produce the beautiful fancy fabrics, which are destined to\r\nadorn the daintiest ladies in the land.  The extent of the operations of\r\nthis firm enables them to introduce a great variety of novelties in every\r\nseason, and thus to compete successfully with the manufacturers of\r\nFrance.  They were the first to introduce the manufacture of paramattas,\r\nwhich superseded the bombazines, at one time in such great demand.  They\r\nproduce superior poplins, (plain, figured, and watered) bareges,\r\nbalzarines, tamataves, coburgs, camlets, challis, crinoline, crêpe de\r\nLyons, grenadines, shawls, scarfs, robes, and also a great variety of\r\nplain fabrics.  They exhibited a large assortment of goods at the London\r\nExhibition of 1851, and received a certificate of “honourable mention”\r\nfor their paramattas, being the only award made for that article.\r\nMessrs. Willett and Co. also received a silver medal at the last\r\nExhibition in Paris.  In 1867, the same firm supplied some rich poplins,\r\nwhich were selected for the queen and royal family, from the stock of Mr.\r\nCaley, in London Street.  Mr. Caley has always on hand a large stock of\r\nNorwich goods, including shawls and fancy fabrics of the newest designs.\r\nVisitors to Norwich should not fail to call at his establishment, if they\r\nwish to carry away any idea of the productions of the old city.\r\n\r\nMessrs. C. and F. Bolingbroke and Jones, manufacturers of all kinds of\r\ntextile fabrics, carry on a large business in a building which was\r\nformerly the city residence of the priors of Ixworth.  On an old door,\r\nwhich formerly opened into the prior’s hall, is the following inscription\r\nin black letter on the transoms which divide the panels:—\r\n\r\n    Maria plena, mater mic\r\n    Remembyr Wyllyá Lowth, Prior 18.\r\n\r\nWilliam Louth was the 18th Prior of Walsingham, from 1505 to 1515.  This\r\ndoor has been noticed by Blomefield and others, but not correctly; Mr. H.\r\nHarrod gave an engraving with description in his “Gleanings Among the\r\nCastles and Convents of Norfolk,” (1857).  John Aldrich, a grocer,\r\nresided here prior to 1549.  He was elected an alderman in 1544, sheriff\r\nin 1551, mayor in 1558 and 1570, and member of parliament for Norwich in\r\n1555, 1558, and 1572.  He was buried inside of St. Clement’s church, on\r\nthe north side of the chancel, June 12th, 1582.  His wife, Elizabeth\r\nAldrich, was buried there April 3rd, 1587.  Messrs. C. and F. Bolingbroke\r\nand Jones have almost rebuilt the house.  They produce large quantities\r\nof textile fabrics, including poplins (plain, figured, and watered)\r\nparamattas, bareges, winseys, linseys, grenadines, and a variety of fancy\r\ngoods for dresses, which are in great demand.  At the first Great\r\nExhibition of 1851 a medal was awarded to this firm for poplins, and at\r\nthe Great Exhibition of 1862 for poplins and poplinettes.  In addition to\r\nthe old extensive premises, the firm, some time since, purchased the\r\nsteam-power mills in Calvert Street, and they also occupy a steam-power\r\nshed at St. James’ factory.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Towler, Rowling, and Allen, of Elm Hill, occupy large rooms in\r\nthe new buildings adjoining St. James’ factory, where they produce large\r\nquantities of plain and fancy goods, which have been in great demand.\r\nThey make also large quantities of plain fabrics, for wholesale houses\r\nonly.  At the London Exhibition of 1862, honourable mention was made of\r\nthe shawls of this firm.\r\n\r\nMr. J. L Barber has a large establishment in St. Martin’s Lane, where he\r\ncarries on business, making reels and winding cotton on them.  He\r\nsupplies great quantities of cotton-thread to wholesale and retail\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Sultzer and Co. carry on the manufacture of crapes to a\r\nconsiderable extent in premises built for the purpose in St. Augustine’s.\r\n\r\nMessrs. F. Hindes and Sons, who have a warehouse in Botolph Street,\r\nmanufacture paramattas, bareges, tamataves, grenadines, poplins, shawls,\r\nand cloakings.  They hire a floor also in the steam-power factory.\r\n\r\nMessrs. French and Co. formed a Limited Liability Company, and built a\r\nnew factory in the Mill Yard Lane, where they manufacture crapes, which\r\nare in great demand.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Grout and Co., manufacturers of gauzes, crapes, aerophanes, &c.,\r\nin addition to their mills in Norwich, have other mills at Yarmouth and\r\nDitchingham, and at Ponder’s End near London.  Theirs is, in fact, the\r\ngreatest concern in the world in the production of crapes and other silk\r\ngoods.  In their several mills they employ about 2000 hands.\r\n\r\nMr. George Allen erected a large factory in 1857 in St. Stephen’s Back\r\nStreet, for the manufacture of elastic cloths for table covers, gloves,\r\nshawls, and other clothing purposes, and for the production also of silk\r\nand lisle webs.  The elastic cloths, which are made upon warp frames, are\r\nconsidered to be a great improvement on “Hooper’s Elastics,” made in the\r\nwest of England, and for wear they are believed to be unsurpassed.  The\r\nmanufacture gives employment to a considerable number of hands.\r\n\r\nAbout 500 power looms are at work in the city, when trade is good,\r\nweaving a great variety of mixed fabrics, and no doubt each loom does\r\ndouble the work of the old hand-loom.  Supposing each loom to produce one\r\npiece of goods weekly, there would be 500 pieces weekly, or 26,000 pieces\r\nyearly.  The prices vary in value from £1 to £10 per piece, and may be\r\naveraged at £5, so that the annual value would be about £130,000.  But at\r\nleast 500 hand-looms are also at work, and supposing that they produce\r\nhalf the quantity of goods, the total annual value would be £195,000, or\r\nin round numbers £200,000.  We are sorry to state, however, as already\r\nintimated, that the manufacture of textile fabrics in Norwich has for\r\nsome time past been declining, and cannot compare with former years.  The\r\ndepression has arisen from various causes, among which may be mentioned\r\nwar, which has deprived the city of its best markets.  The introduction\r\nof cotton and silk goods too has nearly superseded the old stuff fabrics\r\nof the city.  Machinery in Norwich is also behind that in the north.  The\r\nwool grown in Norfolk and Suffolk has, moreover, been sent to Yorkshire\r\nto be spun, and has been repurchased as yarn for Norwich goods; and\r\nlastly, Norwich weavers have not the energy of those in Bradford.\r\nFashion also has been one of the causes of the loss of trade, for the\r\nfashions are continually changing, and Norwich firms have to compete with\r\nall England, Scotland, and France; and it is not to be expected that a\r\nfew houses in this city will produce as many novelties as all the rest of\r\nthe world.  A School of Art has been established, but it has not yet\r\nproduced many practical designers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING given an account of the textile manufactures in this city, we\r\nproceed to furnish some particulars of the more important of other\r\nclasses of business, which go to make up the sum total of the trade and\r\ncommerce of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANKING BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBanking, as now understood, was not carried on till the eighteenth\r\ncentury.  Before the American war of Independence very few country banks\r\nwere established.  Norwich manufactures were in their most prosperous\r\nstate in the middle of last century, and then it was that some banks were\r\nestablished in this city.  On January 31st, 1756, a bank was opened in\r\nthe Upper Market by Charles Weston, who carried on business till the end\r\nof the century.  In 1768, Mr. Thomas Allday’s bank was opened; afterwards\r\nSir R. Kerrison and Son were proprietors, and in 1808 the bank failed.\r\nThe debts amounted to £460,000, and the dividends paid amounted to 16s.\r\n4d. in the pound.  This was the first bank failure in Norwich of any\r\nimportance, and it shook public confidence in banks.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Gurney’s bank was established in Norwich in 1775 as a bank of\r\ndeposit and issue.  This was at a period the most flourishing in the\r\ncommercial annals of Norwich.  The annual value of textile fabrics\r\nproduced in the city was over a million sterling, a trade which was of\r\ncourse a great source of business to the bank.  Henry Gurney, and his son\r\nBartlett Gurney, were the first proprietors.  On the death of the father,\r\nthe son associated himself with his three brothers, Richard, Joseph, and\r\nJohn Gurney; so the firm continued till the deaths of the different\r\nparties.  About 1825, Mr. H. Birkbeck, of Lynn, and Mr. Simon Martin were\r\ntaken in as partners.  The firm then comprised R. H. Gurney, J. J.\r\nGurney, D. Gurney, Simon Martin, and H. Birkbeck.  After J. J. Gurney and\r\nS. Martin died, the firm comprised D. Gurney, J. H. Gurney, H. Birkbeck,\r\nF. H. Gurney, and C. H. Gurney; and W. Birkbeck came in after the death\r\nof his father.  The bank at Norwich has in its connection branches at\r\nNorth Walsham, Aylsham, Holt, Dereham, Fakenham, and Attleborough.  At\r\nYarmouth the firm, until lately, comprised D. Gurney, J. H. Gurney, H.\r\nBirkbeck, T. Brightwen, and J. H. Orde.  This branch has in its\r\nconnection other branches at Lowestoft, Beccles, Bungay, Halesworth,\r\nSaxmundham, Eye, and Stowmarket.  At Lynn the firm, until lately,\r\ncomprised D. Gurney, J. H. Gurney, H. Gurney, H. Birkbeck, S. Gurney, and\r\nF. G. Cresswell, and this bank extends to Downham and Swaffham.\r\n\r\nThe members of the several firms are now as follow:\r\n\r\n                NORWICH AND NORFOLK BANK.\r\nHenry Birkbeck.               Francis Hay Gurney.\r\nWilliam Birkbeck.             Henry Ford Barclay.\r\nSamuel Gurney Buxton.         John Gurney.\r\n                YARMOUTH AND SUFFOLK BANK.\r\nHenry Birkbeck.               Henry F. Barclay.\r\nS. G. Buxton.                 John Gurney.\r\nThomas Brightwen.             James Henry Orde.\r\n               LYNN AND LINCOLNSHIRE BANK.\r\nDaniel Gurney.                Henry Birkbeck.\r\nSomerville Arthur Gurney.     H. F. Barclay.\r\nS. G. Buxton.                 Francis Joseph Cresswell.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Bank, in King Street, Norwich, was opened on January 2nd, 1792,\r\nas a bank of deposit, discount, and issue.  The original proprietors were\r\nMessrs. Hudson and Hatfield, and the first bank was in the Haymarket.\r\nAbout forty years since the proprietors were Charles Saville Onley, Sir\r\nRobert John Harvey, Anthony Hudson, and Thomas Hudson.  They then\r\nemployed only seven clerks, and now thirty clerks are employed at the new\r\nbank.  On January 13th, 1820, a circular was issued by A. and T. Hudson,\r\nstating that it was with great regret that they announced the death of\r\ntheir friend and partner, Mr. Robert Harvey.  Owing to his death, his\r\nbrother, Mr. Charles Harvey, and Sir Robert John Harvey, his nephew, were\r\nadded to the firm.  Before 1820, Mr. Onley withdrew.  Mr. T. Hudson and\r\nMr. A. Hudson died, and before the end of the Russian war, Sir Robert\r\nJohn Harvey died.  The present proprietors are Sir Robert John Harvey\r\nHarvey, Bart., Crown Point, and Roger Allday Kerrison, Esq., who lives at\r\nIpswich.  They have lately built a very handsome bank in the Corinthian\r\nstyle of architecture, on the Castle Meadow, and it was opened in\r\nJanuary, 1866.  At first the Crown Bank had only three agents in the\r\neastern counties, but the number has gradually increased to thirty.  The\r\nfirm purchased the large business of Messrs. Taylor and Dyson at Diss.\r\nThis was an important addition, the Diss bank having extensive\r\nconnections in Norfolk and Suffolk.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Messrs. Starling Day and Sons were bankers, in Pottergate\r\nStreet, afterwards in the Market Place, in the court adjoining the\r\nChronicle Office; and on December 16th, 1825, the bank stopped.  In 1806,\r\nT. Bignold, Son, and Co. were bankers in Briggs’ Street, but did not long\r\ncontinue in business.  The Norfolk and Norwich Joint Stock Bank was\r\nestablished in 1820, in Surrey Street.  This bank consisted of a small\r\nproprietary, and the business, after the loss of the whole share capital,\r\nwas disposed of to the East of England Joint Stock Company, in 1836.\r\nThat company carried on business in the Haymarket till 1864, when the\r\nbank failed.  The sad event was the cause of much misery in the city and\r\ncounty; and many persons who had been in comfortable circumstances were\r\nentirely ruined and left destitute.  The proprietors lost all their\r\ncapital, and were called upon to liquidate heavy liabilities besides.\r\nThere has not been much over trading in the eastern counties, and the\r\nfailure of the East of England Bank should be a warning to other joint\r\nstock banks, which ought to be the safest if well managed.  The business\r\nof the East of England Bank and the premises were purchased by the\r\nProvincial Banking Corporation, limited, and that company now carries on\r\nbusiness in the Haymarket.\r\n\r\nAbout 1838, Mr. Balls opened a bank for deposits, in the Upper Market.\r\nHe carried on his business through the house of Sanderson in London.\r\nSanderson failed for £365,000, but afterwards paid 20s. in the pound, and\r\nhad £20,000 to spare.  Mr. Balls gave up his bank in Norwich, in 1847.\r\n\r\nThe Consolidated Bank arose from a union of the banks of Hankey and Co.,\r\nand Hayward, Kennard, and Co., London, and the bank of Manchester.  They\r\nwere amalgamated in 1863, under the name of the Consolidated Bank, with a\r\nbranch in London Street, Norwich.  The Company gave up this branch, and\r\nthe handsome new premises in London Street were taken by the National\r\nProvincial Bank, which has been established since 1833.\r\n\r\nCountry banks are all of them banks of deposit and discount; they act as\r\nagents for the remittance of money to and from London, and for effecting\r\npayments between different parts of the kingdom.  Nearly all of them are\r\nalso banks of issue, and their notes are, in most cases, made payable to\r\nsome bank in London, as well as at the place where they are issued.  A\r\nmoderate rate of interest, from 2 to 2½ per cent, is allowed by country\r\nbankers on deposits which remain with them for any period beyond six\r\nmonths.  Some make this allowance for shorter periods.  Where a depositor\r\nhas also a drawing account, the balance is struck every six months, and\r\nthe interest due on the average is placed to his credit.  On drawing\r\naccounts, a commission, usually an eighth per cent, is charged on all\r\npayments.  The country banker on his part pays his London agent for the\r\ntrouble which he occasions, either by keeping a certain sum of money in\r\nhis hands without interest, or by allowing a commission on the payments\r\nmade for his account, or by a fixed annual payment in lieu of the same.\r\nThe portion of funds in their hands arising from deposits and issues,\r\nwhich is not required for discounting bills and making advances in the\r\ncountry, is invested in government or mercantile securities in London,\r\nwhich in the event of a contraction of deposits, can be made immediately\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the eastern counties, the most productive in England,\r\nis the foundation of their industrial prosperity, and the chief source of\r\nbusiness to the banks in the market towns.  It is well known that since\r\nthe commencement of this century, by means of an improved system of\r\nhusbandry, the agricultural resources of the district have greatly\r\nincreased, as has also the annual value of the produce in cattle, sheep,\r\nhorses, pigs, and corn.  The various branches of industry and\r\nmanufactures carried on in Norwich and the county are also, of course, to\r\nbe reckoned amongst the sources of the banking business.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE CLOTHIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer, in White Lion Street; Messrs. Riches and Skoyles, Davey Place;\r\nMr. Womack, Dove Street and Lobster Lane; and Messrs. Steward and Son,\r\nTombland; occupy extensive premises, where garments are made for men and\r\nboys by the use of machines, and are disposed of wholesale to retail\r\nclothiers all over the district.  The introduction of sewing machines has\r\ngiven a great impulse to this trade, and garments of all kinds and sizes\r\nare produced here as good in quality and as low in price as they can be\r\nobtained in any part of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nA minute’s walk from the Market Place, in Bethel Street, are the steam\r\nclothing works and warehouses of Messrs. F. W. Harmer and Co.  Between\r\n200 and 300 persons are employed by this firm in the manufacture of boys’\r\nand men’s clothing; their goods are sold wholesale only, and are made for\r\nwhat is technically called the “home trade.”  In this establishment the\r\ndifferent processes of cutting, sewing, making button holes, &c., which a\r\nfew years since were performed by hand labour, are now principally done\r\nby machinery worked by steam power, to the advantage both of the hands\r\nemployed and the consumers of the goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE BOOT AND SHOE TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis trade dates from the commencement of the present century; and for\r\nsome time it was confined to goods for the home market.  In 1800, Mr.\r\nJames Smith began the trade, which was afterwards enlarged by the late\r\nMr. Charles Winter, who carried on a great business, both for the home\r\nmarket and for exportation to the colonies.  On the death of that\r\ngentleman the concern passed into the hands of Messrs. Willis and\r\nSouthall, under whose able management the reputation of the old house is\r\nfully sustained, and whose goods command a ready sale both at home and\r\nabroad.  The quality of the goods is now much improved, and large\r\nquantities are exported to the colonies.\r\n\r\nFormerly, all boots and shoes were made by hand only, and consequently\r\nthere was a great difference in the quality of the work.  The operatives\r\nused to take their work to their homes.  They received so many dozen\r\nuppers from the warehouses and returned them finished, and were paid\r\naccording to quality and quantity.  The late Mr. C. Winter first made use\r\nof sewing machines, for the uppers of boots and shoes, about 1856.\r\nAfterwards American machines were introduced, to sew the soles to the\r\nuppers.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen years since, the manufacturers began to make goods for\r\nexportation to Canada, to the Cape of Good Hope, to India, and Australia.\r\nThis export trade was carried on to a large extent, from 1856 till 1866.\r\nMr. C. Winter sent large quantities of goods to Canada and India, and the\r\nother manufacturers to Australia.  A number of emigrants, however, went\r\ninto the trade in Australia, and the local parliament imposed a duty of\r\n25 per cent. on English-made goods, which stopped the trade, so that of\r\nlate, very few Australian orders have been received in this city.\r\nNotwithstanding this drawback, the boot and shoe trade has become a very\r\nextensive and important branch of industry in Norwich, and about 3000\r\nhands are employed in the manufacture.  Hitherto it has been confined\r\nchiefly to women and children’s goods, but men’s boots have been made to\r\nsome extent, and there is no reason why the trade should not be greatly\r\nincreased.  Machines, as we have said, have been introduced in the\r\nvarious processes of manufacture, and steam power has been applied to the\r\nmachines in two large factories, where vast quantities of goods are\r\nproduced.  The result has been not to diminish but to extend the number\r\nof hands, and to increase the rate of payment.\r\n\r\nThe hand machines now in use are chiefly those of Thomas, Singer, or\r\nHowes.  About 400 machines are at work daily in the warehouses, and 200\r\nin private houses.  In two factories, large American machines are used\r\nfor attaching the soles to the uppers at the rate of a pair per minute.\r\nBy means of these machines, a pair of boots may be cut out, and the\r\nuppers, after fitting, sewn together and finished in an hour; and the\r\nwork, moreover, is better done by the use of machines than it usually is\r\nby hand.  Three operatives are required for each machine, two fitters and\r\none machinist.\r\n\r\nWhen trade is good, about 3000 men, women, and children, are employed in\r\nthe manufacture, either in the warehouses or in their own homes.  The\r\noperatives may be divided into one-third men, one-third women, and\r\none-third children.  They will produce, with the aid of machines, about\r\n1000 dozen pairs of boots and shoes daily.  The quantity will therefore\r\nbe 6000 dozen weekly, and taking the average price at 40s. per dozen, the\r\nvalue would be £12,000 weekly.  Supposing the trade to continue brisk for\r\nfifty weeks in the year, the annual value would be £600,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, 1868, trade was very prosperous, and manufacturers\r\nreceived more orders than they could execute.  The quantities before\r\nstated may be doubled for that year; and at least 6000 men, women, and\r\nchildren, were employed.  Their production, with the aid of machines, has\r\nbeen about 2000 dozen pairs of boots and shoes daily, or 12,000 dozen\r\npairs weekly, so that the weekly value has been £24,000, or £1,200,000\r\nyearly.  Norwich does not transact a hundredth part of this branch of\r\ntrade in England, and, therefore, it may be increased to an indefinite\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe principal firms in the trade in 1868, were Messrs. Tillyard and\r\nHowlett, on St. George’s Plain; Mr. Kemp, in Pitt Street; Messrs. Willis\r\nand Southall, who occupy very extensive premises in the Upper Market; Mr.\r\nHotblack, St. Faith’s Lane; Mr. Lulham, Fishgate Street; Mr. Ford, St.\r\nGeorge Colegate; Mr. Homan, Theatre Street; Mr. Bostock, Swan Lane; Mr.\r\nSteadman, Bethel Street; Messrs. Barker and Gostling, Wensum Street; Mr.\r\nHaldenstein, Queen Street; Messrs. Gamble and Davis, Calvert Street; Mr.\r\nSmith, Calvert Street; Mr. D. Soman, Calvert Street; Mr. Base, in\r\nPrince’s Street; Mr. Copeman, St. Stephen’s; Mr. Horne, Charing Cross;\r\nMr. Worledge, Magdalen Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD, STARCH, AND BLUE WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carrow Works have been greatly extended since the brief notice in the\r\nfirst part of this history was written, and we are now enabled to give a\r\nfuller description.  Messrs. J. and J. Colman employ about 1200 men and\r\nboys in the production of mustard, starch, blue, paper, and flour.  By\r\nthe use of machinery of the most improved construction, and by selecting\r\nseed of the finest quality, the firm produces mustard which cannot be\r\nsurpassed in purity and flavour.  This mustard obtained the only prize\r\nmedals awarded for the article at the Great Exhibition in London, 1862,\r\nand Dublin, 1865, and the only silver medal at Paris, 1868.  The firm\r\nalso obtained medals for starch at the Great Exhibitions in London, 1851\r\nand 1862; Dublin, 1865; York, 1866; and Paris, 1868.\r\n\r\nCarrow Works are situated just outside of the King Street Gates of the\r\ncity, on the banks of the river Wensum, which is navigable for vessels of\r\nabout 120 tons.  Lines of railway are laid down in various directions\r\nthrough the premises connecting all the principal warehouses with the\r\nGreat Eastern Railway at Trowse.  Thus Messrs. Colman have every facility\r\nfor receiving the raw material, and for disposing of the manufactured\r\ngoods by land or water conveyance.  The machinery used is very extensive,\r\nand sixteen engines are now employed, amounting altogether to 1000-horse\r\npower.\r\n\r\nOn entering the works we pass the timekeeper’s office, and observe on the\r\nright hand a large range of brick buildings.  Here is the mustard mill,\r\nand amid all the noise within we are shewn the process by which the\r\nwell-known condiment, mustard, is produced in such immense quantities,\r\nand in the greatest perfection.  The mustard seed, which is grown\r\nextensively in some parts of this country, is crushed between iron\r\nrollers, and is then pounded in large mortars, a long row of which stand\r\non one side of the mill.  The pestles consist of long wooden rods with\r\nheavy balls of iron.  They are set in rapid motion by means of steam\r\npower, and the mustard seed is speedily reduced to the condition of flour\r\nand bran.  These are readily separated, and the flour is brought to the\r\nrequisite quality by means of silk sieves, which vary in fineness\r\naccording to the quality of the mustard to be produced.  These sieves are\r\nloosely arranged in frames, and set in motion by means of revolving\r\nshafts.  Two kinds of seed, the brown and the white, are thus crushed,\r\npounded, and sifted.  The brown is far more pungent than the white; but\r\nin order to produce a flavour relished by consumers, it is necessary to\r\nmix these two kinds, and it is the judicious mixture which gives the fine\r\naromatic flavour of the mustard for which the firm is celebrated.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the mustard mill is the packing floor, where a great number of\r\nmen and boys are employed in putting the mustard into tins of various\r\nshapes and sizes, and adorning them with the handsome labels which are so\r\ngenerally exhibited in grocers’ windows everywhere, for the demand for\r\nthis mustard is universal.\r\n\r\nLeaving the mustard mill we enter the starch works, which seem to be\r\nstill more extensive.  The process of making starch is carefully\r\nexplained to us.  After the grain has been moistened with a solution of\r\ncaustic soda, it is passed into the mill, where it is mixed with water\r\nand ground in its wet state between mill stones; from each pair of which\r\ncontinually runs a stream of pure white liquid, resembling thin paste.\r\nThis liquid is placed in large iron tanks called “separators,” a\r\nconsiderable quantity of water is added, and the whole is well stirred\r\nfor some time.  It is then allowed to settle, and the various particles\r\nof husk, gluten, &c., sink slowly and form a thick deposit at the bottom.\r\nThe water with the starch in solution is then drawn off and pumped up\r\ninto immense shallow vats, several sets of which, placed over one\r\nanother, occupy the whole of the upper part of the building.  In the\r\ncourse of two or three days the liquid in the shallow vats gradually\r\ndeposits the starch held in solution, when the water is drawn off, and\r\nthe starch is taken out and placed in long narrow boxes filled with holes\r\nand lined with cloth.  It remains in these boxes for some time in order\r\nthat the moisture may gradually drain out and the starch consolidate.  As\r\nsoon as it is sufficiently hardened, the starch is taken out and divided\r\ninto blocks, each about six inches square, and put into stoves and\r\nexposed to a temperature of about 140 degrees; after which it is cleaned,\r\npapered, and again placed in stoves, where it remains till it is\r\ngradually crystallized, when the process of manufacture is complete, and\r\nthe starch is ready for sale.\r\n\r\nWe now walk across to the other side of the premises and enter a long row\r\nof workshops, where a great number of men and boys are employed in making\r\ntin-packages for the mustard.  Passing by long ranges of coopers and\r\ncarpenters’ shops, we soon come to a large square block of buildings\r\ncalled the “blue factory.”  Here the indigo is mixed with the finest\r\nstarch, water is added, and the whole is ground in a moist state by large\r\nheavy mill stones, till it resembles a very thick, dark blue paste.  It\r\nis transferred by means of a steam hoist to the upper part of the\r\nbuilding, where it is received and quickly manipulated by a number of\r\ngirls, who divide it into small cakes and stamp it with wooden stamps of\r\nvarious devices, from which it is called “Stamp Title,” “Lion,” &c.; or\r\nthey work it into balls, on which they leave the impressions of their\r\nfinger and thumb, when it is called “Thumb Blue.”  We learn from the\r\nworkers that the great art of blue making consists in drying it\r\ncarefully, so that the lumps or cakes may harden without cracking.  We\r\nwalk through many rooms, almost in the dark, for the window shutters,\r\nwhich are closed, are so constructed as to regulate the temperature, and\r\nwe have just room to pass between large tiers of racks filled with wooden\r\ntrays, on which the lumps and cakes of blue are placed in order that they\r\nmay dry gradually.\r\n\r\nWe next take a peep at the paper mill, and admire the beautiful machinery\r\nwhich rapidly transforms any quantity of dirty rags into a thin milk-like\r\npulp, and then into solid quires and reams of paper, all cut and ready\r\nfor use.  As we pass we look into the engineers’ shop and wonder at the\r\nvariety of the machinery there, capable of operating on the hardest\r\nsteel, and of planing, cutting, punching, or drilling it with the\r\ngreatest apparent ease; and we learn that most of the machinery is made\r\nand repaired on the premises.\r\n\r\nWe are at last taken to the luncheon kitchen, in which a good lunch or\r\ndinner is provided, consisting of as much hot meat and potatoes as any\r\nman can eat, for threepence.  Many of the men and boys gladly avail\r\nthemselves of this kitchen, and obtain a good meal without leaving the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the yard we ascend the hill and observe a handsome\r\nschool-house, built in the Gothic style, and we learn that it was built\r\nby Messrs. J. and J. Colman for the children of the working-people in\r\ntheir service.  The school comprises several class-rooms, and is fitted\r\nup with every convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRON TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal and iron form the basis of our industrial system in this island, but\r\nneither of them are produced in the eastern counties, which are, for the\r\nmost part, purely agricultural.  Iron manufactures have, however, arisen\r\nsince the commencement of the present century, chiefly for agricultural\r\npurposes.  Norwich cannot boast of concerns so extensive as Messrs.\r\nRansome and Sims, of Ipswich; or Messrs. Garrett, of Leiston, in Suffolk;\r\nbut several firms here employ large numbers of mechanics in the\r\nconstruction of engines, machines, and implements of every sort.\r\n\r\nDr. William Fairbairn, in his “History of Iron,” mentions five distinct\r\nepochs: the first dating from the employment of an artificial blast, to\r\naccelerate combustion; the second marked by the use of coke in the\r\nreduction, about the year 1750; the third dating from the introduction of\r\nthe steam engine, on account of the facilities which that invention has\r\ngiven for raising the ores, pumping the mines, supplying the furnace with\r\na copious and regular blast, and moving the powerful forge, and rolling\r\nmachinery; while the fourth is indicated by the introduction of the\r\nsystem of puddling and rolling; and the fifth and last—though not the\r\nleast important epoch in the history of iron, is marked by the\r\napplication of the hot blast, an invention which has increased the\r\nproduction of iron four-fold, and has enabled the iron-master to smelt\r\notherwise useless and unreducible ores.  It has abolished the processes\r\nof coking and roasting, and has afforded facilities for a large and rapid\r\nproduction, far beyond the most sanguine anticipations of its inventors.\r\nSome manufacturers, taking advantage of so powerful an agent, have used\r\nimproper materials, such as cinder heaps and impure ores, and by unduly\r\nhastening the process, have produced an inferior kind of iron.\r\n\r\nNearly all the iron manufacturers in Norwich, Norfolk, and Suffolk, are\r\nfounders, and make their own castings for engines, girders, and machines\r\nof every kind.  The principal firms in this district are Messrs. Ransome\r\nand Sims, before named; Messrs. Garrett, of Leiston; Mr. Turner, Ipswich;\r\nMessrs. Woods, Cocksedge, and Warner, Stowmarket; Mr. C. Burrell, of\r\nThetford; and Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, & Barnard, Mr. W. S. Boulton, Mr.\r\nSmithdale, and Messrs. Holmes and Sons, of Norwich.  These great firms\r\nsend their productions all over the civilised world.\r\n\r\nThe important works of Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, and Barnard, of Norwich,\r\nare situate in St. Michael’s Coslany, and cover an area of one acre, next\r\nthe river Wensum.  Entering from Coslany Street, the new counting house\r\nis joined on the right by a suite of offices, and on the left by the\r\nsmith’s shop, which is backed by fire-proof workshops, seventy-five feet\r\nin length, and five stories in height.  The large foundry is at the east\r\nend of the works.  A tramway runs from Coslany Street into the interior,\r\npermeating the premises.  About 400 men and boys are employed in the\r\nproduction of wire-netting, fencing, garden chairs, stands, machines,\r\nlawn mowers, gates, and every kind of horticultural implements.  A glance\r\nat the operations of the firm will, doubtless, be interesting to our\r\nreaders.  One of the most important is the production daily of many miles\r\nof wire-netting, made by curious machinery.  The strained wire fencing is\r\nmade on the best principle, the bases of both the straining pillars and\r\nstandards being entirely of iron; and after a test of more than thirty\r\nyears, it has been found very superior, both as regards durability and\r\nappearance.  Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, and Barnard are also makers, on a\r\nlarge scale, of bedsteads, mangles, cooking ranges, kitcheners, &c., &c.,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThis firm, the founder of which was Mr. Charles Barnard, a man of modest\r\ndemeanour, but possessed of considerable inventive genius, will live in\r\nhistory as the manufacturers of the celebrated “Norwich Gates,” exhibited\r\nin 1862.  These were designed by Mr. Thomas Jekyll of this city, and by a\r\ncounty subscription were, in November, 1864, placed at the entrance to\r\nthe park at Sandringham, the residence of the Prince of Wales.  During\r\nthe Exhibition of 1862, these marvellous productions attracted great\r\nattention.  The _Times_, of April 7th, after alluding to works of a\r\nsimilar character, said:—\r\n\r\n    “In our judgment, however, the design of these latter is scarcely\r\n    equal to that of the beautiful wrought-iron park gates, which are\r\n    being erected, as a principal nave trophy, by Messrs. Barnard,\r\n    Bishop, and Barnard.”\r\n\r\nThese were adjudged to be the best in the Exhibition.  The same firm also\r\nproduced very elegant gates, which were exhibited at the Paris\r\nExhibition, in 1867, and greatly admired for the beauty of the design and\r\nperfect workmanship.  These gates were only thirteen feet wide, and seven\r\nfeet in height, but they occupied forty of the best workmen from morning\r\ntill night for three months, at a cost of £750 in wages.  These gates\r\nwere quite unique in design and workmanship.  There was not a touch of\r\nthe chisel.  The hammer did all the work in the most perfect manner.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may state, that after a minute examination of the\r\nproductions at these works, we feel convinced that articles can now be\r\nexecuted in metal, which surpass the doings of past ages; and that the\r\nlabour, combined with the intelligence of this 19th century, when\r\nskilfully directed, is quite equal to that of the mediæval period.\r\n\r\nMr. W. S. Boulton, who occupies extensive premises in Rose Lane, is a\r\nmanufacturer of agricultural and horticultural implements; also of\r\nstrained wire fencing, iron hurdles, park gates, garden chairs, iron\r\nbedsteads, kitchen ranges, hot-water appuratus, &c.  He produces every\r\nkind of railing and palisading in great variety, and he put up the iron\r\npalisading round Chapel Field, which is a great ornament as well as\r\nprotection to the ground.  He also supplies a great variety of useful\r\nmachines, such as mincing and sausage machines, and almost all articles\r\nmade of iron.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Riches and Watts are engineers and machine makers, at Duke’s\r\nPalace Iron Works.  They are builders of condensing engines, vertical\r\ncylinder engines, and steam thrashing machines; and are also makers of\r\nAmerican grist mills, corn mills, mills for grinding linseed, &c.,\r\ncultivators, pumping machinery, iron field rollers, and all kinds of\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Holmes and Sons, engineers, on the Castle Hill, are makers of a\r\ngreat variety of machines and implements which have gained many prizes at\r\ndifferent Agricultural Exhibitions.  The firm have also been very\r\nextensively engaged for thirty-five years in the manufacture of drills.\r\nDuring this period, every practical improvement has been introduced,\r\nadapting them to every description of soil, simplifying the different\r\nparts, and decreasing the working expenses for the renewal of wearing\r\nparts.  These drills stand unequalled for simplicity, durability, and\r\nefficiency, and are of lighter draft than others, owing to the position\r\nof the coulters and levers.  More than 4000 of these drills have been\r\nsent out.  The premises of this firm are well situated close to the\r\ncattle market, and have been considerably enlarged.  The new show rooms\r\nin the Market are nearly opposite to the entrance to the Castle.\r\nEntering the works from the high road, we may first inspect the foundry,\r\ncontaining an enormous crane and three cupolas.  Adjoining the foundry\r\nare the stoves for small castings, and above it the pattern-makers’ shop.\r\nReturning to the yard, we may enter the erecting and fitting shop.  The\r\ndrill-fitting shop and the thrashing-machine shops are admirably adapted\r\nfor their intended purposes.  About a hundred hands are employed in the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Smithdale has a very large establishment at St. Ann’s Staithe,\r\nKing Street, on the site of an ancient monastery, remains of which still\r\nexist next the river.  In the large foundry, castings of iron are made,\r\nup to ten tons; and the workshops contain the heaviest machinery in\r\nNorwich.  Mr. Smithdale builds engines from three to a hundred horse\r\npower; and he makes also hydraulic presses, cranes, crabs, mill works,\r\nplaning, shaping, and drilling machines, and boilers of all sizes.\r\n\r\nMr. Reeve, in Pitt Street, is a manufacturer of improved kitchen ranges\r\nof various sizes, which have been in great demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING PUBLISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Jarrold and Sons have, for the last twenty years, been engaged in\r\nthe production of first-class educational books, in science, history, and\r\npenmanship, which are used in schools in Great Britain and her Colonies.\r\nThey also produced the well-known Household Tracts and other works,\r\nbearing on social, moral, and sanitary subjects.  All are printed and\r\nbound in their recently-erected workshops in Little London Street.  They\r\nhave also a publishing house at No. 12, Paternoster Row, London.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINE, SPIRITS, AND BEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorwich merchants carry on a great wholesale business in wines and\r\nspirits.  The principal firms are Messrs. Barwell and Sons, London Street\r\nand St. Stephen’s; Messrs. Norgate and Son, St. Stephen’s; Messrs.\r\nGeldart, in Wensum Street; the Wine Company, in St. Giles’ Street; Mr. P.\r\nBack, Market Place; Mr. R. J. Morley, Post Office Street; and Mr. J.\r\nChamberlin, Post Office Street; all of whom keep large stocks of wines\r\nand spirits.\r\n\r\nThe brewing business is greatly extending in Norwich.  Norwich brewers\r\nproduce pale ales, which claim to be equal to the Burton, and dispose of\r\n100,000 barrels of London porter yearly.  Messrs. Seaman and Grimmer,\r\nthough not producers, do an enormous trade, and bring in, through\r\nYarmouth, about 14,000 barrels of London porter yearly, and send them all\r\nover the city and county.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Patteson and Co. produce 100,000 barrels of ale and beer yearly;\r\nMessrs. Bullard, 60,000 barrels; Messrs. Morgan, 30,000; Messrs. Young\r\nand Co., and other brewers, about 40,000.  The annual value of their\r\nproductions is at least £500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE DRAPERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis trade is largely carried on by Messrs. Chamberlin & Sons, Mr. G. L.\r\nColeman, Mr. Rackham, Mr. Henry Snowdon, and a branch house of Messrs.\r\nCopestake and Moore, of London.  Their trade is in cotton, linen,\r\nwoollen, and silk goods, plain and fancy fabrics, which are supplied to\r\nshopkeepers all over the eastern counties.  They bring goods from all the\r\nmanufacturing districts, and supply them on terms quite as advantageous\r\nas the London houses.  These goods are chiefly of Scotch, Yorkshire, or\r\nLancashire manufactures, and not produced in Norwich.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Chamberlin and Sons, a few years since, rebuilt their premises in\r\nthe Market Place, which are an ornament to the city.  This is the largest\r\nestablishment for drapery in the eastern counties.  On entering the\r\npremises from the Market Place, the retail department presents, in all\r\nits arrangements, a thoroughly complete place of business.  The wholesale\r\nand other departments above are very extensive.  In the basement of the\r\npremises is the wholesale Manchester room, 180 feet in length, for linen\r\ngoods, blankets, and flannels.  There is a separate entrance, in Dove\r\nStreet, to the extensive woollen cloth department.  The carpet room is 44\r\nfeet long and 40 feet wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE GROCERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wholesale grocery trade is carried on to a large extent by Messrs.\r\nBream and Bennett, Mr. W. Belding, Messrs. Butcher and Nephew, Messrs.\r\nCopeman and Sons, Mr. H. Freeman, Mr. R. Fisher, Messrs. Newson and Co.,\r\nand Messrs. Pratt and Hancock.  This trade disposes of the bulk of the\r\nheavy goods brought to the city and sent away from it.  The following is\r\nthe return of the goods, inwards and outwards, for the year ending June,\r\n1867:—\r\n\r\nGoods inwards by river          60,000 tons\r\n,, Thorpe Station                 30,000 ,,\r\n,, Victoria ,,                    22,661 ,,\r\n,, Trowse ,,                      17,616 ,,\r\n                               130,277 tons\r\nGoods outwards by river        100,000 tons\r\n,, at Thorpe                      53,000 ,,\r\n,, at Trowse                      20,434 ,,\r\n,, at Victoria                     7,534 ,,\r\n\r\nCIGARS AND TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of tobacco was introduced into Norwich in 1815 by Mr.\r\nCurr, formerly of St. Andrew’s.  Since then the trade has gradually\r\nincreased, and the various kinds of shag, twist, and cavendish, are now\r\nproduced to the extent of between 100,000 and 200,000 lbs. yearly, by Mr.\r\nNewbegin of Bridewell Alley, and Mr. Kitton on the Dereham Road.\r\n\r\nThe only cigar manufacturers are Messrs. Adcock and Denham, of Post\r\nOffice Street, and Mr. Stevens, Back of the Inns.  Messrs. Adcock and\r\nDenham, are the largest makers in the Eastern Counties, and employ a\r\nconsiderable number of hands.  At their establishment may be seen tobacco\r\nfrom various countries, and the curious enquirer will learn, no doubt\r\nwith surprise, how many distant spots of the earth are laid under\r\ncontribution to supply the demand which exists for the fragrant weed in\r\nthe form of cigars—the importations being, amongst other places, from\r\nColumbia, Cuba, Havanna (in Cuba), Japan, Latakia, Manilla, Mexico,\r\nParaguay, Porto Rico, &c.  The operations, too, are interesting, though\r\nnot easily described.  From the case or bale in which the tobacco\r\narrives, it passes into the hands of the person whose duty it is to\r\nsoften it—a process which requires great skill and care; for the leaf is\r\ngenerally dry and brittle, and has to be shaken and well separated before\r\nthe softening can be properly effected.  The leaf, having been rendered\r\nsufficiently pliable, is next passed over to the “strippers,” whose work\r\nis to draw out the thick stem which traverses it from end to end.  Then\r\nit has to be sorted—the light from the dark, the coarse from the fine—and\r\nlaid in proper order for the “makers,” who with almost magical rapidity,\r\nand by the exercise of great nicety of judgment and manipulation, convert\r\nit into cigars of any required size, shape, and weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPHOLSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several large workshops in this city, for the manufacture of\r\nevery kind of furniture and cabinet work; and in these, some hundreds of\r\nskilled artisans are employed.  Among the principal establishments may be\r\nmentioned those of Messrs. Trevor & Page, Post Office Street; Mr. C. J.\r\nFreeman, in London Street; Messrs. John Crowe and Sons, in St. Stephen’s\r\nStreet; Messrs. Robertson and Sons, Queen Street; and Messrs. Drew and\r\nCorrick, in St. George’s Middle Street.  All these establishments supply\r\nthe best articles for furnishing a house or mansion.  The historian who\r\nmight wish to describe the familiar habits and usages of the present\r\ntimes, could not do better than spend a few hours in our large upholstery\r\nwarehouses, where may be seen every kind of furniture, from articles\r\nwhich contribute to our homeliest comforts, to others which please the\r\neye by their beauty and good taste.  These may be found grouped together\r\nin profusion, making the impression on the mind that this must be a\r\nwealthy district to require the vast stores of goods kept in Norwich\r\nwarehouses; but so it is, as every one knows who has visited the\r\ndwellings of many of our rich citizens.  Luxuries are enjoyed by the\r\nwell-to-do classes of to-day, which could not be found in baronial halls\r\na few centuries ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRIAGE MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several large builders of carriages, gigs, carts, phaetons,\r\n&c., in this city, including Messrs. Jolly and Son, St. Stephen’s Street;\r\nMr. Thorn, St. Giles’ Gates; Messrs. Howes, Chapel Field; Mr. Harcourt,\r\nChapel-Field Road; Messrs. J. and J. Howes, Red Lion Street; Mr. W. H.\r\nHowes, Prince of Wales’ Road; Mr. Rudling, St. Martin’s at Palace.  Mr.\r\nThorn’s “Norwich Car” and “Norfolk Shooting Cart” are well known all over\r\nEngland.  Messrs. Jolly build every sort of useful and fancy vehicle in\r\nthe best possible style.  We cannot here pretend to tell how much the\r\nconstruction of carriages has been improved in the present century, as\r\ncompared with the old lumbering vehicles formerly in use.  Suffice it to\r\nsay, that by the application of science, English carriages have become\r\nthe best in all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSHES AND PAPER BAGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. S. D. Page and Sons have built a large warehouse in the\r\nHaymarket, where they employ upwards of 100 hands in the manufacture of\r\nbrushes for wholesale trade.  They are also extensively engaged in the\r\npaper trade and in the manufacture of paper bags by very interesting and\r\ncurious machinery worked by steam power, and by which each bag is pasted,\r\nfolded, cut, and completed in the machine with astonishing rapidity.\r\nThree such machines, and several hands, are employed.  The bags are made\r\nof various sizes and qualities of paper, adapted for the general use of\r\ngrocers, drapers, confectioners, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOUR MILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the steam flour mills at Carrow works, which produce about 1500\r\nsacks of flour weekly, there are mills in St. Swithin’s and Hellesdon,\r\nwhich also produce enormous quantities.  Messrs. Barber and Sons are the\r\nowners of the water mills at Hellesdon, and the steam flour mills in St.\r\nSwithin’s.  The old water mills in St. Swithin’s, the property of the\r\ncorporation, are in the occupation of Mr. Wells, and are in active\r\noperation.  There are also many wind mills in the neighbourhood, and\r\nwater mills abound.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis business is carried on, as before stated, at Carrow works, but the\r\nlargest mills are at Taverham, a few miles from Norwich.  At these mills,\r\nvast quantities of paper are produced yearly, of various kinds and\r\nqualities, including broad sheets for several influential newspapers.\r\nThe trade has been greatly increased since the repeal of the duty on\r\npaper; but the increase here is nothing to what it has been elsewhere,\r\nsince the daily newspapers have reached a circulation of hundreds of\r\nthousands per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOAP TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother branch of business, arising from productive industry, is that in\r\nsoap, of which Mr. Andrews, of Fishgate Street, is a large manufacturer.\r\nWithin the Norwich Excise Collection, there are several soap makers, who\r\nproduce immense quantities of an article which is used in the silk,\r\nwoollen, linen, and cotton manufactures, as well as for domestic\r\npurposes.  About 300,000,000 lbs. are produced yearly in the Norwich\r\nExcise district.  The repeal of the duty upon this useful article must\r\nhave greatly increased the consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COAL TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen Norwich merchants carry on a considerable trade in coal.\r\nThey receive coal inward by river 70,000 tons, by railway 62,000 tons; in\r\nall, 132,000 tons annually.  The conveyance, at 6s. 8d. per ton, will be\r\n£44,000; and the total value, at 20s. per ton, will be £132,000.  The\r\nprincipal merchants are Messrs. J. and H. Girling, Mr. Dawbarn, Mr.\r\nPointer, Mr. Coller, Mr. Jewson, and others, who now bring coal by\r\nrailway from the central coal fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE FOOD AND MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very extensive business in artificial food for cattle has sprung up of\r\nlate years, but as yet there are only two or three firms engaged in the\r\ntrade in Norwich.  Mr. John Ketton has mills near Foundry Bridge, where\r\nhe produces about 200 tons of cake weekly, for fattening cattle.  The\r\nlinseed or other seed is crushed by immense circular stones, turned by\r\ningenious machinery.  The oil, thus squeezed out, is of great value, and\r\nthe refuse is made into cake for fattening cattle, and sold at £8 per\r\nton.  The oil is of equal value.  Messrs. Gayford, Kitton, and Co., have\r\nmills at St. Ann’s Staithe, King Street, and produce 100 tons of cake\r\nweekly.  These two firms, therefore, produce about 300 tons of cake\r\nweekly, or 15,600 tons yearly, the whole value being £124,800.  The oil\r\nbeing of equal value, the total trade amounts to £250,000 a year.  Other\r\ncity merchants, not producers, send away about 100 tons a-week.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. William Stark, of this city, was an eminent chemist, and the\r\nfirst who produced bone manures.  His son, Mr. M. I. Stark, continues the\r\nsame manufacture of manures, made from steamed bones under a process by\r\nwhich all their gelatinous and fertilizing properties are converted into\r\nthe most suitable form for application to the land.  He also produces\r\nlarge quantities of cake, made from linseed and beans.  This new article\r\nof artificial food has given great satisfaction.  The mills are at Duke’s\r\nPalace Bridge, Norwich, and Rockland St. Mary.  Mr. Reynolds and Mr.\r\nParker also produce other kinds of artificial manure in large quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE AND CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese trades properly belong to the county, but the transactions in the\r\ncity are on a large scale.  The cattle trade is the great trade in the\r\neastern counties, and more especially of Norfolk.  A vast amount of it is\r\ntransacted on the Castle Hill, greatly to the benefit of the city, as it\r\ngives employment to a large number of poor people, and brings custom to\r\nmany inns, taverns, and business establishments.  Norwich Cattle Market\r\nis now one of the largest in England, taking the whole year round, and it\r\nis rapidly increasing.  The following returns show the extent of the\r\ntrade in the city and county.  The traffic at Trowse Station, from June\r\n1866 to June 1867, was as follows:—\r\n\r\nCattle inwards         57,058\r\nSheep ,,               76,154\r\nPigs ,,                 9,855     Total 143,067\r\nCattle outwards        35,083\r\nSheep ,,               59,063\r\nPigs ,,                12,493     Total 106,639\r\n\r\nMost of these animals are brought to or sent away from Norwich Market.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty acres of layers belonging to the railway company round\r\nTrowse Station, and about one hundred acres of layers close by belonging\r\nto private parties.  These layers are generally covered with cattle and\r\nsheep during the season, from August till November.  The valleys of the\r\nYare, the Bure, and the Waveney, afford almost unlimited pastures for any\r\nnumber of cattle and sheep, and the greater part of the lean stock sold\r\non Norwich Hill are brought to be fattened on those pastures.  In short,\r\nthe cattle trade on the Great Eastern lines has been greatly increasing,\r\nand is now the largest on any system of railways in England.\r\n\r\nNorfolk ranks the fourth in extent, as compared with other counties in\r\nEngland, and eighth as regards population; and it is well known, that\r\nsince the commencement of this century, the resources of the county, in\r\nregard to the production of corn, have been greatly increased by an\r\nimproved system of husbandry.  Over a million acres are under\r\ncultivation, including 200,000 acres of commons and sandy heaths, which\r\nhave been inclosed of late years.  In 1831, the average yield of wheat\r\nwas three quarters per acre; but there has been an increase of thirty per\r\ncent, since that period.\r\n\r\nAccording to the inspector’s returns of sales of corn in the Norwich\r\nExchange, the quantities and prices have varied greatly in different\r\nyears, since 1845.  In the year ending October 11th, 1845, the quantity\r\nof wheat sold was 150,226 qrs., but after the repeal of the corn laws,\r\nthe quantity was gradually reduced to the year ending October 3rd, 1868,\r\nwhen it was 65,903 qrs.  Since 1855, the quantity of barley sold yearly\r\nhas varied from 120,000 to 177,000 qrs.; and in the year ending October\r\n3rd, 1868, it was 166,796 qrs.  Average prices per qr. for 1868.  Wheat,\r\n66/9½.  Barley, 42/8¼.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARRYING TRADE.\r\n(_By water_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river Wensum flows for a distance of 30 miles from Rudham to Norwich,\r\nand winding round the city, flows into the Yare at Trowse.  The Yare\r\nwinds through the eastern division of the county for 36 miles to\r\nYarmouth.  The Waveney flows into the Yare at Reedham, and the Bure at\r\nYarmouth.  The three rivers, Yare, Bure, and Waveney, are 200 miles in\r\nlength, and afford means of water conveyance from the city and all parts\r\nof East Norfolk to Yarmouth haven.  The inhabitants of that town have\r\nmade no fewer than seven havens, one after the other, at a cost of\r\nmillions of money,—enough to have formed the piers and quays of solid\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nWe have already given an account of the proceedings of the corporation of\r\nNorwich respecting the improvement of the navigation from this city to\r\nYarmouth and Lowestoft, between 1820 and 1840, and, therefore, will not\r\ngo over the same ground again.  We need only add that the improvement has\r\nbeen continued both by the authorities of Yarmouth and Lowestoft, that\r\nthe channel over Breydon has been deepened to seven feet at low water,\r\nand that a handsome bridge has been built at Yarmouth, allowing of the\r\nfree ebb and flow of the tidal waters.  The harbour at Lowestoft has also\r\nbeen kept open, and the navigation from that port to the city is still\r\ncarried on by means of wherries and other vessels.  These wherries are\r\npeculiar to the rivers of Norfolk and Suffolk, and those used on the Yare\r\ncarry from fifteen to forty tons, drawing from three to four feet of\r\nwater.  The mast is balanced by means of lead, so that one man can raise\r\nand lower it, and on this the sail is hoisted, being extended by a gaff.\r\nThese vessels are well adapted for the windings of the stream, and are\r\ngenerally navigated by two hands, one of them being often a boy, or the\r\nwife of a waterman.  The corporation has jurisdiction on the river from\r\nHellesdon Bridge to Hardley Cross, a distance of twenty-four miles.\r\nThis, however, does not interfere with the rights of landowners on the\r\nbanks, all of whom have their respective free fisheries, &c.  Ten bridges\r\ncross the river in its passage through the city and its suburbs.\r\n\r\nNorwich and Yarmouth must ever be united in the carrying trade by water,\r\nas the river Yare flows into the sea.  From the statements already made,\r\nit will be seen that for centuries past Yarmouth has been the chief port\r\nof the city and county; that from the city, and various towns in East\r\nNorfolk, vast quantities of goods have been annually conveyed along the\r\nYare, Bure, and Waveney, to that port, to be thence shipped to all parts\r\nof England; and that Norwich merchants have brought in the larger\r\nproportion of their goods _viâ_ Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, an act, the 29 and 30 Victoria, c 242, was passed for “the\r\nconservanity and improvement of the port and haven of Great Yarmouth, and\r\nthe rivers connected therewith, also for the levying and abolishing of\r\ntolls and duties, and for other purposes.”  This was the last Yarmouth\r\nPort and Haven Act, and under it, the tolls have been increased on all\r\nvessels coming to Norwich.  By clause 144, it was enacted that, “From and\r\nafter the 25th day of March, 1867, all monies received from time to time\r\nby the Norwich corporation in respect of the Norwich tolls, shall be\r\napplied by that corporation as follows:—First, in payment of interest on\r\nthe £4000 secured on the Norwich tolls, or so much thereof as from time\r\nto time remains secured thereon; and after and subject to that payment.\r\nSecondly, in payment of a compensation to the Norwich corporation for the\r\nabandonment and cesser of the Norwich tolls, during the term of seven\r\nyears, commencing on the 25th day of March, 1867, in sums decreasing £100\r\nyearly, from £700 to £100.  Thirdly, on payment of the principal of the\r\nmortgage debts of £4000, or of so much thereof as from time to time\r\nremains secured on the Norwich tolls.”\r\n\r\nThus, the Norwich tolls will be extinguished in seven years from March,\r\n1867; in 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_By Road and Rail_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads and railways are as necessary as rivers for the carrying trade, and\r\neven more so.  Formerly, roads were the chief means of transit, and the\r\ngreat roads in the eastern counties were among the best in England.  The\r\nRomans made all the great roads from Norwich to Ipswich, Colchester, and\r\nLondon; also from Norwich to Newmarket and London; and many others.\r\n\r\nAfter the commencement of the railway system, the merchants of Norwich\r\nand other towns felt that they must be placed on an equality with other\r\nparts of the kingdom.  Various lines of railways were therefore\r\nprojected; acts of parliament were obtained; and the Eastern Counties\r\nfrom London to Colchester, the Eastern Union from Colchester to Ipswich\r\nand thence to Norwich; the Norfolk from Yarmouth; Norwich to Brandon and\r\nthence to London; and the East Anglian lines, were made and opened.\r\nAfterwards the East Suffolk line was opened from Yarmouth to Beccles,\r\nBungay, and Ipswich.  The Norfolk line was opened in 1845, and caused an\r\nentire change in the carrying trade of the district.  The quantity of\r\ngoods sent along the line to London was soon 100,000 tons yearly, and\r\ngreat quantities were sent by way of Ely and Peterborough to the large\r\ntowns in the north of England, from which also goods are brought to\r\nNorwich.  It is evident, therefore, that a vast amount of traffic, by sea\r\nor land, was transferred to the railway.  Goods which, prior to the\r\nopening of the line were forwarded by road from Norwich into the interior\r\nof the county, were sent by railway as far as Thetford, and thus escaped\r\nthe tonnage dues; and when the branch lines were opened from Lowestoft to\r\nBeccles and Reedham, and from Wymondham to Dereham, Fakenham and Wells,\r\nthere was a still greater diversion of the traffic.  Large quantities of\r\ncoal were sent by railway direct to Dereham, which soon became a depôt\r\nfor central Norfolk.  From all the towns along its course, the new line\r\ntook the greater part of the carrying trade.  It was soon a prosperous\r\nline, and proved to be of great commercial advantage to the city.\r\n\r\nThe opening of all the new lines immediately caused coaches to be\r\ndiscontinued, and threw a deal of shipping out of employment at Yarmouth,\r\nLynn, and Wells.  By railways large quantities of corn and malt were sent\r\nto various towns that used to be sent by sea.  Goods, too, from all parts\r\nof the north of England were brought by railway into Norfolk and Norwich.\r\nFor a long time the chief part of the salt of England was produced in\r\nCheshire and sent down the river Weaver, which flows into the Mersey at\r\nLiverpool, whence it was transhipped to Yarmouth, where the consumption\r\nis immense, not less than 10,000 tons yearly being used for curing fish.\r\nThe greater part of the salt then used in the eastern district was sent\r\nfrom Yarmouth through Norfolk and Suffolk by river conveyance; but since\r\nthe opening of the line from Ely to Peterborough, large quantities have\r\nbeen sent by railway from Stoke Works, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to\r\nany station along the lines at the rate of a penny per ton per mile.\r\nThus large supplies of salt have been brought to the city and county.\r\nWhat has taken place in regard to the trade in salt is only one example\r\nof what has occurred in reference to the trade in any other kind of heavy\r\ngoods.  The Norfolk main line was not laid out so much with a view to the\r\nthrough traffic from any town to London, as to catch the traffic from the\r\ncity and county to the Midland and Northern Counties, by way of Ely and\r\nPeterborough; and this object was completely attained, greatly to the\r\nadvantage of the city and county.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a summary of the carrying trade for 1866–7.\r\n\r\nGoods carried by river inward     60,000 tons\r\nCoal ,, ,,                        70,000 ,,\r\nGoods ,, Thorpe Station           30,000 ,,\r\nCoal ,, ,,                        17,000 ,,\r\nGoods ,, Victoria Station         22,661 ,,\r\nCoal ,, ,,                        25,349 ,,\r\nGoods ,, Trowse Station           17,616 ,,\r\nCoal ,, ,,                        16,706 ,,\r\n                                  259,322 ,,\r\n\r\nGoods outward by river            100,000 tons\r\n,, at Thorpe                      53,000 ,,\r\n,, at Trowse                      20,434 ,,\r\n,, at Victoria                    7,534 ,,\r\n                                  180,968 ,,\r\n\r\nCattle inward at Trowse                    57,058\r\nSheep ,, ,,                                76,154\r\nPigs ,, ,,                                  9,855\r\n                                          143,067\r\n\r\nCattle outward at Trowse                   35,083\r\nSheep ,, ,,                                59,063\r\nPigs ,, ,,                                 12,493\r\n                                          106,639\r\n\r\nTonnage return of goods, coal, and fish, received at and forwarded from\r\nSouthtown Station, East Suffolk railway, from July 1866, to July 1867.\r\n\r\n                     Tons\r\nGoods outwards         8,965\r\n,, inwards            10,306\r\nFish outwards         15,207\r\nCoal ,,                  122\r\n   Total outwards     24,294\r\n    Total inwards     10,306\r\n                      34,600\r\n\r\nThe return for Vauxhall Station at Yarmouth, Norfolk railway, for the\r\ncorresponding period, gives the following results.\r\n\r\n                     Tons\r\nGoods outwards        23,116\r\n,, inwards            14,817\r\nFish outwards          8,014\r\n,, inwards               148\r\nCoal outwards          8,423\r\n,, inwards               910\r\n                      32,328\r\n\r\nTonnage return for Lowestoft, for the year ending June 30th, 1867.\r\n\r\n                      Tons\r\nGoods inwards          11,513\r\n,, outwards             9,069\r\n                       20,582\r\nFish inwards               42\r\n,, outwards             9,561\r\n                        9,603\r\nCoal inwards            2,179\r\n,, outwards            13,979\r\n                       16,158\r\n    Total received     13,736\r\n   Total forwarded     39,036\r\n     Total traffic     52,772\r\n\r\nThus, it appears that a large proportion of the carrying trade of Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk is through the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft.\r\n\r\nThe goods sent away from Norwich by river, roads, and railways, consist\r\nof yarns, which are produced here in large quantities, textile fabrics of\r\nevery description, boots and shoes to the extent of 12,000 dozen pairs\r\nweekly, brushes, manufactured goods of every sort, corn, malt, beer, oil\r\ncake, cotton cake, linseed oil, mustard, starch, flour, paper, general\r\ndrapery, grocery, and printed books.  About 15,000 tons of cake for\r\nfattening cattle are sent away yearly, and distributed over the eastern\r\ncounties.  The goods brought into Norwich consist of raw materials of\r\nevery kind, stone, timber, iron, coal, corn, vast quantities of grocery\r\nand drapery, wines, spirits, ales, porter, fruits, fish, game, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\nPOLITICAL, ECCLESIASTICAL, RELIGIOUS, & EDUCATIONAL\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nPolitical History.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have already recorded the chief political events of the last century,\r\nand we shall now proceed to connect it with the present period by a brief\r\nreview of political meetings and elections.  An account of all the\r\ncontested elections, in full detail, would be highly interesting if it\r\ncould be written, but unfortunately the local records are very imperfect\r\nand unreliable.  The public journals have been, of course, biassed by\r\nparty considerations, and from them it is impossible to derive an\r\nimpartial account.\r\n\r\nThe English parliament has now attained the patriarchal age of 600 years.\r\nThe latest researches confirm the conclusions of the earlier historians,\r\nthat the year 1265 is the date of the first regal summons convoking the\r\ngreat council of the nation, at least in its complete form, on a muster\r\nof lords, spiritual and temporal, knights of the shire, and\r\nrepresentatives of cities and boroughs; and throughout the whole\r\nsexcentenary period which has elapsed, the estates of the realm have been\r\nconvened at frequent intervals to advise the sovereign on national\r\naffairs.  Parliament gradually effected great advances in the cause of\r\nliberty; for, at the time of granting taxes and aids, they generally\r\ncoupled such concessions with important provisions for the good of their\r\nfellow-citizens and the community at large.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. directed a writ to the bailiffs by which four citizens of\r\nNorwich were ordered to be returned to Parliament; but, the attendance of\r\nmembers being then _paid for by their constituents_, the expense was an\r\nobject, and they therefore made interest to get the members reduced to\r\ntwo only.  Under the old charters of the city the freemen were entitled\r\nto vote for members of parliament and members of the corporation; and\r\nhouseholders were not included in the list of voters till the Reform Act\r\nof 1832.  The old freemen, therefore, formed the greater part of the\r\nconstituency, and in the course of time became a very corrupt body here,\r\nas well as in all other corporate towns.  By the act of 1729, it was\r\nprovided “that at every election for burgesses in parliament, every one\r\nthat votes must swear that he hath been admitted to his freedom twelve\r\ncalendar months before that election, and that he hath not been polled at\r\nthat election before, or in case of an election of two members, but for\r\none person.”  The Reform Act of 1832, however, extended the franchise to\r\n£10 householders in towns, and gave them a preponderating power in\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries the House of Commons represented only the landed\r\ninterest, and nearly all laws were in favour of the land-owners, who,\r\nunder pretence of protecting native industry, enacted laws to prevent or\r\nto limit the importation of foreign corn.  The great land-owners in the\r\nHouse of Lords had their nominees, too, in the House of Commons, and\r\nruled the entire country.\r\n\r\nThe first Revolution in France produced a wonderful effect on the\r\npolitical and religious worlds.  In the year 1790 commenced those great\r\nand important events in France, which laid the foundation of the long war\r\nthat afterwards raged between that unfortunate empire and this country,\r\nand which almost ruined Norwich.  Party spirit here began to rage with\r\nincreased violence.  The Tories were vehemently against the Revolution,\r\nand the Whigs were equally earnest in its favour.  It is well known,\r\nindeed, that the unparalleled convulsions on the continent extended their\r\ninfluence to England and Scotland, and raised a storm, although not so\r\ndisastrous, yet scarcely less permanent.  The jealousies of government\r\nhad been excited to an unreasonable height, and the suspension of the\r\nHabeas Corpus Act furnished the ministers with an opportunity of\r\ngratifying all their revenge on political opponents.  England, in short,\r\nby the base, suspicious, and mean conduct of her rulers, became for a\r\nshort time the land of persecution and oppression.  Many of the most\r\nrespectable men were imprisoned on frivolous charges, while others were\r\naccused of high treason; and though acquitted by juries, yet imprisonment\r\ninjured their health, distressed their families, and exhausted their\r\nproperty.  These disgraceful transactions continued for some time, and\r\nroused a strong feeling of indignation against the government of the day.\r\n\r\nMr. Mark Wilks, a Baptist preacher in this city, of whose history we have\r\nalready given some extensive details (see p. 482), made himself very\r\nprominent as an advocate of the Revolution, and of radical principles.\r\nOn July 14th, 1791, he preached two political discourses, before crowded\r\ncongregations, in defence of the Revolution in France, and these\r\ndiscourses had a marked effect in the city; and he became a very active\r\npolitical partizan, both in the city and county.  He took a great\r\ninterest in Hardy and his associates, who had become involved in debt by\r\nthe great expenses of their trial.  He instituted a subscription in all\r\nparts of the kingdom to assist the sufferers; and on April 19th, 1795, he\r\npreached two sermons in Norwich, in which he exposed with great severity\r\nthe injustice of the measures adopted against them, and vindicated their\r\ncharacters and conduct.  The collections, after the sermons, amounted to\r\na large sum.  In one of his sermons, he said:—\r\n\r\n    “In favour of Mr. Windham’s acquitted felons, (Thomas Hardy, John\r\n    Horne Tooke, Bonney, Kidd, Joyce, Holcroft, Richton, and Baxter, and\r\n    all their supposed associates in guilt), we may adduce their\r\n    peaceable and orderly demeanour in all their public and private\r\n    transactions.  By whatever names men are called, whether loyalists or\r\n    republicans, whether Reevites or Jacobins, I will venture to say that\r\n    friends of anarchy are foes of society, and ought to be considered as\r\n    wolves scattering the shepherd’s flock, and dealt with accordingly.\r\n    But have we seen one atom of licentious wantonness, one spark of\r\n    civil discord in these friends of reform?  No! the peaceable and\r\n    orderly deportment of these societies has been sufficient to convince\r\n    every unprejudiced mind how much they have acted under the influence\r\n    of that wisdom which cometh from above, which is in its nature\r\n    peaceable, and productive of good fruits.\r\n\r\n    “The Jacobins in this city—and except at Paris there can have been\r\n    none greater—have given repeated demonstrations of their love of\r\n    peace.  At a time when the starving poor felt an iniquitous\r\n    disposition to riot; when the friends of freedom were represented as\r\n    having formed a design of regulating markets, dividing farms, and\r\n    equalising property; and when the imbecile farmer credulously imbibed\r\n    the representation, the affiliated societies in this city published\r\n    this resolve, ‘_That if any member should break the peace by the\r\n    violation of existing laws_, _he should not only be excluded_, _but\r\n    delivered up into the hands of justice_.’  No exclusion, however, has\r\n    taken place in consequence of this resolution; and the reason has\r\n    been obvious—there has been no offence.  The traitorous conspirators\r\n    (so called) in this city can call upon the Right Hon. W. Windham to\r\n    bear testimony to their love of peace.  The opposition he experienced\r\n    last July, he very well knows arose from no personal disrespect, nor\r\n    from any view of incompetency on his part in point of talents, but\r\n    from a love of peace and an inveterate hatred of this accursed war.\r\n    Mr. Windham very well knows, that when he appeared in the character\r\n    of a true patriot, when it was his creed that ‘The influence of the\r\n    crown had _increased_, was _increasing_, and ought to be\r\n    _diminished_;’ when he avowedly acted as a spy on the executive\r\n    government; when he was found to be the vigilant guardian of the\r\n    life, liberty, and property of his constituents; when no horrid\r\n    imprecation from his all-erring lips had blasted our commercial\r\n    interests; when he had not learned to calumniate his constituents and\r\n    to impute the blackest crimes to the friends of his country; when he\r\n    had not apostatized from the sacred path marked out by a Hampden’s\r\n    and a Sydney’s blood; when he had not frowned on freedom and preached\r\n    the doctrine of extermination, he was respected—yes, loved; at least\r\n    by one, who has offended his best friends, sacrificed his interest,\r\n    and endangered his life to procure his present elevation.  Mr.\r\n    Windham knows that he was never despised by the Whig interest in the\r\n    city, till he appeared in the character of a war minister, and the\r\n    enthusiastic abettor of the most disgraceful and perilous measures\r\n    ever pursued by weak and wicked men.  Perhaps Mr. Windham may boast\r\n    that his friends in Norwich are not diminished, that he found as many\r\n    last July as he was wont to find.  True, but where did he find them?\r\n    Where public money had paved his way!  At the Back of the Inns, among\r\n    flannel-waistcoat manufacturers, in the precincts of the Cathedral,\r\n    and in many places and connexions where, on former occasions, he\r\n    would have been ashamed to have sought them.  Here are those who by\r\n    the possession of places, contracts, promises, expectations, and\r\n    anticipations, are influenced to vote for all the measures of\r\n    government, right or wrong; and those who, connected with the above\r\n    description, are pleased with their prosperity and rejoice to see\r\n    them fatten, though on the public spoil.\r\n\r\n    “Those, too, are to be met with here, who under the influence of\r\n    superstition and prejudice tremble for the safety of _Church and\r\n    King_.  Nor are we without those brainless Gallios, by whom men and\r\n    measures are never weighed; who, devoid of sense and negligent of the\r\n    means which might make them wise, always see with the eyes of others,\r\n    and bow obsequious to their lordly wills.  To the credit of the\r\n    nation, however, at the late election, a fifth class of citizens was\r\n    found, a class of freemen who, though called Jacobin levellers, could\r\n    not countenance a man of blood.  These, averse to coercive measures,\r\n    averse to violence, averse to war, averse to the annihilation of\r\n    commerce, and alike averse to a nation’s ruin, turned their eyes to a\r\n    friend of peace; and in the person of Mr. Mingay found an unsullied\r\n    blank, on which 770 freemen wrote their protest against the measures\r\n    of the administration, the commencement and continuance of a dreadful\r\n    war.  Let me ask Mr. Windham, let me ask the world, who are the best\r\n    men, the advocates of negociation, who wish to overcome evil with\r\n    good, or those who destroy the world by casting about firebrands,\r\n    arrows, and death?  If the former, I will then assert that the\r\n    reputed conspirators are of that description, and deserve the\r\n    character of the best of men.\r\n\r\n    “When the friends of freedom met to celebrate the deliverance of the\r\n    acquitted felons, had the duke of Portland known their character, our\r\n    present worthy mayor would have received no orders from his grace’s\r\n    office to parade the streets with constables to preserve the peace.\r\n    Had no curry-favour sycophant, no worthless candidate for the\r\n    receiver generalship, endeavoured to excite the jealousy of his\r\n    grace, the mayor would not have been necessitated to do what to him\r\n    was unpleasant, or of vindicating in his letter to the duke, which to\r\n    his honour he did, the injured character of his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n    “Thank God! the traitorous conspirators need no militia, no barracks,\r\n    no standing army, no royal proclamations, no suspension of the Habeas\r\n    Corpus, to keep them quiet.  Men of principle detest tumult; and in\r\n    their love of order and of peace, they find a restraint more powerful\r\n    than any government can impose.  From their peaceful habitations the\r\n    savage whoop has not been heard; they have not assailed their quiet\r\n    neighbours, nor burnt the dwellings of God or man.  But can this be\r\n    fairly said of their accusers?  Have no anarchists, rioters, and\r\n    levellers been found among them? (alluding to events at Birmingham).\r\n    Ah! had that been happily the case, thy streets, O Birmingham, had\r\n    never been lighted by the rioter’s torch! nor Thy temples, blessed\r\n    God, reduced to ruins!  Bigotry and persecution had not deprived us\r\n    of the most splendid talents, nor had philosophy been forced to seek\r\n    an asylum under calmer skies!  Had the vain, the greedy, the\r\n    ambitious candidates for honour and emoluments in the army, the navy,\r\n    and the church been under the same influence that has governed the\r\n    hearts and directed the conduct of the friends of freedom, the\r\n    destroying sword had been lodged in its peaceful scabbard, there to\r\n    have slept an eternal sleep.”\r\n\r\nThe preacher proceeded in the same eloquent manner to denounce the war\r\nand its advocates, and to defend the friends of freedom and peace, who it\r\nappears were numerous in this city, and who formed various associations\r\nof, what was deemed, a radical character.  The Tories also had their\r\npolitical clubs under various names, and held weekly or monthly meetings\r\nat different hotels or taverns.  The Eldon Club, formed and named in\r\nhonour of Lord Eldon, is the only one that now remains, and the members\r\nhave long held their meeting at the Bell Inn, on the Castle Hill.  For\r\nsome years the growing feeling here in favor of various pluses of reform,\r\nmanifested itself chiefly in contests for the representation of the city;\r\nbut gradually, public meetings and petitions to parliament became more\r\nand more frequent, and during the few years which preceded the great\r\nReform Bill, were very numerous and often very excited.  Amongst the\r\nfirst subjects which called forth the indignant protests of the citizens\r\nwas that of the corn-laws.  On Jan. 12th, 1815, a county meeting was held\r\nat the Shirehall, when it was unanimously resolved to petition parliament\r\nto take the corn-laws into consideration, on account of the depressed\r\nprices of agricultural produce.  The bill, fixing the protecting price of\r\nwheat imported at 80s. per qr. and barley at 20s. per coomb, was this\r\nsession enacted.  On February 8th, at a numerous meeting held at the\r\nGuildhall, the mayor, (J. W. Robberds,) presiding, it was resolved to\r\npetition the House of Lords against the bill, which had then passed the\r\nHouse of Commons.  The petition was signed by 13,000 citizens, but it\r\npassed the House of Lords, and received the royal assent.  Great\r\nexcitement prevailed, and on March 17th, Thomas William Coke, Esq. and\r\nLord Albemarle, both Liberals, were attacked by the populace, at the\r\ncattle show, and pelted with stones, in consequence of the support which\r\nthey had given to the corn-laws.  Fortunately, they escaped to the Angel\r\nInn (now the Royal Hotel), and afterwards from the city, but the tumult\r\nraged so highly, that the riot act was read, and the Brunswick Hussars\r\nwere called out to quell the disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1816) the attention of the citizens was turned to\r\nthe question of Parliamentary Reform, and on the 14th October, a common\r\nhall was held for the adoption of a petition in its favour.  Mr. Edward\r\nTaylor moved the adoption of the petition, and after congratulating the\r\nmeeting on having a representative, in the person of Mr. Smith, who was\r\nan able and constant friend of the liberties of the people and of\r\nParliamentary Reform, he reminded the audience that it was in vain for\r\nmembers of parliament to attempt to stem the torrent of corruption,\r\nunless the people supported them.  The people had been long inactive, but\r\nhe hoped to see the spirit of zeal and energy on behalf of this great\r\ncause revived, and extend itself to the verge of the island; and that\r\npetitions on the same principle as that about to be adopted by the\r\npresent meeting would be sent to the legislature from every part of the\r\nkingdom.  Mr. Firth had objected to the time as inappropriate.  This he\r\n(Mr. Taylor) regarded as the old Pitt cant, according to which it always\r\nappeared that there were two seasons when any attempt to reform\r\nparliament was improper; the former of these was a state of war, when it\r\nwas said that the ministers had something else to do besides redressing\r\npublic grievances; the other was a state of peace, when the objection was\r\nthat, all things being quiet, it was best not to disturb them.  He (Mr.\r\nTaylor), however, affirmed that it was no less the duty than the right of\r\nthe people of this country to call loudly for reform, especially at a\r\ntime when their burdens and distresses were so great.  Surely they were\r\njustified in asking for retrenchment in the public expenditure, when Lord\r\nBathurst alone took more of the nation’s money, than was sufficient to\r\nmaintain the poor of Norwich for a year.  There was a long black list\r\nexhibiting many more such; while, at the same time, our trade was\r\nstagnant, and our poor rates increasing; and, therefore, he asked boldly\r\nwhether such persons as these, who were taking the public money, ought\r\nnot to be called on to disgorge some of the plunder.  The petition was\r\nadopted by acclamation, and then Mr. William Smith, M.P., for Norwich,\r\naddressed the audience, approving of its prayer.\r\n\r\nMr. E. Taylor attended many meetings elsewhere in favor of Reform in\r\nParliament.  He took a very active part in local politics and was the\r\nlife and soul of his party at contested elections, whether for the city\r\nor the council.  He never connived at bribery or any improper practices.\r\nOn one occasion, during the excitement of a parliamentary election, a man\r\nnamed Bradfield, a working brazier, was offered £30 to vote “orange and\r\npurple.”  Though sadly in want of money, he steadily refused the tempting\r\noffer, which was repeatedly pressed upon him, and he voted\r\n“blue-and-white!”  The result was that he lost his employment, and fell\r\ninto great distress.  Mr. Taylor having heard of the circumstance,\r\ninterested himself on behalf of the honest voter, and promoted a\r\nsubscription, by means of which he was furnished with tools, and enabled\r\nto begin successfully on his own account.  Many years afterwards, Mr.\r\nTaylor, meeting him in the street, offered him the usual greeting of a\r\nfriend; but Bradfield, fresh from his work, excused himself on the ground\r\nthat his hands were “dirty.”  His generous benefactor, however, would not\r\nallow the force of the apology, declaring that the man’s hands could not\r\nbe very “dirty,” his conduct had shown that his heart and conscience were\r\nso pure.  Mr. Taylor, in short, was so much respected for his rectitude,\r\nboth political and religious, that it was no matter of surprise when he\r\nwas seen walking arm in arm with a political opponent.  Mr. Taylor’s\r\nelectioneering labors were chiefly confined to serving on committees,\r\nvisiting clubs, canvassing voters, and haranguing the people.  He was a\r\ngood speaker and always popular.  On the platform, his strong good sense\r\nand nervous eloquence rendered his speeches effective, and they derived\r\ngreat weight from the known integrity of his character.  If elections\r\ncould have been gained by arguments alone, his addresses would have been\r\nmore formidable to his opponents than they were.  But there was often a\r\nmajority, which could be won to either side by “golden” arguments.\r\n\r\nSo matters went on till 1822, when many political meetings were held, at\r\nwhich Mr. Edward Taylor took an active part.  On January 12th, he moved\r\nand carried a resolution for Parliamentary Reform at a county meeting,\r\nconvened for the avowed object of considering “agricultural distress.”\r\nOn March 5th, he attended a Reform meeting at Bungay.  On April 24th, he\r\nattended another “agricultural distress” meeting, and carried a\r\nresolution in favor of Parliamentary Reform.  On May 11th, a county\r\nmeeting was held with the express object of petitioning for reform, and\r\nresolutions were carried in favor of it.  On Nov. 5th, Mr. Taylor\r\npresided at the annual dinner of the Norwich Reform Club.\r\n\r\nThe agitation for the repeal of the corn laws was continued in 1825, and\r\non April 18th a public meeting was held in St. Andrew’s Hall, where a\r\npetition was adopted for a revision of the corn laws, which afterwards\r\nreceived 14,385 signatures, and was forwarded on the 26th to be presented\r\nto the House of Commons.  Meetings were also held in the same year to\r\npromote the abolition of slavery, a question which excited a good deal of\r\ninterest in this city; while the years from 1826 to 1829 were devoted\r\nchiefly to agitations for the abolition of slavery and Roman Catholic\r\nemancipation, counter petitions being sent to parliament in regard to the\r\nlatter by the Whig and Tory sections of the clergy.\r\n\r\nOn June 29th, 1830, King William IV. was proclaimed, on the Castle Hill,\r\nby the High Sheriff, the bells ringing in honour of the event.  Next day\r\nthe king was proclaimed in the city, amid the cheers of the citizens; and\r\nthe mayor presided at a dinner, in celebration of His Majesty’s\r\naccession, at the Norfolk Hotel.  This king was believed to be in favour\r\nof Reform and Retrenchment, and the liberal party always made him appear\r\nto be so.  But the correspondence of the late Earl Grey with his Majesty,\r\nrecently published, proves that the king entertained the question of\r\nReform with great reluctance, which was shared even by some of the Whig\r\nministers.  Lord Grey himself wrote, January 16th, 1831,—\r\n\r\n    “It has often been my wish to find the means of postponing it, but\r\n    the result of all my consideration has been that an attempt to do so\r\n    would be fatal to the character of the government, and would lead to\r\n    its dissolution under circumstances still more disastrous than those\r\n    which would follow such a result, if his Majesty were unfortunately\r\n    compelled, by a sense of duty, to withhold his assent from the\r\n    measure which may be submitted to him by his ministers.  And other\r\n    members of the government itself interposed difficulties.  Even Lord\r\n    Brougham objected, after the measure was drawn up, to the abolition\r\n    of the close boroughs, urging the argument that there would be no\r\n    means for getting seats for persons in the government,” &c.\r\n\r\nAnd Lord Grey seriously feared that on this point his lord chancellor\r\nmight “throw us over with the king!”  The king would not hear of the\r\nballot, and he strongly objected to shortening the duration of parliament\r\nto five years as proposed.  At last all obstacles were removed, and on\r\nMarch 4th, 1831, the bill was introduced by Lord John Russell into the\r\nHouse of Commons.  After a prolonged debate it was read a second time by\r\nonly a majority of one.  It was defeated in committee on an amendment\r\nagainst diminishing the number of English representatives.  Then the\r\ncabinet, by a minute, called on the king for a distinct answer to the\r\nrequest for a dissolution.  He yielded, avowing that the perils to follow\r\nat home and abroad from a change of ministry were greater than could\r\narise from a dissolution.  But he took occasion to recur to some of his\r\nold objections, and to urge that the bill should be remodelled before\r\nbeing re-introduced; and he pressed the condition, above all, of\r\nresistance to extreme change.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the dissolution on the defeat of ministers on the\r\nReform Bill, an election took place in this city on April 29th, 1831.\r\nThe polling commenced next morning, Saturday, and was continued on the\r\nfollowing Monday and Tuesday.  The numbers were for R. H. Gurney, Esq.,\r\n(L.) 2158; the Right Hon. Robert Grant, (L.) 2163; Sir Charles Wetherell,\r\n(C.) 977; and Mr. M. T. Sadler, (C.) 964.  The two former gentlemen were\r\ndeclared duly elected.  On the Monday evening the Tory polling booths\r\nwere pulled down and afterwards burned.\r\n\r\nOn February 29th, 1832, Lord Viscount Sidmouth presented an address to\r\nthe king, signed by 2300 of the gentry, clergy, freemen, freeholders, and\r\nother inhabitants of the city, praying his Majesty to “withhold his royal\r\nsanction from any measure which might compromise the independence of\r\neither branch of the legislature, and expressing their fullest confidence\r\nin his paternal regard for his faithful people to preserve the\r\nfundamental principles of the British constitution.”  This petition was\r\nin reference to a threatened creation of new peers in the House of Lords.\r\nOn May 14th, ministers having been again defeated on the Reform Bill, (by\r\na majority of thirty-five in the House of Lords,) a requisition was\r\npresented to the mayor, Sir J. H. Yallop, to call a public meeting in\r\nsupport of the bill.  The mayor complied, and the meeting was called.  A\r\nprocession was formed on the Castle Meadow, and being joined by a very\r\nlarge body from Wymondham, carrying many banners and accompanied by bands\r\nof music, proceeded to St. Andrew’s Hall, which was quite filled.  The\r\nmayor presided, and a petition was adopted praying the House of Commons\r\nto stop all supplies till the bill was passed.  The cry was for “the\r\nbill—the whole bill, and nothing but the bill.”  On June 5th, the\r\n“Telegraph” coach arrived in the city with the news of the passing of the\r\nReform Bill, by a majority of eighty-four.  A large number of people were\r\nin waiting, and the moment the coach entered the top of St. Stephen’s\r\nStreet, the people on hearing the news loudly cheered, and the cheering\r\nwas continued along the whole line of the street into the Market Place.\r\nA large party perambulated the city with a band playing lively airs, all\r\nthe evening, and on the following night a bonfire was kindled on the\r\nCastle Ditches.  During the month several public dinners were held to\r\ncelebrate the passing of the Reform Bill; and the 5th of the following\r\nmonth was devoted to a special demonstration.  The morning was ushered in\r\nby the firing of cannon and the ringing of bells, and a procession having\r\nbeen previously arranged, about 11 a.m. a large body of horsemen took up\r\ntheir position on the Castle Ditches whence, headed by three mounted\r\ntrumpeters, and followed by the Norwich Political Union and electors of\r\nthe different wards, and accompanied by an immense concourse of\r\nspectators, they passed through the principal streets of the city.  The\r\nelectors afterwards proceeded to the Old Cricket Ground, where they were\r\nregaled with roast beef, plum-pudding, and ale, and spent the rest of the\r\nday in rural sports.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMED PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first election for the city, after the passing of the Reform Bill,\r\ntook place on December 10th, 11th, and 12th, 1832, with the following\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nLord Viscount Stormont (C.)        2016\r\nSir James Scarlett (C.)            1962\r\nR. H. Gurney, Esq. (L.)            1809\r\nH. B. Ker, Esq. (L.)               1765\r\n\r\nThe contest was a severe one, and the total number polled was 3807,\r\nincluding 2283 freemen, 834 freeholders, and 690 occupiers.  Gross\r\nbribery prevailed, and a committee of investigation was at once\r\nappointed, meetings were held, and subscriptions were collected from\r\nhouse to house throughout the several parishes, in support of a petition\r\nto parliament against the return of the sitting members.  The petition\r\nwas presented by Mr. Grote on the 18th of Feb., 1833, and on the 4th of\r\nApril, intelligence reached the city by mail that a committee of the\r\nHouse had declared the members duly elected, but that they had decided\r\nthat the petition was neither frivolous nor vexatious.  At page 396 we\r\nhave already given some of the evidence afterwards taken in Norwich on\r\nthe subject, by the commissioners appointed to enquire into the state of\r\nthe municipal corporation.  The decision of the parliamentary committee\r\nwas received with great surprise.  On June 19th of the same year, the\r\nConservative ladies of Norwich, having previously subscribed for two\r\nbanners to be presented to Lord Stormont and Sir James Scarlett, the\r\npresentation took place in the Council Chamber, in the presence of 150\r\nladies, with several members of the corporation.  Lord Viscount Stormont\r\nattended, and Mr. Robert Scarlett was present on behalf of his father,\r\nSir James Scarlett.  Mrs. Bignold, the mayoress, and Mrs. Preston\r\npresented the banners amid great applause.\r\n\r\nThe first Reformed Parliament assembled January 29th, 1833.  It lasted\r\nbarely two years, for the dismissal of the Whig ministry by the king, and\r\nthe placing of Sir Robert Peel at the head of a Conservative government,\r\ncaused its dissolution on December 10th, 1834.\r\n\r\n              _Election of January_ 6_th_ _and_ 7_th_, 1835.\r\n\r\nLord Viscount Stormont (C.)         1892\r\nHon. Robert C. Scarlett (C.)        1878\r\nHon. Edward V. Harbord (L.)         1592\r\nFrank Offley Martin, Esq. (L.)      1585\r\n\r\nThe second Reformed Parliament assembled, Feb. 19th, 1835, and on the\r\n26th an amendment on the address led to a division with the following\r\nresult:—for the amendment 309; against 302; majority against ministers,\r\n7.  This led to the resignation of the Peel administration; and Lord\r\nMelbourne was recalled to the head of the government.  The death of the\r\nking led to a dissolution, on July 17th, 1837, and then followed the most\r\nsevere and costly contest that ever took place for the representation of\r\nNorwich; bribery, intimidation, and treating, being carried on to a most\r\nshameful extent; £40,000 is said to have been spent in the demoralization\r\nof the electors.\r\n\r\n                   _The Election of July_ 25_th_, 1837.\r\n\r\nMarquis of Douro (C.)                1863\r\nHonorable R. C. Scarlett (C.)        1865\r\nBenjamin Smith (L.)                  1843\r\nW. Mountford Nurse (L.)              1831\r\n\r\nA petition was presented against the return of Lord Douro and Mr.\r\nScarlett, and the result was, that by arrangement the poll was\r\nreduced—Douro, 1842; Smith, 1841; Scarlett, 1840; Nurse, 1829.\r\nConsequently, Lord Douro and Mr. Smith were declared duly elected.\r\n\r\nThe third Reformed Parliament assembled on Nov. 15th, 1837, and continued\r\ntill June 23rd, 1841.  Another election took place on June 28th, 1841,\r\nwhen the former members were again candidates.  No polling took place at\r\nthis election, but it was rendered remarkable in consequence of the\r\nChartists and other electors being much opposed to the compromise, which\r\nthe exhausting contest of 1837 had induced the leaders of the Liberal and\r\nConservative parties to enter into, and an opposition of some kind was\r\nresolved upon.  Accordingly, after Lord Douro and Mr. Smith had been\r\nnominated at the Guildhall, John Dover, a stalwart Chartist freeman,\r\nproposed as a candidate, Mr. William Eagle, a barrister of Lakenheath, in\r\nSuffolk.  John Whiting, a £10-occupier, seconded the nomination, and a\r\nshow of hands was taken, which the sheriff declared to be in favor of\r\nLord Douro and Mr. Smith.  Then Dover demanded a poll for Mr. Eagle, who\r\nwas not present.  The under-sheriff thereupon required a guarantee for\r\nthe expenses, and some delay occurred.  Many persons were applied to in\r\nthe emergency, but declined to give the guarantee required.  Dover\r\nultimately withdrew the nomination on receiving £50 from certain parties,\r\nas he alleged, for expenses which had been incurred.  This soon became\r\nknown to the crowd of Chartists outside of the Guildhall, and a riot\r\nensued.  When Dover came out they surrounded him, took his money from\r\nhim, and tore the clothes off his back.  He escaped for the time, but on\r\nthe following day the mob found him again, and threatened to throw him\r\ninto the river, but he was rescued by the police.  A petition was\r\nsubsequently presented, by Mr. Duncombe, to the House of Commons, signed\r\nby 6000 inhabitants of Norwich, complaining of the return of Lord Douro\r\nand Mr. Smith, but it led to no result, and they sat in the house till\r\nthe next election.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Reformed Parliament assembled Aug. 19th, 1841, and was\r\ndissolved July 23rd, 1847.  Another election took place on July 29th,\r\n1847.  A very great effort was made at this election, by a large body of\r\nvoters, to break down the compromise which had been entered into in 1841;\r\nand though not successful, it proved the difficulty of maintaining such\r\nan arrangement in a large constituency.  Mr. Parry, a Barrister of the\r\nHome Circuit, was nominated by the extreme Liberal party.  The result of\r\nthe poll was as follows:—\r\n\r\n                   _The Election of July_ 29_th_, 1847.\r\n\r\nSamuel Morton Peto (L.)         2448\r\nMarquis of Douro (C.)           1727\r\nJohn Humfreys Parry (L.)        1572\r\n\r\nThe fifth Reformed Parliament assembled on Sept. 21st, 1847, and its\r\ndissolution took place in consequence of the accession to office of Lord\r\nDerby’s ministry, on July 1st, 1852.  A severe contest took place between\r\nthe Liberals and Conservatives, on July 8th, 1852, with the following\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n                   _The Election of July_ 8_th_, 1852.\r\n\r\nSamuel Morton Peto (L.)             2190\r\nEdward Warner (L.)                  2145\r\nMarquis of Douro (C.)               1592\r\nCol. Lothian S. Dickson (C.)        1465\r\n\r\nThe sixth Reformed Parliament assembled on Nov. 4th, 1852, and an\r\nelection took place here in Dec., 1854.  The vacancy in the\r\nrepresentation which caused this election, arose in consequence of Mr.\r\nPeto having, in conjunction with his partners, undertaken to construct a\r\nrailway from Balaclava to Sebastopol, to assist the British army in\r\nbringing the siege of that place to a successful conclusion.  Though no\r\ncontract had been entered into by Mr. Peto with the government, he had to\r\nresign his seat.  Sir S. Bignold became a candidate in the Conservative\r\ninterest, and Anthony Hamond, Esq., for the Liberals.  The contest ended\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n                      _The Election of Dec._, 1854.\r\n\r\nSir S. Bignold (C.)        1901\r\nAnthony Hamond (L.)        1635\r\n\r\nThe sixth Reformed Parliament was dissolved on March 21st, 1857, in\r\nconsequence of a resolution having been proposed by Mr. Cobden, in\r\ncondemnation of the proceedings of the ministry with regard to the\r\nChinese war.  A division took place at an early hour, on March 4th—For\r\nMr. Cobden’s motion, 263; against, 247; majority against the government,\r\n16.  This caused an election here on March 28th, 1857.\r\n\r\n                      _The Election of March_, 1857.\r\n\r\nLord Viscount Bury (L.)         2238\r\nHenry Wm. Schneider (L.)        2247\r\nSir S. Bignold (C.)             1636\r\n\r\nThe seventh Reformed Parliament assembled April 30th, 1857.  On Feb.\r\n19th, 1858, Lord Palmerston, who commenced the session with a large\r\nmajority in his favour, was defeated on the Conspiracy to Murder Bill, by\r\n234 to 215 votes.  Lord Palmerston accordingly resigned, and was\r\nsucceeded by Lord Derby.  An election took place on April 30th, 1859, and\r\nanother severe contest ensued between the Liberals and Conservatives,\r\nwith the following result:—\r\n\r\n                      _The Election of April_, 1859.\r\n\r\nLord Viscount Bury (L.)         2154\r\nHenry Wm. Schneider (L.)        2138\r\nSir S. Bignold (C.)             1966\r\nC. M. Lushington (C.)           1900\r\n\r\nThe eighth Reformed Parliament assembled May 31st, 1859; and Lord Derby,\r\nbeing defeated on an amendment to the address, resigned.  Lord Palmerston\r\nagain came into power, and Lord Bury was appointed Treasurer of the\r\nHousehold.  This occasioned a vacancy in the representation, and the\r\nelection took place on June 29th, 1859.\r\n\r\n                      _The Election of June_, 1859.\r\n\r\nLord Viscount Bury (L.)        1922\r\nSir S. Bignold (C.)            1561\r\nColonel Boldero (C.)             39\r\n\r\nThe election of Lord Bury and Mr. Schneider, on April 30th, 1859, having\r\nbeen declared void on the ground of bribery (which had been shamefully\r\nresorted to on both sides) by a committee of the House of Commons, on\r\nJuly 30th, 1859, and the subsequent election of Lord Bury, on June 29th,\r\nhaving been also declared void, writs were ordered, on March 23rd, 1860,\r\nto be issued for the election of two members.  This led to a grand trial\r\nof the strength of the two parties here on March 29th, 1860, with the\r\nfollowing result:—\r\n\r\n                      _The Election of March_, 1860.\r\n\r\nEdward Warner (L.)               2083\r\nCol. Sir Wm. Russell (L.)        2045\r\nWm. David Lewis (C.)             1631\r\nWm. Forlonge (C.)                1636\r\n\r\nThe eighth Reformed Parliament, during the existence of which Lord\r\nPalmerston continued premier, was dissolved on Thursday, July 6th, 1865.\r\nThe nomination for this city was appointed to take place on Tuesday, July\r\n11th.\r\n\r\n                      _The Election of July_, 1865.\r\n\r\nMr. Warner and Sir William Russell offered themselves for re-election.\r\nThe Conservatives, however, undismayed by past defeats, determined again\r\nto contest the representation.  At a large meeting of the party, held at\r\nthe Norfolk Hotel on Saturday evening, July 1st, Sir S. Bignold, who\r\npresided, after opening the proceedings, introduced Robert Edmond Chester\r\nWaters, Esq., of Upton Park, Dorsetshire, to the electors present, who\r\nresolved unanimously to support him as one of the Conservative\r\ncandidates.  At a meeting subsequently held in the third ward, Augustus\r\nGoldsmid, Esq., was introduced and accepted as the second candidate.  The\r\nelectors knew very little about the antecedents of either gentlemen, and\r\nnever supposed that Mr. Waters had been a candidate in the Liberal\r\ninterest, and a member of the Reform Club.  He was a young man and a good\r\nspeaker, and by his eloquence and address greatly pleased his numerous\r\nsupporters.  On the Friday following, however, in the two local Liberal\r\nnewspapers, the _Norfolk News_ and the _Norwich Mercury_, and at a large\r\nmeeting of Liberal electors in St. Andrew’s Hall, certain serious charges\r\nwere made affecting the character of Mr. Waters, which charges, it was\r\nalleged, had led to his “retirement” from the Reform Club, of which he\r\nhad once been a member; and the Conservatives were challenged to\r\ninvestigate the truth of the charges.  Mr. Waters himself indignantly\r\ndenied them, and issued a circular stating that he had ordered legal\r\nproceedings to be instituted against the authors of the slanders.  He\r\nalso addressed a great meeting in St. Andrew’s Hall in his own defence,\r\nand vehemently denounced his calumniators.  The challenge of the Liberals\r\nwas accordingly accepted, and Mr. H. S. Patteson and Mr. E. Field were\r\nappointed on behalf of the Conservative committee to accompany Dr.\r\nDalrymple and Mr. J. H. Tillett to London, to examine the books of the\r\nReform Club, and make other investigations.  In the meantime the\r\nConservative committee issued an appeal to the electors, expressing\r\nthemselves satisfied with the proofs Mr. Waters had submitted to them of\r\nhis position in society, and asking them to suspend their judgment until\r\nthe return of the deputation from London.  On the Monday, the gentlemen\r\nforming the deputation proceeded to London, and in the course of the day,\r\na telegram, unfavourable to Mr. Waters, was received by the committee in\r\nthe city, which resulted in the following notice being issued:—\r\n\r\n    “FELLOW CITIZENS; in consequence of a telegram just received, we feel\r\n    it our duty to withdraw our support from Mr. Waters, as one of the\r\n    candidates for the city.  The other gentlemen who signed the previous\r\n    paper are absent from Norwich.  Signed, Fred. Brown, J. B. Morgan, F.\r\n    E. Watson, Henry Ling.  Norwich, 10th July, 1865.”\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, this telegram caused great consternation among the\r\nConservatives, many of whom resolved to support Mr. Waters\r\nnotwithstanding.  Indignation meetings of a large section of the party\r\nwere held at various taverns in the city, and Mr. Waters was received\r\nwith greater enthusiasm than ever.  At a meeting held in the evening, Mr.\r\nWaters addressed his friends, and the Hon. Major Augustus Jocelyn also\r\nspoke, bearing testimony to the high personal character of Mr. Waters.\r\nThis only confirmed the gentlemen of his committee in their previous\r\ndecision, whereupon Mr. Waters declared his determination to stand\r\nindependently, and he continued his candidature.\r\n\r\nThe nomination took place on Tuesday, July 11th, in the Guildhall, which\r\nwas crowded by partisans.  The sheriff (C. Jecks, Esq.) presided as\r\nreturning officer.  Sir William Foster, Bart., nominated Edward Warner,\r\nEsq., of Higham Hall, Woodford, Essex, as a fit and proper person to\r\nrepresent the city of Norwich in parliament.  Mr. E. Willett seconded and\r\nMr. J. J. Colman supported the nomination, amid much applause.  Dr.\r\nDalrymple nominated Sir William Russell, Bart., C.B., of Charlton Park,\r\nGloucestershire; Mr. J. H. Tillett seconded and Mr. Donald Steward\r\nsupported the nomination.  Mr. J. G. Johnson nominated Augustus Goldsmid,\r\nEsq., Barrister-at-law; Mr. Patteson seconded and Mr. J. B. Morgan\r\nsupported the nomination.  Mr. R. P. Wiseman nominated Robert Edmond\r\nChester Waters, Esq., of Upton Park, Dorsetshire; Mr. J. Allen (surgeon)\r\nseconded and Mr. John Hardy supported the nomination.  The sheriff then\r\ncalled for a show of hands, and declared it to be in favour of Mr. Warner\r\nand Sir William Russell.  Mr. J. G. Johnson demanded a poll on behalf of\r\nMr. Goldsmid, and Mr. Wiseman for Mr. Waters.  The polling took place on\r\nWednesday and was kept up with great spirit; at the close the numbers\r\nwere:—\r\n\r\nSir William Russell (L.)         1845\r\nEdward Warner (L.)               1838\r\nAugustus Goldsmid (C.)           1466\r\nR. E. Chester Waters (C.)        1363\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, as organised in 1832, performed, during the\r\nthirty-five years of its existence, a work of the first magnitude, the\r\nrepealing of the old and bad corn laws.  It also swept away the\r\nnavigation laws, the paper and newspaper taxes, the window duties, and\r\nevery restriction which impeded the progress of industry.  But a new\r\nHouse of Commons was needed, a House that should represent not only the\r\nmiddle but also the working classes, not only capital but labour.  For\r\nthis purpose, a new Reform Bill became necessary, to lower and extend the\r\nfranchise to all householders, to give at least every rate-payer a vote,\r\nto enable working-men to help in returning members to Parliament.  After\r\nLord Palmerston’s death a new government was formed; and in 1866, Mr.\r\nGladstone brought in another Reform Bill, which was not accepted, and on\r\nan adverse division, respecting a rating clause, the ministry resigned.\r\nLord Derby came into office, and Mr. Disraeli introduced a Bill for\r\nHousehold Suffrage, on terms based on rate-paying by the occupiers.  This\r\nBill, which swept away all “compounding” for rates, was passed in 1867,\r\nand under it the number of voters in Norwich was increased from five to\r\ntwelve thousand.  In 1868, ministers were defeated by a majority of more\r\nthan sixty, on a motion by Mr. Gladstone for the dis-establishment and\r\ndis-endowment of the Irish church, and the government determined to\r\nappeal to the new constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nPolitical History—(_Continued_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Election of Nov._, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN consequence of the passing of the New Reform Bill in 1867, this\r\nelection had been long anticipated, and preparations for it had been for\r\nsome months in progress by the re-organisation of the three parties—the\r\nConservatives, the Whigs, and the Radicals, the last of which was now\r\nnumerically the strongest of the three.  At the commencement of the year,\r\na general committee of forty delegates, five from each of the eight\r\nwards, was formed in the Tory interest, in order to be prepared for the\r\ncoming struggle.  This general committee, consisting of middle-class and\r\nworking-men, was intended to supersede a junta of the more influential\r\nmen of the party, who were accused of having mis-managed every election\r\nfor the last twenty years; and they set to work at once to form a general\r\nConservative Association, and to some extent, succeeded, while the old\r\nleaders kept aloof from all the proceedings, Mr. G. Johnson, Mr. E.\r\nField, Mr. F. E. Watson, Mr. J. S. Skipper, Mr. F. Brown, Mr. J. B.\r\nMorgan, Mr. H. Morgan, and others, who had been active partisans, seldom\r\nputting in an appearance at any political meetings.  After re-organising\r\ntheir party, the new committee of forty cast about for a popular\r\ncandidate, and fixed upon Sir R. J. H. Harvey, Bart., the late member for\r\nThetford, which had just been disfranchised, but after a long\r\nconsideration of the matter he politely declined, and though again and\r\nagain solicited, he still refused to come forward.  After various\r\nfruitless negociations with other parties, the new committee however at\r\nlast requested Sir Henry Stracey, Bart., of Rackheath, to contest the\r\nrepresentation of the city; and though he hesitated for some time, at\r\nlast he consented to do so, and issued a short address.  He attended many\r\nward meetings of his party at different places, and one great meeting in\r\nSt. Andrew’s Hall.  Sir S. Bignold presided and spoke strongly in favour\r\nof the hon. baronet, who declared himself to be a Protestant churchman; a\r\nfriend of church and state, and of all the time-honoured institutions of\r\nthe country; a supporter of Disraeli’s ministry; and an opponent of all\r\nradical changes.  Sir Henry also, by request, attended a meeting of the\r\nLicensed Victuallers, at the Hop-Pole Gardens, and having promised to\r\noppose the Permissive Bill and to vote for a redress of their grievances,\r\nthe meeting passed a resolution to support him at the coming election.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn, the Whigs held several meetings at the Royal Hotel,\r\nand after much discussion resolved to support the old members, Sir\r\nWilliam Russell and Mr. Edward Warner.  Those gentlemen accordingly came\r\nto Norwich by the invitation of the Whigs and addressed the electors, but\r\nwere not favourably received by the meeting, most of those present being\r\nadvanced Liberals.  In consequence of this, they retired till the\r\nLiberals should be more united.  The working-men, in fact, had also held\r\nmany previous meetings, and were resolved to have their own candidate,\r\nand they nominated Jacob Henry Tillett, who had laboured for them for so\r\nmany years.  To achieve their end, they formed a very extensive\r\nOrganization, embracing all the wards in the city; canvassed the\r\nelectors, and registered every one in every parish who promised to vote\r\nfor their candidate; and in a short time they registered 4000 voters for\r\nMr. Tillett, and were very confident of success.  The consequence was\r\nthat when Sir Henry Stracey came forward, the Whigs, in view of a strong\r\ncontest, agreed to combine with the advanced section of the Liberals, and\r\na meeting was held of both sections, who resolved to support Sir William\r\nRussell and Mr. Tillett—Sir William Foster, presiding.  Those two\r\ngentlemen accordingly issued a joint address, promising to support the\r\nsame Liberal principles and measures.  The Conservatives too, in view of\r\nthe coming contest, forgot their past differences, and worked together\r\nmost energetically.\r\n\r\nThe nomination took place on November 16th.  As soon as the sheriff (J.\r\nRobison, Esq.) had taken his seat, the Guildhall was filled with a\r\nroaring, shouting, and groaning crowd, who exercised their lungs most\r\nvigorously, to express their approval or disapprobation of the views of\r\nthe different prominent members of either party, as they made their\r\nappearance by twos and threes at the magistrates’ entrance to the court.\r\nFor aught that could be said to the contrary by those a few feet distant,\r\nthe reading of the writ and the administering of the oath to the sheriff\r\nseemed to be but dumb show.\r\n\r\nAfter the sheriff had opened the proceedings, Mr. H. Birkbeck nominated\r\nColonel Sir William Russell, Baronet.\r\n\r\nMr. John Youngs seconded and Mr. S. Daynes supported the nomination.\r\n\r\nSir S. Bignold said he begged to nominate Sir Henry Josias Stracey,\r\nBaronet, of Rackheath, their opulent neighbour and brother elector.\r\n\r\nMr. W. J. U. Browne seconded and Mr. J. G. Johnson supported the\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nMr. J. J. Colman said he had great pleasure in nominating Jacob Henry\r\nTillett, Esq., of the city of Norwich.\r\n\r\nMr. A. M. F. Morgan seconded and Mr. C. J. Bunting supported the\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff, having read aloud the names of the candidates, put them in\r\nthe order of their nomination, and after taking the show of hands on\r\neach, declared that it was in favor of Sir William Russell and Jacob\r\nHenry Tillett, Esq.\r\n\r\nSir S. Bignold then demanded a poll on behalf of Sir H. J. Stracey, and\r\nthe proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the sheriff for\r\npresiding, moved by Mr. J. G. Johnson, and seconded by Mr. J. J. Colman.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the candidates from the Hall was witnessed by some two\r\nthousand persons, who warmly greeted their respective favorites.  A very\r\nlarge crowd followed Mr. J. J. Colman and Mr. Donald Steward to the\r\nLiberal head-quarters—the Royal Hotel—cheering most enthusiastically for\r\nthe Liberal candidates.\r\n\r\nThe polling took place on the next day, and the following shows the state\r\nof the poll as issued at intervals by the Conservatives, from which it\r\nwill be seen that, though Mr. Tillett was at the bottom at four o’clock,\r\nthey themselves show him to have had a majority of forty-seven votes,\r\neven so late as half-past three, and that the Tory poll was increased in\r\nthe last half-hour by no fewer than 561!\r\n\r\n      9 O’CLOCK.          9.30 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey (C.)       804  Stracey      1249\r\nRussell (L.)       775  Russell      1233\r\nTillett (L.)       797  Tillett      1225\r\n     10 O’CLOCK.         10.30 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey           1624  Stracey      1981\r\nRussell           1686  Russell      2125\r\nTillett           1656  Tillett      2071\r\n     11 O’CLOCK.         11.30 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey           2364  Stracey      2601\r\nRussell           2628  Russell      2892\r\nTillett           2569  Tillett      2816\r\n     12 O’CLOCK.         12.30 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey           2787  Stracey      2965\r\nRussell           3057  Russell      3165\r\nTillett           2974  Tillett      3084\r\n      1 O’CLOCK.          1.30 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey           3116  Stracey      3239\r\nRussell           3326  Russell      3430\r\nTillett           3217  Tillett      3327\r\n      2 O’CLOCK.          2.30 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey           3383  Stracey      3578\r\nRussell           3550  Russell      3744\r\nTillett           3443  Tillett      3637\r\n      3 O’CLOCK.          3.30 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey           3760  Stracey      3960\r\nRussell           3930  Russell      4203\r\nTillett           3812  Tillett      4007\r\n               4 O’CLOCK.\r\nStracey                      4521\r\nRussell                      4509\r\nTillett                      4364\r\n\r\nThe following are the numbers polled in each ward:\r\n\r\n                  Russell.

They had not, however, anticipated\r\nthe corrupt means which were adopted to secure the return of Sir Henry\r\nStracey.  As soon, however, as the contest was at an end, Mr. Tillett\r\nresolved to petition against the hon. baronet’s return, and the trial\r\ntook place in the Shirehall, before Mr. Baron Martin, on Friday,\r\nSaturday, and Monday, the 15th, 16th, and 18th of January, and ended in\r\nSir Henry Stracey’s election being declared void on the ground of bribery\r\nby his agents.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe appeal to the country was made, it will be remembered, on Mr.\r\nGladstone’s declared policy of dis-establishing the Irish church, and the\r\nresult of the general election showed so decided a majority in Mr.\r\nGladstone’s favor, that before the new House of Commons assembled, Mr.\r\nDisraeli resigned, and Mr. Gladstone assumed the reins of government.\r\nThe House met for the swearing in of members on the 10th of December; and\r\nadjourned to February 16th, 1869, for the despatch of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERS FOR NORWICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the burgesses who served in parliament for\r\nthis city, according to the earliest accounts.

The\r\nsubjoined list has been verified by that official document, and is the\r\nmost complete record ever published.  We give also a few particulars as\r\nto the residences of some of the most distinguished of these civic\r\ndignitaries.\r\n\r\nWilliam Appleyard was the first mayor of Norwich, in 1403.  He resided in\r\nan old flint building in Bridewell Alley, St. Andrew’s, which came\r\nafterwards into the hands of Thomas Cambridge, who, in 1454, conveyed it\r\nto John Paston, from whom it passed to the Hobarts, the Cursons, the\r\nBrownes, the Codds, and the Sothertons.  It was afterwards used as a\r\nprison, and is now occupied by Mr. James Newbegin.\r\n\r\nJohn Cambridge was elected to the office of mayor four times, in 1430,\r\n1437, 1438, 1439.  He resided in one of the old-fashioned houses on St.\r\nAndrew’s hill.\r\n\r\nRoger Best, grocer, was elected mayor in 1467 and 1472.  He occupied a\r\nhouse in King Street, near St. Ethelred’s church.  Afterwards, in the\r\nsame house, lived Sir Robert de Salle, who was killed by the rebels in\r\nKett’s rebellion.\r\n\r\nJohn Rightwise was elected mayor in 1501, and in 1504 was chosen to\r\nrepresent the city in parliament.  In 1513 he was again elected mayor.\r\nHe lived in the house in London Street now occupied by Mr. Boulton, the\r\nironmonger.  During his mayoralty he rebuilt the Market Cross, which\r\nformerly stood in the Market Place.  The cross contained an oratory\r\ninside.  At the time of the Commonwealth it was assigned to dealers in\r\nleather, but was entirely demolished in 1732.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ramsey was sheriff in 1498, and mayor in 1502, and again in 1508.\r\nHe built a portion of St. Michael at Coslany Church, and his tomb is on\r\nthe north side with a merchant’s mark, and the initials “W. R.” on it.\r\n\r\nJohn Clarke, mayor in 1515 and 1520, resided in a house on St. Andrew’s\r\nhill, occupied in 1561 by Mr. Suckling, merchant, and sheriff of Norwich.\r\nThe Suckling arms and many curious carvings are still to be seen on the\r\ngateway.\r\n\r\nRobert Jannys, whose portrait is in the Guildhall, was mayor in 1517 and\r\n1524.\r\n\r\nRobert Browne, mayor in 1522, had his coat of arms painted on the window\r\nof the Guildhall.\r\n\r\nAugustine Steward was elected mayor in 1534, and represented the city in\r\nparliament in 1541.  He also served as mayor in 1546 and 1556.  He lived\r\nin a house on Tombland.  His portrait was placed in the Guildhall.\r\n\r\nWilliam Layer, mayor in 1537, occupied one of the large houses on the\r\nnorth side of St. Andrew’s Street.\r\n\r\nHeny Bacon, grocer, was mayor in 1557 and 1566, and lived in a flint\r\nhouse at the east end of the church of St. George’s Colegate; his mark\r\nand initials are over the door.  Fifty years ago, a large room on the\r\nfirst floor was lined with fine oak panelling, and the chimney piece was\r\nelaborately carved.  These curiosities were removed to the mansion of G.\r\nKett Tompson, Esq., of Witchingham.  The building is now a boot and shoe\r\nwarehouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Codd was mayor of Norwich in the year of Kett’s rebellion.  He took\r\nan active part in suppressing the rebellion, and at his death bequeathed\r\na large sum of money to the hospital in St. Helen’s, where so many old\r\nmen have found an asylum.  He was buried in the nave of the church of St.\r\nPeter’s per Mountergate, and the heads of his will are read in the church\r\nannually on the Sunday before St. Thomas’ Day.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mingay, mayor in 1561, entertained the Duke and Duchess of\r\nNorfolk, and the Earls of Huntingdon and Northumberland, with many of the\r\nnobility and gentry, at a grand banquet in St. Andrew’s Hall, which, in\r\nsubsequent years, was the scene of many mayors’ feasts.\r\n\r\nAlexander Thurston was mayor in 1600, and M.P. for Norwich in 1601.  He\r\nlived in a large old-fashioned house in St. Clement’s churchyard,\r\nformerly occupied by the priors of Ixworth.  Some carved work in the\r\nhouse exhibits the initials “A. T.” and the arms of Hester Aldrich, his\r\nwife.  In the adjoining house lived John Aldrich, grocer, who took an\r\nactive part in suppressing Kett’s rebellion.\r\n\r\nJohn Pettus, mayor in 1608, was afterwards knighted.  The house at the\r\nnorth-west corner of St. Simon’s churchyard was long the residence of the\r\nPettus family.  The date 1608 is on the door with the arms of Pettus in\r\none spandrel and his wife’s on the other.  His monument is in St. Simon’s\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThomas Anguish, mayor in 1611, lived in a house at the north end of\r\nTombland.  In a court there, on an old door, is the date 1594 with the\r\ninitials of himself and his wife, T. E. A.  He founded the Boys’ Hospital\r\nSchool in St. Edmund’s.  He bequeathed a house and estate in Fishgate\r\nStreet to the corporation for the use and endowment of a hospital, or a\r\nconvenient place for keeping, bringing up, and teaching very poor\r\nchildren born in the city.\r\n\r\nMr. John Harvey, manufacturer in 1709, was sheriff in 1720, alderman in\r\n1722, and mayor in 1727.  He died on September 28th, 1742, and was buried\r\nin the family vault, which now contains about forty leaden coffins, in\r\nthe church of St. Clement’s.  The family held an estate in that parish\r\nfor more than a century.  Some of their portraits adorn the walls of St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\nJohn Patteson, mayor in 1788 and M.P. in 1806–7, resided in a house on\r\nthe right-hand side of a court adjoining the Crown and Angel in St.\r\nStephen’s Street; afterwards he resided in Surrey Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF THE MAYORS, SHERIFFS, ETC.\r\n_From the Year_ 1403 _to_ 1869.\r\n\r\n                        MAYORS.

By the Corporation Reform Act the office of\r\nSteward was abolished in 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nEcclesiastical.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE origin of the See of Norwich is attached to Sigebert, king of the\r\nEast Angles, who, being in France about the year 630, brought over Felix,\r\na priest of Burgundy, and constituted him bishop, fixing his seat at\r\nDunwich, in Suffolk.  About forty years afterwards the diocese was\r\ndivided, Dunwich and North Elmham having each a bishop, and this\r\ncontinued till the year 870, when the two sees were again united under\r\nWybred at Elmham.  Owing to the devastations of the piratical Danes the\r\nsee remained vacant nearly one hundred years, but was restored by\r\nTheodored, in 995 according to the common account; but there is evidence\r\nwhich tends to prove that he was bishop in 945, if not before.  During\r\nthe reign of William I. the see was removed to Thetford, and in the year\r\n1094 it was finally settled in Norwich.  This added greatly to the\r\nimportance of the city, and made it the capital of East Anglia.\r\n\r\nThe diocese, as to its seat, has continued unchanged since 1094, and as\r\nto its extent and government has been but slightly modified.  The most\r\nprominent bishops have been Losinga, who established the see at Norwich\r\nand founded the cathedral, and John Grey or Gray, who governed Ireland,\r\ndivided it into counties, placed it under English laws, fought in France,\r\nand captured fortresses there,—for bishops were fighting men in those\r\ndays; Pandulph, who excommunicated King John Lackland; W. Middleton, who\r\nacted as Guardian of the Kingdom; John Salmon and William de Ermine, who\r\nwere Lord Chancellors; and Bateman, who founded Trinity Hall, Cambridge.\r\nOthers less noted were Henry le Spencer, who fought as a soldier for the\r\npope on shore, and as an English admiral at sea; Richard Courtenay, who\r\ndied at the siege of Harfleur; John de Wakering, who was Lord Privy Seal;\r\nNykke, known as the blind bishop, who conducted a traitorous\r\ncorrespondence with the pope; William Rugge, who deprived the see of its\r\nbarony; Parkhurst, who was famous for entertaining Oxford scholars;\r\nScambler, called “the scandalous;” John Jeggon, called “the wag;”\r\nMontague, called “the excellent;” Corbet, called the “merry wit;” Hall,\r\n“the saintly;” Overall and Sparrow, “the learned;” and Bathurst, “the\r\ngood,” who pleaded for Catholic emancipation.  Three of the dignitaries,\r\nJ. Harpsfield, H. Prideaux, and T. Sherlock, became cardinals; one, John,\r\nbecame archbishop of Smyrna; and one, Montgomery, became bishop of Meath.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral establishment includes the bishop, the dean, three\r\narchdeacons, four canons, twenty-four hon. canons, four minor canons, and\r\na chancellor.  The income of the bishop is £4,500; that of each of the\r\narchdeacons is £200; and that of the other archdeacon is £184.  The\r\ndiocese comprises all Norfolk except the parishes of Emneth and Brandon,\r\nand all Suffolk except the deaneries of Thedwaster and Thingoe, and parts\r\nof the deaneries of Clare, Fordham, and Sudbury; and it is divided into\r\nthe archdeaconries of Norwich, Norfolk, and Suffolk.  Population,\r\n743,000; acres, 1,994,535; deaneries, 41; benefices, 908; curates, 253;\r\nchurch sittings, 294,177.

But\r\nthe Bible Society, the most important of them all, has been supported by\r\nboth Churchmen and Dissenters.  It was founded in 1811, since which year\r\nit has distributed 323,000 bibles in the city and county, and remitted to\r\nthe Parent Society more than £120,000.  The late J. J. Gurney was an\r\nardent supporter of this society, and delivered his last great speech on\r\nits behalf at an annual meeting in St. Andrew’s Hall.\r\n\r\nOf the other societies the Church Missionary Society has taken the lead,\r\nand the Lord Bishop of the diocese has generally presided.  This society\r\nwas instituted here in 1813, and it has raised more than £70,000.  The\r\nRev. Edward Bickersteth, one of its founders and its first secretary, was\r\npartner with Thomas Bignold, Esq., solicitor of this city (brother to Sir\r\nSamuel Bignold), whose sister he married.  At the first meeting in St.\r\nAndrew’s Hall, upwards of £700 was collected.  Mr. Bickersteth was\r\nordained in 1815 by Bishop Bathurst, and after visiting Africa on behalf\r\nof the mission, became secretary of the Parent Society.\r\n\r\nThe Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts is,\r\nhowever, the oldest missionary society of the Church of England, and\r\nannual meetings on its behalf have been held here all through the present\r\ncentury.  It has two objects in view—first, by carrying the gospel to our\r\ncolonists to prevent christians from becoming heathens in faith and\r\npractice; second, to make heathens christians.  The work of the society\r\nhas been chiefly in our colonies.  In following the direction of its\r\noriginal charter, the society has been vindicated by the practice of\r\nother more recent missionary societies of the Church of England.\r\n\r\nThe Church Pastoral Aid Society was instituted in the year 1835, for the\r\npurpose of supplying assistance to the incumbents of large and populous\r\nparishes, to enable them to obtain the help of additional curates and lay\r\nagents.  Aid is now afforded to 548 incumbents, and the grants of the\r\nsociety, when all occupied, are for 502 curates and 181 lay assistants.\r\nMeetings are held here every year in support of the parent institution.\r\nThe total receipts for the year ending March 31st, 1868, were £57,019\r\n16s. 7d., and the expenditure £64,065 16s. 3d.\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Diocesan Church Association was established in 1862.  Its\r\nobject was to combine, as far as possible, Churchmen of every shade of\r\npolitical and religious opinion in the support of the established church,\r\nparticularly as regards all questions affecting its welfare, likely to\r\nbecome the subject of legislation, and generally in the promotion of\r\nmeasures calculated to increase its stability and usefulness; but points\r\nof doctrine are never brought under discussion.  Annual meetings are held\r\nevery year on the second Thursday after Easter, when reports are read,\r\nand the officers and committee elected.  This society comprises 800\r\nmembers, one half of whom are laymen.\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Diocesan Church Building Association was established on\r\nOctober 20th, 1836.  It is in union with the Incorporated Society for\r\npromoting the enlargement, building, and repairing of churches and\r\nchapels in England and Wales.  The patron is the Earl of Leicester, and\r\nthe president the Lord Bishop of the diocese.  Grants have been made to\r\nmany parishes in this county.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk Book Hawking Association was established in December, 1855,\r\nfor the sale, throughout the county of Norfolk, by the agency of licensed\r\nhawkers, of bibles, prayer books, tracts, and prints of a religious and\r\ninstructive character.  In the year ending August 31st, 1868, the number\r\nof bibles, testaments, prayer books, church services, tracts, and prints\r\nsold, amounted to 11,449, the receipts being £523 1s. 11½d.  The receipts\r\nfor the year (including a balance of £56 2s. 5d.,) were £759 18s. 4d.,\r\nand the expenditure amounted to £722 9s. 1½d., leaving a balance in hand\r\nof £37 9s. 2½d.  President, the Lord Bishop of the diocese.\r\n\r\nThe Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was founded in the year\r\n1698.  The Norwich Auxiliary is of later date.  During the year 1868 the\r\ncommittee forwarded to the Parent Society contributions amounting to\r\n£154, in addition to donations of £30 from the local fund; and the sale\r\nof books at the depository realised £350, viz., for bibles and\r\ntestaments, 1,489; prayer books, 3,731; other books, 16,993; total,\r\n22,213.  By the rules of this society all its members must be of the\r\nestablished church.  Its principal object is the distribution of the Holy\r\nScriptures at home and abroad, and other religious books which are\r\ncalculated to diffuse christian knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Churchman’s Club was instituted in the early part of the year\r\n1868, mainly through the exertions of the Rev. F. Meyrick, for the moral\r\nand mental improvement of young men in the city.  For these purposes a\r\nreading room has been established, supplied with books, periodicals, and\r\nnewspapers.  Lectures are delivered and classes have been formed for\r\nsecular and religious instruction.  About 100 honorary, and 200\r\nreading-room members have been enrolled.\r\n\r\nAnnual meetings have also been held here on behalf of the London\r\nMissionary Society, which is chiefly supported by Independents; on behalf\r\nof the Baptist Missions, the Wesleyan Missions, and other missions to the\r\nheathen; the Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews; and\r\nalso on behalf of the Norwich City Mission, a society which has been of\r\ngreat benefit in improving the spiritual condition of the poor.  A full\r\naccount of the operations of this mission would exhibit the social state\r\nof the city far better than any elaborate description.\r\n\r\nTurning our attention now to the question of Education, it will not be\r\ntoo much to say that Norwich has always been the head quarters of\r\neducation in the eastern counties, on account both of the number and the\r\ncharacter of the schools, some of which have produced very eminent men.\r\nThe Grammar School is a far-famed ancient institution.  It was originally\r\nfounded and endowed by the bishops of the See who collated the masters,\r\nand the archdeacon of Norwich inducted them.  The Singing and Grammar\r\nSchools belonging to the Convent were kept in the Almonry, the masters of\r\nwhich were frequently collated by the bishop on the Convent’s nomination,\r\nand as soon as inducted they generally published the bishop’s inhibition,\r\nprohibiting all other persons from teaching grammar or singing in the\r\ncity.  At the Reformation they were dissolved; and the present Free\r\nGrammar School was appointed, and took the name of Edward VI.  It is\r\ndivided into the upper and lower schools, has considerable endowments,\r\nand an interest in fifteen scholarships at Cambridge.  It has afforded\r\ninstruction to many distinguished scholars, including Archbishop Parker,\r\nBishops Cousin, T. Green, Maltby, and Monk, Dr. Caius, the founder of\r\nCaius College at Cambridge, Wild, the learned tailor, Admiral Lord\r\nNelson, Coke, Rajah Brooke, and many others.  The Commercial School, in\r\nBridge Street, shares the same endowments, and affords instruction to\r\nmore than 200 boys.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Schools Inquiry Commission, which was issued in March,\r\n1868, and is the most comprehensive on the subject of the education of\r\nthe upper and middle classes that has yet appeared, is very favourable as\r\nregards the Norwich Grammar and Commercial Schools, but quite the reverse\r\nrespecting the schools in the county.  Norwich Grammar School is stated\r\nto have been established in 1547.  The gross income of the charity is\r\n£1558.  The endowment of the school is £662.  The course of instruction\r\nis classical, under a head master and competent teachers.  This is no\r\ndoubt the best school for the classics, but the Commercial School is the\r\nmost useful to the citizens.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond, the assistant commissioner, in the report upon endowed\r\nschools says, that no education, preparatory to the University, is\r\nsupplied in Norfolk, except at the Grammar Schools of Norwich, Holt, and\r\nKing’s Lynn, in none of which does it, except in Norwich, “engross very\r\nmuch of the teacher’s time and attention, nor is it anywhere carried out\r\nto the same perfection as at such schools as Marlborough College and the\r\nCity of London School.  In Norfolk, Latin, so far as it went, was in the\r\nendowed schools generally satisfactory.  But hardly any boy could have\r\nbeen set to write five consecutive lines of Latin, not taken from the\r\nexercise book.  It is fair to add that Norwich sacrifices nothing to it.\r\nIn mathematics, modern languages, and general literature, the school has\r\nfew equals; and certainly none superior in the county.  French is in\r\nNorfolk a recognised study in classical schools, as well as in most of\r\nthe semi-classical schools; is very good, and in all but one\r\nsatisfactory.  In the non-classical schools, French, when attempted, is\r\nworthless.  Arithmetic is in the great majority of Norfolk schools\r\npractically, and perhaps educationally, the most important subject\r\ntaught, and a large portion of time and attention is assigned to it.”\r\n\r\nOnly at a few schools is any useful knowledge of Algebra given, and only\r\nat Norwich Grammar School does it extend beyond the solution of quadratic\r\nequations.  Euclid is not learnt in a very satisfactory manner; it is\r\ntaught too exclusively by papers in Norfolk.  Of natural science no real\r\nor substantial knowledge is imparted.  Of English subjects, history is\r\nthe least taught and the worst learnt.  English literature is hardly\r\ntaught at all, yet it is the noblest literature in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond says that in Norfolk it is simply impossible to establish a\r\nclassical day school without boarders.  At Norwich, Yarmouth, and\r\npossibly Kings Lynn, semi-classical day schools might, under very\r\nfavourable circumstances, remunerate an able certificated teacher, but no\r\nprivate day school in these towns is any better than a national school;\r\n_a fortiori_, this is true of smaller towns and villages.\r\n\r\nThe Boys’ and Girls’ Hospital Schools were founded, in 1618, by Thomas\r\nAnguish; admit on the foundation sixty-nine boys and fifty girls; allow\r\nto each boy £10 yearly for board with parents or friends; the girls are\r\nboarded and lodged at the new School Rooms in Lakenham.  The schools have\r\nan endowed income of £2,097 in the boys’ department, and £1,012 in the\r\ngirls’ department.  Baron’s School has an endowed income of £536.\r\nScott’s School has £137; Balderstone’s School has also £137; Norman’s\r\nSchool has £650, and maintains thirty boys; and several other schools\r\nhave endowments.  The Lancasterian School, in College Court, has room for\r\n300 children, and is supported by Nonconformists.  The School for the\r\nBlind, in Magdalen Street, was founded in 1805 at a cost of £1,000, and\r\nhas an income of £1,300 yearly, and is open to the blind from every part\r\nof the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Diocesan National School Society, established in 1812, has\r\ncontributed £250 per annum towards the support of schools in the city and\r\ncounty, and has supported an institution for training mistresses for the\r\ncharge of schools.  These trained teachers have been in great demand all\r\nover the diocese.  The Norwich charity schools are church schools, nine\r\nin number, and they have afforded instruction to a large number of boys\r\nand girls.  But the education of the poor in this city has not been left\r\nentirely to the church, as there are many British schools supported by\r\nall classes of Nonconformists.\r\n\r\nIn early times the monks or the clergy were the schoolmasters.  Their\r\nschools, when not carried on within the walls of a monastery, were, and\r\nhave been called, Grammar Schools, up to the present time.  Other similar\r\nschools have also been established from time to time in various parts of\r\nthe district, some for educating the sons of the poor, and others for the\r\nmiddle classes.  The population of the country, however, increased so\r\nrapidly, and the people were so ignorant, that no comparison can be made\r\nwith the present state of society.  Dr. Bell introduced the monitorial\r\nsystem, in 1796, and warmly advocated its adoption as the most effectual\r\nmeans of rapidly extending popular instruction.  It was as warmly\r\nreceived, and he was chiefly instrumental in establishing the National\r\nSociety for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the principles of the\r\nEstablished Church.  This society was started in 1811, and has been very\r\nsuccessful.  The British and Foreign Society was established shortly\r\nbefore upon the principles advocated by Lancaster, of allowing the bible\r\nto be read in the schools without note or comment.\r\n\r\nA great change has taken place as regards the intelligence and morals of\r\nthe people, and this may be attributed to the vast increase in the number\r\nof day and Sunday schools.  Popular education is almost the creation of\r\nthe present century, although the day-school epoch may be dated from the\r\nyear 1796, when the youthful quaker, Joseph Lancaster, began to teach\r\nchildren in his father’s house at Southwark.  Lancaster was an enthusiast\r\nin his calling, and acted as much in the character of a guardian to his\r\nscholars as a master, and whilst often charging nothing for his\r\ninstruction, he fed his pupils as well.  No wonder that he had at one\r\ntime 1000 scholars.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1851, the city contained then 45 public day\r\nschools, with 5,207 scholars; 10 private day schools, with 2,553\r\nscholars; and 55 Sunday schools, with 6,859 scholars, which number has\r\nsince been very greatly increased.  About twenty-nine of the Sunday\r\nschools, with 2,650 scholars, belonged to the Church of England; and\r\ntwenty-six Sunday schools with more scholars belonged to the Dissenters.\r\nFive schools with 534 scholars were endowed schools; thirteen with 1,915\r\nscholars were church schools; ten with 712 scholars were national\r\nschools; five with 546 scholars were dissenting British schools.  All the\r\nrest belonged to the Non-conformists.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1861, the Norwich Parochial Charity Schools\r\nafforded instruction, on the national system, to more than 700 boys and\r\n400 girls.  The Model School for boys numbered 400, and that for girls\r\n300 scholars.  New schoolrooms had been built in Heigham, Lakenham,\r\nThorpe, and various parts of the city; and the bishops, the clergy, and\r\nministers of all denominations zealously promoted the educational\r\nmovement.  A great change has, as might consequently have been expected,\r\ntaken place for the better as regards the morals and intelligence of the\r\nmass of the citizens, and this may be attributed in a great measure to\r\nthe number of day and Sunday schools.  Crimes are not now of so frequent\r\noccurrence as formerly.  The magistrates and police have less to do; and\r\nchurches and chapels are more numerous, and better filled and supported.\r\n\r\nWhile the population has been increasing and schools becoming more\r\nnumerous in this city, some means of continuing the education of young\r\nmen seemed to be required, and this want has been in a measure supplied\r\nby the establishment of popular literary institutions.  Of these there\r\nhave been several at various periods, including the Mechanics’\r\nInstitution, the Athenæum, the People’s College, and the Young Men’s\r\nInstitute, all of which are now defunct, and in their places we have a\r\nYoung Men’s Christian Association, and a Church of England Young Men’s\r\nAssociation; the former having about 400 and the latter 200 members.  Of\r\nboth of these the object is to promote the religious, moral, social, and\r\nintellectual well-being of young men, and we are happy to be able to say\r\nthat their work is most energetically and efficiently accomplished.\r\nThere are also a School of Art and a Free Library, both of which we have\r\nalready noticed at pages 431 and 432.\r\n\r\nAs might also be expected, the growth of education and the spread of\r\nreligion have led to that which always, sooner or later, comes out of the\r\nimproved intellectual and moral condition of society—the establishment of\r\na large number of benevolent institutions with various noble purposes.\r\nPerhaps it would be quite within the bounds of the strictest truth to say\r\nthat there is hardly a city or town in the kingdom, of the same\r\npopulation and extent as Norwich, in which a greater amount of genuine\r\ncharity exists, and where institutions for the relief and comfort of the\r\nsick and the poor are more abundant.  In fact these are so numerous in\r\nNorwich that we cannot even mention them.  We may say, however, that\r\namongst them are the Norwich District Visiting Society for relieving the\r\nsick poor at their own houses, established at a public meeting held on\r\nJanuary 16th, 1815; the Norwich Public Dispensary, instituted in the year\r\n1804, for the purpose of giving advice, medicine, and attendance free of\r\nexpense to indigent persons unable to pay for the same; the Jenny Lind\r\nInfirmary for sick children, established on May 30th, 1853, by the\r\nproceeds of a concert, when the Swedish Nightingale was the principal\r\nvocalist; the Benevolent Association for the relief of decayed tradesmen,\r\ntheir widows and orphans, established here on November 16th, 1790; the\r\nNorwich Magdalen or Female Home, established in 1826, for the reclamation\r\nof females who have deviated from the paths of virtue; the Orphans’ Home,\r\nestablished in 1849, for training orphan girls for domestic service; the\r\nSoup Charity, established in 1840, for supplying the poor with a\r\nnutritious soup at a low price in winter; the Bethel Hospital, erected in\r\n1713, for the support and treatment of poor lunatics at a very moderate\r\ncharge; the Blind Hospital, founded in 1805 by Thomas Tawell, a blind\r\ngentleman, for teaching the blind to read and work; the Old Man’s or St.\r\nGiles’ Hospital in Bishopgate Street, founded by Edward VI. as an\r\nalmshouse; Doughty’s Hospital in Calvert Street, founded by William\r\nDoughty, gentleman, in 1687, for twenty-four poor men and eight poor\r\nwomen; and, most valuable of all, the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital for\r\nthe relief of sick and lame poor.  This last, in fact, is an institution\r\nof such importance, and is accomplishing so important a use, that we deem\r\nit deserving of a more extended notice.  This noble institution is an\r\nextensive brick building situated on St. Stephens Road.  It was erected\r\nin 1771 at a cost of more than £21,000, including about £8,000 expended\r\non subsequent additions and improvements.  It has been considerably\r\nenlarged at different times, and it is fitted up with all the latest\r\nimprovements.  It was commenced by the voluntary contributions of the\r\nbenevolent, and has received many donations and legacies.  It has been\r\nwell supported by a long list of annual subscribers.  In 1867 the annual\r\nsubscriptions amounted to £2038 14s. 0d.; benefactions, £422 3s. 4d.;\r\ncollections, £313 1s. 7d.; legacies, £124 4s. 10d.; dividends and\r\ninterest, £745 15s. 1d.; sundries, £62 0s. 4d.; total, £3785 19s. 2d.\r\nThe expenditure in that year amounted to £4935 9s. 3d.  The stock\r\npurchased since 1770 amounts to £23,976 12s. 7d.  The stock sold since\r\n1770, £4890 4s. 4d.  Present stock, £22,091 9s. 5d.—3 per cents.  Bank\r\nstock, £166 13s. 4d.  From 1824 to 1864 the institution received £6018\r\n1s. 9d. from the profits of the Triennial Festivals in St. Andrew’s Hall.\r\nFrom the opening of the hospital in 1772 to January 1st, 1868, in-door\r\npatients 56,828, out-door 52,387.  Daily average number of in-patients,\r\n133; average number of days of each, 43.  The physicians and surgeons\r\nattend in turn to take in-patients every Saturday at 11 a.m., and every\r\nWednesday at the same hour to prescribe for the out-patients,\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the institution are superintended by a board of\r\nmanagement, selected annually from the governors, who consist of persons\r\nwho have contributed thirty guineas or upwards at one time; and that the\r\ninstitution is managed well is sufficiently attested by the vast amount\r\nof good which, through a long series of years, it has successfully\r\neffected, and the cordial support which it has uniformly received from\r\nthe nobility, gentry, and trading community of both city and county.\r\nDoubtless it is a noble exemplification of true Christian Charity, and it\r\nis earnestly to be hoped that as years pass on its means of usefulness\r\nwill be more and more extended by the increasing sympathy and support of\r\nan appreciative public.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY AUTHORITIES, OFFICIALS, _&c._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                JUSTICES.\r\n\r\nNath.

The\r\nGreat Eastern Railway runs into the yards, and goods may be packed in the\r\nOrwell Works yard and delivered at any place having railway communication\r\nwith London without unloading.\r\n\r\nThe works occupy twelve acres of ground, of which about two-thirds is\r\nroofed over, and the demand for covered space continually increases.\r\nFrom 5,000 to 6,000 tons of complete machinery, chiefly for agricultural\r\nuses, annually leave the works.  These, if placed side by side and close\r\ntogether, would cover at least ten acres.  These machines go to all parts\r\nof the world.  Orders have been executed for almost every country in\r\nEurope, for North and South America, for Persia, India, the Spice\r\nIslands, Australia, Africa, and other countries.  The catalogues and\r\nprice currents of the firm have been printed in many languages of the Old\r\nand the New World.\r\n\r\nThe factory is divided into two parts by a road leading direct into the\r\nQuay.  On the southern side are situated the Foundry, Smith Shops, Plough\r\nShops, and Stores.  Whilst on the northern side are the Engine-Erecting\r\nShop, Thrashing Machine Shop, and other shops for the construction of\r\nMills and smaller agricultural machines, such as Screens, Grinding Mills,\r\nChaff-Cutters, Turnip-Cutters, &c.\r\n\r\nThe foundry is large and well furnished with cranes and the other\r\nappliances of the moulders’ art—especially with patent machinery for\r\nmoulding, by which an extraordinary rate of production and of accuracy is\r\nsecured.  The smithy contains 73 forges, and nearly in the centre there\r\nis fixed one of Nasmyth’s large steam hammers.\r\n\r\nPloughs, for which this firm have so long been famous, are fitted up in a\r\nlarge shop, after the forgings and castings have been prepared in the\r\nsmithy and foundry.  Every plough turned out, and which are numbered by\r\nthousands in the course of one year, come under the eye of the foreman or\r\ninspector, and are thoroughly examined, to see that every part is\r\ncorrect.  Here also are made Horse Rakes, Haymakers, and other field\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nIn the northern block are fixed the valuable engineers’ tools, lathes,\r\nstoking machines, &c., necessary for the turning, shaping, and fashioning\r\nall the component parts of a steam-engine or other complex machine.  Here\r\nalso the patterns are made, and here the produced machine receives its\r\nfinal perfection.  At the extreme northern end of the factory are the\r\nshops where are made the steam thrashing and other agricultural machines,\r\nof which wood is a principal component, the wood-work being conveniently\r\nintroduced into this shop from a detached timber yard, where is fixed all\r\nthe wood-working machinery by which the frameworks of the steam thrashers\r\nand other machines are completely fashioned.\r\n\r\nIn between the northern and southern parts of the Works the Offices are\r\nsituated, and it will give _some_ idea of the magnitude of the business\r\nwhen we say that last year upwards of 34,000 letters were received and\r\nanswered.  The Commercial Office is 100 feet long, and the manufacturing\r\noffice 40 feet long.\r\n\r\nOur remaining space must be devoted to the productions of the firm.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that the name of Ransome has been associated with the\r\nplough from the earliest period of its improvement until its present\r\nhighly perfected condition, and that in many a well-contested struggle in\r\nEngland and abroad, before all kinds of tribunals, the Ransome plough has\r\nbeen eminently successful, and is manufactured in annually increasing\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe first great improvement in the plough, viz., the Patent Chilled\r\nPlough Share was the invention of Robert Ransome, the founder of the\r\nfirm, and was patented in 1803.  _Now_ these patent shares are in\r\nuniversal use.  Indeed to the improvement of the plough and the unwearied\r\nenergy of the founder and his two sons, James and Robert Ransome, the\r\nfirm may be said to owe its origin and subsequent success.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ransomes were also one of the earliest makers of the portable\r\nsteam engine, and are at the present time amongst the largest producers\r\nof this very important machine in the kingdom.  Within the last ten\r\nyears, engines of this class, to the aggregate power of 10,000 horses\r\nnominal, have left the Orwell Works.\r\n\r\nThe steam thrashing machines made by the firm, which possess peculiar\r\nadvantages of construction, are also produced in very large numbers, and\r\nhave carried off a large number of prizes.\r\n\r\nTo the merits of these and other inventions developed and manufactured by\r\nthe firm, the long line of prize diplomas in the commercial office, the\r\nlarge box of medals, gold, silver, and bronze, the decorations bestowed\r\non partners of the firm by the Sultan of Turkey and the King of Portugal,\r\nand, recently, the gold medal of the Paris Exhibition, bear abundant\r\ntestimony and need no confirmation of ours.\r\n\r\nWe may just add that the manufacture of railway material, which has\r\nformed part of the business hitherto conducted at the Orwell Works, will\r\nshortly be transferred to a branch of the old firm, who are building a\r\nnew factory on the banks of the Orwell.  This will give Messrs. Ransomes,\r\nSims, and Head, increased space, and facilities for the manufacture of\r\nagricultural machinery, to which they will henceforth give their\r\nexclusive attention.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PRINTING OFFICES_,\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LONDON STREET, NORWICH.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                              JARROLD & SONS\r\n\r\n    _Have recently added to the Printing Department of their business_\r\n\r\n                    Lithographic Steam Power Machinery\r\n\r\n             _of the newest and most approved construction_,\r\n         _adapted to the rapid completion of the usual business_\r\n                           _requirements_, _as_\r\n\r\n               BILLS, INVOICE, NOTE & MEMORANDUM HEADINGS,\r\n                      CARDS, CIRCULARS, ETC., ETC.,\r\n\r\n             _and also to the production of First-Class and_\r\n            _Elaborate Designs in Prospectuses and Ornamental_\r\n                              _Show-Cards_.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD TRACTS FOR THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE MILLIONS of these Popular Tracts are now in circulation in Great\r\nBritain and the Colonies, and the demand is increasing.
