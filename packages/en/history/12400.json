FROM A PAINTING BY F.

The value of Busch's _Memoirs_ has been much exaggerated;\r\nexcept for quite the last years of Bismarck's life they contain little\r\nnew information which is of any importance. Not only had a large portion\r\nof the book already been published in Busch's two earlier books, but\r\nmany of the anecdotes and documents in those parts which were new had\r\nalso been published elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBismarck's own _Memoirs_ have a very different value: not so much\r\nbecause of the new facts which they record, but because of the light\r\nthey throw on Bismarck's character and on the attitude he adopted\r\ntowards men and political problems. With his letters and speeches, they\r\nwill always remain the chief source for our knowledge of his inner life.\r\n\r\nThe other authorities are so numerous that it is impossible here to\r\nenumerate even the more important. I must, however, express the\r\ngratitude which all students of Bismarck's career owe to Horst Kohl; in\r\nhis _Bismarck-Regesten_ he has collected and arranged the material so as\r\ninfinitely to lighten the labours of all others who work in the same\r\nfield. His _Bismarck-Jahrbuch_ is equally indispensable; without this it\r\nwould be impossible for anyone living in England to use the innumerable\r\nletters, documents, and anecdotes which each year appear in German\r\nperiodicals. Of collections of documents and letters, the most important\r\nare those by Herr v. Poschinger, especially the volumes containing the\r\ndespatches written from Frankfort and those dealing with Bismarck's\r\neconomic and financial policy. A full collection of Bismarck's\r\ncorrespondence is much wanted; there is now a good edition of the\r\nprivate letters, edited by Kohl, but no satisfactory collection of the\r\npolitical letters.\r\n\r\nFor diplomatic history between 1860 and 1870, I have, of course, chiefly\r\ndepended on Sybel; but those who are acquainted with the recent course\r\nof criticism in Germany will not be surprised if, while accepting his\r\nfacts, I have sometimes ventured to differ from his conclusions.\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1899.

Just a month\r\nbefore, Napoleon had escaped from Elba; and, as the child lay in his\r\ncradle, the peasants of the village, who but half a year ago had\r\nreturned from the great campaign in France, were once more called to\r\narms. A few months passed by; again the King of Prussia returned at the\r\nhead of his army; in the village churches the medals won at Waterloo\r\nwere hung up by those of Grossbehren and Leipzig. One more victory had\r\nbeen added to the Prussian flags, and then a profound peace fell upon\r\nEurope; fifty years were to go by before a Prussian army again marched\r\nout to meet a foreign foe.\r\n\r\nThe name and family of Bismarck were among the oldest in the land. Many\r\nof the great Prussian statesmen have come from other countries: Stein\r\nwas from Nassau, and Hardenberg was a subject of the Elector of Hanover;\r\neven Blücher and Schwerin were Mecklenburgers, and the Moltkes belong to\r\nHolstein. The Bismarcks are pure Brandenburgers; they belong to the old\r\nMark, the district ruled over by the first Margraves who were sent by\r\nthe Emperor to keep order on the northern frontier; they were there two\r\nhundred years before the first Hohenzollern came to the north.\r\n\r\nThe first of the name of whom we hear was Herbort von Bismarck, who, in\r\n1270, was Master of the Guild of the Clothiers in the city of Stendal.\r\nThe town had been founded about one hundred years before by Albert the\r\nBear, and men had come in from the country around to enjoy the\r\nprivileges and security of city life. Doubtless Herbort or his father\r\nhad come from Bismarck, a village about twenty miles to the west, which\r\ntakes its name either from the little stream, the Biese, which runs near\r\nit, or from the bishop in whose domain it lay. He was probably the first\r\nto bear the name, which would have no meaning so long as he remained in\r\nhis native place, for the _von_ was still a mark of origin and had not\r\nyet become the sign of nobility. Other emigrants from Bismarck seem also\r\nto have assumed it; in the neighbouring town of Prenzlau the name\r\noccurs, and it is still found among the peasants of the Mark; as the\r\nWends were driven back and the German invasion spread, more adventurous\r\ncolonists migrated beyond the Oder and founded a new Bismarck in\r\nPomerania.\r\n\r\nOf the lineage of Herbort we know nothing[1]; his ancestors must have\r\nbeen among the colonists who had been planted by the Emperors on the\r\nnorthern frontier to occupy the land conquered from the heathen. He\r\nseems himself to have been a man of substance and position; he already\r\nused the arms, the double trefoil, which are still borne by all the\r\nbranches of his family. His descendants are often mentioned in the\r\nrecords of the Guild; his son or grandson, Rudolph or Rule, represented\r\nthe town in a conflict with the neighbouring Dukes of Brunswick. It was\r\nhis son Nicolas, or Claus as he is generally called, who founded the\r\nfortunes of the family; he attached himself closely to the cause of the\r\nMargrave, whom he supported in his troubles with the Duke of Brunswick,\r\nand whose interests he represented in the Town Council. He was amply\r\nrewarded for his fidelity. After a quarrel between the city and the\r\nPrince, Bismarck left his native home and permanently entered the\r\nservice of the Margrave. Though probably hitherto only a simple citizen,\r\nhe was enfiefed with the castle of Burgstall, an important post, for it\r\nwas situated on the borders of the Mark and the bishopric of Magdeburg;\r\nhe was thereby admitted into the privileged class of the\r\n_Schlossgesessenen_, under the Margrave, the highest order in the feudal\r\nhierarchy. From that day the Bismarcks have held their own among the\r\nnobility of Brandenburg. Claus eventually became Hofmeister of\r\nBrandenburg, the chief officer at the Court; he had his quarrels with\r\nthe Church, or rather with the spiritual lords, the bishops of Havelburg\r\nand Magdeburg, and was once excommunicated, as his father had been\r\nbefore him, and as two of his sons were after him.\r\n\r\nClaus died about the year 1385. For two hundred years the Bismarcks\r\ncontinued to live at Burgstall, to which they added many other estates.\r\nWhen Conrad of Hohenzollern was appointed Margrave and Elector, he found\r\nsturdy supporters in the lords of Burgstall; he and his successors often\r\ncame there to hunt the deer and wild boars, perhaps also the wolves\r\nand bears, with which the forests around the castle abounded; for the\r\nHohenzollerns were keen sportsmen then as now, as their vassals found\r\nto their cost. In 1555, Hans George, son of the reigning Elector,\r\nAlbert Achilles, bought the neighbouring estate of Letzlingen from\r\nthe Alvenslebens; there he built a house which is still the chief\r\nhunting-lodge of the Kings of Prussia. Soon he cast envious eyes on the\r\ngreat woods and preserves which belong to Burgstall, and intimated that\r\nhe wished to possess them. The Bismarcks resisted long. First they were\r\ncompelled to surrender their hunting rights; this was not sufficient;\r\nthe appetite of the Prince grew; in his own words he wished \"to be rid\r\nof the Bismarcks from the moor and the Tanger altogether.\" He offered in\r\nexchange some of the monasteries which had lately been suppressed; the\r\nBismarcks (the family was represented by two pairs of brothers, who all\r\nlived together in the great castle) long refused; they represented that\r\ntheir ancestors had been faithful vassals; they had served the Electors\r\nwith blood and treasure; they wished \"to remain in the pleasant place to\r\nwhich they had been assigned by God Almighty.\" It was all of no use; the\r\nPrince insisted, and his wrath was dangerous. The Bismarcks gave in;\r\nthey surrendered Burgstall and received in exchange Schoenhausen and\r\nCrevisse, a confiscated nunnery, on condition that as long as the\r\nejected nuns lived the new lords should support them; for which purpose\r\nthe Bismarcks had annually to supply a certain quantity of food and\r\neighteen barrels of beer.\r\n\r\nOf the four co-proprietors, all died without issue, except Friedrich,\r\ncalled the Permutator, in whose hands the whole of the family property\r\nwas again collected; he went to live at Schoenhausen, which since then\r\nhas been the home of the family. No remains of the old castle exist, but\r\nthe church, built in the thirteenth century, is one of the oldest and\r\nmost beautiful in the land between the Havel and the Elbe. House and\r\nchurch stand side by side on a small rising overlooking the Elbe. Here\r\nthey took up their abode; the family to some extent had come down in the\r\nworld. The change had been a disadvantageous one; they had lost in wealth\r\nand importance. For two hundred years they played no very prominent part;\r\nthey married with the neighbouring country gentry and fought in all the\r\nwars. Rudolph, Friedrich's son, fought in France in behalf of the\r\nHuguenots, and then under the Emperor against the Turks. His grandson,\r\nAugust, enlisted under Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar; afterwards he fought in\r\nthe religious wars in France and Germany, always on the Protestant\r\nside; lastly, he took service under the Elector of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nIt was in his lifetime that a great change began to take place which was\r\nto alter the whole life of his descendants. In 1640, Frederick William,\r\nknown as the great Elector, succeeded his father. He it was who laid the\r\nfoundations for that system of government by which a small German\r\nprincipality has grown to be the most powerful military monarchy in\r\nmodern Europe. He held his own against the Emperor; he fought with the\r\nPoles and compelled their King to grant him East Prussia; he drove the\r\nSwedes out of the land. More than this, he enforced order in his own\r\ndominions; he laid the foundation for the prosperity of Berlin; he\r\norganised the administration and got together a small but efficient\r\nmilitary force. The growing power of the Elector was gained to a great\r\nextent at the expense of the nobles; he took from them many of the\r\nprivileges they had before enjoyed. The work he began was continued by\r\nhis son, who took the title of King; and by his grandson, who invented\r\nthe Prussian system of administration, and created the army with which\r\nFrederick the Great fought his battles.\r\n\r\nThe result of the growth of the strong, organised monarchy was indeed\r\ncompletely to alter the position of the nobles. The German barons in the\r\nsouth had succeeded in throwing off the control of their territorial\r\nlords; they owned no authority but the vague control of the distant\r\nEmperor, and ruled their little estates with an almost royal\r\nindependence; they had their own laws, their own coinage, their own\r\narmy. In the north, the nobles of Mecklenburg Holstein, and Hanover\r\nformed a dominant class, and the whole government of the State was in\r\ntheir hands; but those barons whose homes fell within the dominion of\r\nthe Kings of Prussia found themselves face to face with a will and a\r\npower stronger than their own; they lost in independence, but they\r\ngained far more than they lost. They were the basis on which the State\r\nwas built up; they no longer wasted their military prowess in\r\npurposeless feuds or in mercenary service; in the Prussian army and\r\nadministration they found full scope for their ambition, and when the\r\nvictories of Frederick the Great had raised Prussia to the rank of a\r\nEuropean Power, the nobles of Brandenburg were the most loyal of his\r\nsubjects. They formed an exclusive caste; they seldom left their homes;\r\nthey were little known in the south of Germany or in foreign countries;\r\nthey seldom married outside their own ranks. Their chief amusement was\r\nthe chase, and their chief occupation was war. And no king has ever had\r\nunder his orders so fine a race of soldiers; they commanded the armies\r\nof Frederick and won his battles. Dearly did they pay for the greatness\r\nof Prussia; of one family alone, the Kleists, sixty-four fell on the\r\nfield of battle during the Seven Years' War.\r\n\r\nThey might well consider that the State which they had helped to make,\r\nand which they had saved by their blood, belonged to them. But if they\r\nhad become Prussians, they did not cease to be Brandenburgers; their\r\nloyalty to their king never swerved, for they knew that he belonged to\r\nthem as he did to no other of his subjects. He might go to distant\r\nKönigsberg to assume the crown, but his home was amongst them; other\r\nprovinces might be gained or lost with the chances of war, but while a\r\nsingle Hohenzollern lived he could not desert his subjects of the Mark.\r\nThey had the intense local patriotism so characteristic of the German\r\nnation, which is the surest foundation for political greatness; but\r\nwhile in other parts the Particularists, as the Germans called them,\r\naimed only at independence, the Brandenburger who had become a Prussian\r\ndesired domination.\r\n\r\nAmong them the Bismarcks lived. The family again divided into two\r\nbranches: one, which became extinct about 1780, dwelling at Crevisse,\r\ngave several high officials to the Prussian Civil Service; the other\r\nbranch, which continued at Schoenhausen, generally chose a military\r\ncareer. August's son, who had the same name as his father, rebuilt the\r\nhouse, which had been entirely destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty\r\nYears' War; he held the position of Landrath, that is, he was the head\r\nof the administration of the district in which he lived. He married a\r\nFräulein von Katte, of a well-known family whose estates adjoined those\r\nof the Bismarcks. Frau von Bismarck was the aunt of the unfortunate\r\nyoung man who was put to death for helping Frederick the Great in his\r\nattempt to escape. His tomb is still to be seen at Wust, which lies\r\nacross the river a few miles from Schoenhausen; and at the new house,\r\nwhich arose at Schoenhausen and still stands, the arms of the Kattes\r\nare joined to the Bismarck trefoil. The successor to the estates, August\r\nFriedrich, was a thorough soldier; he married a Fräulein von Diebwitz\r\nand acquired fresh estates in Pomerania, where he generally lived.\r\n\r\nHe rose to the rank of colonel, and fell fighting against the Austrians\r\nat Chotusitz in 1742. \"Ein ganzer Kerl\" (a fine fellow), said the King,\r\nas he stood by the dying officer. His son, Carl Alexander, succeeded to\r\nSchoenhausen; the next generation kept up the military traditions of the\r\nfamily; of four brothers, all but one became professional officers and\r\nfought against France in the wars of liberation. One fell at Möckern in\r\n1813; another rose to the rank of lieutenant-general; the third also\r\nfought in the war; his son, the later Count Bismarck-Bohlen, was wounded\r\nat Grossbehren, and the father at once came to take his place during his\r\nconvalescence, in order that the Prussian army might not have fewer\r\nBismarcks. When the young Otto was born two years later, he would often\r\nhear of the adventures of his three uncles and his cousin in the great\r\nwar. The latter, Bismarck-Bohlen, rose to very high honours and was to\r\ndie when over eighty years of age, after he had witnessed the next great\r\nwar with France. It is a curious instance of the divisions of Germany in\r\nthose days that there were Bismarcks fighting on the French side\r\nthroughout the war. One branch of the family had settled in South\r\nGermany; the head of it, Friedrich Wilhelm, had taken service in the\r\nWurtemburg army; he had become a celebrated leader of cavalry and was\r\npassionately devoted to Napoleon. He served with distinction in the\r\nRussian campaign and was eventually taken prisoner by the Germans in the\r\nbattle of Leipzig.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the four brothers, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich v. Bismarck,\r\nhad retired from the army at an early age: he was a quiet, kindly man of\r\ndomestic tastes; on the division of the estates, Schoenhausen fell to\r\nhis lot, and he settled down there to a quiet country life. He took a\r\nstep which must have caused much discussion among all his friends and\r\nrelations, for he chose as wife not one of his own rank, not a Kleist,\r\nor a Katte, or a Bredow, or an Arnim, or an Alvensleben, or any other of\r\nthe neighbouring nobility; he married a simple Fräulein Mencken. She\r\nwas, however, of no undistinguished origin. Her father, the son of a\r\nprofessor at the University of Leipzig, had entered the Prussian Civil\r\nService; there he had risen to the highest rank and had been Cabinet\r\nSecretary to both Frederick William II. and Frederick III. He was a man\r\nof high character and of considerable ability; as was not uncommon among\r\nthe officials of those days, he was strongly affected by the liberal and\r\neven revolutionary doctrines of France.\r\n\r\nFräulein Mencken, who was married at the age of sixteen, was a clever\r\nand ambitious woman. From her her son inherited his intellect; from\r\nhis father he derived what the Germans call _Gemüth_, geniality,\r\nkindliness, humour. By his two parents he was thus connected with the\r\ndouble foundation on which Prussia had been built: on his father's side\r\nhe had sprung from the fighting nobles; on his mother's, from the\r\nscholars and officials. In later life we shall find that while his\r\nprejudices and affections are all enlisted on the side of the noble,\r\nthe keen and critical intellect he had inherited from his mother enabled\r\nhim to overcome the prejudices of his order.\r\n\r\nThe early life of the young pair was not altogether fortunate. Several\r\nchildren died at a very early age; the defeat of Prussia brought foreign\r\noccupation; Schoenhausen was seized by French troopers; the marks of\r\ntheir swords are still to be seen in a beam over one of the doors, and\r\nRittmeister v. Bismarck had to take his wife away into the woods in\r\norder to escape their violence.\r\n\r\nOf all the children of the marriage only three lived: Bernhard, who was\r\nborn in 1810, Otto, and one sister, Malvina, born in 1827.\r\n\r\nOtto did not live at Schoenhausen long; when he was only a year old, his\r\nfather moved to Pomerania and settled on the estates Kniephof and Kulz,\r\nwhich had come into the family on his grandfather's marriage. Pomerania\r\nwas at that time a favourite residence among the Prussian nobility; the\r\ncountry was better wooded than the Mark, and game more plentiful; the\r\nrich meadows, the wide heaths and forests were more attractive than the\r\nheavy corn-lands and the sandy wastes of the older province. Here, in\r\nthe deep seclusion of country life, the boy passed his first years; it\r\nwas far removed from the bustle and turmoil of civilisation. Naugard,\r\nthe nearest town, was five miles distant; communication was bad, for it\r\nwas not till after 1815 that the Prussian Government began to construct\r\nhighroads. In this distant province, life went on as in the olden days,\r\nlittle altered by the changes which had transformed the State. The\r\ngreater portion of the land belonged to large proprietors; the noble as\r\nin old days was still all-powerful on his own estate; in his hands was\r\nthe administration of the law, and it was at his manorial court that men\r\nhad to seek for justice, a court where justice was dealt not in the name\r\nof the King but of the Lord of the Manor. He lived among his people and\r\ngenerally he farmed his own lands. There was little of the luxury of an\r\nEnglish country-house or the refinement of the French noblesse; he would\r\nbe up at daybreak to superintend the work in the fields, his wife and\r\ndaughters that of the household, talking to the peasants the pleasant\r\n_Platt Deutsch_ of the countryside. Then there would be long rides or\r\ndrives to the neighbours' houses; shooting, for there was plenty of deer\r\nand hares; and occasionally in the winter a visit to Berlin; farther\r\naway, few of them went. Most of the country gentlemen had been to Paris,\r\nbut only as conquerors at the end of the great war.\r\n\r\nThey were little disturbed by modern political theories, but were\r\ncontented, as in old days, to be governed by the King. It was a\r\nreligious society; among the peasants and the nobles, if not among the\r\nclergy, there still lingered something of the simple but profound faith\r\nof German Protestantism; they were scarcely touched by the rationalism\r\nof the eighteenth or by the liberalism of the nineteenth century; there\r\nwas little pomp and ceremony of worship in the village church, but the\r\nnatural periods of human life--birth, marriage, death--called for the\r\nblessing of the Church, and once or twice a year came the solemn\r\nconfession and the sacrament. Religious belief and political faith were\r\nclosely joined, for the Church was but a department of the State; the\r\nKing was chief bishop, as he was general of the army, and the sanctity\r\nof the Church was transferred to the Crown; to the nobles and peasants,\r\ncriticism of, or opposition to, the King had in it something of\r\nsacrilege; the words \"by the Grace of God\" added to the royal title were\r\nmore than an empty phrase. Society was still organised on the old\r\npatriarchal basis: at the bottom was the peasant; above him was the\r\n_gnädiger Herr_; above him, _Unser allergnädigste Herr_, the King, who\r\nlived in Berlin; and above him, the _Herr Gott_ in Heaven.\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants of South Germany, and the men of the towns, these\r\nnobles of Further Pomerania, the _Junker_ as they were called, with\r\ntheir feudal life, their medieval beliefs, their simple monarchism, were\r\nthe incarnation of political folly; to them liberalism seemed another\r\nform of atheism, but in this solitude and fresh air of the great plain\r\nwas reared a race of men who would always be ready, as their fathers had\r\nbeen, to draw their sword and go out to conquer new provinces for their\r\nKing to govern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLY LIFE.\r\n\r\n1821-1847.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the boy's early life we know little. His mother was ambitious for her\r\nsons; Otto from his early years she designed for the Diplomatic Service;\r\nshe seems to have been one of those women who was willing to sacrifice\r\nthe present happiness of her children for their future advancement. When\r\nonly six years old the boy was sent away from home to a school in\r\nBerlin. He was not happy there; he pined for the free life of the\r\ncountry, the fields and woods and animals; when he saw a plough he would\r\nburst into tears, for it reminded him of his home. The discipline of the\r\nschool was hard, not with the healthy and natural hardships of life in\r\nthe open air, but with an artificial Spartanism, for it was the time\r\nwhen the Germans, who had suddenly awoke to feelings of patriotism and a\r\nlove of war to which they had long been strangers, under the influence\r\nof a few writers, were throwing all their energies into the cultivation\r\nof physical endurance. It was probably at this time that there was laid\r\nthe foundation of that dislike for the city of Berlin which Bismarck\r\nnever quite overcame; and from his earliest years he was prejudiced\r\nagainst the exaggerated and affected Teutonism which was the fashion\r\nafter the great war. A few years later his parents came to live\r\naltogether in the town; then the boy passed on to the Gymnasium,\r\nboarding in the house of one of the masters. The teaching in this school\r\nwas supplemented by private tutors, and he learned at this time the\r\nfacility in the use of the English and French languages which in after\r\nyears was to be of great service to him. The education at school was of\r\ncourse chiefly in the classical languages; he acquired a sufficient\r\nmastery of Latin. There is no evidence that in later life he continued\r\nthe study of classical literature. In his seventeenth year he passed the\r\nAbiturienten examination, which admitted him as a student to the\r\nuniversity and entitled him to the privilege of serving in the army for\r\none instead of three years. His leaving certificate tells us that his\r\nconduct and demeanour towards his comrades and teachers were admirable,\r\nhis abilities considerable, and his diligence fair.\r\n\r\nThe next year he passed in the ordinary course to the university,\r\nentering at Göttingen; the choice was probably made because of the\r\ncelebrity which that university had acquired in law and history. It is\r\nsaid that he desired to enter at Heidelberg, but his mother refused her\r\npermission, because she feared that he would learn those habits of\r\nbeer-drinking in which the students of that ancient seat of learning\r\nhave gained so great a proficiency; it was, however, an art which, as\r\nhe found, was to be acquired with equal ease at Göttingen. The young\r\nBismarck was at this time over six feet high, slim and well built, of\r\ngreat physical strength and agility, a good fencer, a bold rider, an\r\nadmirable swimmer and runner, a very agreeable companion; frank,\r\ncheerful, and open-hearted, without fear either of his comrades or of\r\nhis teachers. He devoted his time at Göttingen less to learning than to\r\nsocial life; in his second term he entered the Corps of the Hanoverians\r\nand was quickly noted for his power of drinking and fighting; he is\r\nreported to have fought twenty-six duels and was only wounded once, and\r\nthat wound was caused by the breaking of his opponent's foil. He was\r\nfull of wild escapades, for which he was often subjected to the ordinary\r\npunishments of the university.\r\n\r\nTo many Germans, their years at the university have been the\r\nturning-point of their life; but it was not so with Bismarck. To those\r\nwho have been brought up in the narrow surroundings of civic life,\r\nstudent days form the single breath of freedom between the discipline of\r\na school and the drudgery of an office. To a man who, like Bismarck, was\r\naccustomed to the truer freedom of the country, it was only a passing\r\nphase; as we shall see, it was not easy to tie him down to the drudgery\r\nof an office. He did not even form many friendships which he continued\r\nin later years; his associates in his corps must have been chiefly young\r\nHanoverians; few of his comrades in Prussia were to be found at\r\nGöttingen; his knowledge of English enabled him to make the\r\nacquaintance of the Americans and English with whom Göttingen has always\r\nbeen a favourite university; among his fellow-students almost the only\r\none with whom in after life he continued the intimacy of younger days\r\nwas Motley. We hear little of his work; none of the professors seem to\r\nhave left any marked influence on his mind or character; indeed they had\r\nlittle opportunity for doing so, for after the first term his attendance\r\nat lectures almost entirely ceased. Though never a student, he must have\r\nbeen at all times a considerable reader; he had a retentive memory and\r\nquick understanding; he read what interested him; absorbed, understood,\r\nand retained it. He left the university with his mind disciplined indeed\r\nbut not drilled; he had a considerable knowledge of languages, law,\r\nliterature, and history; he had not subjected his mind to the dominion\r\nof the dominant Hegelian philosophy, and to this we must attribute that\r\nfreshness and energy which distinguishes him from so many of his ablest\r\ncontemporaries; his brain was strong, and it worked as easily and as\r\nnaturally as his body; his knowledge was more that of a man of the world\r\nthan of a student, but in later life he was always able to understand\r\nthe methods and to acquire the knowledge of the subjects he required in\r\nhis official career. History was his favourite study; he never\r\nattempted, like some statesmen, to write; but if his knowledge of\r\nhistory was not as profound as that of a professed historian, he was\r\nafterwards to shew as a parliamentary debater that he had a truer\r\nperception of the importance of events than many great scholars who\r\nhave devoted their lives to historical research, and he was never at a\r\nloss for an illustration to explain and justify the policy he had\r\nassumed. For natural science he shewed little interest, and indeed at\r\nthat time it scarcely could be reckoned among the ordinary subjects of\r\neducation; philosophy he pursued rather as a man than as a student, and\r\nwe are not surprised to find that it was Spinoza rather than Kant or\r\nFichte or Hegel to whom he devoted most attention, for he cared more for\r\nprinciples of belief and the conduct of life than the analysis of the\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nHis university career does not seem to have left any mark on his\r\npolitical principles; during just those years, the agitation of which\r\nthe universities had long been the scene had been forcibly repressed; it\r\nwas the time of deep depression which followed the revolution of 1830,\r\nand the members of the aristocratic corps to which he belonged looked\r\nwith something approaching contempt on this _Burschenschaft_, as the\r\nunion was called, which propagated among the students the national\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAfter spending little more than a year at Göttingen, he left in\r\nSeptember, 1833; in May of the following year he entered as a student at\r\nBerlin, where he completed his university course; we have no record as\r\nto the manner in which he spent the winter and early spring, but we find\r\nthat when he applied to Göttingen for permission to enter at Berlin, it\r\nwas accorded on condition that he sat out a term of imprisonment which\r\nhe still owed to the university authorities. During part of his time in\r\nBerlin he shared a room with Motley. In order to prepare for the final\r\nexamination he engaged the services of a crammer, and with his\r\nassistance, in 1835, took the degree of Doctor of Law and at once passed\r\non to the public service.\r\n\r\nHe had, as we have seen, been destined for the Diplomatic Service from\r\nearly life; he was well connected; his cousin Count Bismarck-Bohlen\r\nstood in high favour at Court. He was related to or acquainted with all\r\nthe families who held the chief posts both in the military and civil\r\nservice; with his great talents and social gifts he might therefore look\r\nforward to a brilliant career. Any hopes, however, that his mother might\r\nhave had were destined to be disappointed; his early official life was\r\nvaried but short. He began in the judicial department and was appointed\r\nto the office of Auscultator at Berlin, for in the German system the\r\njudicature is one department of the Civil Service. After a year he was\r\nat his own request transferred to the administrative side and to\r\nAix-la-Chapelle; it is said that he had been extremely pained and\r\nshocked by the manner in which the officials transacted the duties of\r\ntheir office and especially by their management of the divorce matters\r\nwhich came before the court. The choice of Aix-la-Chapelle was probably\r\nowing to the fact that the president of that province was Count Arnim of\r\nBoytzenburg, the head of one of the most numerous and distinguished\r\nfamilies of the Mark, with so many members of which Bismarck was in\r\nlater years to be connected both for good and evil. Count Arnim was a\r\nman of considerable ability and moderate liberal opinions, who a few\r\nyears later rose to be the first Minister-President in Prussia. Under\r\nhim Bismarck was sure to receive every assistance. He had to pass a\r\nfresh examination, which he did with great success. His certificate\r\nstates that he shewed thoroughly good school studies, and was well\r\ngrounded in law; he had thought over what he had learnt and already had\r\nacquired independent opinions. He had admirable judgment, quickness in\r\nunderstanding, and a readiness in giving verbal answers to the questions\r\nlaid before him; we see all the qualities by which he was to be\r\ndistinguished in after life. He entered on his duties at Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nat the beginning of June; at his own request Count Arnim wrote to the\r\nheads of the department that as young Bismarck was destined for a\r\ndiplomatic career they were to afford him every opportunity of becoming\r\nacquainted with all the different sides of the administrative work and\r\ngive him more work than they otherwise would have done; he was to be\r\nconstantly occupied. His good resolutions did not, however, continue\r\nlong; he found himself in a fashionable watering-place, his knowledge of\r\nlanguages enabled him to associate with the French and English visitors,\r\nhe made excursions to Belgium and the Rhine, and hunting expeditions to\r\nthe Ardennes, and gave up to society the time he ought to have spent in\r\nthe office. The life at Aix was not strict and perhaps his amusements\r\nwere not always edifying, but he acquired that complete ease in\r\ncosmopolitan society which he could not learn at Göttingen or Berlin,\r\nand his experiences during this year were not without use to him when\r\nhe was afterwards placed in the somewhat similar society of Frankfort.\r\nThis period in his career did not last long; in June, 1837, we find him\r\napplying for leave of absence on account of ill-health. He received\r\nleave for eight days, but he seems to have exceeded this, for four\r\nmonths afterwards he writes from Berne asking that his leave may be\r\nprolonged; he had apparently gone off for a long tour in Switzerland and\r\nthe Rhine. His request was refused; he received a severe reprimand, and\r\nCount Arnim approved his resolution to return to one of the older\r\nPrussian provinces, \"where he might shew an activity in the duties of\r\nhis office which he had in vain attempted to attain in the social\r\nconditions of Aachen.\"\r\n\r\nHe was transferred to Potsdam, but he remained here only a few weeks; he\r\nhad not as yet served in the army, and he now began the year as a\r\nprivate soldier which was required from him; he entered the Jaeger or\r\nRifles in the _Garde Corps_ which was stationed at Potsdam, but after a\r\nfew weeks was transferred to the Jaeger at Stettin. The cause seems to\r\nhave been partly the ill-health of his mother; she was dying, and he\r\nwished to be near her; in those days the journey from Berlin to\r\nPomerania took more than a day; besides this there were pecuniary\r\nreasons. His father's administration of the family estates had not been\r\nsuccessful; it is said that his mother had constantly pressed her\r\nhusband to introduce innovations, but had not consistently carried them\r\nout; this was a not unnatural characteristic in the clever and ambitious\r\nwoman who wished to introduce into agricultural affairs those habits\r\nwhich she had learnt from the bureaucrats in Berlin. However this may\r\nbe, matters had now reached a crisis; it became necessary to sell the\r\nlarger part of the land attached to the house at Schoenhausen, and in\r\nthe next year, after the death of Frau von Bismarck, which took place on\r\nJanuary 1, 1839, it was decided that Herr von Bismarck should in future\r\nlive at Schoenhausen with his only daughter, now a girl of twelve years\r\nof age, while the two brothers should undertake the management of the\r\nPomeranian estates.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that at the age of twenty-four all prospect of an\r\nofficial career had for the time to be abandoned, and Otto settled down\r\nwith his brother to the life of a country squire. It is curious to\r\nnotice that the greatest of his contemporaries, Cavour, went through a\r\nsimilar training. There was, however, a great difference between the two\r\nmen: Cavour was in this as in all else a pioneer; when he retired to his\r\nestate he was opening out new forms of activity and enterprise for his\r\ncountrymen; Bismarck after the few wild years away from home was to go\r\nback to the life which all his ancestors had lived for five hundred\r\nyears, to become steeped in the traditions of his country and his caste.\r\nCavour always points the way to what is new, Bismarck again brings into\r\nhonour what men had hastily thought was antiquated. He had to some\r\nextent prepared himself for the work by attending lectures at a newly\r\nfounded agricultural college in the outskirts of Greifswald. The\r\nmanagement of the estate seems to have been successful; the two brothers\r\nstarted on their work with no capital and no experience, but after\r\nthree or four years by constant attention and hard work they had put the\r\naffairs in a satisfactory state. In 1841, a division was made; Otto had\r\nwished this to be done before, as he found that he spent a good deal\r\nmore money than his brother and was gaining an unfair advantage in the\r\ncommon household; from this time he took over Kniephof, and there he\r\nlived for the next four years, while his brother took up his abode four\r\nmiles off at Kulz, where he lived till his death in 1895. Otto had not\r\nindeed given up the habits he had learnt at Göttingen; his wild freaks,\r\nhis noisy entertainments, were the talk of the countryside; the beverage\r\nwhich he has made classical, a mixture of beer and champagne, was the\r\ncommon drink, and he was known far and wide as the mad Bismarck. These\r\nacts of wildness were, however, only a small part of his life; he\r\nentered as a lieutenant of Landwehr in the cavalry and thereby became\r\nacquainted with another form of military service. It was while he was at\r\nthe annual training that he had an opportunity of shewing his physical\r\nstrength and courage. A groom, who was watering horses in the river, was\r\nswept away by the current; Bismarck, who was standing on a bridge\r\nwatching them, at once leaped into the river, in full uniform as he was,\r\nand with great danger to himself saved the drowning man. For this he\r\nreceived a medal for saving life. He astonished his friends by the\r\namount and variety of his reading; it was at this time that he studied\r\nSpinoza. It is said that he had among his friends the reputation of\r\nbeing a liberal; it is probable enough that he said and did many things\r\nwhich they did not understand; and anything they did not understand\r\nwould be attributed to liberalism by the country gentlemen of Pomerania;\r\npartly no doubt it was due to the fact that in 1843 he came back from\r\nParis wearing a beard. We can see, however, that he was restless and\r\ndiscontented; he felt in himself the possession of powers which were not\r\nbeing used; there was in his nature also a morbid restlessness, a\r\ndissatisfaction with himself which he tried to still but only increased\r\nby his wild excesses. As his affairs became more settled he travelled;\r\none year he went to London, another to Paris; of his visit to England we\r\nhave an interesting account in a letter to his father. He landed in\r\nHull[2], thence he went to Scarborough and York, where he was hospitably\r\nreceived by the officers of the Hussars; \"although I did not know any of\r\nthem, they asked me to dinner and shewed me everything\"; from York he\r\nwent to Manchester, where he saw some of the factories.\r\n\r\n  \"Generally speaking I cannot praise too highly the extraordinary\r\n  courtesy and kindness of English people, which far surpass what I\r\n  had expected; even the poor people are pleasant, very unassuming,\r\n  and easy to get on with when one talks to them. Those who come\r\n  much into intercourse with strangers--cab-drivers, porters,\r\n  etc.--naturally have a tendency to extortion, but soon give in\r\n  when they see that one understands the language and customs and\r\n  is determined not to be put upon. Generally I find the life much\r\n  cheaper than I expected.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1844, his sister, to whom he was passionately devoted, was married to\r\nan old friend, Oscar von Arnim. Never did an elder brother write to his\r\nyoung sister more delightful letters than those which she received from\r\nhim; from them we get a pleasant picture of his life at this time.\r\nDirectly after the wedding, when he was staying with his father at\r\nSchoenhausen, he writes:\r\n\r\n  \"Just now I am living here with my father, reading, smoking, and\r\n  walking; I help him to eat lamperns and sometimes play a comedy\r\n  with him which it pleases him to call fox-hunting. We start out\r\n  in heavy rain, or perhaps with 10 degrees of frost, with Ihle,\r\n  Ellin, and Karl; then in perfect silence we surround a clump of\r\n  firs with the most sportsmanlike precautions, carefully observing\r\n  the wind, although we all, and probably father as well, are\r\n  absolutely convinced that there is not a living creature in it\r\n  except one or two old women gathering firewood. Then Ihle, Karl,\r\n  and the two dogs make their way through the cover, emitting the\r\n  most strange and horrible sounds, especially Ihle; father stands\r\n  there motionless and on the alert with his gun cocked, just as\r\n  though he really expected to see something. Ihle comes out just\r\n  in front of him, shouting 'Hoo lala, hey heay, hold him, hie,\r\n  hie,' in the strangest and most astonishing manner. Then father\r\n  asks me if I have seen nothing, and I with the most natural tone\r\n  of astonishment that I can command, answer 'No, nothing at all.'\r\n  Then after abusing the weather we start off to another wood,\r\n  while Ihle with a confidence that he assumes in the most natural\r\n  manner praises its wealth in game, and there we play over the\r\n  game again _dal segno_. So it goes on for three or four hours;\r\n  father's, Ihle's, and Fingal's passion does not seem to cool for\r\n  a moment. Besides that, we look at the orange house twice a day\r\n  and the sheep once a day, observe the four thermometers in the\r\n  room once every hour, set the weather-glass, and, since the\r\n  weather has been fine, have set all the clocks by the sun and\r\n  adjusted them so closely that the clock in the dining-room is the\r\n  only one which ever gives a sound after the others have struck.\r\n  Charles V. was a stupid fellow. You will understand that with so\r\n  multifarious an occupation I have little time left to call on the\r\n  clergymen; as they have no vote for the election it was quite\r\n  impossible.\r\n\r\n  \"The Elbe is full of ice, the wind E.S.E., the latest thermometer\r\n  from Berlin shews 8 degrees, the barometer is rising and at 8.28.\r\n  I tell you this as an example how in your letters you might write\r\n  to father more the small events of your life; they amuse him\r\n  immensely; tell him who has been to see you, whom you have been\r\n  calling on, what you had for dinner, how the horses are, how the\r\n  servants behave, if the doors creak and the windows are firm--in\r\n  short, facts and events. Besides this, he does not like to be\r\n  called papa, he dislikes the expression. _Avis au lecteur_.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he says:\r\n\r\n  \"Only with difficulty can I resist the temptation of filling a\r\n  whole letter with agricultural lamentations over frosts, sick\r\n  cattle, bad reap, bad roads, dead lambs, hungry sheep, want of\r\n  straw, fodder, money, potatoes, and manure; outside Johann is\r\n  persistently whistling a wretched schottische out of tune, and I\r\n  have not the cruelty to interrupt it, for he seeks to still by\r\n  music his violent love-sickness.\"\r\n\r\nThen we have long letters from Nordeney, where he delighted in the sea,\r\nbut space will not allow us to quote more. It is only in these letters,\r\nand in those which he wrote in later years to his wife, that we see the\r\nnatural kindliness and simplicity of his disposition, his love of\r\nnature, and his great power of description. There have been few better\r\nletter-writers in Germany or any other country.\r\n\r\nHis ability and success as an agriculturist made a deep impression on\r\nhis neighbours. As years went on he became much occupied in local\r\nbusiness; he was appointed as the representative of his brother, who was\r\nLandrath for the district; in 1845 he was elected one of the members for\r\nthe Provincial Diet of Pomerania. He also had a seat in the Diet for the\r\nSaxon province in which Schoenhausen was situated. These local Diets\r\nwere the only form of representative government which existed in the\r\nrural districts; they had little power, but their opinion was asked on\r\nnew projects of law, and they were officially regarded as an efficient\r\nsubstitute for a common Prussian Parliament. Many of his friends,\r\nincluding his brother, urged him again to enter the public service, for\r\nwhich they considered he was especially adapted; he might have had the\r\npost of Royal Commissioner for Improvements in East Prussia.\r\n\r\nHe did make one attempt to resume his official career. At the beginning\r\nof 1844 he returned to Potsdam and took up his duties as Referendar,\r\nbut not for long; he seems to have quarrelled with his superior. The\r\nstory is that he called one day to ask for leave of absence; his chief\r\nkept him waiting an hour in the anteroom, and when he was admitted asked\r\nhim curtly, \"What do you want?\" Bismarck at once answered, \"I came to\r\nask for leave of absence, but now I wish for permission to send in my\r\nresignation.\" He was clearly deficient in that subservience and ready\r\nobedience to authority which was the best passport to promotion in the\r\nCivil Service; there was in his disposition already a certain truculence\r\nand impatience. From this time he nourished a bitter hatred of the\r\nPrussian bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThis did not, however, prevent him carrying out his public duties as a\r\nlanded proprietor. In 1846 we find him taking much interest in proposals\r\nfor improving the management of the manorial courts; he wished to see\r\nthem altered so as to give something of the advantages of the English\r\nsystem; he regrets the \"want of corporate spirit and public feeling in\r\nour corn-growing aristocracy\"; \"it is unfortunately difficult among most\r\nof the gentlemen to awake any other idea under the words 'patrimonial\r\npower' but the calculation whether the fee will cover the expenses.\" We\r\ncan easily understand that the man who wrote this would be called a\r\nliberal by many of his neighbours; what he wanted, however, was a reform\r\nwhich would give life, permanency, and independence to an institution\r\nwhich like everything else was gradually falling before the inroads of\r\nthe dominant bureaucracy. The same year he was appointed to the\r\nposition of Inspector of Dykes for Jerichow. The duties of this office\r\nwere of considerable importance for Schoenhausen and the neighbouring\r\nestate; as he writes, \"it depends on the managers of this office\r\nwhether from time to time we come under water or not.\" He often refers\r\nto the great damages caused by the floods; he had lost many of his\r\nfruit-trees, and many of the finest elms in the park had been destroyed\r\nby the overflowing of the Elbe.\r\n\r\nAs Bismarck grew in age and experience he associated more with the\r\nneighbouring families. Pomerania was at this time the centre of a\r\ncurious religious movement; the leader was Herr von Thadden, who lived\r\nat Triglaff, not many miles from Kniephof. He was associated with Herr\r\nvon Semft and three brothers of the family of Below. They were all\r\nprofoundly dissatisfied with the rationalistic religion preached by the\r\nclergy at that time, and aimed at greater inwardness and depth of\r\nreligious feeling. Herr von Thadden started religious exercises in his\r\nown house, which were attended not only by the peasants from the village\r\nbut by many of the country gentry; they desired the strictest\r\nenforcement of Lutheran doctrine, and wished the State directly to\r\nsupport the Church. This tendency of thought acquired greater importance\r\nwhen, in 1840, Frederick William IV succeeded to the throne; he was also\r\na man of deep religious feeling, and under his reign the extreme\r\nLutheran party became influential at Court. Among the ablest of these\r\nwere the three brothers von Gerlach. One of them, Otto, was a\r\ntheologian; another, Ludwig, was Over-President of the Saxon province,\r\nand with him Bismarck had much official correspondence; the third,\r\nLeopold, who had adopted a military career, was attached to the person\r\nof the King and was in later years to have more influence upon him than\r\nanyone except perhaps Bunsen. The real intellectual leader of the party\r\nwas Stahl, a theologian.\r\n\r\nFrom about the year 1844 Bismarck seems to have become very intimate\r\nwith this religious coterie; his friend Moritz v. Blankenburg had\r\nmarried Thadden's daughter and Bismarck was constantly a visitor at\r\nTriglaff. It was at Blankenburg's wedding that he first met Hans v.\r\nKleist, who was in later years to be one of his most intimate friends.\r\nHe was, we are told, the most delightful and cheerful of companions; in\r\nhis tact and refinement he shewed an agreeable contrast to the ordinary\r\nmanners of Pomerania. He often rode over to take part in Shakespeare\r\nevenings, and amused them by accounts of his visit to England[3]. He was\r\npresent occasionally at the religious meetings at Triglaff, and though\r\nhe never quite adopted all the customs of the set the influence on him\r\nof these older men was for the next ten years to govern all his\r\npolitical action. That he was not altogether at one with them we can\r\nunderstand, when we are told that at Herr von Thadden's house it would\r\nnever have occurred to anyone even to think of smoking. Bismarck was\r\nthen, as in later life, a constant smoker.\r\n\r\nThe men who met in these family parties in distant Pomerania were in a\r\nfew years to change the whole of European history. Here Bismarck for the\r\nfirst time saw Albrecht von Roon, a cousin of the Blankenburgs, then a\r\nrising young officer in the artillery; they often went out shooting\r\ntogether. The Belows, Blankenburgs, and Kleists were to be the founders\r\nand leaders of the Prussian Conservative party, which was Bismarck's\r\nonly support in his great struggle with the Parliament; and here, too,\r\ncame the men who were afterwards to be editors and writers of the _Kreuz\r\nZeitung_.\r\n\r\nThe religious convictions which Bismarck learnt from them were to be\r\nlasting, and they profoundly influenced his character. He had probably\r\nreceived little religious training from his mother, who belonged to the\r\nrationalistic school of thought. It was by them that his monarchical\r\nfeeling was strengthened. It is not at first apparent what necessary\r\nconnection there is between monarchical government and Christian faith.\r\nFor Bismarck they were ever inseparably bound together; nothing but\r\nreligious belief would have reconciled him to a form of government so\r\nrepugnant to natural human reason. \"If I were not a Christian, I would\r\nbe a Republican,\" he said many years later; in Christianity he found the\r\nonly support against revolution and socialism. He was not the man to be\r\nbeguiled by romantic sentiment; he was not a courtier to be blinded by\r\nthe pomp and ceremony of royalty; he was too stubborn and independent to\r\nacquiesce in the arbitrary rule of a single man. He could only obey the\r\nking if the king himself held his authority as the representative of a\r\nhigher power. Bismarck was accustomed to follow out his thought to its\r\nconclusions. To whom did the king owe his power? There was only one\r\nalternative: to the people or to God. If to the people, then it was a\r\nmere question of convenience whether the monarchy were continued in\r\nform; there was little to choose between a constitutional monarchy where\r\nthe king was appointed by the people and controlled by Parliament, and\r\nan avowed republic. This was the principle held by nearly all his\r\ncontemporaries. He deliberately rejected it. He did not hold that the\r\nvoice of the people was the voice of God. This belief did not satisfy\r\nhis moral sense; it seemed in public life to leave all to interest and\r\nambition and nothing to duty. It did not satisfy his critical intellect;\r\nthe word \"people\" was to him a vague idea. The service of the People or\r\nof the King by the Grace of God, this was the struggle which was soon to\r\nbe fought out.\r\n\r\nBismarck's connection with his neighbours was cemented by his marriage.\r\nAt the beginning of 1847, he was engaged to a Fräulein von Puttkammer,\r\nwhom he had first met at the Blankenburgs' house; she belonged to a\r\nquiet and religious family, and it is said that her mother was at first\r\nfilled with dismay when she heard that Johanna proposed to marry the mad\r\nBismarck. He announced the engagement to his sister in a letter\r\ncontaining the two words, \"All right,\" written in English. Before the\r\nwedding could take place, a new impulse in his life was to begin. As\r\nrepresentative of the lower nobility he had to attend the meeting of the\r\nEstates General which had been summoned in Berlin. From this time the\r\nstory of his life is interwoven with the history of his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n1847-1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck was a subject of the King of Prussia, but Prussia was after all\r\nonly one part of a larger unit; it was a part of Germany. At this time,\r\nhowever, Germany was little more than a geographical expression. The\r\nmedieval emperors had never succeeded in establishing permanent\r\nauthority over the whole nation; what unity there had been was\r\ncompletely broken down at the Reformation, and at the Revolution the\r\nEmpire itself, the symbol of a union which no longer existed, had been\r\nswept away. At the restoration in 1815 the reorganisation of Germany was\r\none of the chief tasks before the Congress of Vienna. It was a task in\r\nwhich the statesmen failed. All proposals to restore the Empire were\r\nrejected, chiefly because Francis, who had taken the style of Emperor of\r\nAustria, did not desire to resume his old title. Germany emerged from\r\nthe Revolution divided into thirty-nine different States; Austria was\r\none of the largest and most populous monarchies in Europe, but more than\r\nhalf the Austrian Empire consisted of Italian, Slavonic, and Hungarian\r\nprovinces. The Emperor of Austria ruled over about 20,000,000 Germans.\r\nThe next State in size and importance was Prussia. Then came four\r\nStates, the Kingdoms of Saxony, Hanover, Bavaria, and Würtemberg,\r\nvarying in size from five to two million inhabitants; below them were\r\nsome thirty principalities of which the smallest contained only a few\r\nthousand inhabitants. By the principles adopted in the negotiations\r\nwhich preceded the Congress of Vienna, every one of these States was\r\nrecognised as a complete independent monarchy, with its own laws and\r\nconstitutions. The recognition of this independence made any common\r\ngovernment impossible. Neither Austria nor Prussia would submit to any\r\nexternal authority, or to one another; the Kings of Bavaria and\r\nWürtemberg were equally jealous of their independence. All that could be\r\ndone was to establish a permanent offensive and defensive alliance\r\nbetween these States. For the management of common concerns, a Diet was\r\nappointed to meet at Frankfort; the Diet, however, was only a union of\r\ndiplomatists; they had to act in accordance with instructions from their\r\ngovernments and they had no direct authority over the Germans; each\r\nGerman was officially regarded as a subject, as the case might be, of\r\nthe King of Prussia, the Prince of Reuss, the Grand Duke of Weimar.\r\nThere was no German army, no German law, no German church. No\r\ndevelopment of common institutions was possible, for no change could be\r\nintroduced without the universal consent of every member of the\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nThis lamentable result of the Congress of Vienna caused much\r\ndissatisfaction among the thinking classes in Germany. A very strong\r\nnational feeling had been aroused by the war against Napoleon. This\r\nfound no satisfaction in the new political institutions. The discontent\r\nwas increased when it was discovered that the Diet, so useless for all\r\nelse, was active only against liberty. Prince Metternich, a very able\r\ndiplomatist, knew that the Liberal and National ideas, which were so\r\ngenerally held at that time, would be fatal to the existence of the\r\nAustrian Empire; he therefore attempted to suppress them, not only in\r\nAustria, but also in Germany, as he did in Italy. Unfortunately the King\r\nof Prussia, Frederick William III., whose interests were really entirely\r\nopposed to those of Austria, was persuaded by Metternich to adopt a\r\nrepressive policy. The two great powers when combined could impose their\r\nwill on Germany; they forced through the Diet a series of measures\r\ndevoted to the restriction of the liberty of the press, the control of\r\nthe universities, and the suppression of democratic opinion.\r\n\r\nThe result of this was great discontent in Germany, which was especially\r\ndirected against Prussia; in 1830 the outbreak of revolution in Paris\r\nhad been followed by disturbances in many German States; Austria and\r\nPrussia, however, were still strong enough to maintain the old system.\r\nThe whole intellect of the country was diverted to a policy of\r\nopposition; in the smaller States of the south, Parliamentary government\r\nhad been introduced; and the great aim of the Liberals was to establish\r\na Parliament in Prussia also.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the old King died; the son, Frederick William IV., was a man of\r\ngreat learning, noble character, high aspirations; he was, however,\r\nentirely without sympathy or understanding for the modern desires of his\r\ncountrymen; he was a child of the Romantic movement; at the head of the\r\nyoungest of European monarchies, he felt himself more at home in the\r\nMiddle Ages than in his own time. There could be no sympathy between him\r\nand the men who took their politics from Rousseau and Louis Blanc, and\r\ntheir religion from Strauss. It had been hoped that he would at once\r\nintroduce into Prussia representative institutions. He long delayed, and\r\nthe delay took away any graciousness from the act when at last it was\r\ncommitted. By a royal decree published in 1822 it had been determined\r\nthat no new loan could be made without the assent of an assembly of\r\nelected representatives; the introduction of railways made a loan\r\nnecessary, and at the beginning of 1847 Frederick William summoned for\r\nthe first time the States General.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia had thereby stirred up a power which he was unable\r\nto control; he had hoped that he would be able to gather round him the\r\nrepresentatives of the nobles, the towns, and the peasants; that this\r\nnew assembly, collecting about him in respectful homage, would add\r\nlustre to his throne; that they would vote the money which was required\r\nand then separate. How much was he mistaken! The nation had watched for\r\nyears Parliamentary government in England and France; this was what they\r\nwished to have, and now they were offered a modern imitation of\r\nmedieval estates. They felt themselves as grown men able and justified\r\nin governing their own country; the King treated them as children. The\r\nopening ceremony completed the bad impression which the previous acts of\r\nthe King had made. While the majority of the nation desired a formal and\r\nwritten Constitution, the King in his opening speech with great emphasis\r\ndeclared that he would never allow a sheet of paper to come between him\r\nand God in heaven.\r\n\r\nBismarck was not present at the opening ceremony; it was, in fact, owing\r\nto an accident that he was able to take his seat at all; he was there as\r\nsubstitute for the member for the _Ritterschaft_ of Jerichow, who had\r\nfallen ill. He entered on his Parliamentary duties as a young and almost\r\nunknown man; he did not belong to any party, but his political\r\nprinciples were strongly influenced by the friends he had found in\r\nPomerania. They were soon to be hardened by conflict and confirmed by\r\nexperience; during the first debates he sat silent, but his indignation\r\nrose as he listened to the speeches of the Liberal majority. Nothing\r\npleased them; instead of actively co-operating with the Government in\r\nthe consideration of financial measures, they began to discuss and\r\ncriticise the proclamation by which they had been summoned. There was\r\nindeed ample scope for criticism; the Estates were so arranged that the\r\nrepresentatives of the towns could always be outvoted by the landed\r\nproprietors; they had not even the right of periodical meetings; the\r\nKing was not compelled to call them together again until he required\r\nmore money. They not only petitioned for increased powers, they demanded\r\nthem as a right; they maintained that an assembly summoned in this form\r\ndid not meet the intentions of previous laws; when they were asked to\r\nallow a loan for a railway in East Prussia, they refused on the ground\r\nthat they were not a properly qualified assembly.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Bismarck: the action of the King might have been\r\ninconclusive; much that he said was indiscreet; but it remained true\r\nthat he had taken the decisive step; no one really doubted that Prussia\r\nwould never again be without a Parliament. It would be much wiser, as it\r\nwould be more chivalrous, to adopt a friendly tone and not to attempt to\r\nforce concessions from him. He was especially indignant at the statement\r\nmade that the Prussian people had earned constitutional government by\r\nthe part they took in the war of liberation; against this he protested:\r\n\r\n  \"In my opinion it is a bad service to the national honour to\r\n  assume that the ill-treatment and degradation that the Prussians\r\n  suffered from a foreign ruler were not enough to make our blood\r\n  boil, and to deaden all other feelings but that of hatred for the\r\n  foreigners.\"\r\n\r\nWhen told that he was not alive at the time, he answered:\r\n\r\n  \"I cannot dispute that I was not living then, and I have been\r\n  genuinely sorry that I was not born in time to take part in that\r\n  movement; a regret which is diminished by what I have just heard.\r\n  I had always believed that the slavery against which we fought\r\n  lay abroad; I have just learned that it lay at home, and I am\r\n  not grateful for the explanation.\"\r\n\r\nThe ablest of the Liberal leaders was George v. Vincke; a member of an\r\nold Westphalian family, the son of a high official, he was a man of\r\nhonesty and independence, but both virtues were carried to excess; a\r\nborn leader of opposition, domineering, quarrelsome, ill to please, his\r\nshort, sturdy figure, his red face and red hair were rather those of a\r\npeasant than a nobleman, but his eloquence, his bitter invective, earned\r\nthe respect and even fear of his opponents. Among these Bismarck was to\r\nbe ranged; in these days began a rivalry which was not to cease till\r\nnearly twenty years later, when Vincke retired from the field and\r\nBismarck stood triumphant, the recognised ruler of the State. At this\r\ntime it required courage in the younger man to cross swords with the\r\nexperienced and powerful leader.\r\n\r\nVincke was a strong Liberal, but in the English rather than the Prussian\r\nsense; his constant theme was the rule of law; he had studied English\r\nhistory, for at that time all Liberals prepared themselves for their\r\npart by reading Hallam or Guizot and Dahlmann; he knew all about Pym and\r\nHampden, and wished to imitate them. The English Parliament had won its\r\npower by means of a Petition of Right and a Bill of Rights; he wished\r\nthey should do the same in Prussia; it escaped him that the English\r\ncould appeal to charters and ancient privileges, but that in Prussia the\r\nabsolute power of the King was the undisputed basis on which the whole\r\nState had been built up, and that every law to which they owed their\r\nliberty or their property derived its validity from the simple\r\nproclamation of the King.\r\n\r\nBismarck, if he had read less, understood better the characteristics of\r\nEngland, probably because he knew better the conditions of his own\r\ncountry. He rose to protest against these parallels with England;\r\nPrussia had its own problems which must be settled in its own way.\r\n\r\n  \"Parallels with foreign countries have always something\r\n  disagreeable.... At the Revolution, the English people were in a\r\n  very different condition from that of Prussia to-day; after a\r\n  century of revolution and civil war, it was in a position to be\r\n  able to give away a crown and add conditions which William of\r\n  Orange accepted. On the other hand, we are in possession of a\r\n  crown whose rights were actually unlimited, a crown held by the\r\n  grace not of the people but of God, and which of its own\r\n  free-will has given away to the people a portion of its\r\n  rights--an example rare in history.\"\r\n\r\nIt shows how strong upon him was the influence of his friends in\r\nPomerania that his longest and most important speech was in defence of\r\nthe Christian monarchy. The occasion was a proposal to increase the\r\nprivileges of the Jews. He said:\r\n\r\n  \"I am no enemy of the Jews; if they become my enemies I will\r\n  forgive them. Under certain circumstances I love them; I am ready\r\n  to grant them all rights but that of holding the magisterial\r\n  office in a Christian State. This they now claim; they demand to\r\n  become Landrath, General, Minister, yes even, under\r\n  circumstances, Minister of Religion and Education. I allow that\r\n  I am full of prejudices, which, as I have said, I have sucked in\r\n  with my mother's milk; I cannot argue them away; for if I think\r\n  of a Jew face to face with me as a representative of the King's\r\n  sacred Majesty, and I have to obey him, I must confess that I\r\n  should feel myself deeply broken and depressed; the sincere\r\n  self-respect with which I now attempt to fulfil my duties towards\r\n  the State would leave me. I share these feelings with the mass of\r\n  the lower strata of the people, and I am not ashamed of their\r\n  society.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he spoke of the Christian State:\r\n\r\n  \"It is as old as every European State; it is the ground in which\r\n  they have taken root; no State has a secure existence unless it\r\n  has a religious foundation. For me, the words, 'by the Grace of\r\n  God,' which Christian rulers add to their name, are no empty\r\n  phrase; I see in them a confession that the Princes desire to\r\n  wield the sceptre which God has given them according to the will\r\n  of God on earth. As the will of God I can only recognise that\r\n  which has been revealed in the Christian Gospel--I believe that\r\n  the realisation of Christian teaching is the end of the State; I\r\n  do not believe that we shall more nearly approach this end by the\r\n  help of the Jews.... If we withdraw this foundation, we retain in\r\n  a State nothing but an accidental aggregate of rights, a kind of\r\n  bulwark against the war of all against all, which ancient\r\n  philosophy has assumed. Therefore, gentlemen, do not let us spoil\r\n  the people of their Christianity; do not let us take from them\r\n  the belief that our legislation is drawn from the well of\r\n  Christianity, and that the State aims at the realisation of\r\n  Christianity even if it does not attain its end.\"\r\n\r\nWe can well understand how delighted Herr von Thadden was with his\r\npupil. \"With Bismarck I naturally will not attempt to measure myself,\"\r\nhe writes; \"in the last debates he has again said many admirable\r\nthings\"; and in another letter, \"I am quite enthusiastic for Otto\r\nBismarck.\" It was more important that the King felt as if these words\r\nhad been spoken out of his own heart.\r\n\r\nAmong his opponents, too, he had made his mark; they were never tired of\r\nrepeating well-worn jests about the medieval opinions which he had\r\nsucked in with his mother's milk.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session, he returned to Pomerania with fresh\r\nlaurels; he was now looked upon as the rising hope of the stern and\r\nunbending Tories. His marriage took place in August, and the young Hans\r\nKleist, a cousin of the bride, as he proposed the bridegroom's health,\r\nforetold that in their friend had arisen a new Otto of Saxony who would\r\ndo for his country all that his namesake had done eight hundred years\r\nbefore. Careless words spoken half in jest, which thirty years later\r\nKleist, then Over-President of the province, recalled when he proposed\r\nthe bridegroom's health at the marriage of Bismarck's eldest daughter.\r\nThe forecast had been more than fulfilled, but fulfilled at the cost of\r\nmany an early friendship; and all the glory of later years could never\r\nquite repay the happy confidence and intimacy of those younger days.\r\n\r\nFollowed by the good wishes of all their friends, Bismarck and his young\r\nwife started on their wedding tour, which took them through Austria to\r\nItaly. At Venice he came across the King of Prussia, who took the\r\nopportunity to have more than one conversation with the man who had\r\ndistinguished himself in the States General. At the beginning of the\r\nwinter they returned to Schoenhausen to settle down to a quiet country\r\nlife. Fate was to will it otherwise. The storm which had long been\r\ngathering burst over Europe. Bismarck was carried away by it; from\r\nhenceforth his life was entirely devoted to public duties, and we can\r\ncount by months the time he was able to spend with his wife at the old\r\nfamily house; more than forty years were to pass before he was able\r\nagain to enjoy the leisure of his early years.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which at the end of February broke out in Paris quickly\r\nspread to Germany; the ground was prepared and the news quickly came to\r\nhim, first of disorder in South Germany, then of the fall of the\r\nMinistry in Dresden and Munich; after a few days it was told that a\r\nrevolution had taken place in Vienna itself. The rising in Austria was\r\nthe signal for Berlin, and on the 18th of March the revolution broke out\r\nthere also. The King had promised to grant a Constitution; a fierce\r\nfight had taken place in the streets of the city between the soldiers\r\nand the people; the King had surrendered to the mob, and had ordered the\r\ntroops to withdraw from the city. He was himself almost a prisoner in\r\nhis castle protected only by a civilian National Guard. He was exposed\r\nto the insults of the crowd; his brother had had to leave the city and\r\nthe country. It is impossible to describe the enthusiasm and wild\r\ndelight with which the people of Germany heard of these events. Now the\r\npress was free, now they also were going to be free and great and\r\nstrong. All the resistance of authority was overthrown; nothing, it\r\nseemed, stood between them and the attainment of their ideal of a united\r\nand free Germany. They had achieved a revolution; they had become a\r\npolitical people; they had shewn themselves the equals of England and of\r\nFrance. They had liberty, and they would soon have a Constitution.\r\nBismarck did not share this feeling; he saw only that the monarchy which\r\nhe respected, and the King whom, with all his faults, he loved and\r\nhonoured, were humiliated and disgraced. This was worse than Jena. A\r\ndefeat on the field of battle can be avenged; here the enemies were his\r\nown countrymen; it was Prussian subjects who had made the King the\r\nlaughing-stock of Europe. Only a few months ago he had pleaded that they\r\nshould not lose that confidence between King and people which was the\r\nfinest tradition of the Prussian State; could this confidence ever be\r\nrestored when the blood of so many soldiers and citizens had been shed?\r\nHe felt as though someone had struck him in the face, for his country's\r\ndishonour was to him as his own; he became ill with gall and anger. He\r\nhad only two thoughts: first to restore to the King courage and\r\nconfidence, and then--revenge on the men who had done this thing. He at\r\nleast was not going to play with the revolution. He at once sat down and\r\nwrote to the King a letter full of ardent expressions of loyalty and\r\naffection, that he might know there still were men on whom he could\r\nrely. It is said that for months after, through all this terrible year,\r\nthe King kept it open by him on his writing-table. Then he hurried to\r\nBerlin, if necessary to defend him with the sword. This was not\r\nnecessary, but the situation was almost worse than he feared; the King\r\nwas safe, but he was safe because he had surrendered to the revolution;\r\nhe had proclaimed the fatal words that _Prussia was to be dissolved in\r\nGermany_.\r\n\r\nAt Potsdam Bismarck found his old friends of the Guard and the Court;\r\nthey were all in silent despair. What could they do to save the monarchy\r\nwhen the King himself had deserted their cause? Some there were who even\r\ntalked of seeking help from the Czar of Russia, who had offered to come\r\nto the help of the monarchy in Prussia and place himself at the head of\r\nthe Prussian army, even if necessary against their own King. There was\r\nalready a Liberal Ministry under Count Arnim, Bismarck's old chief at\r\nAachen; the Prussian troops were being sent to support the people of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein in their rebellion against the Danes; the Ministers\r\nfavoured the aspirations of Poland for self-government; in Prussia there\r\nwas to be a Constituent Assembly and a new Constitution drawn up by it.\r\nBismarck did what he could; he went down to Schoenhausen and began to\r\ncollect signatures for an address of loyalty to the King; he wished to\r\ninstil into him confidence by appealing to the loyalty of the country\r\nagainst the radicalism of the town. Then he hurried back to Berlin for\r\nthe meeting of the Estates General, which had been hastily summoned to\r\nprepare for the new elections. An address was proposed thanking the King\r\nfor the concessions he had made; Bismarck opposed it, but he stood\r\nalmost alone.\r\n\r\n  \"I have not changed my opinion,\" he said, \"in the last six\r\n  months; the past is buried, and I regret more bitterly than any\r\n  of you that no human power can reawaken it, now that the Crown\r\n  itself has cast the earth on its coffin.\"\r\n\r\nTwo men alone voted against the address--Bismarck and Herr von Thadden.\r\n\"It is easy to get fame nowadays,\" said the latter; \"a little courage is\r\nall one requires.\"\r\n\r\nCourage it did require; Berlin was terrorised; the new National Guard\r\nwas unable to maintain order; men scarcely dared to appear in the\r\nstreets in the ordinary dress of a gentleman. The city was full of\r\nPolish insurgents, many of whom had only just been released from prison.\r\nWhen the National Assembly came together, it became the organ of the\r\nextreme Republican party; all the more moderate men and more\r\ndistinguished had preferred to be elected for that general German\r\nAssembly which at the same time was sitting at Frankfort to create a new\r\nConstitution for the whole Confederation. How quickly had the balance of\r\nparties altered: Vincke, until a few months ago the leader of the\r\nLiberals, found himself at Frankfort regarded as an extreme\r\nConservative; and Frankfort was moderate compared to Berlin. At this\r\ntime an ordinary English Radical would have been looked upon in Germany\r\nas almost reactionary. Bismarck did not seek election for either of the\r\nAssemblies; he felt that he could do no good by taking part in the\r\ndeliberations of a Parliament, the very meeting of which seemed to him\r\nan offence against the laws and welfare of the State. He would indeed\r\nhave had no logical position; both Parliaments were Constituent\r\nAssemblies; it was the duty of the one to build up a new Germany, of the\r\nother a new Prussia; their avowed object was the regeneration of their\r\ncountry. Bismarck did not believe that Prussia wanted regenerating; he\r\nheld that the roots for the future greatness of the State must be found\r\nin the past. What happened to Germany he did not much care; all he saw\r\nwas that every proposal for the regeneration of Germany implied either a\r\ndissolution of Prussia, or the subjection of the Prussian King to the\r\norders of an alien Parliament.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer he did what he could; he contributed articles to the\r\nnewspapers attacking the Polish policy of the Government, and defending\r\nthe landlords and country gentry against the attacks made on them. As\r\nthe months went by, as the anarchy in Berlin increased, and the violence\r\nof the Assembly as well as the helplessness of the Government became\r\nmore manifest, he and some of his friends determined to make their\r\nvoices heard in a more organised way. It was at the house of his\r\nfather-in-law at Rheinfeld that he, Hans Kleist, and Herr von Below\r\ndetermined to call together a meeting of well-known men in Berlin, who\r\nshould discuss the situation and be a moral counterpoise to the\r\nmeetings of the National Assembly; for in that the Conservative party\r\nand even the Moderate Liberals were scarcely represented; if they did\r\nspeak they were threatened by the mob which encumbered the approaches to\r\nthe House. Of more permanent importance was the foundation of a\r\nnewspaper which should represent the principles of the Christian\r\nmonarchy, and in July appeared the first number of the _New Prussian\r\nGazette_, or, as it was to be more generally known, the _Kreuz Zeitung_,\r\nwhich was to give its name to the party of which it was the organ.\r\nBismarck was among the founders, among whom were also numbered Stahl,\r\nthe Gerlachs, and others of his older friends; he was a frequent\r\ncontributor, and when he was at Berlin was almost daily at the office;\r\nwhen he was in the country he contributed articles on the rural affairs\r\nwith which he was more specially qualified to deal.\r\n\r\nThese steps, of course, attracted the attention and the hostility of the\r\ndominant Liberal and Revolutionary parties; the _Junker_, as they were\r\ncalled, were accused of aiming at reaction and the restoration of the\r\nabsolute monarchy. As a matter of fact, this is what many of them\r\ndesired; they were, however, only doing their duty as members of\r\nsociety; it would have been mere cowardice and indolence had they\r\nremained inactive and seen all the institutions they valued overthrown\r\nwithout attempting to defend them. It required considerable courage in\r\nthe middle of so violent a crisis to come forward and attempt to stop\r\nthe revolution; it was a good example that they began to do so by\r\nconstitutional and legal means. They shewed that Prussia had an\r\naristocracy, and an aristocracy which was not frightened; deserted by\r\nthe King they acted alone; in the hour of greatest danger they founded a\r\nConservative party, and matters had come to this position that an\r\norganised Conservative party was the chief necessity of the time.\r\n\r\nAt first, however, their influence was small, for a monarchical party\r\nmust depend for its success on the adhesion of the King, and the King\r\nhad not yet resolved to separate himself from his Liberal advisers.\r\nBismarck was often at Court and seems to have had much influence; both\r\nto his other companions and to the King himself he preached always\r\ncourage and resolution; he spoke often to the King with great openness;\r\nhe was supported by Leopold von Gerlach, with whom at this time he\r\ncontracted a close intimacy. For long their advice was in vain, but\r\nin the autumn events occurred which shewed that some decision must be\r\ntaken: the mob of Berlin stormed the _Zeughaus_ where the arms\r\nwere kept; the Constitution of the Assembly was being drawn up so as to\r\nleave the King scarcely any influence in the State; a resolution was\r\npassed calling on the Ministers to request all officers to leave the\r\narmy who disliked the new order of things. The crisis was brought about\r\nby events in Vienna; in October the Austrian army under Jellachich\r\nand Windischgrätz stormed the city, proclaimed martial law, and forcibly\r\noverthrew the Revolutionary Government; the King of Prussia now summoned\r\nresolution to adopt a similar course. It is said that Bismarck suggested\r\nto him the names of the Ministers to whom the task should be entrusted.\r\nThe most important were Count Brandenburg, an uncle of the King's, and\r\nOtto v. Manteuffel, a member of the Prussian aristocracy, who with\r\nBismarck had distinguished himself in the Estates General. He seems to\r\nhave been constantly going about among the more influential men,\r\nencouraging them as he encouraged the King, and helping behind the scenes\r\nto prepare for the momentous step. Gerlach had suggested Bismarck's name\r\nas one of the Ministers, but the King rejected it, writing on the side of\r\nthe paper the characteristic words, \"Red reactionary; smells of blood;\r\nwill be useful later.\" Bismarck's language was of such a nature as to\r\nalarm even many of those who associated with him. Count Beust, the Saxon\r\nMinister, was at this time in Berlin and met Bismarck for the first time;\r\nthey were discussing the conduct of the Austrian Government in shooting\r\nRobert Blum, a leading demagogue who had been in Vienna during the siege.\r\nBeust condemned it as a political blunder. \"No, you are wrong,\" said\r\nBismarck; \"when I have my enemy in my power I must destroy him.\"\r\n\r\nThe event fully justified Bismarck's forecast that nothing was required\r\nbut courage and resolution. After Brandenburg had been appointed\r\nMinister, the Prussian troops under Wrangel again entered Berlin, a\r\nstate of siege was proclaimed, the Assembly was ordered to adjourn to\r\nBrandenburg; they refused and were at once ejected from their\r\nmeeting-place, and as a quorum was not found at Brandenburg, were\r\ndissolved. The Crown then of its own authority published a new\r\nConstitution and summoned a new Assembly to discuss and ratify it. Based\r\non the discipline of the army the King had regained his authority\r\nwithout the loss of a single life.\r\n\r\nBismarck stood for election in this new Assembly, for he could accept\r\nthe basis on which it had been summoned; he took his seat for the\r\ndistrict of the West Havel in which the old city of Brandenburg, the\r\noriginal capital of the Mark, was situated. He had come forward as an\r\nopponent of the Revolution. \"Everyone,\" he said in his election address,\r\n\"must support the Government in the course they have taken of combating\r\nthe Revolution which threatens us all.\" \"No transaction with the\r\nRevolution,\" was the watchword proposed in the manifesto of his party.\r\nHe appealed to the electors as one who would direct all his efforts to\r\nrestore the old bond of confidence between Crown and people. He kept his\r\npromise. In this Assembly the Extreme Left was still the predominant\r\nparty; in an address to the Crown they asked that the state of siege at\r\nBerlin should be raised, and that an amnesty to those who had fought on\r\nthe 18th of March should be proclaimed. Bismarck did not yet think that\r\nthe time for forgiveness had come; the struggle was indeed not yet over.\r\nHe opposed the first demand because, as he said, there was more danger\r\nto liberty of debate from the armed mob than there was from the Prussian\r\nsoldiers. In one of the most careful of his speeches he opposed the\r\namnesty. \"Amnesty,\" he said, \"was a right of the Crown, not of the\r\nAssembly\"; moreover the repeated amnesties were undermining in the\r\npeople the feeling of law; the opinion was being spread about that the\r\nlaw of the State rested on the barricades, that everyone who disliked a\r\nlaw or considered it unjust had the right to consider it as\r\nnon-existent. Who that has read the history of Europe during this year\r\ncan doubt the justice of the remark? Then he continues:\r\n\r\n  \"My third reason for voting against the amnesty is humanity. The\r\n  strife of principles which during this year has shattered Europe\r\n  to its foundations is one in which no compromise is possible.\r\n  They rest on opposite bases. The one draws its law from what is\r\n  called the will of the people, in truth, however, from the law of\r\n  the strongest on the barricades. The other rests on authority\r\n  created by God, an authority by the grace of God, and seeks its\r\n  development in organic connection with the existing and\r\n  constitutional legal status ... the decision on these principles\r\n  will come not by Parliamentary debate, not by majorities of\r\n  eleven votes; sooner or later the God who directs the battle will\r\n  cast his iron dice.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were greeted with applause, not only by the men who sat on\r\nhis side of the House, but by those opposite to him. The truth of them\r\nwas to be shewn by the events which were taking place at that very time.\r\nThey were spoken on the 22d of March. The next day was fought the battle\r\nof Novara and it seemed that the last hopes of the Italian patriots were\r\nshattered. Within a few months the Austrian army subdued with terrible\r\nvengeance the rising in Lombardy and Venetia; Hungary was prostrate\r\nbefore the troops whom the Czar sent to help the young Austrian\r\nEmperor, and the last despairing outbreak of rebellion in Saxony and in\r\nBaden was to be subdued by the Prussian army. The Revolution had failed\r\nand it had raised up, as will always happen, a military power, harder,\r\ncrueller, and more resolute than that it had overthrown. The control\r\nover Europe had passed out of the hands of Metternich and Louis Philippe\r\nto fall into those of Nicholas, Schwarzenberg, and Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia the King used his power with moderation, the conflict of\r\nparties was continued within legal limits and under constitutional\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament which still claimed that control over the executive\r\ngovernment which all Parliaments of the Revolution had exercised, was\r\ndissolved. A new Assembly met in August; the King had of his own\r\nauthority altered the electoral law and the new Parliament showed a\r\nconsiderable majority belonging to the more moderate Liberal party.\r\nBismarck retained his old seat. He still found much to do; his influence\r\nwas increasing; he opposed the doctrines of the more moderate Liberalism\r\nwith the same energy with which he had attacked the extreme Revolution.\r\nThe most important debates were those concerning the Constitution; he\r\ntook part in them, especially opposing the claim of the Parliament to\r\nrefuse taxes. He saw that if the right was given to the Lower House of\r\nvoting the taxes afresh every year they would be able to establish a\r\ncomplete control over the executive government; this he did not wish. He\r\nwas willing that they should have the right of discussing and rejecting\r\nany new taxes and also, in agreement with the Crown and the Upper House,\r\nof determining the annual Budget. It was maintained by the Liberals that\r\nthe right to reject supplies every year was an essential part of a\r\nconstitutional system; they appealed to the practice in England and to\r\nthe principles adopted in the French and Belgian Constitutions. Their\r\nargument was that this practice which had been introduced in other\r\ncountries must be adopted also in Prussia. It was just one of those\r\narguments which above all offended Bismarck's Prussian patriotism. Why\r\nshould Prussia imitate other countries? Why should it not have its own\r\nConstitution in its own way? Constitution, as he said, was the _mot\r\nd'ordre_ of the day, the word which men used when they were in want of\r\nan argument. \"In Prussia that only is constitutional which arises from\r\nthe Prussian Constitution; whatever be constitutional in Belgium, or in\r\nFrance, in Anhalt Dessau, or there where the morning red of Mecklenburg\r\nfreedom shines, here that alone is constitutional which rests on the\r\nPrussian Constitution.\" If he defended the prerogative of the Crown he\r\ndefended the Constitution of his country. A constitution is the\r\ncollection of rules and laws by which the action of the king is\r\ngoverned; a state without a constitution is a mere Oriental despotism\r\nwhere each arbitrary whim of the king is transmuted into action; this\r\nwas not what Bismarck desired or defended; there was no danger of this\r\nin Prussia. He did not even oppose changes in the law and practice of\r\nthe Constitution; what he did oppose was the particular change which\r\nwould transfer the sovereignty to an elected House of Parliament. \"It\r\nhas been maintained,\" he once said, \"that a constitutional king cannot\r\nbe a king by the Grace of God; on the contrary he is it above all\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nThe references to foreign customs were indeed one of the most curious\r\npractices of the time; the matter was once being discussed whether the\r\nCrown had the power to declare a state of siege without the assent of\r\nthe Chambers; most speakers attempted to interpret the text of the\r\nPrussian Constitution by precedents derived from the practice in France\r\nand England; we find the Minister of Justice defending his action on the\r\nground of an event in the French Revolution, and Lothar Bucher, one of\r\nthe ablest of the Opposition, complained that not enough attention had\r\nbeen paid to the procedure adopted in England for repealing the _Habeas\r\nCorpus Act_, entirely ignoring the fact that there was no Habeas Corpus\r\nAct in Prussia. We can easily understand how repulsive this was to a man\r\nwho, like Bismarck, wished nothing more than that his countrymen should\r\ncopy, not the details of the English Constitution, but the proud\r\nself-reliance which would regard as impertinent an application of\r\nforeign notions.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause for this peculiarity was the desire of the Liberal party\r\nto attain that degree of independence and personal liberty which was\r\nenjoyed in England or France; the easiest way to do this seemed to be to\r\ncopy their institutions. There was, however, another reason: the study\r\nof Roman law in Germany in which they had been educated had accustomed\r\nthem to look for absolute principles of jurisprudence which might be\r\napplied to the legislation of all countries; when, therefore, they\r\nturned their minds to questions of politics, they looked for absolute\r\nprinciples of constitutional government, on which, as on a law of\r\nnature, their own institutions might be built up. To find these they\r\nanalysed the English Constitution, for England was the classical land of\r\nrepresentative government; they read its rules as they would the\r\ninstitutions of a Roman Jurisconsult and used them to cast light on the\r\ndark places of their own law. Bismarck did not share this type of\r\nthought; his mind was rather of the English cast; he believed the old\r\nPrussian Constitution was as much a natural growth as that of England,\r\nand decided dark points by reference to older practice as an Englishman\r\nwould search for precedents in the history of his own country.\r\n\r\nAt that time the absolute excellence of a democratic constitution was a\r\ndogma which few cared to dispute; it appeared to his hearers as a mere\r\nparadox when Bismarck pointed out how little evidence there was that a\r\ngreat country could prosper under the government of a Parliament elected\r\nby an extended franchise. Strictly speaking, there was no evidence from\r\nexperience; France, as he said, was the parent of all these theories,\r\nbut the example of France was certainly not seductive. \"I see in the\r\npresent circumstances of France nothing to encourage us to put the\r\n_Nessus_ robe of French political teaching over our healthy body.\" (This\r\nwas in September, 1849, when the struggle between the Prince President\r\nand the Assembly was already impending.) The Liberals appealed to\r\nBelgium; it had, at least, stood the storm of the last year, but so had\r\nRussia, and, after all, the Belgian Constitution was only eighteen years\r\nold, \"an admirable age for ladies but not for constitutions.\" And then\r\nthere was England.\r\n\r\n  \"England governs itself, although the Lower House has the right\r\n  of refusing taxes. The references to England are our misfortune;\r\n  give us all that is English which we have not, give us English\r\n  fear of God and English reverence before the law, the whole\r\n  English Constitution, but above all the complete independence of\r\n  English landed property, English wealth and English common-sense,\r\n  especially an English Lower House, in short everything which we\r\n  have not got, then I will say, you can govern us after the\r\n  English fashion.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. How could they appeal to England as a proof that a\r\ndemocratic Parliament was desirable? England had not grown great under a\r\ndemocratic but under an aristocratic constitution.\r\n\r\n  \"English reform is younger than the Belgian Constitution; we have\r\n  still to wait and see whether this reformed Constitution will\r\n  maintain itself for centuries as did the earlier rule of the\r\n  English aristocracy.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in Bismarck's opinion, it was not likely to do so, we see a few\r\nyears later; with most Continental critics of English institutions, he\r\nbelieved that the Reform Bill had destroyed the backbone of the English\r\nConstitution. In 1857 he wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"They have lost the 'inherited wisdom' since the Reform Bill;\r\n  they maintain a coarse and violent selfishness and the ignorance\r\n  of Continental relations.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not merely aristocratic prejudice; it was a wise caution to bid\r\nhis countrymen pause before they adopted from foreign theorists a form\r\nof government so new and untried, and risked for the sake of an\r\nexperiment the whole future of Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn later years Bismarck apologised for many of the speeches which he\r\nmade at this period: \"I was a terrible Junker in those days,\" he said;\r\nand biographers generally speak of them as though they required\r\njustification or apology. There seems no reason for this. It would have\r\nbeen impossible for him, had he at that time been entrusted with the\r\ngovernment of the State, entirely to put into practice what he had said\r\nfrom his place in the Chamber. But he was not minister; he was only a\r\nparty leader; his speeches were, as they were intended to be, party\r\nspeeches; they had something of the exaggeration which conflict always\r\nproduces. They were, moreover, opposition speeches, for he was\r\naddressing not so much the Government as the Chamber and the country,\r\nand in them the party to which he belonged was a very small minority.\r\nBut why was there not to be a Conservative party in Prussia?\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for the proper development of constitutional life that\r\nthe dominant Liberal doctrines should be opposed by this bold criticism.\r\nBismarck was only doing what in England was done by the young Disraeli,\r\nby Carlyle, and by Ruskin; the world would not be saved by\r\nconstitutional formulæ.\r\n\r\nThere were some of his party whose aims went indeed beyond what may be\r\nconsidered morally legitimate and politically practicable. The Gerlachs\r\nand many of their friends, and the purely military party which was\r\nheaded by Prince Charles Frederick, the King's youngest brother, desired\r\nto do away with the Constitution, to dismiss the Parliament, and to\r\nrestore the absolute monarchy in a form which would have been more\r\nextreme than that which it had had since 1815. The King himself\r\nsympathised with their wishes and he probably would have acted according\r\nto them were it not that he had sworn to maintain the Constitution. He\r\nwas a religious man and he respected his oath. There does not appear any\r\nevidence that Bismarck wished for extreme action of this kind. Even in\r\nhis private correspondence, at least in that part of it which has been\r\npublished, one finds no desire to see Prussia entirely without a\r\nParliament. It was a very different thing to wish as he did that the\r\nduties of the Parliament should be strictly limited and that they should\r\nnot be allowed completely to govern the State. We must always remember\r\nhow much he owed to representative assemblies. Had the Estates General\r\nnever been summoned, had the Revolution never taken place, he would\r\nprobably have passed his life as a country gentleman, often discontented\r\nwith the Government of the country but entirely without influence. He\r\nowed to Parliament his personal reputation, but he owed to it something\r\nmore than that. Up to 1847 the only public career open to a Prussian\r\nsubject was the Civil Service; it was from them that not only the\r\nsubordinate officials but the Ministers of the State were selected. Now\r\nwe have seen that Bismarck had tried the Civil Service and deliberately\r\nretired from it. The hatred of bureaucracy he never overcame, even when\r\nhe was at the head of the Prussian State. It arose partly from the\r\nnatural opposition between the nobleman and the clerk. Bismarck felt in\r\nthis like Stein, the greatest of his predecessors, who though he had\r\ntaken service under the Prussian Crown never overcame his hatred of\r\n\"_the animal with a pen_\" as he called Prussian Civil Servants, and shed\r\ntears of indignation when he was first offered a salary. Bismarck was\r\nnever a great nobleman like Stein and he did not dislike receiving a\r\nsalary; but he felt that the Civil Servants were the enemies of the\r\norder to which he belonged. He speaks a few years later of \"the biting\r\nacid of Prussian legislation which in a single generation can reduce a\r\nmediatised Prince to an ordinary voter.\" He is never tired of saying\r\nthat it was the bureaucracy which was the real introducer of the\r\nRevolution into Prussia. In one of his speeches he defends himself and\r\nhis friends against the charge of being enemies to freedom; \"that they\r\nwere not,\" he says;\r\n\r\n  \"Absolutism with us is closely connected with the omnipotence of\r\n  the _Geheimrath_ and the conceited omniscience of the Professors\r\n  who sit behind the green table, a product, and I venture to\r\n  maintain a necessary product, of the Prussian method of\r\n  education. This product, the bureaucracy, I have never loved.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, as he often does, he maintains that the Prussian Parliament does\r\nnot represent the people, he is thinking of the predominance among them\r\nof officials, for we must always remember that many of the extreme\r\nLiberal party and some of their most active leaders were men who were\r\nactually at that time in the service of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIt was the introduction of a Representative Assembly that for the first\r\ntime in Prussian history made possible a Conservative opposition against\r\nthe Liberalism of the Prussian Government. There are two kinds of\r\nLiberalism. In one sense of the word it means freedom of debate, freedom\r\nof the press, the power of the individual as against the Government,\r\nindependence of character, and personal freedom. Of Liberalism in this\r\nsense of the word there was indeed little in the Prussian Government.\r\nBut Liberalism also meant the overthrow of the old established\r\ninstitutions inherited from the Middle Ages, especially the destruction\r\nof all privileges held by the nobility; it meant on the Continent\r\nopposition to all form of dogmatic religious teaching; it meant the\r\ncomplete subjection of the Church to the State; it meant the abolition\r\nof all local distinctions and the introduction of a uniform system of\r\ngovernment chiefly imitated from French institutions. It was in this\r\nsense of the word that, with the exception of the first few years of the\r\nreign of Frederick William IV., the Prussian Government had been\r\nLiberal, and it was this Liberalism which Bismarck and his friends hated\r\nalmost as much as they did the Liberalism of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe clearest instance of his attitude on such matters is to be found in\r\nhis opposition to the Bill introduced for making civil marriage\r\ncompulsory. He opposed it in a speech which was many years later to be\r\nquoted against him when he himself introduced a measure almost identical\r\nwith that which he now opposed. Civil marriage, he said, was a foreign\r\ninstitution, an imitation of French legislation; it would simply serve\r\nto undermine the belief in Christianity among the people, \"and\" he said,\r\n\"I have seen many friends of the illumination during the last year or\r\ntwo come to recognise that a certain degree of positive Christianity is\r\nnecessary for the common man, if he is not to become dangerous to human\r\nsociety.\" The desire for introducing this custom was merely an instance\r\nof the constant wish to imitate what is foreign.\r\n\r\n  \"It would be amusing,\" he said, \"if it were not just our own\r\n  country which was subjected to these experiments of French\r\n  charlatanism. In the course of the discussion it has often been\r\n  said by gentlemen standing in this place that Europe holds us for\r\n  a people of thinkers. Gentlemen, that was in old days. The\r\n  popular representation of the last two years has deprived us of\r\n  this reputation. They have shown to a disappointed Europe only\r\n  translators of French stucco but no original thinkers. It may be\r\n  that when civil marriage also rejoices in its majority, the\r\n  people will have their eyes opened to the swindle to which they\r\n  have been sacrificed; when one after another the old Christian\r\n  fundamental rights have been taken from them: the right to be\r\n  governed by Christian magistrates; the right to know that they\r\n  have secured to their children a Christian education in schools\r\n  which Christian parents are compelled to maintain and to use;\r\n  the right of being married in the Christian fashion which his\r\n  faith requires from everyone, without being dependent on\r\n  constitutional ceremonies. If we go on in this way I hope still\r\n  to see the day when the fool's ship of the time will be wrecked\r\n  on the rock of the Christian Church; for the belief in the\r\n  revealed Word of God still stands firmer among the people than\r\n  the belief in the saving power of any article of the\r\n  Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way he was able from his place in Parliament to criticise\r\nthe proposals of the Government for freeing the peasants from those\r\npayments in kind, and personal service which in some of the provinces\r\nstill adhered to their property; he attacked their financial proposals;\r\nhe exposed the injustice of the land tax; he defended the manorial\r\njurisdiction of the country gentlemen. Especially he defended the nobles\r\nof Prussia themselves, a class against whom so many attacks had been\r\nmade. He pointed out that by them and by their blood the Prussian State\r\nhad been built up; the Prussian nobles were, he maintained, not, as so\r\noften was said, unpopular; a third of the House belonged to them; they\r\nwere not necessarily opposed to freedom; they were, at least, the truest\r\ndefenders of the State. Let people not confuse patriotism and\r\nLiberalism. Who had done more for the true political independence of the\r\nState, that independence without which all freedom was impossible, than\r\nthe Prussian nobles? At the end of the Seven Years' War boys had stood\r\nat the head of the army, the only survivors of their families. The\r\nprivileges of the nobles had been taken from them, but they had not\r\nbehaved like the democrats; their loyalty to the State had never\r\nwavered; they had not even formed a Fronde. He was not ashamed of the\r\nname of Junker: \"We will bring the name to glory and honour,\" were\r\nalmost the last words he spoke in Parliament.\r\n\r\nBismarck soon became completely at home in the House. Notwithstanding\r\nthe strength of his opinions and the vigour with which he gave\r\nexpression to them, he was not unpopular, even among his opponents. He\r\nwas always a gentleman and a man of the world; he did not dislike mixing\r\nwith men of all classes and all parties; he had none of that stiffness\r\nand hauteur which many of his friends had acquired from their military\r\npursuits. His relations with his opponents are illustrated by an\r\nanecdote of which there are many versions. He found himself one day\r\nwhile in the refreshment room standing side by side with d'Ester, one of\r\nthe most extreme of the Republican party. They fell into conversation,\r\nand d'Ester suggested that they should make a compact and, whichever\r\nparty succeeded in the struggle for power, they should each agree to\r\nspare the other. If the Republicans won, Bismarck should not be\r\nguillotined; if the monarchists, d'Ester should not be hung. \"No,\"\r\nanswered Bismarck, \"that is no use; if you come into power, life would\r\nnot be worth living. There must be hanging, but courtesy to the foot of\r\nthe gallows.\"\r\n\r\nIf he was in after years to become known as the great adversary of\r\nParliamentary government, this did not arise from any incapacity to\r\nhold his own in Parliamentary debate. He did not indeed aim at oratory;\r\nthen, as in later years, he always spoke with great contempt of men who\r\ndepended for power on their rhetorical ability. He was himself deficient\r\nin the physical gifts of a great speaker; powerful as was his frame, his\r\nvoice was thin and weak. He had nothing of the actor in him; he could\r\nnot command the deep voice, the solemn tones, the imposing gestures, the\r\nOlympian mien by which men like Waldeck and Radowitz and Gagern\r\ndominated and controlled their audience. His own mind was essentially\r\ncritical; he appealed more to the intellect than the emotions. His\r\nspeeches were always controversial, but he was an admirable debater. It\r\nis curious to see how quickly he adopts the natural Parliamentary tone.\r\nHis speeches are all subdued in tone and conversational in manner. Many\r\nof them were very carefully prepared, for though he did not generally\r\nwrite them out, he said them over and over again to himself or to\r\nKleist, with whom he lived in Berlin. They are entirely unlike any other\r\nspeeches--he has, in fact, in them, as in his letters, added a new\r\nchapter to the literature of his country, hitherto so poor in prose.\r\n\r\nThey shew a vivid imagination and an almost unequalled power of\r\nillustration. The thought is always concrete, and he is never satisfied\r\nwith the vague ideas and abstract conceptions which so easily moved his\r\ncontemporaries. No speeches, either in English or in German, preserve so\r\nmuch of their freshness. He is almost the only Parliamentary orator\r\nwhose speeches have become to some extent a popular book; no other\r\norator has enriched the language as he has done with new phrases and\r\nimages. The great characteristic of his speeches, as of his letters, is\r\nthe complete absence of affectation and the very remarkable intellectual\r\nhonesty. They are often deficient in order and arrangement; he did not\r\nexcel in the logical exposition of a connected argument, but he never\r\nwas satisfied till he had presented the idea which influenced him in\r\nwords so forcible and original that it was impressed on the minds of his\r\naudience, and he was often able to find expressions which will not be\r\nforgotten so long as the German language is spoken.\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine that under other circumstances, or in another\r\ncountry, he would have risen to power and held office as a Parliamentary\r\nMinister. He often appeals to the practice and traditions of the English\r\nParliament, and there are few Continental statesmen who would have been\r\nso completely at home in the English House of Commons; he belonged to\r\nthe class of men from whom so many of the great English statesmen had\r\ncome and whom he himself describes:\r\n\r\n  \"What with us is lacking is the whole class which in England\r\n  carries on politics, the class of gentlemen who are well-to-do\r\n  and therefore Conservative, who are independent of material\r\n  interests and whose whole education is directed towards making\r\n  them English statesmen, and the object of whose life is to take\r\n  part in the Commonwealth of England.\"\r\n\r\nThey were the class to whom he belonged, and he would gladly have taken\r\npart in a Parliamentary government of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of his position arose from the fact that he was really\r\nacquainted with and represented the inhabitants of only one-half of the\r\nmonarchy. So long as he is dealing with questions of landed property, or\r\nof the condition of the peasants, he has a minute and thorough\r\nknowledge. He did not always, however, avoid the danger of speaking as\r\nthough Prussia consisted entirely of agriculturists. The great\r\ndifficulty then as now of governing the State, was that it consisted of\r\ntwo parts: the older provinces, almost entirely agricultural, where the\r\nland was held chiefly by the great nobles, and the new provinces, the\r\nRhine and Westphalia, where there was a large and growing industrial\r\npopulation. To the inhabitants of these provinces Bismarck's constant\r\nappeal to the old Prussian traditions and to the achievements of the\r\nPrussian nobility could have little meaning. What did the citizens of\r\nCologne and Aachen care about the Seven Years' War? If their ancestors\r\ntook part in the war, it would be as enemies of the Kings of Prussia.\r\nWhen Bismarck said that they were Prussians, and would remain Prussian,\r\nhe undoubtedly spoke the opinion of the Mark and of Pomerania. But the\r\ninhabitants of the Western Provinces still felt and thought rather as\r\nGermans than as Prussians; they had scarcely been united with the\r\nmonarchy thirty years; they were not disloyal, but they were quite\r\nprepared--nay, they wished to see Prussia dissolved in Germany. No one\r\ncan govern Prussia unless he is able to reconcile to his policy these\r\ntwo different classes in the State. It was this which the Prussian\r\nConservatives, to which Bismarck at that time belonged, have always\r\nfailed to do. The Liberals whom he opposed failed equally. In later\r\nyears he was very nearly to succeed in a task which might appear almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n1849-1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck, however, did not confine himself to questions of\r\nconstitutional reform and internal government. He often spoke on the\r\nforeign policy of the Government, and it is in these speeches that he\r\nshews most originality.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution in Germany, as in Italy, had two sides; it was Liberal,\r\nbut it was also National. The National element was the stronger and more\r\ndeep-seated. The Germans felt deeply the humiliation to which they were\r\nexposed owing to the fact that they did not enjoy the protection of a\r\npowerful Government; they wished to belong to a national State, as\r\nFrenchmen, Englishmen, and Russians did. It was the general hope that\r\nthe period of revolution might be used for establishing a government to\r\nwhich the whole of Germany would pay obedience. This was the task of the\r\nConstituent Assembly, which since the spring of 1848 had with the\r\npermission of the Governments been sitting at Frankfort. Would they be\r\nable to succeed where the diplomatists of Vienna had failed? They had\r\nat least good-will, but it was to be shewn that something more than\r\nhonest endeavour was necessary. There were three great difficulties with\r\nwhich they had to contend. The first was the Republican party, the men\r\nwho would accept no government but a Republic, and who wished to found\r\nthe new state by insurrection. They were a small minority of the German\r\npeople; several attempts at insurrection organised by them were\r\nsuppressed, and they were outvoted in the Assembly. The second\r\ndifficulty was Austria. A considerable portion of Germany was included\r\nin the Austrian Empire. If the whole of Germany were to be included in\r\nthe new State which they hoped to found, then part of the Austrian\r\nEmpire would have to be separated from the rest, subjected to different\r\nlaws and a different government; nothing would remain but a personal\r\nunion between the German and Slavonic provinces. The Government of\r\nAustria, after it had recovered its authority at the end of 1848,\r\nrefused to accept this position, and published a new Constitution,\r\nbinding all the provinces together in a closer union. The Assembly at\r\nFrankfort had no power to coerce the Emperor of Austria; they therefore\r\nadopted the other solution, viz.: that the rest of Germany was to be\r\nreconstituted, and the Austrian provinces left out. The question,\r\nhowever, then arose: Would Austria accept this--would she allow a new\r\nGermany to be created in which she had no part? Surely not, if she was\r\nable to prevent it. The third difficulty was the relation between the\r\nindividual States and the new central authority. It is obvious that\r\nwhatever powers were given to the new Government would be taken away\r\nfrom the Princes of the individual States, who hitherto had enjoyed\r\ncomplete sovereignty. Those people who in Germany were much influenced\r\nby attachment to the existing governments, and who wished to maintain\r\nthe full authority of the Princes and the local Parliaments, were called\r\n_Particularists_. During the excitement of the Revolution they had been\r\nalmost entirely silenced. With the restoration of order and authority\r\nthey had regained their influence. It was probable that many of the\r\nStates would refuse to accept the new Constitution unless they were\r\ncompelled to do so. Where was the power to do this? There were many in\r\nthe National Assembly who wished to appeal to the power of the people,\r\nand by insurrection and barricades compel all the Princes to accept the\r\nnew Constitution. There was only one other power in Germany which could\r\ndo the work, and that was the Prussian army. Would the King of Prussia\r\naccept this task?\r\n\r\nThe German Constitution was completed in March, 1849. By the exercise of\r\nmuch tact and great personal influence, Heinrich von Gagern, the\r\nPresident of the Assembly and the leader of the Moderate party in it,\r\nhad procured a majority in favour of an hereditary monarchy, and the\r\nKing of Prussia was elected to the post of first German Emperor. At the\r\nbeginning of April there arrived in Berlin the deputation which was to\r\noffer to him the crown, and on his answer depended the future of\r\nGermany. Were he to accept, he would then have undertaken to put\r\nhimself at the head of the revolutionary movement; it would be his duty\r\nto compel all the other States to accept the new Constitution, and, if\r\nnecessary, to defend it on the field of battle against Austria. Besides\r\nthis he would have to govern not only Prussia but Germany; to govern it\r\nunder a Constitution which gave almost all the power to a Parliament\r\nelected by universal suffrage, and in which he had only a suspensive\r\nveto. Can we be surprised that he refused the offer? He refused it on\r\nthe ground that he could not accept universal suffrage, and also because\r\nthe title and power of German Emperor could not be conferred on him by a\r\npopular assembly; he could only accept it from his equals, the German\r\nPrinces.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the King was discussed in the Prussian Assembly, and an\r\naddress moved declaring that the Frankfort Constitution was in legal\r\nexistence, and requesting the King to accept the offer. It was on this\r\noccasion that Bismarck for the first time came forward as the leader of\r\na small party on the Extreme Right. He at once rose to move the previous\r\nquestion. He denied to the Assembly even the right of discussing this\r\nmatter which belonged to the prerogative of the King.\r\n\r\nHe was still more strongly opposed to the acceptance of the offered\r\ncrown. He saw only that the King of Prussia would be subjected to a\r\nParliamentary Assembly, that his power of action would be limited. The\r\nmotto of his speech was that Prussia must remain Prussia. \"The crown of\r\nFrankfort,\" he said, \"may be very bright, but the gold which gives\r\ntruth to its brilliance has first to be won by melting down the\r\nPrussian crown.\" His speech caused great indignation; ten thousand\r\ncopies of it were printed to be distributed among the electors so as to\r\nshow them the real principles and objects of the reactionary party.\r\n\r\nHis opposition to any identification of Prussia and Germany was\r\nmaintained when the Prussian Government itself took the initiative and\r\nproposed its own solution. During the summer of 1849, the Prussian\r\nprogramme was published. The Government invited the other States of\r\nGermany to enter into a fresh union; the basis of the new Constitution\r\nwas to be that of Frankfort, but altered so far as might be found\r\nnecessary, and the union was to be a voluntary one. The King in order to\r\ncarry out this policy appointed as one of his Ministers Herr von\r\nRadowitz. He was a man of the highest character and extreme ability. An\r\nofficer by profession, he was distinguished by the versatility of his\r\ninterests and his great learning. The King found in him a man who shared\r\nhis own enthusiasm for letters. He had been a member of the Parliament\r\nat Frankfort, and had taken a leading part among the extreme\r\nConservatives; a Roman Catholic, he had come forward in defence of\r\nreligion and order against the Liberals and Republicans; a very eloquent\r\nspeaker, by his earnestness and eloquence he was able for a short time\r\nto give new life to the failing hopes of the German patriots.\r\n\r\nBismarck always looked on the new Minister with great dislike. Radowitz,\r\nindeed, hated the Revolution as much as he did; he was a zealous and\r\npatriotic Prussian; but there was a fundamental difference in the nature\r\nof the two men. Radowitz wished to reform Germany by moral influence.\r\nBismarck did not believe in the possibility of this. To this perhaps we\r\nmust add some personal feeling. The Ministry had hitherto consisted\r\nalmost entirely of men who were either personal friends of Bismarck, or\r\nwhom he had recommended to the King. With Radowitz there entered into it\r\na man who was superior to all of them in ability, and over whom Bismarck\r\ncould not hope to have any influence. Bismarck's distrust, which\r\namounted almost to hatred, depended, however, on his fear that the new\r\npolicy would bring about the ruin of Prussia. He took the extreme\r\nParticularist view; he had no interest in Germany outside Prussia;\r\nWürtemberg and Bavaria were to him foreign States. In all these\r\nproposals for a new Constitution he saw only that Prussia would be\r\nrequired to sacrifice its complete independence; that the King of\r\nPrussia would become executor for the decrees of a popular and alien\r\nParliament. They were asked to cease to be Prussians in order that they\r\nmight become Germans. This Bismarck refused to do. \"Prussians we are,\"\r\nhe said, \"and Prussians we will remain.\" He had no sympathy with this\r\nidea of a United Germany which was so powerful at the time; there was\r\nonly one way in which he was willing that Germany should be united, and\r\nthat was according to the example which Frederick the Great had set. The\r\nideals of the German nation were represented by Arndt's famous song,\r\n\"Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?\" The fatherland of the Germans was not\r\nSuabia or Prussia, not Austria or Bavaria, it was the whole of Germany\r\nwherever the German tongue was spoken. From this Bismarck deliberately\r\ndissociated himself. \"I have never heard,\" he said, \"a Prussian soldier\r\nsinging, 'Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?'\" The new flag of Germany was\r\nto be the German tricolour, black and white and gold.\r\n\r\n  \"The Prussian soldiers,\" cried Bismarck, \"have no tricoloured\r\n  enthusiasm; among them you will find, as little as in the rest of\r\n  the Prussian people, the desire for a national regeneration; they\r\n  are contented with the name of Prussia, and proud of the name of\r\n  Prussia. These troops follow the black and white flag, not the\r\n  tricolour; under the black and white they die with joy for their\r\n  country. The tricolour they have learnt since the 18th of March\r\n  to look on as the colours of their foes.\"\r\n\r\nThese words aroused intense indignation. One of the speakers who\r\nfollowed referred to him as the Prodigal Son of the German Fatherland,\r\nwho had deserted his father's house. Bismarck repudiated the epithet. \"I\r\nam not a prodigal son,\" he said; \"my father's house is Prussia and I\r\nhave never left it.\" He could not more clearly repudiate the title\r\nGerman. The others were moved by enthusiasm for an idea, he by loyalty\r\nto an existing State.\r\n\r\nNothing was sound, he said, in Germany, except the old Prussian\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n  \"What has preserved us is that which is specifically Prussian. It\r\n  was the remnant of the _Stock-Preussenthum_ which has survived\r\n  the Revolution, the Prussian army, the Prussian treasure, the\r\n  fruits of many years of intelligent Prussian administration, and\r\n  the living co-operation between King and people. It was the\r\n  attachment of the Prussian people to their hereditary dynasty,\r\n  the old Prussian virtues of honour, loyalty, obedience, and the\r\n  courage which, emanating from the officers who form its bone and\r\n  marrow, permeates the army down to the youngest recruit.\"\r\n\r\nHe reminded the House how the Assembly at Frankfort had only been saved\r\nfrom the insurgent mob by a Prussian regiment, and now it was proposed\r\nto weaken and destroy all these Prussian institutions in order to change\r\nthem into a democratic Germany. He was asked to assent to a Constitution\r\nin which the Prussian Government would sink to the level of a provincial\r\ncouncil, under the guidance of an Imperial Ministry which itself would\r\nbe dependent on a Parliament in which the Prussian interests would be in\r\na minority. The most important and honourable duties of the Prussian\r\nParliament would be transferred to a general Parliament; the King would\r\nlose his veto; he would be compelled against his will to assent to laws\r\nhe disliked; even the Prussian army would be no longer under his sole\r\ncommand. What recompense were they to gain for this?\r\n\r\n  \"The pleasant consciousness of having followed an unselfish and\r\n  noble policy; of having satisfied the requirements of a national\r\n  regeneration; of having carried out the historical task of\r\n  Prussia, or some such vague expression.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he contrasted what would have been a true Prussian policy, a\r\npolicy which Frederick the Great might have followed.\r\n\r\n  \"He would have known that now as in the day of our fathers the\r\n  sound of the trumpets which summoned them to their sovereign's\r\n  flag has not lost its power for Prussian ears; he would have had\r\n  the choice either of joining our old comrade Austria, and\r\n  undertaking the brilliant part which the Emperor of Russia has\r\n  played, and destroying the cause of the Revolution, or by the\r\n  same right by which he took Silesia, he might, after refusing to\r\n  accept the crown, have ordered the Germans what constitution they\r\n  should have, and thrown the sword into the scale; then Prussia\r\n  would have been in the position to win for Germany its place in\r\n  the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n  \"We all wish the same. We all wish that the Prussian eagle should\r\n  spread out his wings as guardian and ruler from the Memel to the\r\n  Donnersberg, but free will we have him, not bound by a new\r\n  Regensburg Diet. Prussians we are and Prussians will we remain; I\r\n  know that in these words I speak the confession of the Prussian\r\n  army and the majority of my fellow-countrymen, and I hope to God\r\n  that we will still long remain Prussian when this sheet of paper\r\n  is forgotten like a withered autumn leaf.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy of Radowitz was doomed to failure, not so much because of any\r\ninherent weakness in it, but because Prussia was not strong enough to\r\ndefend herself against all the enemies she had called up. The other\r\nCourts of Germany were lukewarm, Austria was extremely hostile. The\r\nKings of Hanover and Saxony retreated from the alliance on the ground\r\nthat they would enter the union only if the whole of Germany joined;\r\nBavaria had refused to do so; in fact the two other Kings had privately\r\nused all their influence to prevent Bavaria from joining, in order that\r\nthey might always have an excuse for seceding. Prussia was, therefore,\r\nleft surrounded by twenty-eight of the smaller States. A Parliament from\r\nthem was summoned to meet at Erfurt in order to discuss the new\r\nConstitution. Bismarck was elected a member of it; he went there\r\navowedly to protect the Prussian interests. He had demanded from the\r\nGovernment that at least the Constitution agreed on in Erfurt should\r\nagain be submitted to the Prussian Chamber; he feared that many of the\r\nmost important Prussian rights might be sacrificed. His request was\r\nrefused, for it was obvious that if, after the Parliament of Erfurt had\r\ncome to some conclusion, the new Constitution was to be referred back\r\nagain to the twenty-eight Parliaments of the allied States, the new\r\nunion would never come into effect at all. It is curious here to find\r\nBismarck using the rights of the Prussian Parliament as a weapon to\r\nmaintain the complete independence of Prussia. Sixteen years later, when\r\nhe was doing the work in which Radowitz failed, one of his chief\r\ndifficulties arose from the conduct of men who came forward with just\r\nthe same demand which he now made, and he had to refuse their demands as\r\nRadowitz now refused his.\r\n\r\nHe did not take much part in the debates at Erfurt; as he was one of the\r\nyoungest of the members, he held the position of Secretary; the\r\nPresident of the Assembly was Simpson, a very distinguished public man,\r\nbut a converted Jew. \"What would my father have said,\" observed\r\nBismarck, \"if he had lived to see me become clerk to a Jewish scholar?\"\r\nOn one occasion he became involved in what might have been a very\r\nserious dispute, when he used his power as Secretary to exclude from the\r\nreporters' gallery two journalists whose reports of the meeting were\r\nvery partial and strongly opposed to Austria. His attitude towards the\r\nAssembly is shewn by the words:\r\n\r\n  \"I know that what I have said to you will have no influence on\r\n  your votes, but I am equally convinced that your votes will be as\r\n  completely without influence on the course of events.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole union was, as a matter of fact, broken down by the opposition\r\nof Austria. Bismarck had, in one of his first speeches, warned against a\r\npolicy which would bring Prussia into the position which Piedmont had\r\nheld before the battle of Novara, when they embarked on a war in which\r\nvictory would have brought about the overthrow of the monarchy, and\r\ndefeat a disgraceful peace. It was his way of saying that he hoped the\r\nKing would not eventually draw the sword in order to defend the new\r\nLiberal Constitution against the opposition of Austria. The day came\r\nwhen the King was placed in this position. Austria had summoned the old\r\nDiet to meet at Frankfort; Prussia denied that the Diet still legally\r\nexisted; the two policies were clearly opposed to one another: Austria\r\ndesiring the restoration of the old Constitution, Prussia, at the head\r\nof Liberal Germany, summoning the States round her in a new union. There\r\nwere other disputes about Schleswig-Holstein and the affairs of Hesse,\r\nbut this was the real point at issue. The Austrians were armed, and were\r\nsupported by the Czar and many of the German States; shots were actually\r\nexchanged between the Prussian and Bavarian outposts in Hesse. The\r\nAustrian ambassador had orders to leave Berlin; had he done so, war\r\ncould not have been avoided. He disobeyed his orders, remained in\r\nBerlin, asked for an interview with the King, and used all his influence\r\nto persuade him to surrender. The Ministry was divided; Radowitz stood\r\nalmost alone; the other Ministers, Bismarck's friends, had always\r\ndistrusted his policy. They wished to renew the old alliance with\r\nAustria; the Minister of War said they could not risk the struggle; it\r\nwas rumoured that he had deliberately avoided making preparations in\r\norder to prevent the King putting himself at the head of the Liberal\r\nparty. During the crisis, Bismarck was summoned to the King at\r\nLetzlingen; there can be no doubt what his advice was; eventually the\r\nparty of peace prevailed, and Radowitz resigned. Bismarck on hearing the\r\nnews danced three times round the table with delight. Brandenburg died\r\nalmost immediately after; Manteuffel became Minister-President; he asked\r\nSchwarzenberg for an interview, travelled to Olmütz to meet him, and an\r\nagreement was come to by which practically Prussia surrendered every\r\nobject of dispute between the two great Powers.\r\n\r\nThe convention of Olmütz was the most complete humiliation to which any\r\nEuropean State has ever been subjected. Prussia had undertaken a policy,\r\nand with the strong approval of the great majority of the nation had\r\nconsistently maintained it for over a year; Austria had required that\r\nthis policy should be surrendered; the two States had armed; the\r\nultimatum had been sent, everything was prepared for war, and then\r\nPrussia surrendered. The cause for this was a double one. It was partly\r\nthat Prussia was really not strong enough to meet the coalition of\r\nAustria and Russia, but it was also that the King was really of two\r\nminds; he was constitutionally unable to maintain against danger a\r\nconsistent course of policy.\r\n\r\nBismarck was one of the few men who defended the action of the Ministry.\r\nIn the ablest of all his speeches he took up the gauntlet, and exposed\r\nall the weakness and the dangers of Radowitz's policy. This was not a\r\ncause in which Prussia should risk its existence. Why should they go to\r\nwar in order to subject Prussia not to the Princes but to the Chambers\r\nof the smaller States? A war for the Union would, he said, remind him of\r\nthe Englishman who had a fight with the sentry in order that he might\r\nhang himself in the sentry-box, a right which he claimed for himself and\r\nevery free Briton. It was the duty of the councillors of the King to\r\nwarn him from a policy which would bring the State to destruction.\r\n\r\n  \"Still I would not shrink, from the war; I would advise it, were\r\n  anyone able to prove to me the necessity for it, or to point out\r\n  a worthy end which could be attained by it and in no other way.\r\n  Why do great States wage war nowadays? The only sound principle\r\n  of action for a great State is political egoism and not\r\n  Romanticism, and it is unworthy of a great State to fight for any\r\n  matter which does not concern its own interests. Shew us,\r\n  gentlemen, an object worthy of war and you have my vote. It is\r\n  easy for a statesman in his office or his chamber to blow the\r\n  trumpet with the breath of popularity and all the time to sit\r\n  warming himself by his fireside, while he leaves it to the\r\n  rifleman, who lies bleeding on the snow, whether his system\r\n  attains victory and glory. Nothing is easier; but woe to the\r\n  statesman who at such a time does not look about for a reason for\r\n  the war which will be valid when the war is over. I am convinced\r\n  you will see the questions which now occupy us in a different\r\n  light a year hence, when you look back upon them through a long\r\n  perspective of battle-fields and conflagrations, misery and\r\n  wretchedness. Will you then have the courage to go to the peasant\r\n  by the ashes of his cottage, to the cripple, to the childless\r\n  father, and say: 'You have suffered much, but rejoice with us,\r\n  the Union is saved. Rejoice with us, Hassenpflug is no longer\r\n  Minister, Bayernhofer rules in Hesse.'\"\r\n\r\nEloquent words; but what a strange comment on them his own acts were to\r\nafford. In 1850 Prussia had a clearer and juster cause of war than in\r\n1866; every word of his speech might have been used with equal effect\r\nsixteen years later; the Constitution of 1850 was little different from\r\nthat which Bismarck himself was to give to Germany. The policy of\r\nRadowitz was the only true policy for Prussia; if he failed, it was\r\nbecause Prussia's army was not strong enough; war would have been\r\nfollowed by defeat and disaster. There was one man who saw the evils as\r\nthey really were; the Prince of Prussia determined that if ever he\r\nbecame King the army of Prussia should be again made strong and\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\nIt was probably this speech which determined Bismarck's future career.\r\nHe had defended the agreement with Austria and identified himself with\r\nthe policy of the Government; what more natural than that they should\r\nuse him to help to carry out the policy he had upheld. Prussia consented\r\nto recognise the restoration of the Diet; it would be necessary,\r\ntherefore, to send an envoy. Now that she had submitted to Austria the\r\nonly wise policy was to cultivate her friendship. Who could do this\r\nbetter than Bismarck? Who had more boldly supported and praised the new\r\nrulers of Austria? When the Gotha party, as they were called, had wished\r\nto exclude Austria from Germany, he it was who said that Austria was no\r\nmore a foreign State than Würtemberg or Bavaria. The appointment of\r\nBismarck would be the best proof of the loyal intentions of the Prussian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nA few years later he himself gave to Motley the following account of his\r\nappointment:\r\n\r\n  \"In the summer of 1851,\" Motley writes, \"he told me that the\r\n  Minister, Manteuffel, asked him one day abruptly, if he would\r\n  accept the post of Ambassador at Frankfort, to which (although\r\n  the proposition was as unexpected a one to him as if I should\r\n  hear by the next mail that I had been chosen Governor of\r\n  Massachusetts) he answered, after a moment's deliberation, 'yes,'\r\n  with out another word. The King, the same day, sent for him, and\r\n  asked him if he would accept the place, to which he made the same\r\n  brief answer, 'Ja.' His Majesty expressed a little surprise that\r\n  he made no inquiries or conditions, when Bismarck replied that\r\n  anything which the King felt strong enough to propose to him, he\r\n  felt strong enough to accept. I only write these details, that\r\n  you may have an idea of the man. Strict integrity and courage of\r\n  character, a high sense of honour, a firm religious belief,\r\n  united with remarkable talents, make up necessarily a combination\r\n  which cannot be found any day in any Court; and I have no doubt\r\n  that he is destined to be Prime Minister, unless his obstinate\r\n  truthfulness, which is apt to be a stumbling-block for\r\n  politicians, stands in his way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFRANKFORT.\r\n\r\n1851-1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck when he went to Frankfort was thirty-six years of age; he had\r\nhad no experience in diplomacy and had long been unaccustomed to the\r\nroutine of official life. He had distinguished himself by qualities\r\nwhich might seem very undiplomatic; as a Parliamentary debater he had\r\nbeen outspoken in a degree remarkable even during a revolution; he had a\r\nhabit of tearing away the veil from those facts which everyone knows and\r\nwhich all wish to ignore; a careless good-fellowship which promised\r\nlittle of that reserve and discretion so necessary in a confidential\r\nagent; a personal and wilful independence which might easily lead him\r\ninto disagreement with the Ministers and the King. He had not even the\r\nadvantage of learning his work by apprenticeship under a more\r\nexperienced official; during the first two months at Frankfort he held\r\nthe position of First Secretary, but his chief did not attempt to\r\nintroduce him to the more important negotiations and when, at the end of\r\nJuly, he received his definite appointment as envoy, he knew as little\r\nof the work as when he arrived at Frankfort.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, occupied his time in becoming acquainted with the\r\nsocial conditions. His first impressions were very unfavourable.\r\nFrankfort held a peculiar position. Though the centre of the German\r\npolitical system it was less German than any other town in the country.\r\nThe society was very cosmopolitan. There were the envoys of the German\r\nStates and the foreign Powers, but the diplomatic circle was not graced\r\nby the dignity of a Court nor by the neighbourhood of any great\r\nadministrative Power. Side by side with the diplomatists were the\r\ncitizens of Frankfort; but here again we find indeed a great\r\nmoney-market, the centre of the finance of the Continent, dissociated\r\nfrom any great productive activity. In the neighbourhood were the\r\nwatering-places and gambling-tables; Homburg and Wiesbaden, Soden and\r\nBaden-Baden, were within an easy ride or short railway journey, and\r\nFrankfort was constantly visited by all the idle Princes of Germany. It\r\nwas a city in which intrigue took the place of statesmanship, and never\r\nhas intrigue played so large a part in the history of Europe as during\r\nthe years 1850-1870. Half the small States who were represented at\r\nFrankfort had ambitions beyond their powers; they liked to play their\r\npart in the politics of Europe. Too weak to stand alone, they were also\r\ntoo weak to be quite honest, and attempted to gain by cunning a position\r\nwhich they could not maintain by other means. This was the city in which\r\nBismarck was to serve his diplomatic apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nTwo extracts from letters to his wife give the best picture of his\r\npersonal character at this time:\r\n\r\n  \"On Saturday I drove with Rochow to Rüdesheim; there I took a\r\n  boat and rowed out on the Rhine, and bathed in the\r\n  moonlight--only nose and eyes above the water, and floated down\r\n  to the Rat Tower at Bingen, where the wicked Bishop met his end.\r\n  It is something strangely dreamlike to lie in the water in the\r\n  quiet, warm light, gently carried along by the stream; to look at\r\n  the sky with the moon and stars above one, and, on either side,\r\n  to see the wooded mountain-tops and castle parapets in the\r\n  moonlight, and to hear nothing but the gentle rippling of one's\r\n  own motion. I should like a swim like this every evening. Then I\r\n  drank some very good wine, and sat long talking with Lynar on the\r\n  balcony, with the Rhine beneath us. My little Testament and the\r\n  starry heavens brought us on Christian topics, and I long shook\r\n  at the Rousseau-like virtue of his soul.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Yesterday I was at Wiesbaden, and with a feeling of melancholy\r\n  revisited the scenes of former folly. May it please God to fill\r\n  with His clear and strong wine this vessel in which the champagne\r\n  of twenty-one years foamed so uselessly.... I do not understand\r\n  how a man who reflects on himself, and still knows, and will\r\n  know, nothing of God, can endure his life for contempt and\r\n  weariness. I do not know how I endured this in old days; if, as\r\n  then, I were to live without God, thee, and the children, I do\r\n  not know why I should not put life aside like a dirty shirt; and\r\n  yet most of my acquaintances live thus.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us see what he thinks of his new duties:\r\n\r\n  \"Our intercourse here is at best nothing but a mutual suspicion\r\n  and espionage; if only there was anything to spy out and to hide!\r\n  It is pure trifles with which they worry themselves, and I find\r\n  these diplomatists with their airs of confidence and their petty\r\n  fussiness much more absurd than the member of the Second Chamber\r\n  in his conscious dignity. Unless some external events take place,\r\n  and we clever men of the Diet can neither direct nor foresee\r\n  them, I know already what we shall bring about in one or two or\r\n  three years, and will do it in twenty-four hours if the others\r\n  will only be reasonable and truthful for a single day. I am\r\n  making tremendous progress in the art of saying nothing in many\r\n  words; I write reports many pages long, which are smooth and\r\n  finished like leading articles, and if Manteuffel after reading\r\n  them can say what they contain, he can do more than I. We all do\r\n  as though we believed of each other that we are full of thoughts\r\n  and plans, if only we would express them, and all the time we\r\n  none of us know a hair's breadth more what will become of\r\n  Germany.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Austrian Envoy who was President of the Diet he writes:\r\n\r\n  \"Thun in his outward appearance has something of a hearty good\r\n  fellow mixed with a touch of the Vienna _roué_. Underneath this\r\n  he hides, I will not say great political power and intellectual\r\n  gifts, but an uncommon cleverness and cunning, which with great\r\n  presence of mind appears from underneath the mask of harmless\r\n  good-humour as soon as politics are concerned. I consider him as\r\n  an opponent who is dangerous to anyone who honestly trusts him,\r\n  instead of paying back in his own coin.\"\r\n\r\nHis judgment on his other colleagues is equally decisive; of the\r\nAustrian diplomatists he writes:\r\n\r\n  \"one must never expect that they will make what is right the\r\n  foundation of their policy for the simple reason that it is the\r\n  right. Cautious dishonesty is the characteristic of their\r\n  association with us. They have nothing which awakens confidence.\r\n  They intrigue under the mask of good-fellowship.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to look for open co-operation from them;\r\n\r\n  \"their mouths are full of the necessity for common action, but\r\n  when it is a question of furthering our wishes, then officially\r\n  it is, 'We will not oppose,' and a secret pleasure in preparing\r\n  obstacles.\"\r\n\r\nIt was just the same with the envoys of the other countries: with few\r\nexceptions there is none for whom right has any value in itself.\r\n\r\n  \"They are caricatures of diplomatists who put on their official\r\n  physiognomy if I ask them for a light, and select gestures and\r\n  words with a truly Regensburg caution, if they ask for the key of\r\n  the water-closet.\" Writing to Gerlach he speaks of \"the lying,\r\n  double-tongued policy of the Austrians. Of all the lies and\r\n  intrigues that go on up and down the Rhine an honest man from the\r\n  old Mark has no conception. These South German children of nature\r\n  are very corrupt.\"\r\n\r\nHis opinion of the diplomatists does not seem to have improved as he\r\nknew them better. Years later he wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"There are few diplomatists who in the long run do not prefer to\r\n  capitulate with their conscience and their patriotism, and to\r\n  guard the interests of their country and their sovereign with\r\n  somewhat less decision, rather than, incessantly and with danger\r\n  to their personal position, to contend with the difficulties\r\n  which are prepared for them by a powerful and unscrupulous\r\n  enemy.\"\r\n\r\nHe does not think much better of his own Prussian colleagues; he often\r\ncomplains of the want of support which he received. \"With us the\r\nofficial diplomacy,\" he writes, \"is capable of playing under the same\r\nroof with strangers against their own countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters are chiefly interesting because of the light they throw on\r\nhis own character at the beginning of his diplomatic career; we must not\r\ntake them all too seriously. He was too good a raconteur not to make a\r\ngood story better, and too good a letter-writer not to add something to\r\nthe effect of his descriptions; besides, as he says elsewhere, he did\r\nnot easily see the good side of people; his eyes were sharper for their\r\nfaults than their good qualities.[4] After the first few passages of\r\narms he got on well enough with Thun; when he was recalled two years\r\nlater Bismarck spoke of him with much warmth. \"I like him personally,\r\nand should be glad to have him for a neighbour at Schönhausen.\"\r\n\r\nIt is however important to notice that the first impression made on him\r\nby diplomatic work was that of wanton and ineffective deceit. Those who\r\naccuse him, as is so often done, of lowering the standard of political\r\nmorality which prevails in Europe, know little of politics as they were\r\nat the time when Schwarzenberg was the leading statesman.\r\n\r\nIt was his fate at once to be brought in close contact with the most\r\ndisagreeable side of political life. In all diplomatic work there must\r\nbe a good deal of espionage and underhand dealing. This was a part of\r\nhis duties which Bismarck had soon to learn. He was entrusted with the\r\nmanagement of the Press. This consisted of two parts: first of all, he\r\nhad to procure the insertion of articles in influential papers in a\r\nsense agreeable to the plans of the Prussian Government; secondly, when\r\nhostile articles appeared, or inconvenient information was published, he\r\nhad to trace the authors of it,--find out by whom the obnoxious paper\r\nhad been inspired, or who had conveyed the secret information. This is a\r\nform of activity of which it is of course not possible to give any full\r\naccount; it seems, however, clear that in a remarkably short time\r\nBismarck shewed great aptitude for his new duties. His letters to\r\nManteuffel are full of curious information as to the intrigues of those\r\nwho are hostile to Prussia. He soon learns to distrust the information\r\nsupplied by the police; all through his life he had little respect for\r\nthis department of the Prussian State. He soon had agents of his own. We\r\nfind him gaining secret information as to the plans of the Ultramontane\r\nparty in Baden from a compositor at Freiburg who was in his pay. On\r\nother occasions, when a Court official at Berlin had conveyed to the\r\nnewspapers private information, Bismarck was soon able to trace him out.\r\nWe get the impression, both from his letters and from what other\r\ninformation we possess, that all the diplomatists of Germany were\r\nconstantly occupied in calumniating one another through anonymous\r\ncontributions to a venal Press.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the customs of the time that he had to warn his\r\nwife that all her letters to him would be read in the post-office before\r\nhe received them. It was not only the Austrians who used these methods;\r\neach of the Prussian Ministers would have his own organ which he would\r\nuse for his own purposes, and only too probably to attack his own\r\ncolleagues. It was at this time that a curious fact came to light with\r\nregard to Herr von Prokesch-Osten, the Austrian Ambassador at Berlin. He\r\nhad been transferred from Berlin to Frankfort, and on leaving his house\r\nsold some of his furniture. In a chest of drawers was found a large\r\nbundle of papers consisting of newspaper articles in his handwriting,\r\nwhich had been communicated to different papers, attacking the Prussian\r\nGovernment, to which he at the time was accredited. Of Prokesch it is\r\nthat Bismarck once writes: \"As to his statements I do not know how much\r\nyou will find to be Prokesch, and how much to be true.\" On another\r\noccasion, before many witnesses, Bismarck had disputed some statement he\r\nmade. \"If it is not true,\" cried Prokesch, \"then I should have lied in\r\nthe name of the Royal and Imperial Government.\" \"Certainly,\" answered\r\nBismarck. There was a dead pause in the conversation. Prokesch\r\nafterwards officially admitted that the statement had been incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis association with the Press formed in him a habit of mind which he\r\nnever lost: the proper use of newspapers seemed to him, as to most\r\nGerman statesmen, to be not the expression of public opinion but the\r\nsupport of the Government; if a paper is opposed to the Government, the\r\nassumption seems to be that it is bribed by some other State.\r\n\r\n  \"The whole country would rejoice if some of the papers which are\r\n  supported by foreign sources were suppressed, with the express\r\n  recognition of their unpatriotic attitude. There may be\r\n  opposition in the internal affairs, but a paper which in Prussia\r\n  takes part against the policy of the King on behalf of foreign\r\n  countries, must be regarded as dishonoured and treated as such.\"\r\n\r\nPolitically his position was very difficult; the Diet had been restored\r\nby Austria against the will of Prussia; the very presence of a Prussian\r\nEnvoy in Frankfort was a sign of her humiliation. He had indeed gone\r\nthere full of friendly dispositions towards Austria; he was instructed\r\nto take up again the policy which had been pursued before 1848, when all\r\nquestions of importance had been discussed by the two great Powers\r\nbefore they were laid before the Diet. Bismarck, however, quickly found\r\nthat this was no longer the intention of Austria; the Austria which he\r\nhad so chivalrously defended at Berlin did not exist; he had expected to\r\nfind a warm and faithful friend--he found a cunning and arrogant enemy.\r\nSchwarzenberg had spared Prussia but he intended to humble her; he\r\nwished to use the Diet as a means of permanently asserting the\r\nsupremacy of Austria, and he would not be content until Prussia had been\r\nforced like Saxony or Bavaria to acquiesce in the position of a vassal\r\nState. The task might not seem impossible, for Prussia appeared to be on\r\nthe downward path.\r\n\r\nOf course the Diet of Frankfort was the place where the plan had to be\r\ncarried out; it seemed an admirable opportunity that Prussia was\r\nrepresented there by a young and untried man. Count Thun and his\r\nsuccessors used every means to make it appear as though Prussia was a\r\nState not of equal rank with Austria. They carried the war into society\r\nand, as diplomatists always will, used the outward forms of social\r\nintercourse as a means for obtaining political ends. On this field,\r\nBismarck was quite capable of meeting them. He has told many stories of\r\ntheir conflicts.\r\n\r\nAs President of the Diet, Thun claimed privileges for himself which\r\nothers did not dare to dispute.\r\n\r\n  \"In the sittings of the military commission when Rochow was\r\n  Prussian envoy, Austria alone smoked. Rochow, who was a\r\n  passionate smoker, would also have gladly done so, but did not\r\n  venture. When I came I did not see any reason against it; and\r\n  asked for a light from the Presiding State; this seemed to be\r\n  noticed with astonishment and displeasure by him and the other\r\n  gentlemen; it was obviously an event for them. This time only\r\n  Austria and Prussia smoked. But the others obviously held it so\r\n  important that they sent home a report on it. Someone must have\r\n  written about it to Berlin, as a question from the late King\r\n  arrived; he did not smoke himself and probably did not find the\r\n  affair to his taste. It required much consideration at the\r\n  smaller Courts, and for quite half a year only the two great\r\n  Powers smoked. Then Schrenk, the Bavarian envoy, began to\r\n  maintain the dignity of his position by smoking. The Saxon\r\n  Nostitz would doubtless have liked to begin too, but I suppose he\r\n  had not yet received permission from his Minister. But when next\r\n  time he saw that Bothmer, the Hanoverian, allowed himself a\r\n  cigar, he must have come to an understanding with his neighbour\r\n  (he was a good Austrian, and had sons in the Austrian army), for\r\n  he brought out his pouch and lit up. There remained only the\r\n  Würtemberger and the Darmstadter, and they did not smoke at all,\r\n  but the honour and the importance of their States required it,\r\n  and so on the following day the Würtemberger really brought out\r\n  his cigar. I can see him with it now, a long, thin, yellow thing,\r\n  the colour of rye-straw,--and with sulky determination, as a\r\n  sacrifice for his Swabian fatherland, he smoked at least half of\r\n  it. Hesse-Darmstadt alone refrained.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Thun received Bismarck in his shirt sleeves: \"You\r\nare quite right,\" said Bismarck, \"it is very hot,\" and took off his own\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nIn the transaction of business he found the same thing. The plan seemed\r\nto be deliberately to adopt a policy disadvantageous to Prussia, to\r\nprocure the votes of a majority of the States, thereby to cause Prussia\r\nto be outvoted, and to leave her in the dilemma of accepting a decision\r\nwhich was harmful to herself or of openly breaking with the Federation.\r\nOn every matter which came up the same scenes repeated themselves; now\r\nit was the disposal of the fleet, which had to a great extent been\r\nprovided for and maintained by Prussian money; Austria demanded that it\r\nshould be regarded as the property of the Confederation even though most\r\nof the States had never paid their contribution. Then it was the\r\nquestion of the Customs' Union; a strong effort was made by the\r\nanti-Prussian party to overthrow the union which Prussia had established\r\nand thereby ruin the one great work which she had achieved. Against\r\nthese and similar attempts Bismarck had constantly to be on the\r\ndefensive. Another time it was the publication of the proceedings of the\r\nDiet which the Austrians tried to make a weapon against Prussia. The\r\nwhole intercourse became nothing but a series of disputes, sometimes\r\nserious, sometimes trivial.\r\n\r\nBismarck was soon able to hold his own; poor Count Thun, whose nerves\r\nwere not strong, after a serious discussion with him used to go to bed\r\nat five o'clock in the afternoon; he complained that his health would\r\nnot allow him to hold his post if there were to be continuous quarrels.\r\nWhen his successor, Herr v. Prokesch, left Frankfort for Constantinople,\r\nhe said that \"it would be like an Eastern dream of the blessed to\r\nconverse with the wise Ali instead of Bismarck.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first strangeness had passed off Bismarck became\r\nreconciled to his position. His wife and children joined him, he made\r\nhimself a comfortable home, and his house soon became one of the most\r\npopular in the town; he and his wife were genial and hospitable and he\r\nused his position to extend his own influence and that of his country.\r\nHis old friend, Motley, visited him there in 1855 and wrote to his wife:\r\n\r\n                                          \"FRANKFORT,\r\n                                          \"Monday, July 30, 1855.\r\n\r\n  \" ... The Bismarcks are as kind as ever--nothing can be more\r\n  frank and cordial than her manners. I am there all day long. It\r\n  is one of those houses where everyone does what he likes. The\r\n  show apartments where they receive formal company are on the\r\n  front of the house. Their living rooms, however, are a _salon_\r\n  and dining-room at the back, opening upon the garden. Here there\r\n  are young and old, grandparents and children and dogs all at\r\n  once, eating, drinking, smoking, piano-playing, and pistol-firing\r\n  (in the garden), all going on at the same time. It is one of\r\n  those establishments where every earthly thing that can be eaten\r\n  or drunk is offered you; porter, soda water, small beer,\r\n  champagne, burgundy, or claret are about all the time, and\r\n  everybody is smoking the best Havana cigars every minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of society, much of it congenial to him. He had given up\r\nplaying since his marriage, and was one of the few diplomatists who was\r\nnot found at the Homburg gaming-tables, but he had a sufficiency of\r\nsport and joined with the British envoy, Sir Alexander Malet, in taking\r\nsome shooting. A couple of years later in contradicting one of the\r\nfrequent newspaper reports, that he aimed at supplanting the Minister,\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n  \"My castle in the air is to spend three to five years longer at\r\n  Frankfort, then perhaps the same time in Vienna or Paris, then\r\n  ten years with glory as Minister, then die as a country\r\n  gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nA prospect which has been more nearly fulfilled than such wishes\r\ngenerally are.\r\n\r\nHe was for the first year still a member of the Second Chamber and\r\noccasionally appeared in it; his interest in his diplomatic work had,\r\nhowever, begun to overshadow his pleasure in Parliamentary debate.\r\n\r\n  \"I am thoroughly tired of my life here,\" he writes in May, 1853,\r\n  to his wife from Berlin, \"and long for the day of my departure. I\r\n  find the intrigues of the House immeasurably shallow and\r\n  undignified; if one always lives among them, one deceives oneself\r\n  and considers them something wonderful. When I come here from\r\n  Frankfort and see them as they really are, I feel like a sober\r\n  man who has fallen among drunkards. There is something very\r\n  demoralising in the air of the Chambers; it makes the best people\r\n  vain without their knowing it.\"\r\n\r\nSo quickly has he outgrown his feelings of a year ago: then it was the\r\nintrigues of diplomatists that had seemed to him useless and\r\ndemoralising. Now it was Parliamentary debates; in the opinion he formed\r\nat this time he never wavered.\r\n\r\nHis distaste for Parliamentary life was probably increased by an event\r\nwhich took place about this time. As so often before in the course of\r\ndebate he had a sharp passage of words with Vincke; the latter referred\r\ncontemptuously to Bismarck's diplomatic achievements. \"All I know of\r\nthem is the famous lighted cigar.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck answered with some angry words and at the close of the sitting\r\nsent a challenge. Four days later a duel with pistols took place--the\r\nonly one he ever fought. Neither was injured. It seems that Vincke, who\r\nhad the first shot, seeing that Bismarck (who had received the sacrament\r\nthe night before) was praying, missed on purpose; Bismarck then shot\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons he did not stand for re-election when the Chamber was\r\ndissolved in 1852, although the King was very much displeased with his\r\ndetermination. He was shortly afterwards appointed member of the newly\r\nconstituted House of Lords, but though he occasionally voted, as in duty\r\nbound, for Government measures, he never spoke; he was not to be heard\r\nagain in the Parliament until he appeared there as President of the\r\nMinistry. He was glad to be freed from a tie which had interfered with\r\nhis duties at Frankfort; to these he devoted himself with an\r\nextraordinary energy; all his old repugnance to official life had\r\ndisappeared; he did not confine himself to the mere routine of his\r\nduties, or to carrying out the instructions sent to him from Berlin.\r\n\r\nHis power of work was marvellous: there passed through his hands a\r\nconstant series of most important and complicated negotiations; up to\r\nthis time he had no experience or practice in sedentary literary work,\r\nnow he seems to go out of the way to make fresh labours for himself. He\r\nwrites long and careful despatches to his Minister on matters of general\r\npolicy; some of them so carefully thought out and so clearly expressed\r\nthat they may still be looked on as models. He is entirely free from\r\nthat circumlocution and involved style which makes so much diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence almost worthless. His arguments are always clear,\r\ncomplete, concise. He used to work long into the night, and then, when\r\nin the early morning the post to Berlin had gone, he would mount his\r\nhorse and ride out into the country. It was in these years that he\r\nformed those habits to which the breakdown of his health in later years\r\nwas due; but now his physical and intellectual vigour seemed\r\ninexhaustible.\r\n\r\nHe never feared to press his own views as to the policy which should be\r\npursued. He also kept up a constant correspondence with Gerlach, and\r\nmany of these letters were laid before the King, so that even when\r\nabsent he continued as before to influence both the official and\r\nunofficial advisers. He soon became the chief adviser on German affairs\r\nand was often summoned to Berlin that his advice might be taken; within\r\ntwo years after his appointment he was sent on a special mission to\r\nVienna to try and bring about an agreement as to the rivalry concerning\r\nthe Customs' Union. He failed, but he had gained a knowledge of persons\r\nand opinions at the Austrian Court which was to be of much use to him.\r\n\r\nDuring these years, indeed, he acquired a most remarkable knowledge of\r\nGermany; before, he had lived entirely in Prussia, now he was at the\r\ncentre of the German political system, continually engaged in important\r\nnegotiations with the other Courts; after a few years there was not a\r\nman of importance in German public life whose character and opinions he\r\nhad not gauged.\r\n\r\nFurther experience only confirmed in him the observations he had made at\r\nthe beginning, that it was impossible to maintain a good understanding\r\nwith Austria. The tone of his letters soon changes from doubt and\r\ndisappointment to settled and determined hostility. In other matters\r\nalso he found that the world was not the same place it had seemed to\r\nhim; he had been accustomed to regard the Revolution as the chief danger\r\nto be met; at Frankfort he was in the home of it; here for nearly a year\r\nthe German Assembly had held its meetings; in the neighbouring States of\r\nBaden, Hesse, and in the Palatinate, the Republican element was strong;\r\nhe found them as revolutionary as ever, but he soon learnt to despise\r\nrather than fear them:\r\n\r\n  \"The population here would be a political volcano if revolutions\r\n  were made with the mouth; so long as it requires blood and\r\n  strength they will obey anyone who has courage to command and, if\r\n  necessary, to draw the sword; they would be dangerous only under\r\n  cowardly governments.\r\n\r\n  \"I have never seen two men fighting in all the two years I have\r\n  been here. This cowardice does not prevent the people, who are\r\n  completely devoid of all inner Christianity and all respect for\r\n  authority, from sympathising with\r\n  the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nHis observations on the character of the South Germans only increased\r\nhis admiration for the Prussian people and his confidence in the\r\nPrussian State.\r\n\r\nHe had not been at Frankfort a year before he had learnt to look on this\r\nhostility of Austria as unsurmountable. As soon as he had convinced\r\nhimself of this, he did not bewail and bemoan the desertion of their\r\nally; he at once accustomed himself to the new position and considered\r\nin what way the Government ought to act. His argument was simple.\r\nAustria is now our enemy; we must be prepared to meet this enmity either\r\nby diplomacy or war; we are not strong enough to do so alone; therefore\r\nwe must have allies. There was no sure alliance to be had in Germany; he\r\ndespised the other German States. If there were to be a war he would\r\nrather have them against him than on his side. He must find help abroad;\r\nAustria had overcome Prussia by the alliance with Russia. Surely the\r\nonly thing to be done was to seek support where it could be got, either\r\nwith Russia or with France, if possible with both. In this he was only\r\nreverting to the old policy of Prussia; the alliance with Austria had\r\nonly begun in 1813. From now until 1866 his whole policy was ceaselessly\r\ndevoted to bringing about such a disposition of the forces of Europe\r\nthat Austria might be left without allies and Prussia be able to regain\r\nthe upper hand in German affairs.\r\n\r\nThe change was in his circumstances, not in his character; as before he\r\nwas moved by a consuming passion of patriotism; something there was too\r\nof personal feeling,--his own pride, his own ambitions were engaged,\r\nthough this was as nothing compared to love of his country and loyalty\r\nto the King. He was a soldier of the Prussian Crown: at Berlin he had to\r\ndefend it against internal enemies; now the danger had shifted, the\r\npower of the Government was established, why waste time in fighting\r\nwith Liberalism? Other enemies were pressing on. When Jellachich and\r\nWindischgätz had stood victorious by the blood-stained altar of St.\r\nStephen's, the Austrian army had destroyed the common foe; now it was\r\nthe same Austrian army and Austrian statesmen who desired to put a limit\r\nto Prussian ambition. Bismarck threw himself into the conflict of\r\ndiplomacy with the same courage and relentless persistence that he had\r\nshewn in Parliamentary debates. He had already begun to divine that the\r\ntime might come when the Prussian Crown would find an ally in Italian\r\npatriots and Hungarian rebels.\r\n\r\nIt was the Eastern complications which first enabled him to shew his\r\ndiplomatic abilities in the larger field of European politics. The plans\r\nfor the dismemberment of the Turkish Empire which were entertained by\r\nthe Czar were opposed by England, France, and Austria; Prussia, though\r\nnot immediately concerned, also at first gave her assent to the various\r\nnotes and protests of the Powers; so that the ambition of the Czar was\r\nconfronted by the unanimous voice of Europe.\r\n\r\nBismarck from the beginning regarded the situation with apprehension; he\r\nsaw that Prussia was being entangled in a struggle in which she had much\r\nto lose and nothing to gain. If she continued to support the Western\r\nPowers she would incur the hatred of Russia; then, perhaps, by a sudden\r\nchange of policy on the part of Napoleon, she would be left helpless and\r\nexposed to Russian vengeance. If war were to break out, and Prussia took\r\npart in the war, then the struggle between France and Russia would be\r\nfought out on German soil, and, whoever was victorious, Germany would be\r\nthe loser. What interests of theirs were at stake that they should incur\r\nthis danger? why should Prussia sacrifice herself to preserve English\r\ninfluence in the Mediterranean, or the interests of Austria on the\r\nDanube? He wished for exactly the opposite policy; the embarrassment of\r\nAustria must be the opportunity of Prussia; now was the time to recover\r\nthe lost position in Germany. The dangerous friendship of Austria and\r\nRussia was dissolved; if Prussia came to an understanding with the Czar,\r\nit was now Austria that would be isolated. The other German States would\r\nnot desire to be dragged into a war to support Austrian dominion in the\r\nEast. Let Prussia be firm and they would turn to her for support, and\r\nshe would once more be able to command a majority of the Diet.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons he recommended his Government to preserve an armed\r\nneutrality, in union, if possible, with the other German States. If they\r\nwere to take sides, he preferred it should not be with the Western\r\nPowers, for, as he said,--\r\n\r\n  \"We must look abroad for allies, and among the European Powers\r\n  Russia is to be had on the cheapest terms; it wishes only to grow\r\n  in the East, the two others at our expense.\"\r\n\r\nIt shews the advance he had made in diplomacy that throughout his\r\ncorrespondence he never refers to the actual cause of dispute; others\r\nmight discuss the condition of the Christians in Turkey or the Holy\r\nPlaces of Jerusalem; he thinks only of the strength and weakness of his\r\nown State. The opening of the Black Sea, the dismemberment of Turkey,\r\nthe control of the Mediterranean, the fate of the Danubian\r\nPrincipalities--for all this he cared nothing, for in them Prussia had\r\nno interests; they only existed for him so far as the new combinations\r\namong the Powers might for good or evil affect Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe crisis came in 1854: a Russian army occupied Moldavia and Wallachia;\r\nEngland and France sent their fleets to the Black Sea; they determined\r\non war and they wished for the alliance of Austria. Austria was inclined\r\nto join, for the presence of Russian troops on the Danube was a menace\r\nto her; she did not dare to move unless supported by Prussia and\r\nGermany; she appealed to the Confederacy and urged that her demands\r\nmight be supported by the armies of her allies; but the German States\r\nwere little inclined to send the levies of their men for the Eastern\r\ninterests of the Emperor. If they were encouraged by Prussia, they would\r\nrefuse; the result in Germany, as in Europe, depended on the action of\r\nPrussia, and the decision lay with the King.\r\n\r\nWas Prussia to take part with Russia or the Western Powers? That was the\r\nquestion which for many months was debated at Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe public opinion of the nation was strong for the Western Powers; they\r\nfeared the influence of Russia on the internal affairs of Germany; they\r\nhad not forgotten or forgiven the part which the Czar had taken in 1849;\r\nthe choice seemed to lie between Russia and England, between liberty and\r\ndespotism, between civilisation and barbarism. On this side also were\r\nthose who wished to maintain the alliance with Austria. Russia had few\r\nfriends except at the Court and in the army, but the party of the _Kreuz\r\nZeitung,_ the Court Camarilla, the princes and nobles who commanded the\r\n_Garde Corps_, wished for nothing better than a close alliance with the\r\ngreat Emperor who had saved Europe from the Revolution. \"Let us draw our\r\nsword openly in defence of Russia,\" they said, \"then we may bring\r\nAustria with us; the old alliance of the three monarchies will be\r\nrestored, and then will be the time for a new crusade against France,\r\nthe natural enemy of Germany, and the upstart Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nThe conflict of parties was keenest in the precincts of the Court;\r\nsociety in Berlin was divided between the Russian and the English; the\r\nQueen was hot for Russia, but the English party rallied round the Prince\r\nof Prussia and met in the salons of his wife. Between the two the King\r\nwavered; he was, as always, more influenced by feeling than by\r\ncalculation, but his feelings were divided. How could he decide between\r\nAustria and Russia, the two ancient allies of his house? He loved and\r\nreverenced the Czar; he feared and distrusted Napoleon; alliance with\r\ninfidels against Christians was to him a horrible thought, but he knew\r\nhow violent were the actions and lawless the desires of Nicholas. He\r\ncould not ignore the opinions of Western Europe and he wished to stand\r\nwell with England. The men by whose advice he was guided stood on\r\nopposite sides: Bunsen was for England, Gerlach for Russia; the Ministry\r\nalso was divided. No efforts were spared to influence him; the Czar and\r\nNapoleon each sent special envoys to his Court; the Queen of England and\r\nher husband warned him not to forget his duty to Europe and humanity; if\r\nhe would join the allies there would be no war. Still he wavered; \"he\r\ngoes to bed an Englishman and gets up a Russian,\" said the Czar, who\r\ndespised his brother-in-law as much as he was honoured by him.\r\n\r\nWhile the struggle was at its height, Bismarck was summoned to Berlin,\r\nthat his opinion might also be heard. At Berlin and at Letzlingen he had\r\nfrequent interviews with the King. In later years he described the\r\nsituation he found there:\r\n\r\n  \"It was nothing strange, according to the custom of those days,\r\n  that half a dozen ambassadors should be living in hotels\r\n  intriguing against the policy of the Minister.\"\r\n\r\nHe found Berlin divided into two parties: the one looked to the Czar as\r\ntheir patron and protector, the other wished to win the approval of\r\nEngland; he missed a reasonable conviction as to what was the interest\r\nof Prussia. His own advice was against alliance with the Western Powers\r\nor Austria; better join Russia than England; better still, preserve\r\nneutrality and hold the balance of Europe. He had the reputation of\r\nbeing very Russian, but he protested against the term. \"I am not\r\nRussian,\" he said, \"but Prussian.\" He spoke with great decision against\r\nthe personal adherents of the King, men who looked to the Czar rather\r\nthan to their own sovereign, and carried their subservience even to\r\ntreason. As in former days, courage he preached and resolution. Some\r\ntalked of the danger of isolation; \"With 400,000 men we cannot be\r\nisolated,\" he said. The French envoy warned him that his policy might\r\nlead to another Jena; \"Why not to Waterloo?\" he answered. Others talked\r\nof the danger of an English blockade of their coasts; he pointed out\r\nthat this would injure England more than Prussia.\r\n\r\n  \"Let us be bold and depend on our own strength; let us frighten\r\n  Austria by threatening an alliance with Russia, frighten Russia\r\n  by letting her think we may join the Western Powers; if it were\r\n  true that we could never side with Russia, at least we must\r\n  retain the possibility of threatening to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was what we might expect from the character of the King;\r\nunable to decide for either of the contending factors, he alternated\r\nbetween the two, and gave his support now to one, now to the other. In\r\nMarch, when Bismarck was still in Berlin, sudden disgrace fell upon the\r\nEnglish party; Bunsen was recalled from London, Bonin, their chief\r\nadvocate in the Ministry, was dismissed; when the Prince of Prussia, the\r\nchief patron of the Western alliance, protested, he was included in the\r\nact of disfavour, and had to leave Berlin, threatened with the loss of\r\nhis offices and even with arrest. All danger of war with Russia seemed\r\nto have passed; Bismarck returned content to Frankfort. Scarcely had he\r\ngone when the old affection for Austria gained the upper hand, and by a\r\nseparate treaty Prussia bound herself to support the Austrian demands,\r\nif necessary by arms. Bismarck heard nothing of the treaty till it was\r\ncompleted; the Ministers had purposely refrained from asking his advice\r\non a policy which they knew he would disapprove. He overcame his\r\nfeelings of disgust so far as to send a cold letter of congratulation to\r\nManteuffel; to Gerlach he wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"His Majesty should really see to it that his Ministers should\r\n  drink more champagne; none of the gentry ought to enter his\r\n  Council without half a bottle under his belt. Our policy would\r\n  soon get a respectable colour.\"\r\n\r\nThe real weakness lay, as he well knew, in the character of the King.\r\n\"If here I say to one of my colleagues, 'We remain firm even if Austria\r\ndrives matters to a breach,' he laughs in my face and says, 'As long as\r\nthe King lives it will not come to a war between Austria and Prussia.'\"\r\nAnd again, \"The King has as much leniency for the sins of Austria as I\r\nhope to have from the Lord in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a severe strain on his loyalty, but he withstood it; he has, I\r\nbelieve, never expressed his opinion about the King; we can guess what\r\nit must have been. It was a melancholy picture: a King violent and\r\ntimid, obstinate and irresolute; his will dragged now this way, now\r\nthat, by his favourites, his wife and his brother; his own Ministers\r\nintriguing against each other; ambassadors recommending a policy instead\r\nof carrying out their instructions; and the Minister-President standing\r\ncalmly by, as best he could, patching up the appearance of a Consistent\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the experience which he gained at this time which in\r\nlater years, when he himself had become Minister, made Bismarck so\r\njealous of outside and irresponsible advisers; he did not choose to\r\noccupy the position of Manteuffel, he laid down the rule that none of\r\nhis own subordinates should communicate with the King except through\r\nhimself; a Bismarck as Foreign Minister would not allow a Gerlach at\r\nCourt, nor a Bismarck among his envoys. He had indeed been careful not\r\nto intrigue against his chief, but it was impossible to observe that\r\ncomplete appearance of acquiescence which a strong and efficient\r\nMinister must demand. Bismarck was often asked his opinion by the King\r\ndirectly; he was obliged to say what he believed to be the truth, and he\r\noften disapproved of that which Manteuffel advised. In order to avoid\r\nthe appearance of disloyalty, he asked Gerlach that his letters should\r\nbe shewn to Manteuffel; not all of them could be shewn, still less would\r\nit be possible to repeat all he said. If they were in conflict, his duty\r\nto the King must override his loyalty to the Minister, and the two could\r\nnot always be reconciled. To Englishmen indeed it appears most improper\r\nthat the King should continually call for the advice of other\r\npoliticians without the intervention or the knowledge of his Ministers,\r\nbut this is just one of those points on which it is impossible to apply\r\nto Prussian practice English constitutional theory. In England it is a\r\nmaxim of the Constitution that the sovereign should never consult anyone\r\non political matters except the responsible Ministry; this is possible\r\nonly because the final decision rests with Parliament and the Cabinet\r\nand not with the sovereign. It was, however, always the contention of\r\nBismarck that the effective decision in Prussia was with the King. This\r\nwas undoubtedly the true interpretation of the Prussian Constitution;\r\nbut it followed from this that the King must have absolute freedom to\r\nask the advice of everyone whose opinions would be of help to him; he\r\nmust be able to command the envoys to foreign countries to communicate\r\nwith him directly, and if occasion required it, to consult with the\r\npolitical opponents of his own Ministers. To forbid this and to require\r\nthat all requests should come to him by the hands of the Ministers would\r\nbe in truth to substitute ministerial autocracy for monarchical\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSomething of this kind did happen in later years when the German Emperor\r\nhad grown old, and when Bismarck, supported by his immense experience\r\nand success, guided the policy of the country alone, independent of\r\nParliament, and scarcely allowing any independent adviser to approach\r\nthe Emperor. This was exceptional; normally a Prussian Minister had to\r\nmeet his opponents and critics not so much in public debate as in\r\nprivate discussion. Under a weak sovereign the policy of the country\r\nmust always be distracted by palace intrigue, just as in England under a\r\nweak Cabinet it will be distracted by party faction. The Ministers must\r\nalways be prepared to find their best-laid schemes overthrown by the\r\ninfluence exerted upon the royal mind by his private friends or even by\r\nhis family. It may be said that tenure of office under these conditions\r\nwould be impossible to a man of spirit; it was certainly very\r\ndifficult; an able and determined Minister was as much hampered by this\r\nprivate opposition as by Parliamentary discussion. It is often the\r\nfashion to say that Parliamentary government is difficult to reconcile\r\nwith a strong foreign policy; the experiences of Prussia from the year\r\n1815 to 1863 seem to shew that under monarchical government it is\r\nequally difficult.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had been maturing in his mind a bolder plan: Why should not\r\nPrussia gain the support she required by alliance with Napoleon?\r\n\r\nThe Germans had watched the rise of Napoleon with suspicion and alarm;\r\nthey had long been taught that France was their natural enemy. When\r\nNapoleon seized the power and assumed the name of Emperor, the old\r\ndistrust was revived; his very name recalled memories of hostility; they\r\nfeared he would pursue an ambitious and warlike policy; that he would\r\nwithdraw the agreements on which the peace of Europe and the security of\r\nthe weaker States depended, and that he would extend to the Rhine the\r\nborders of France. He was the first ruler of France whose internal\r\npolicy awoke no sympathy in Germany; his natural allies, the Liberals,\r\nhe had alienated by the overthrow of the Republic, and he gained no\r\ncredit for it in the eyes of the Conservatives. The monarchical party in\r\nPrussia could only have admiration for the man who had imprisoned a\r\nParliament and restored absolute government; they could not repudiate an\r\nact which they would gladly imitate, but they could not forgive him that\r\nhe was an usurper. According to their creed the suppression of liberty\r\nwas the privilege of the legitimate King.\r\n\r\nIt was the last remnant of the doctrine of legitimacy, the belief that\r\nit was the duty of the European monarchs that no State should change its\r\nform of government or the dynasty by which it was ruled; the doctrine of\r\nthe Holy Alliance that kings must make common cause against the\r\nRevolution. How changed were the times from the days when Metternich had\r\nused this as a strong support for the ascendancy of the House of\r\nAustria! Austria herself was no longer sound; the old faith lingered\r\nonly in St. Petersburg and Berlin; but how weak and ineffective it had\r\nbecome! There was no talk now of interference, there would not be\r\nanother campaign of Waterloo or of Valmy; there was only a prudish\r\nreserve; they could not, they did not dare, refuse diplomatic dealings\r\nwith the new Emperor, but they were determined there should be no\r\ncordiality: the virgin purity of the Prussian Court should not be\r\ndeflowered by intimacy with the man of sin.[5] If there could not be a\r\nfresh crusade against Buonapartism, at least, there should be no\r\nalliance with it.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Bismarck had little sympathy with this point of view;\r\nhe regarded the _coup d'état_ as necessary in a nation which had left\r\nthe firm ground of legitimacy; France could not be governed except by an\r\niron hand. As a Prussian, however, he could not be pleased, for he saw\r\nan enemy who had been weak strengthened, but he did not believe in\r\nNapoleon's warlike desires. In one way it was an advantage,--the\r\noverthrow of the Republic had broken the bond which joined the German\r\nrevolutionists to France. He did not much mind what happened in other\r\ncountries so long as Prussia was safe.\r\n\r\nThere is no ground for surprise that he soon began to go farther; he\r\nwarned his friends not to irritate the Emperor; on the occasion of the\r\nEmperor's marriage the _Kreuz Zeitung_ published a violent article,\r\nspeaking of it as an insult and threat to Prussia. Bismarck's feelings\r\nas a gentleman were offended by this useless scolding; it seemed,\r\nmoreover, dangerous. If Prussia were to quarrel with France, they would\r\nbe obliged to seek the support of the Eastern Powers: if Russia and\r\nAustria should know this, Prussia would be in their hands. The only\r\neffect of this attitude would be to cut off the possibility of a useful\r\nmove in the game of diplomacy:\r\n\r\n  \"There is no good in giving our opposition to France the stamp of\r\n  irrevocability; it would be no doubt a great misfortune if we\r\n  were to unite ourselves with France, but why proclaim this to all\r\n  the world? We should do wiser to act so that Austria and Russia\r\n  would have to court our friendship against France than treat us\r\n  as an ally who is presented to them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a topic to which he often refers:\r\n\r\n  \"We cannot make an alliance with France without a certain degree\r\n  of meanness, but very admirable people, even German princes, in\r\n  the Middle Ages have used a sewer to make their escape, rather\r\n  than be beaten or throttled.\"\r\n\r\nAn alliance with Napoleon was, however, according to the code of honour\r\nprofessed, if not followed, in every German State, the sin for which\r\nthere was no forgiveness. It was but a generation ago that half the\r\nGerman princes had hurried to the Court of the first Napoleon to receive\r\nat his hands the estates of their neighbours and the liberties of their\r\nsubjects. No one doubted that the new Napoleon would be willing to use\r\nsimilar means to ensure the power of France; would he meet with willing\r\nconfederates? The Germans, at least, do not seem to have trusted one\r\nanother; no prince dared show ordinary courtesy to the ruling family of\r\nFrance, no statesman could visit Paris but voices would be heard crying\r\nthat he had sold himself and his country. An accusation of this kind was\r\nthe stock-in-trade which the Nationalist press was always ready to bring\r\nagainst every ruler who was obnoxious to them. It required moral\r\ncourage, if it also shewed political astuteness, when Bismarck proposed\r\ndeliberately to encourage a suspicion from which most men were anxious\r\nthat their country should be free. He had already plenty of enemies, and\r\nreports were soon heard that he was in favour of a French alliance; they\r\ndid not cease for ten years; he often protests in his private letters\r\nagainst these unworthy accusations; the protests seem rather absurd, for\r\nif he did not really wish for an alliance between Prussia and France, he\r\nat least wished that people should dread such an alliance. A man cannot\r\nfrighten his friends by the fear he will rob them, and at the same time\r\nenjoy the reputation for strict probity.\r\n\r\nHe explains with absolute clearness the benefits which will come from a\r\nFrench alliance:\r\n\r\n  \"The German States are attentive and attracted to us in the same\r\n  degree in which they believe we are befriended by France.\r\n  Confidence in us they will never have, every glance at the map\r\n  prevents that; and they know that their separate interests and\r\n  the misuse of their sovereignty always stand in the way of the\r\n  whole tendency of Prussian policy. They clearly recognise the\r\n  danger which lies in this; it is one against which the\r\n  unselfishness of our Most Gracious Master alone gives them a\r\n  temporary security. The opinions of the King, which ought at\r\n  least for a time to weaken their mistrust, will gain his Majesty\r\n  no thanks; they will only be used and exploited. In the hour of\r\n  necessity gratitude and confidence will not bring a single man\r\n  into the field. Fear, if it is used with foresight and clearness,\r\n  can place the whole Confederacy at our feet, and in order to\r\n  instil fear into them we must give clear signs of our good\r\n  relations with France.\"\r\n\r\nHe objected to Prussia following what was called a German policy, for,\r\nas he said, by a national and patriotic policy is meant that Prussia\r\nshould do what was for the interest, not of herself, but of the smaller\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after the Crimean War that he was able to press this\r\npolicy. Napoleon had now won his position in Europe; Gerlach had seen\r\nwith pain and disgust that the Queen of England had visited his Court.\r\nThe Emperor himself desired a union with Prussia. In this, sympathy and\r\ninterest combined: he had much affection for Germany; his mind, as his\r\neducation, was more German than French; he was a man of ideas; he was\r\nthe only ruler of France who has sincerely desired and deliberately\r\nfurthered the interests of other countries; he believed that the nation\r\nshould be the basis of the State; his revolutionary antecedents made him\r\nnaturally opposed to the House of Austria; and he was ready to help\r\nPrussia in resuming her old ambitious policy.\r\n\r\nThe affair of Neuchâtel gave him an opportunity of earning the personal\r\ngratitude of the King, and he did not neglect it, for he knew that in\r\nthe royal prejudice was the strongest impediment to an alliance. In 1857\r\nBismarck was sent to Paris to discuss this and other matters. Two years\r\nbefore he had been presented to the Emperor, but it had been at the time\r\nwhen he was opposed to the French policy. Now for the first time the two\r\nmen who were for ten years to be the leaders, now friends, then rivals,\r\nin the realm of diplomacy, were brought into close connection. Bismarck\r\nwas not impressed by the Emperor's ability. He wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"People exaggerate his intellect, but underrate his heart.\"\r\n  Napoleon was very friendly; his wish to help the King went\r\n  farther than his duty to follow French policy. He said: \"Why\r\n  should we not be friends; let us forget the past; if everyone\r\n  were to attach himself to a policy of memories, two nations that\r\n  have once been at war must be at war to all eternity; statesmen\r\n  must occupy themselves with the future.\"\r\n\r\nThis was just Bismarck's opinion; he wrote home suggesting that he might\r\nprepare the way for a visit of the Emperor to Prussia; he would like to\r\ncome and it would have a good effect. This was going farther than the\r\nKing, grateful though he was, would allow; he told Gerlach not to answer\r\nthis part of the letter at all while Bismarck was in Paris. Bismarck,\r\nhowever, continued in his official reports and private letters to urge\r\nagain and again the political advantages of an understanding with\r\nFrance; it is Austria that is the natural enemy, for it is Austria whose\r\ninterests are opposed to Prussia. If they repel the advance of Napoleon,\r\nthey will oblige him to seek an alliance with Russia, and this was a\r\ndanger which even in those days Bismarck never ceased to fear. Prince\r\nNapoleon, cousin of the Emperor, was at that time on a visit to Berlin;\r\non his way through Frankfort he had singled out Bismarck, and (no doubt\r\nunder instructions) had shown great friendliness to him; the _Kreuz\r\nZeitung_ again took the opportunity of insulting the ruler of France;\r\nBismarck again remonstrated against the danger of provoking hostility by\r\nthese acts of petty rancour, disguised though they might be under the\r\nname of principle. He did not succeed in persuading the King or his\r\nconfidant; he was always met by the same answer: \"France is the natural\r\nenemy of Germany; Napoleon is the representative of the Revolution;\r\nthere can be no union between the King of Prussia and the Revolution.\"\r\n\"How can a man of your intelligence sacrifice your principles to a\r\nsingle individual?\" asks Gerlach, who aimed not at shewing that an\r\nalliance with France would be foolish, but that it would be wrong. Five\r\nyears before, Bismarck would have spoken as Gerlach did; but in these\r\nyears he had seen and learnt much; he had freed himself from the\r\ninfluence of his early friends; he had outgrown their theoretic\r\nformalism; he had learned to look at the world with his own eyes, and to\r\nhim, defending his country against the intrigues of weaker and the\r\npressure of more powerful States, the world was a different place from\r\nwhat it was to those who passed their time in the shadow of the Court.\r\nHe remembered that it was not by strict obedience to general principles\r\nthat Prussia had grown great. Frederick the Second had not allowed\r\nhimself to be stopped by these narrow searchings of heart; his successor\r\nhad not scrupled to ally himself with revolutionary France. This rigid\r\ninsistence on a rule of right, this nice determining of questions of\r\nconscience, seemed better suited to the confessor's chair than to the\r\nadvisers of a great monarch. And the principle to which he was asked to\r\nsacrifice the future of his country,--was it after all a true principle?\r\nWhy should Prussia trouble herself about the internal constitution of\r\nother States, what did it concern her whether France was ruled by a\r\nBourbon or an Orleans or a Bonaparte? How could Prussia continue the\r\npolicy of the Holy Alliance when the close union of the three Eastern\r\nmonarchies no longer existed? If France were to attack Germany, Prussia\r\ncould not expect the support of Russia, she could not even be sure of\r\nthat of Austria. An understanding with France was required, not by\r\nambition, but by the simplest grounds of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nThese and other considerations he advanced in a long and elaborate\r\nmemorandum addressed to Manteuffel, which was supplemented by letters to\r\nthe Minister and Gerlach. For closeness of reasoning, for clearness of\r\nexpression, for the wealth of knowledge and cogency of argument these\r\nare the most remarkable of his political writings. In them he sums up\r\nthe results of his apprenticeship to political life, he lays down the\r\nprinciples on which the policy of the State ought to be conducted, the\r\nprinciples on which in future years he was himself to act.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" he asks, \"are the reasons against an alliance with France? The\r\nchief ground is the belief that the Emperor is the chief representative\r\nof the Revolution and identical with it, and that a compromise with the\r\nRevolution is as inadmissible in internal as in external policy.\" Both\r\nstatements he triumphantly overthrows. \"Why should we look at Napoleon\r\nas the representative of the Revolution? there is scarcely a government\r\nin Europe which has not a revolutionary origin.\"\r\n\r\n  \"What is there now existing in the world of politics which has a\r\n  complete legal basis? Spain, Portugal, Brazil, all the American\r\n  Republics, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Greece, Sweden,\r\n  England, which State with full consciousness is based on the\r\n  Revolution of 1688, are all unable to trace back their legal\r\n  systems to a legitimate origin. Even as to the German princes we\r\n  cannot find any completely legitimate title for the ground which\r\n  they have won partly from the Emperor and the Empire, partly from\r\n  their fellow-princes, partly from the Estates.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes farther: the Revolution is not peculiar to France; it did not\r\neven originate there:\r\n\r\n  \"It is much older than the historical appearance of Napoleon's\r\n  family and far wider in its extent than France, if we are to\r\n  assign it an origin in this world, we must look for it, not in\r\n  France, but in England, or go back even earlier, even to Germany\r\n  or Rome, according as we regard the exaggerations of the\r\n  Reformation or of the Roman Church as responsible.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Napoleon is not the sole representative of revolutions, why make\r\nopposition to him a matter of principle? He shews no desire of\r\npropagandism.\r\n\r\n  \"To threaten other States by means of the Revolution has been for\r\n  years the trade of England, and this principle of not associating\r\n  with a revolutionary power is itself quite modern: it is not to\r\n  be found in the last century. Cromwell was addressed as Brother\r\n  by European potentates and they sought his friendship when it\r\n  appeared useful. The most honourable Princes joined in alliance\r\n  with the States-General before they were recognised by Spain. Why\r\n  should Prussia now alone, to its own injury, adopt this excessive\r\n  caution?\"\r\n\r\nHe goes farther: not only does he reject the principle of\r\nlegitimacy,--he refuses to be bound by any principles; he did not free\r\nhimself from one party to bind himself to another; his profession was\r\ndiplomacy and in diplomacy there was no place for feelings of affection\r\nand antipathy.\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper use of principles in diplomacy? It is to persuade\r\nothers to adopt a policy which is convenient to oneself.\r\n\r\n  \"My attitude towards Foreign Governments springs not from any\r\n  antipathy, but from the good or evil they may do to Prussia.\" \"A\r\n  policy of sentiment is dangerous, for it is one-sided; it is an\r\n  exclusively Prussian peculiarity.\" \"Every other Government makes\r\n  its own interests the sole criterion of its actions, however much\r\n  it may drape them in phrases about justice and sympathy.\" \"My\r\n  ideal for foreign policy is freedom from prejudice; that our\r\n  decisions should be independent of all impressions of dislike or\r\n  affection for Foreign States and their governments.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the canon by which he directed his own actions, and he expected\r\nobedience to it from others.\r\n\r\n  \"So far as foreigners go I have never in my life had sympathy for\r\n  anyone but England and its inhabitants, and I am even now not\r\n  free from it; but they will not let us love them, and as soon as\r\n  it was proved to me that it was in the interest of a sound and\r\n  well-matured Prussian policy, I would let our troops fire on\r\n  French, English, Russian, or Austrian, with the same\r\n  satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n  \"I cannot justify sympathies and antipathies as regards Foreign\r\n  Powers and persons before my feeling of duty in the foreign\r\n  service of my country, either in myself or another; therein lies\r\n  the embryo of disloyalty against my master or my country. In my\r\n  opinion not even the King himself has the right to subordinate\r\n  the interests of his country to his own feelings of love or\r\n  hatred towards strangers; he is, however, responsible towards God\r\n  and not to me if he does so, and therefore on this point I am\r\n  silent.\"\r\n\r\nThis reference to the King is very characteristic. Holding, as he did,\r\nso high an ideal of public duty himself, he naturally regarded with\r\ngreat dislike the influence which, too often, family ties and domestic\r\naffection exercised over the mind of the sovereign. The German Princes\r\nhad so long pursued a purely domestic policy that they forgot to\r\ndistinguish between the interests of their families and their land. They\r\nwere, moreover, naturally much influenced in their public decisions, not\r\nonly by their personal sympathies, but also by the sympathies and\r\nopinions of their nearest relations. To a man like Bismarck, who\r\nregarded duty to the State as above everything, nothing could be more\r\ndisagreeable than to see the plans of professional statesmen criticised\r\nby irresponsible people and perhaps overthrown through some woman's\r\nwhim. He was a confirmed monarchist but he was no courtier. In his\r\nletters at this period he sometimes refers to the strong influence which\r\nthe Princess of Prussia exercised over her husband, who was heir to the\r\nthrone. He regarded with apprehension the possible effects which the\r\nproposed marriage of the Prince of Prussia's son to the Princess Royal\r\nof England might have on Prussian policy. He feared it would introduced\r\nEnglish influence and Anglomania without their gaining any similar\r\ninfluence in England. \"If our future Queen remains in any degree\r\nEnglish, I see our Court surrounded by English influence.\" He was not\r\ninfluenced in this by any hostility to England; almost at the same time\r\nhe had written that England was the only foreign country for which he\r\nhad any sympathy. He was only (as so often) contending for that\r\nindependence and self-reliance which he so admired in the English. For\r\ntwo hundred years English traditions had absolutely forbidden the\r\nsovereign to allow his personal and family sympathies to interfere with\r\nthe interests of the country. If the House of Hohenzollern were to\r\naspire to the position of a national monarch it must act in the same\r\nway. At this very time the Emperor Napoleon was discussing the Prussian\r\nmarriage with Lord Clarendon. \"It will much influence the policy of the\r\nQueen in favour of Prussia,\" he said. \"No, your Majesty,\" answered the\r\nEnglish Ambassador. \"The private feelings of the Queen can never have\r\nany influence on that which she believes to be for the honour and\r\nwelfare of England.\" This was the feeling by which Bismarck was\r\ninfluenced; he was trying to educate his King, and this was the task to\r\nwhich for many years he was devoted. What he thought of the duties of\r\nprinces we see from an expression he uses in a letter to Manteuffel:\r\n\"Only Christianity can make princes what they ought to be, and free them\r\nfrom that conception of life which causes many of them to seek in the\r\nposition given them by God nothing but the means to a life of pleasure\r\nand irresponsibility.\" All his attempts to win over the King and Gerlach\r\nto his point of view failed; the only result was that his old friends\r\nbegan to look on him askance; his new opinions were regarded with\r\nsuspicion. He was no longer sure of his position in Court; his\r\noutspokenness had caused offence; after reading his last letter, Gerlach\r\nanswered: \"Your explanation only shews me that we are now far asunder\";\r\nthe correspondence, which had continued for almost seven years,\r\nstopped. Bismarck felt that he was growing lonely; he had to accustom\r\nhimself to the thought that the men who had formerly been both\r\npolitically and personally his close friends, and who had once welcomed\r\nhim whenever he returned to Berlin, now desired to see him kept at a\r\ndistance. In one of his last letters to Gerlach, he writes: \"I used to\r\nbe a favourite; now all that is changed. His Majesty has less often the\r\nwish to see me; the ladies of the Court have a cooler smile than\r\nformerly; the gentlemen press my hand less warmly. The high opinion of\r\nmy usefulness is sunk, only the Minister [Manteuffel] is warmer and more\r\nfriendly.\" Something of this was perhaps exaggerated, but there was no\r\ndoubt that a breach had begun which was to widen and widen: Bismarck was\r\nno longer a member of the party of the _Kreuz Zeitung_. It was fortunate\r\nthat a change was imminent in the direction of the Prussian Government;\r\nthe old figures who had played their part were to pass away and a new\r\nera was to begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG AND PARIS.\r\n\r\n1858-1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1857 the health of the King of Prussia broke down; he\r\nwas unable to conduct the affairs of State and in the month of September\r\nwas obliged to appoint his brother as his representative to carry on the\r\nGovernment. There was from the first no hope for his recovery; the\r\ncommission was three times renewed and, after a long delay, in October\r\nof the following year, the King signed a decree appointing his brother\r\nRegent. At one time, in the spring of 1858, the Prince had, it is said,\r\nthought of calling on Bismarck to form a Ministry. This, however, was\r\nnot done. It was, however, one of the first actions of the Prince Regent\r\nto request Manteuffel's resignation; he formed a Ministry of moderate\r\nLiberals, choosing as President the Prince of Hohenzollern, head of the\r\nCatholic branch of his own family.\r\n\r\nThe _new era_, as it was called, was welcomed with delight by all\r\nparties except the most extreme Conservatives. No Ministry had been so\r\nunpopular as that of Manteuffel. At the elections which took place\r\nimmediately, the Government secured a large majority. The Prince and his\r\nMinisters were able to begin their work with the full support of\r\nParliament and country.\r\n\r\nBismarck did not altogether regret the change; his differences with the\r\ndominant faction at Court had extended to the management of home as well\r\nas of foreign affairs; for the last two years he had been falling out of\r\nfavour. He desired, moreover, to see fresh blood in the Chamber.\r\n\r\n  \"The disease to which our Parliamentary life has succumbed, is,\r\n  besides the incapacity of the individual, the servility of the\r\n  Lower House. The majority has no independent convictions, it is\r\n  the tool of ministerial omnipotence. If our Chambers do not\r\n  succeed in binding the public interest to themselves and drawing\r\n  the attention of the country, they will sooner or later go to\r\n  their grave without sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nCurious it is to see how his opinion as to the duties and relations of\r\nthe House towards the Government were to alter when he himself became\r\nMinister. He regarded it as an advantage that the Ministry would have\r\nthe power which comes from popularity; his only fear was that they might\r\ndraw the Regent too much to the left; but he hoped that in German and\r\nforeign affairs they would act with more decision, that the Prince would\r\nbe free from the scruples which had so much influenced his brother, and\r\nthat he would not fear to rely on the military strength of Prussia.\r\n\r\nOne of their first acts was to recall Bismarck from Frankfort; the\r\nchange was inevitable, and he had foreseen it. The new Government\r\nnaturally wished to be able to start clear in their relations to\r\nAustria; the Prince Regent did not wish to commit himself from the\r\nbeginning to a policy of hostility. It was, however, impossible for a\r\ncordial co-operation between the two States to be established in German\r\naffairs so long as Bismarck remained at Frankfort; the opinions which he\r\nhad formed during the last eight years were too well known. It was,\r\nmoreover, evident that a crisis in the relations with Austria was\r\napproaching; war between France and Austria was imminent; a new factor\r\nand a new man had appeared in Europe,--Piedmont and Cavour.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1858, Cavour had had a secret and decisive interview with\r\nNapoleon at Plombières; the two statesmen had come to an agreement by\r\nwhich France engaged to help the Piedmontese to expel the Austrians from\r\nItaly. Bismarck would have desired to seize this opportunity, and use\r\nthe embarrassment of Austria as the occasion for taking a stronger\r\nposition in Germany; if it were necessary he was prepared to go as far\r\nas an alliance with France. He was influenced not so much by sympathy\r\nwith Piedmont, for, as we have seen, he held that those who were\r\nresponsible for foreign policy should never give way to sympathy, but by\r\nthe simple calculation that Austria was the common enemy of Prussia and\r\nPiedmont, and where there were common interests an alliance might be\r\nformed. The Government were, however, not prepared to adopt this\r\npolicy. It might have been supposed that a Liberal Ministry would have\r\nshewn more sympathy with the Italian aspirations than the Conservatives\r\nwhom they had succeeded. This was not the case, as Cavour himself soon\r\nfound out.\r\n\r\nAfter his visit to Plombières, Cavour had hurried across the frontier\r\nand spent two days at Baden-Baden, where he met the Prince of Prussia,\r\nManteuffel, who was still Minister, and other German statesmen. Bismarck\r\nhad been at Baden-Baden in the previous week and returned a few days\r\nlater; he happened, however, on the two days when Cavour was there, to\r\nbe occupied with his duties at Frankfort; the two great statesmen\r\ntherefore never met. Cavour after his visit wrote to La Marmora saying\r\nthat he had been extremely pleased with the sympathy which had been\r\ndisplayed to him, both by the Prince and the other Prussians. So far as\r\nhe could foresee, the attitude of Prussia would not be hostile to\r\nItalian aspirations. In December, however, after the change of Ministry,\r\nhe writes to the Italian Envoy at Frankfort that the language of\r\nSchleinitz, the new Foreign Minister, is less favourable than that of\r\nhis predecessor. The Cabinet do not feel the same antipathy to Austria\r\nas that of Manteuffel did; German ideas have brought about a\r\nrapprochement.\r\n\r\n  \"I do not trust their apparently Liberal tendencies. It is\r\n  possible that your colleague, Herr von Bismarck, will support us\r\n  more closely, but I fear that even if he is kept at Frankfort he\r\n  will not exercise so much influence as under the former\r\n  Ministry.\"\r\n\r\nCavour's insight did not deceive him. The Italian question had for the\r\nmoment re-awakened the old sympathy for Austria; Austria, it seemed, was\r\nnow the champion of German nationality against the unscrupulous\r\naggression of France. There were few men who, like Bismarck, were\r\nwilling to disregard this national feeling and support the Italians. To\r\nhave deliberately joined Napoleon in what after all was an unprovoked\r\nattack on a friendly prince of the same nation, was an act which could\r\nhave been undertaken only by a man of the calibre of Frederick the\r\nGreat. After all, Austria was German; the Austrian provinces in Italy\r\nhad been assigned to the Emperor by the same authority as the Polish\r\nprovinces to Prussia. We can imagine how great would have been the\r\noutcry had Austria joined with the French to set up a united Poland,\r\ntaking Posen and West Prussia for the purpose; and yet this act would\r\nhave been just of the same kind as that which would have been committed\r\nhad Prussia at this time joined or even lent diplomatic support to the\r\nFrench-Italian alliance. It is very improbable that even if Bismarck had\r\nbeen Minister at this period he would have been able to carry out this\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Government acted on the whole correctly. As the war became\r\nmore imminent the Prince Regent prepared the Prussian army and\r\neventually the whole was placed on a war footing. He offered to the\r\nEmperor of Austria his armed neutrality and a guarantee of the Austrian\r\npossessions in Italy. In return he required that he himself should have\r\nthe command of all the forces of the German Diet. Had Austria accepted\r\nthese terms, either the war would have been stopped or the whole force\r\nof Germany under the King of Prussia would have attacked France on the\r\nRhine. The Emperor however refused to accept them; he required a\r\nguarantee not only of his possessions in Italy but also of his treaties\r\nwith the other Italian princes. Moreover, he would accept the assistance\r\nof Prussia only on condition that the Prussian army was placed under the\r\norders of the general appointed by the Diet. It was absurd to suppose\r\nthat any Prussian statesman would allow this. The action of Austria\r\nshewed in fact a distrust and hatred of Prussia which more than\r\njustified all that Bismarck had written during his tenure of office at\r\nFrankfort. In the end, rather than accept Prussian assistance on the\r\nterms on which it was offered, the Emperor of Austria made peace with\r\nFrance; he preferred to surrender Lombardy rather than save it by\r\nPrussian help. \"Thank God,\" said Cavour, \"Austria by her arrogance has\r\nsucceeded in uniting all the world against her.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring of the year was spent by Bismarck at St. Petersburg. He had\r\nbeen appointed Prussian Minister to that capital--put out in the cold,\r\nas he expressed it. From the point of dignity and position it was an\r\nadvance, but at St. Petersburg he was away from the centre of political\r\naffairs. Russia had not yet recovered from the effects of the Crimean\r\nWar; the Czar was chiefly occupied with internal reforms and the\r\nemancipation of the serfs. The Eastern Question was dormant, and Russia\r\ndid not aim at keeping a leading part in the settlement of Italian\r\naffairs. Bismarck's immediate duties were not therefore important and he\r\nno longer had the opportunity of giving his advice to the Government\r\nupon the general practice. It is improbable that Herr von Schleinitz\r\nwould have welcomed advice. He was one of the weakest of the Ministry;\r\nan amiable man of no very marked ability, who owed his position to the\r\npersonal friendship of the Prince Regent and his wife. The position\r\nwhich Bismarck had occupied during the last few years could not but be\r\nembarrassing to any Minister; this man still young, so full of\r\nself-confidence, so unremitting in his labours, who, while other\r\ndiplomatists thought only of getting through their routine work, spent\r\nthe long hours of the night in writing despatches, discussing the whole\r\nforeign policy of the country, might well cause apprehension even to the\r\nstrongest Minister.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Bismarck's departure from Frankfort our knowledge of\r\nhis official despatches ceases; we lose the invaluable assistance of his\r\nletters to Manteuffel and Gerlach. For some time he stood so much alone\r\nthat there was no one to whom he could write unreservedly on political\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHe watched with great anxiety the progress of affairs with regard to\r\nItaly. At the beginning of May he wrote a long letter to Schleinitz, as\r\nhe had done to Manteuffel, urging him to bold action; he recounted his\r\nexperiences at the Diet, he reiterated his conviction that no good would\r\ncome to Prussia from the federal tie--the sooner it was broken the\r\nbetter; nothing was so much to be desired as that the Diet should\r\noverstep its powers, and pass some resolution which Prussia could not\r\naccept, so that Prussia could take up the glove and force a breach. The\r\nopportunity was favourable for a revision of the Constitution. \"I see,\"\r\nhe wrote \"in our Federal connection only a weakness of Prussia which\r\nsooner or later must be cured, _ferro et igni_.\" Probably Schleinitz's\r\nanswer was not of such a kind as to tempt him to write again. In his\r\nprivate letters he harps on the same string; he spent June in a visit to\r\nMoscow but he hurried back at the end of the month to St. Petersburg to\r\nreceive news of the war. Before news had come of the peace of\r\nVillafranca he was constantly in dread that Prussia would go to war on\r\nbehalf of Austria:\r\n\r\n  \"We have prepared too soon and too thoroughly, the weight of\r\n  the burden we have taken on ourselves is drawing us down the\r\n  incline. We shall not be even an Austrian reserve; we shall\r\n  simply sacrifice ourselves for Austria and take away the war from\r\n  her.\"\r\n\r\nHow disturbed he was, we can see by the tone of religious resignation\r\nwhich he assumes--no doubt a sign that he fears his advice has not yet\r\nbeen acted upon.\r\n\r\n  \"As God will. Everything here is only a question of time; peoples\r\n  and men, wisdom and folly, war and peace, they come and go like\r\n  rain and water, and the sea alone remains. There is nothing on\r\n  earth but hypocrisy and deceit.\"\r\n\r\nThe language of this and other letters was partly due to the state of\r\nhis health; the continual anxiety and work of his life at Frankfort,\r\njoined to irregular hours and careless habits, had told upon his\r\nconstitution. He fell seriously ill in St. Petersburg with a gastric and\r\nrheumatic affection; an injury to the leg received while shooting in\r\nSweden, became painful; the treatment adopted by the doctor, bleeding\r\nand iodine, seems to have made him worse. At the beginning of July,\r\n1860, he returned on leave to Berlin; there he was laid up for ten days;\r\nhis wife was summoned and under her care he began to improve. August he\r\nspent at Wiesbaden and Nauheim, taking the waters, the greater part of\r\nthe autumn in Berlin; in October he had to go Warsaw officially to\r\nreceive and accompany the Czar, who came to Breslau for an interview\r\nwith the Prince Regent. From Breslau he hurried back to Berlin, from\r\nBerlin down to Pomerania, where his wife was staying with her father;\r\nthen the same week back to Berlin, and started for St. Petersburg. The\r\nresult of these long journeys when his health was not completely\r\nreestablished was very serious. He was to spend a night on the journey\r\nto St. Petersburg with his old friend, Herr von Below, at Hohendorf, in\r\nEast Prussia; he had scarcely reached the house when he fell dangerously\r\nill of inflammation of the lungs and rheumatic fever. He remained here\r\nall the winter, and it was not until the beginning of March, 1860, that\r\nhe was well enough to return to Berlin. Leopold von Gerlach, who met him\r\nshortly afterwards, speaks of him as still looking wretchedly ill. This\r\nprolonged illness forms an epoch in his life. He never recovered the\r\nfreshness and strength of his youth. It left a nervous irritation and\r\nrestlessness which often greatly interfered with his political work and\r\nmade the immense labour which came upon him doubly distasteful. He loses\r\nthe good humour which had been characteristic of him in early life; he\r\nbecame irritable and more exacting. He spent the next three months in\r\nBerlin attending the meetings of the Herrenhaus, and giving a silent\r\nvote in favour of the Government measures; he considered it was his duty\r\nas a servant of the State to support the Government, though he did not\r\nagree with the Liberal policy which in internal affairs they adopted. At\r\nthis time he stood almost completely alone. His opinions on the Italian\r\nquestion had brought about a complete breach with his old friends. Since\r\nthe conclusion of the war, public opinion in Germany, as in England, had\r\nveered round. The success of Cavour had raised a desire to imitate him;\r\na strong impulse had been given to the national feeling, and a society,\r\nthe _National Verein_, had been founded to further the cause of United\r\nGermany under Prussian leadership. The question of the recognition of\r\nthe new Kingdom of Italy was becoming prominent; all the Liberal party\r\nlaid much stress on this. The Prince Regent, however, was averse to an\r\nact by which he might seem to express his approval of the forcible\r\nexpulsion of princes from their thrones. As the national and liberal\r\nfeeling in the country grew, his monarchical principles seemed to be\r\nstrengthened. The opinions which Bismarck was known to hold on the\r\nFrench alliance had got into the papers and were much exaggerated; he\r\nhad plenty of enemies to take care that it should be said that he wished\r\nPrussia to join with France; to do as Piedmont had done, and by the\r\ncession of the left bank of the Rhine to France to receive the\r\nassistance of Napoleon in annexing the smaller states. In his letters of\r\nthis period Bismarck constantly protests against the truth of these\r\naccusations. \"If I am to go to the devil,\" he writes, \"it will at least\r\nnot be a French one. Do not take me for a Bonapartist, only for a very\r\nambitious Prussian.\" It is at this time that his last letter to Gerlach\r\nwas written. They had met at the end of April, and Gerlach wrote to\r\nprotest against the opinion to which Bismarck had given expression:\r\n\r\n  \"After the conversation which I have had with you I was\r\n  particularly distressed that, by your bitterness against Austria,\r\n  you had allowed yourself to be diverted from the simple attitude\r\n  towards law and the Revolution. For you an alliance with France\r\n  and Piedmont is a possibility, a thought which is far from me\r\n  and, dear Bismarck, ought to be far from you. For me Louis\r\n  Napoleon is even more than his uncle the incarnation of the\r\n  Revolution, and Cavour is a Rheinbund Minister like Montgellas.\r\n  You cannot and ought not to deny the principles of the Holy\r\n  Alliance; they are no other than that authority comes from God,\r\n  and that the Princes must govern as servants appointed by God.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck answers the letter the next day:\r\n\r\n  \"I am a child of other times than you. No one loses the mark\r\n  impressed on him in the period of his youth. In you the\r\n  victorious hatred of Bonaparte is indelible; you call him the\r\n  incarnation of the Revolution and if you knew of any worse name\r\n  you would bestow it upon him. I have lived in the country from my\r\n  twenty-third to my thirty-second year and will never be rid of\r\n  the longing to be back again; I am in politics with only half my\r\n  heart; what dislike I have of France is based rather on the\r\n  Orleans than the Bonapartist régime. It is opposed to\r\n  bureaucratic corruption under the mask of constitutional\r\n  government. I should be glad to fight against Bonaparte till the\r\n  dogs lick up the blood but with no more malice than against\r\n  Croats, Bohemians, and Bamberger fellow-countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nThe two friends were never to meet again. The old King of Prussia died\r\nat the beginning of the next year, and Gerlach, who had served him so\r\nfaithfully, though perhaps not always wisely, survived his master\r\nscarcely a week.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1860 Bismarck returned to his duties in Russia; and\r\nthis time, with the exception of a fortnight in October, he spent a\r\nwhole year in St. Petersburg. He had still not recovered from the\r\neffects of his illness and could not, therefore, go out much in society,\r\nbut he was much liked at Court and succeeded in winning the confidence\r\nboth of the Emperor and his family. His wife and children were now with\r\nhim, and after the uncertainty of his last two years he settled down\r\nwith pleasure to a quieter mode of life. He enjoyed the sport which he\r\nhad in the Russian forests; he studied Russian and made himself\r\ncompletely at home. Political work he had little to do, except what\r\narose from the charge of \"some 200,000 vagabond Prussians\" who lived in\r\nRussia. Of home affairs he had little knowledge:\r\n\r\n  \"I am quite separated from home politics, as besides the\r\n  newspapers I receive scarcely anything but official news which\r\n  does not expose the foundation of affairs.\"\r\n\r\nFor the time the reports of his entering the Ministry had ceased; he\r\nprofessed to be, and perhaps was, quite satisfied.\r\n\r\n  \"I am quite contented with my existence here; I ask for no change\r\n  in my position until it be God's will I settle down quietly at\r\n  Schönhausen or Reinfeld and can leisurely set about having my\r\n  coffin made.\"\r\n\r\nIn October he had to attend the Czar on a journey to Warsaw where he had\r\nan interview with the Prince Regent. The Prince was accompanied by his\r\nMinister-President, the Prince of Hohenzollern, who took the opportunity\r\nof having long conversations with the Ambassador to St. Petersburg. It\r\nis said that as a result of this the Minister, who wished to be relieved\r\nfrom a post which was daily becoming more burdensome, advised the Prince\r\nRegent to appoint Bismarck Minister-President. The advice, however, was\r\nnot taken.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were taking place in Prussia which were to bring about\r\nimportant constitutional changes. The success of the Ministry of the\r\n_new era_ had not answered the expectations of the country. Their\r\nforeign policy had been correct, but they had shewn no more spirit than\r\ntheir predecessors, and the country was in that excited state in which\r\npeople wanted to see some brilliant and exciting stroke of policy,\r\nthough they were not at all clear what it was they desired. Then a rift\r\nhad begun to grow between the Regent and his Ministers. The Liberalism\r\nof the Prince had never been very deep; it owed its origin in fact\r\nchiefly to his opposition to the reactionary government of his brother.\r\nAs an honest man he intended to govern strictly in accordance with the\r\nConstitution. He had, however, from the beginning no intention of\r\nallowing the Chambers to encroach upon the prerogatives of the Crown.\r\nThe Ministers on the other hand regarded themselves to some extent as a\r\nParliamentary Ministry; they had a majority in the House and they were\r\ninclined to defer to it. The latent causes of difference were brought\r\ninto activity by the question of army reform.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Regent was chiefly and primarily a soldier. As a second son\r\nit had been doubtful whether he would ever succeed to the throne. He had\r\nan intimate acquaintance with the whole condition of the army, and he\r\nhad long known that in many points reform was necessary. His first\r\naction on succeeding his brother was to appoint a Commission of the War\r\nOffice to prepare a scheme of reorganisation. A memorandum had been\r\ndrawn up for him by Albert von Roon, and with some alterations it was\r\naccepted by the Commission. The Minister of War, Bonin (the same who had\r\nbeen dismissed in 1854 at the crisis of the Eastern complications),\r\nseems to have been indifferent in the matter; he did not feel in himself\r\nthe energy for carrying through an important reform which he had not\r\nhimself originated, and of which perhaps he did not altogether approve.\r\nThe Prince Regent had set his mind upon the matter; the experience\r\ngained during the mobilisation of 1859 had shewn how serious the defects\r\nwere; the army was still on a war footing and it was a good opportunity\r\nfor at once carrying through the proposed changes. Bonin therefore\r\nresigned his office and Roon, in December, 1859, was appointed in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThis appointment was to have far-reaching results; it at once destroyed\r\nall harmony in the Ministry itself. The rest of the Ministers were\r\nLiberals. Roon was a strong Conservative. He was appointed professedly\r\nmerely as a departmental Minister, but he soon won more confidence with\r\nthe Regent than all the others. He was a man of great energy of\r\ncharacter and decision in action. The best type of Prussian officer, to\r\nconsiderable learning he joined a high sense of duty founded on\r\ndeep-rooted and simple religious faith. The President of the Ministry\r\nhad practically retired from political life and the Government had no\r\nlonger a leader. Roon's introduction was in fact the beginning of all\r\nthe momentous events which were to follow. But for him there would have\r\nbeen no conflict in the Parliament and Bismarck would never have become\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1860 the project of law embodying the proposals for\r\narmy reform was laid before the Lower House. It was ordered by them in\r\naccordance with the practice to be referred to a small Committee.\r\n\r\nThe proposals consisted of (a) an increase in the number of recruits to\r\nbe raised each year, (b) a lengthening of the term of service with the\r\ncolours, (c) an alteration in the relations of the Landwehr to the rest\r\nof the army.\r\n\r\nThe Committee appointed to consider these reforms accepted the first,\r\nbut rejected the second and third. They asserted that the three years'\r\nservice with the colours was not necessary, and they strongly disliked\r\nany proposal for interfering with the Landwehr. The report of the\r\nCommittee was accepted by the House. It was in vain that the more\r\nfar-seeing members of the Liberal party tried to persuade their leaders\r\nto support the Government; it was in vain that the Ministers pointed out\r\nthat the Liberal majority had been elected as a Government majority, and\r\nit was their duty to support Ministers taken from their own party. The\r\nlaw had to be withdrawn and the Government, instead, asked for a vote of\r\nnine million thalers, provisionally, for that year only, as a means of\r\nmaintaining the army in the state to which it had been raised. In asking\r\nfor this vote it was expressly stated that the principles of the\r\norganisation should be in no wise prejudiced.\r\n\r\n  \"The question whether in future a two or three years' service\r\n  shall be required; whether the period with the Reserve shall be\r\n  extended; in what position the Landwehr shall be placed--all this\r\n  is not touched by the present proposal.\"\r\n\r\nOn this condition the House voted the money required, but for one year\r\nonly. The Government, however, did not keep this pledge; the Minister\r\nof War simply continued to carry out the reorganisation in accordance\r\nwith the plan which had been rejected; new regiments were formed, and by\r\nthe end of the year the whole army had been reorganised. This action was\r\none for which the Prince and Roon were personally responsible; it was\r\ndone while the other Ministers were away from Berlin, and without their\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen the House met at the beginning of the next year they felt that they\r\nhad been deceived; they were still more indignant when Roon informed\r\nthem that he had discovered that the whole of the reorganisation could\r\nbe legally carried through in virtue of the prerogative of the Crown,\r\nand that a fresh law was not required; that therefore the consideration\r\nof the changes was not before the House, and that all they would have to\r\ndo would be to vote the money to pay for them. Of course the House\r\nrefused to vote the money; after long debates the final settlement of\r\nthe question was postponed for another year; the House, though this time\r\nby a majority of only eleven votes, granting with a few modifications\r\nthe required money, but again for one year only.\r\n\r\nAll this time Bismarck was living quietly at St. Petersburg; he had no\r\ninfluence on affairs, for the military law had nothing to do with him,\r\nand the Regent did not consult him on foreign policy. No one, however,\r\nprofited by Roon's appointment so much as he; he had once more a friend\r\nand supporter at Court, who replaced the loss of Gerlach. Roon and he\r\nhad known one another in the old Pomeranian days. There was a link in\r\nMoritz Blankenburg, who was a \"Dutz\" friend of Bismarck's and Roon's\r\ncousin. We can understand how untenable Roon's position was when we find\r\nthe Minister of War choosing as his political confidants two of the\r\nleaders of the party opposed to the Ministry to which he belonged.\r\n\r\nEver since Roon had entered the Government there had been indeed a\r\nperpetual crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Ministers were lukewarm in their support of the military\r\nbill; they only consented to adopt it on condition that the King would\r\ngive his assent to those measures which they proposed to introduce, in\r\norder to maintain their positions as leaders of the party; they proposed\r\nto bring in bills for the reform of the House of Lords, for the\r\nresponsibility of Ministers, for local government. These were opposed to\r\nthe personal opinions of the King; he was supported in his opposition by\r\nRoon and refused his assent, but he neither dismissed the Ministers nor\r\ndid they resign. So long as they were willing to hold office on the\r\nterms he required, there was indeed no reason why he should dismiss\r\nthem; to do so would be to give up the last hope of getting the military\r\nBill passed. All through 1861 the same uncertainty continued; Roon\r\nindeed again and again wrote to his master, pointing out the necessity\r\nfor getting rid of his colleagues; he wished for a Conservative Ministry\r\nwith Bismarck as President. Here, he thought, was the only man who had\r\nthe courage to carry through the army reform. Others thought as he did.\r\nWho so fitted to come to the help of the Crown as this man who, ten\r\nyears before, had shewn such ability in Parliamentary debate? And\r\nwhenever the crisis became more acute, all the Quidnuncs of Berlin shook\r\ntheir heads and said, \"Now we shall have a Bismarck Ministry, and that\r\nwill be a _coup d'état_ and the overthrow of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck meanwhile was living quietly at St. Petersburg, awaiting\r\nevents. At last the summons came; on June 28, 1861, Roon telegraphed to\r\nhim that the pear was ripe; he must come at once; there was danger in\r\ndelay. His telegram was followed by a letter, in which he more fully\r\nexplained the situation. The immediate cause of the crisis was that the\r\nKing desired to celebrate his accession, as his brother had done, by\r\nreceiving the solemn homage of all his people; the Ministry refused\r\ntheir assent to an act which would appear to the country as \"feudal\" and\r\nreactionary. A solemn pledge of obedience to the King was the last thing\r\nthe Liberals wanted to give, just for the same reasons that the King\r\nmade a point of receiving it; his feelings were deeply engaged, and Roon\r\ndoubtless hoped that his colleagues would at last be compelled to\r\nresign; he wished, therefore, to have Bismarck on the spot.\r\n\r\nBismarck could not leave St. Petersburg for some days; he, however,\r\nanswered by a telegram and a long letter; he begins in a manner\r\ncharacteristic of all his letters at this period:\r\n\r\n  \"Your letter disturbed me in my comfortable meditations on the\r\n  quiet time which I was going to enjoy at Reinfeld. Your cry 'to\r\n  horse' came with a shrill discord. I have grown ill in mind,\r\n  tired out, and spiritless since I lost the foundation of my\r\n  health.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the end:\r\n\r\n  \"Moving, quarrelling, annoyance, the whole slavery day and night\r\n  form a perspective, which already makes me homesick for Reinfeld\r\n  or St. Petersburg. I cannot enter the swindle in better company\r\n  than yours; but both of us were happier on the Sadower Heath\r\n  behind the partridges.\"\r\n\r\nSo he wrote late at night, but the next morning in a postscript he\r\nadded: \"If the King will to some extent meet my views, then I will set\r\nto the work with pleasure.\" In the letter he discusses at length the\r\nprogramme; he does not attach much importance to the homage; it would be\r\nmuch better to come to terms on the military question, break with the\r\nChamber, and dissolve. The real difficulty he sees, however, is foreign\r\npolicy; only by a change in the management of foreign affairs can the\r\nCrown be relieved from a pressure to which it must ultimately give way;\r\nhe would not himself be inclined to accept the Ministry of the Interior,\r\nbecause no good could be done unless the foreign policy was changed, and\r\nthat the King himself would probably not wish that.\r\n\r\n  \"The chief fault of our policy is that we have been Liberal at\r\n  home and Conservative abroad; we hold the rights of our own King\r\n  too cheap, and those of foreign princes too high; a natural\r\n  consequence of the difference between the constitutional tendency\r\n  of the Ministers and the legitimist direction which the will of\r\n  his Majesty gives to our foreign policy. Of the princely houses\r\n  from Naples to Hanover none will be grateful for our love, and we\r\n  practise towards them a truly evangelical love of our enemies at\r\n  the cost of the safety of our own throne. I am true to the sole\r\n  of my foot to my own princes, but towards all others I do not\r\n  feel in a single drop of blood the slightest obligation to raise\r\n  up a little finger to help them. In this attitude I fear that I\r\n  am so far removed from our Most Gracious Master, that he will\r\n  scarcely find me fitted to be a Councillor of his Crown. For this\r\n  reason he will anyhow prefer to use me at the Home-Office. In my\r\n  opinion, however, that makes no difference, for I promise myself\r\n  no useful results from the whole Government unless our attitude\r\n  abroad is more vigorous and less dependent on dynastic\r\n  sympathies.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck arrived in Berlin on July 9th. When he got there the crisis was\r\nover; Berlin was nearly empty; Roon was away in Pomerania, the King in\r\nBaden-Baden; a compromise had been arranged; there was not to be an act\r\nof homage but a coronation. There was, therefore, no more talk of his\r\nentering the Ministry; Schleinitz, however, told him that he was to be\r\ntransferred from Russia, but did not say what post he was to have. The\r\nnext day, in obedience to a command, he hurried off to Baden-Baden; the\r\nKing wished to have his advice on many matters of policy, and instructed\r\nhim to draw up a memorandum on the German question. He used the\r\nopportunity of trying to influence the King to adopt a bolder policy. At\r\nthe same time he attempted to win over the leaders of the Conservative\r\nparty. A general election was about to take place; the manifesto of the\r\nConservative party was so worded that we can hardly believe it was not\r\nan express and intentional repudiation of the language which Bismarck\r\nwas in the habit of using; they desired\r\n\r\n  \"the unity of our German fatherland, though not like the Kingdom\r\n  of Italy through 'blood and fire' [_Blut und Brand;_ almost the\r\n  words which Bismarck had used to describe the policy which must\r\n  be followed], but in the unity of its princes and peoples holding\r\n  firm to authority and law.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck, on hearing this, sent to his old friend Herr von Below, one of\r\nthe leaders of the party, a memorandum on German affairs, and\r\naccompanied it by a letter. He repeated his old point that Prussia was\r\nsacrificing the authority of the Crown at home to support that of other\r\nprinces in whose safety she had not the slightest interest. The\r\nsolidarity of Conservative interests was a dangerous fiction, unless it\r\nwas carried out with the fullest reciprocity; carried out by Prussia\r\nalone it was Quixotry; it prevented King and Government from executing\r\ntheir true task, the protection of Prussia from all injustice, whether\r\nit came from home or abroad; this was the task given to the King by God.\r\n\r\n  \"We make the unhistorical, the jealous, and lawless\r\n  mania for sovereignty of the German Princes the bosom\r\n  child of the Conservative party in Prussia, we are enthusiastic\r\n  for the petty sovereignties which were created\r\n  by Napoleon and protected by Metternich, and are blind\r\n  to the dangers which threaten Prussia and the independence\r\n  of Germany.\"\r\n\r\nHe wishes for a clear statement of their policy; a stricter\r\nconcentration of the German military forces, reform of the Customs'\r\nUnions, and a number of common institutions to protect material\r\ninterests against the disadvantages which arise from the unnatural\r\nconfiguration of the different states.\r\n\r\n  \"Besides all this I do not see why we should shrink\r\n  back so bashfully from the idea of a representation of\r\n  the people. We cannot fight as revolutionary an institution\r\n  which we Conservatives cannot do without even in\r\n  Prussia, and is recognised as legitimate in every German\r\n  State.\" [6]\r\n\r\nThis letter is interesting as shewing how nearly his wishes on German\r\naffairs coincided with those of the Liberal party and of the National\r\nVerein: he was asking the Conservatives to adopt the chief points in\r\ntheir opponents' programme. Of course they would not do so, and the King\r\nhimself was more likely to be alarmed than attracted by the bold and\r\nadventurous policy that was recommended to him. Bismarck's anticipation\r\nwas justified; the King was not prepared to appoint him Foreign\r\nMinister. Herr von Schleinitz indeed resigned, but his place was taken\r\nby Bernstorff, Minister at London; he had so little confidence in the\r\nsuccess of his office that he did not even give up his old post, and\r\noccupied the two positions, one of which Bismarck much desired to have.\r\n\r\nAfter attending the coronation at Königsberg, Bismarck, therefore,\r\nreturned to his old post at St. Petersburg; his future was still quite\r\nuncertain; he was troubled by his own health and that of his children;\r\nfor the first time he begins to complain of the cold.\r\n\r\n  \"Since my illness I am so exhausted that I have lost all my\r\n  energy for excitement. Three years ago I would have made a\r\n  serviceable Minister; when I think of such a thing now I feel\r\n  like a broken-down acrobat. I would gladly go to London, Paris,\r\n  or remain here, as it pleases God and his Majesty. I shudder at\r\n  the prospect of the Ministry as at a cold bath.\"\r\n\r\nIn March he is still in ignorance; his household is in a bad state.\r\n\r\n  \"Johanna has a cough, which quite exhausts her; Bill is in bed\r\n  with fever, the doctor does not yet know what is the matter with\r\n  him; the governess has no hope of ever seeing Germany again.\"\r\n\r\nHe does not feel up to taking the Ministry; even Paris would be too\r\nnoisy for him.\r\n\r\n  \"London is quieter; but for the climate and the children's\r\n  health, I would prefer to stay here. Berne is an old idea of\r\n  mine; dull places with pretty neighbourhoods suit old people;\r\n  only there is no sport there, as I do not like climbing after\r\n  chamois.\"\r\n\r\nThe decision depended on the events at home; the position of the\r\nGovernment was becoming untenable. The elections had been most\r\nunfavourable; the Radicals had ceased to efface themselves, the old\r\nleaders of 1848 had appeared again; they had formed a new party of\r\n\"Progressives,\" and had won over a hundred seats at the expense of the\r\nConservatives and the moderate Liberals; they were pledged not to carry\r\nout the military reforms and to insist on the two years' service. They\r\nintended to make the difference of opinion on this point the occasion of\r\na decisive struggle to secure and extend the control of the House over\r\nthe administration, and for this purpose to bring into prominence\r\nconstitutional questions which both Crown and Parliament had hitherto\r\navoided. From the day the session opened it was clear that there was now\r\nno chance of the money being voted for the army. Before the decisive\r\ndebate came on, the majority had taken the offensive and passed what was\r\na direct vote of want of confidence in the Ministry. On this the\r\nMinistry handed in their resignations to the King; their place was taken\r\nby members of the Conservative party and Parliament again dissolved\r\nafter sitting only six weeks. It was the end of the _new era_.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtful whether the new Ministers would have the skill and\r\nresolution to meet the crisis; they still were without a leader; Prince\r\nvon Hohenlohe, a member of the Protestant branch of the family to which\r\nthe present Chancellor of the Empire belongs, was appointed provisional\r\nPresident. The opinions of the country was clear enough; the elections\r\nresulted in the complete defeat not only of the Conservatives but of the\r\nmoderate Liberals; not a single one of the Ministers was returned. There\r\nwas, therefore, no doubt that the King would either have to give in on\r\nthe question of the army or to govern against the will of the majority\r\nof the Chamber. The struggle was no longer confined to the question of\r\nthe army; it was a formal conflict for power between the House and the\r\nCrown. The attempt to introduce a Parliamentary government which had\r\nbeen thwarted ten years before was now revived. Who could say what the\r\nend would be? All precedent seemed to shew that in a struggle between\r\nCrown and Parliament sooner or later the King must be beaten, unless,\r\nindeed, he was prepared to adopt the means which Napoleon used. The King\r\nwould not give in; he believed that the army reform was necessary to the\r\nsafety of his country; on the other hand, he was a man of too loyal a\r\ncharacter to have recourse to violence and a breach of the Constitution.\r\nIf, however, the Constitution proved to be of such a kind that it made\r\nit impossible for him to govern the country, he was prepared to retire\r\nfrom his post; the position would indeed be untenable if on his\r\nshoulders lay the responsibility of guiding the policy and defending the\r\ninterests of Prussia, and at the same time the country refused to grant\r\nhim the means of doing so.\r\n\r\nThe elections had taken place on May 6th; four days later Bismarck\r\narrived in Berlin; he had at last received his recall. As soon as he was\r\nseen in Berlin his appointment as Minister-President was expected; all\r\nthose who wished to maintain the authority of the Crown, looked on him\r\nas the only man who could face the danger. Roon was active, as usual, on\r\nhis side and was now supported by some of his colleagues, but\r\nSchleinitz, who had the support of the Queen, wished to be President\r\nhimself; there were long meetings of the Council and audiences of the\r\nKing; but the old influences were still at work; Bismarck did not wish\r\nto enter the Ministry except as Foreign Minister, and the King still\r\nfeared and distrusted him. An incident which occurred during these\r\ncritical days will explain to some extent the apprehensions which\r\nBismarck so easily awoke. The chronic difficulties with the Elector of\r\nHesse had culminated in an act of great discourtesy; the King of Prussia\r\nhad sent an autograph letter to the Elector by General Willisen; the\r\nElector on receiving it threw it unopened on the table; as the letter\r\ncontained the final demands of Prussia, the only answer was to put some\r\nof the neighbouring regiments on a war footing. Bernstorff took the\r\nopportunity of Bismarck's presence in Berlin to ask his advice; the\r\nanswer was: \"The circumstance that the Elector has thrown a royal letter\r\non the table is not a clever _casus belli_; if you want war, make me\r\nyour Under Secretary; I will engage to provide you a German civil war of\r\nthe best quality in a few weeks.\" The King might naturally fear that if\r\nhe appointed Bismarck, not Under Secretary, but Minister, he would in a\r\nfew weeks, whether he liked it or not, find himself involved in a German\r\ncivil war of the best quality. He wanted a man who would defend the\r\nGovernment before the Chambers with courage and ability; Bismarck, who\r\nhad gained his reputation as a debater, was the only man for the post.\r\nHe could have had the post of Minister of the Interior; he was offered\r\nthat of Minister-President without a Portfolio; but if he did not\r\nactually refuse, he strongly disapproved of the plan; he would not be\r\nable to get on with Bernstorff, and Schleinitz would probably interfere.\r\n\"I have no confidence in Bernstorff's eye for political matters; he\r\nprobably has none in mine.\" Bernstorff was \"too stiff,\" \"his collars\r\nwere too high.\" During these long discussions he wrote to his wife:\r\n\r\n  \"Our future is obscure as in Petersburg. Berlin is now to the\r\n  front; I do nothing one way or another; as soon as I have my\r\n  credentials for Paris in my pocket I will dance and sing. At\r\n  present there is no talk of London, but all may change again. I\r\n  scarcely get free of the discussions all day long; I do not find\r\n  the Ministers more united than their predecessors were.\"\r\n\r\nDisgusted with the long waiting and uncertainty he pressed for a\r\ndecision; after a fortnight's delay he was appointed Minister at Paris,\r\nbut this was in reality only a fresh postponement; nothing had really\r\nbeen decided; the King expressly told him not to establish himself\r\nthere. To his wife he wrote from Berlin:\r\n\r\n  \"I am very much pleased, but the shadow remains in the\r\n  background. I was already as good as caught for the Ministry.\r\n  Perhaps when I am out of their sight they will discover another\r\n  Minister-President. I expect to start for Paris to-morrow;\r\n  whether for long, God knows; perhaps only for a few months or\r\n  even weeks. They are all conspired together that I should stay\r\n  here. I have had to be very firm to get away from this hotel life\r\n  even for a time.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not really expect to be away more than ten days or a fortnight.\r\nAt a farewell audience just before he started, the King seems to have\r\nled him to expect that he would in a very few days be appointed as he\r\nwished, Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in Paris on the 30th, to take up his quarters in the empty\r\nEmbassy. He did not wait even to see his wife before starting and he\r\nwrote to her that she was not to take any steps towards joining him.\r\n\r\n  \"It is not decided that I am to stay here; I am in the middle of\r\n  Paris lonelier than you are in Reinfeld and sit here like a rat\r\n  in a deserted house. How long it will last God knows. Probably in\r\n  eight or ten days I shall receive a telegraphic summons to Berlin\r\n  and then game and dance is over. If my enemies knew what a\r\n  benefit they would confer on me by their victory and how\r\n  sincerely I wish it for them, Schleinitz out of pure malice would\r\n  probably do his best to bring me to Berlin.\"\r\n\r\nDay after day, however, went by and the summons did not come; on the\r\ncontrary Bernstorff wrote as though he were proposing to stay on; he did\r\nnot however, suggest giving up his post in London, Roon wrote that he\r\nhad raised the question in conversation with the King; that he had found\r\nthe old leaning towards Bismarck, and the old irresolution. The Chamber\r\nhad met, but the first few weeks of the session passed off with\r\nunexpected quiet and it was not till the autumn that the question of the\r\nBudget would come up. Bismarck wrote to Bernstorff to try and find out\r\nwhat was to happen to him, but the King, before whom the letter was\r\nlaid, was quite unable to come to any decision.\r\n\r\nBismarck therefore determined to use his enforced leisure in order to go\r\nacross to London for a few days. He had only visited England once as a\r\nyoung man, and, expecting as he did soon to be responsible for the\r\nconduct of foreign affairs, it was desirable that he should make the\r\npersonal acquaintance of the leading English statesmen. Undoubtedly, one\r\nof the reasons why he had been sent to Paris was that he might renew his\r\nacquaintance with the Emperor. There was also a second International\r\nExhibition and everyone was going to London. We have, unfortunately, no\r\nletters written from England; after his return he writes to Roon:\r\n\r\n  \"I have just come back from London; people there are much better\r\n  informed about China and Turkey than about Prussia. Loftus must\r\n  write more nonsense to his Ministers than I thought.\"\r\n\r\nThe only event of which we have any information was his meeting with Mr.\r\nDisraeli, who at that time was leader of the Opposition in the House of\r\nCommons; it took place at a dinner given by the Russian Ambassador to\r\nthe Grand Duchess of Saxe-Weimar. Among the guests was Count Vitzthum,\r\nSaxon Envoy; he saw Bismarck and Disraeli engaged in a long conversation\r\nafter dinner; afterwards the English statesman told him the substance of\r\nit. Bismarck had spoken as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"I shall soon be compelled to undertake the leadership of the\r\n  Prussian Government. My first care will be, with or without the\r\n  help of Parliament, to reorganise the army. The King has rightly\r\n  set himself this task; he cannot however carry it through with\r\n  his present councillors. When the army has been brought to such a\r\n  state as to command respect, then I will take the first\r\n  opportunity to declare war with Austria, burst asunder the German\r\n  Confederation, bring the middle and smaller States into\r\n  subjection, and give Germany a national union under the\r\n  leadership of Prussia. I have come here to tell this to the\r\n  Queen's Ministers.\"\r\n\r\nDisraeli added to Vitzthum, who, of course, as Saxon Envoy was much\r\ninterested: \"Take care of that man; he means what he says.\" It does not\r\nappear that Bismarck had an opportunity of explaining his project either\r\nto Lord Palmerston or to Lord Russell.\r\n\r\nAll through July he remained in Paris, to which he was called back in\r\norder to receive some despatches which after all never arrived; the same\r\nuncertainty continued; there was no work to be done there, Emperor and\r\nMinisters were going away; he was still all alone in the Embassy without\r\nservants, or furniture. As he wrote to his wife, he did not know what\r\nto have for dinner or what to eat it on. He therefore applied for leave;\r\nhe was himself of opinion that as the King would not immediately give\r\nhim the Foreign Office it was not yet time for him to enter the\r\nMinistry. Writing to Roon he advised that the Government should prolong\r\nthe conflict, draw the Chamber into disputes on small matters which\r\nwould weary the country; then when they were getting worn out and hoped\r\nthat the Government would meet them half-way so as to end the conflict,\r\nthen would be the time to summon him,\r\n\r\n  \"as a sign that we are far from giving up the battle. The\r\n  appearance of a new battalion in the Ministerial array would then\r\n  perhaps make an impression that would be wanting now, especially\r\n  if beforehand a commotion was created by expressions about a\r\n  _coup d'état_ and a new Constitution; then my own reputation for\r\n  careless violence would help me and people would think, 'now it\r\n  is coming!' Then, all the half-hearted would be inclined to\r\n  negotiation. I am astonished at the political incapacity of our\r\n  Chambers and yet we are an educated country. Undoubtedly too much\r\n  so; others are not cleverer but they have not the childish\r\n  self-confidence with which our political leaders publish their\r\n  incapacity in its complete nakedness as a model and pattern. How\r\n  have we Germans got the reputation of retiring modesty? There is\r\n  not a single one of us who does not think that he understands\r\n  everything, from strategy to picking the fleas off a dog, better\r\n  than professionals who have devoted their lives to it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only with difficulty he could even get leave of absence, for the\r\nKing was as irresolute as ever; as to the cause of the difficulty we get\r\nsome hint in Roon's letters. There was a party which was pushing\r\nSchleinitz, the only member of the Liberal Ministry who remained in\r\noffice; he had very influential support.\r\n\r\n  \"Her Majesty the Queen returns to Babelsburg on Sunday; she is\r\n  much agitated, there will be scenes; the temperature towards the\r\n  Ministry will fall to zero or below.\"\r\n\r\nHe eventually got away at the end of July with six weeks' leave of\r\nabsence; he travelled down to Bordeaux and Bayonne and across the\r\nPyrenees to San Sebastian; he was away from all news of the world; for\r\nweeks he scarcely saw even a German paper.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September he was at Toulouse; the sea-bathing, the\r\nmountain air, the freedom from work and anxiety, and the warmth had\r\ncompletely restored his health; for the first time since he went to St.\r\nPetersburg he had recovered his old spirit, his decision, and directness\r\nof action. He wrote that he must have some definite decision; otherwise\r\nhe would send in his resignation. \"My furniture is at St. Petersburg and\r\nwill be frozen up, my carriages are at Stettin, my horses at Berlin, my\r\nfamily in Pomerania, and I on the highroad.\" He was prepared to be his\r\nMajesty's Envoy at Paris but he was also ready at once to enter the\r\nMinistry. \"Only get me certainty, one way or another,\" he writes to\r\nRoon, \"and I will paint angels' wings on your photograph.\" Two days\r\nlater, just as a year before, he received a telegram from Roon telling\r\nhim to come at once. On the 17th he was in Paris and on the morning of\r\nthe 20th he arrived in Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe long-delayed crisis had at last come; the debates on the Budget and\r\nthe vote for the army reform began on September 11th; it was continued\r\nfor five days, and at the end the House, by a majority of 273 to 62,\r\nrefused the money required for the increased establishment. The result\r\nof this vote would be that if the wishes of the House were carried out,\r\nthe whole of the expenditure which had already been made for eight\r\nmonths of the current year was illegal; moreover, the regiments which\r\nhad already existed for two years must be disbanded. It was a vote which\r\ncould not possibly be carried into effect, as the money had already been\r\nspent. At a meeting of the Ministry which was held the next morning, the\r\nmajority, including this time even Roon, seemed to have been inclined to\r\nattempt a compromise. The King alone remained firm. When he had heard\r\nthe opinion of all the Ministers, he rose and said that in that case it\r\nwould be impossible for him to carry on the Government any longer; it\r\nwould only remain for him to summon the Crown Prince. As he said this he\r\nput his hand on the bell to call a messenger. The Ministers all sprang\r\nfrom their chairs and assured him that he might depend upon them, and\r\nthey would support him to the end. Such were the circumstances in which\r\nRoon summoned Bismarck. None the less the influence of the Queen and the\r\nCrown Prince were so strong that the King still doubted whether he\r\nought to continue the struggle; on one thing he was determined, that if\r\nhe had to give way he would abdicate. Two days later he again asked Roon\r\nhis advice. \"Appoint Bismarck Minister-President,\" was the answer. \"But\r\nhe is not here, he will not accept,\" objected the King, referring\r\ndoubtless to the difficulties which Bismarck had raised formerly. \"He is\r\nin Berlin at this moment,\" said Roon. The King ordered him to come to\r\nPotsdam. When Bismarck arrived there he found the King sitting at his\r\ntable, and in front of him the act of abdication, already signed. The\r\nKing asked him whether he was willing to undertake the Government, even\r\nagainst the majority of the Parliament and without a Budget. Bismarck\r\nsaid he would do so. It was one last chance, and the King tore up the\r\nact of abdication. Two days later Bismarck was appointed provisional\r\nMinister-President, and, at the beginning of October, received his\r\ndefinite appointment as President and Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFLICT.\r\n\r\n1862-1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which Bismarck accepted office were such as to\r\ntry the nerves of the strongest man. The King had not appealed to him so\r\nlong as there was anyone else who would carry on the Government; he was\r\nthe last resource, and had taken up a burden from which all others\r\nshrunk. He had pledged himself to support the King in a conflict against\r\nthe whole nation; with the exception of the Upper House he had no\r\nfriends or supporters. The opinion in Europe was as decisively against\r\nhim as that in Prussia; he was scarcely looked on as a serious\r\npolitician; everyone believed that in a few weeks he would have to\r\nretire, and the King to give up the useless conflict on which he was\r\nstaking his throne. Bismarck was under no illusion as to his position;\r\nhe had been summoned by the King, he depended for his office entirely on\r\nthe King, but would the King have the strength of will and courage to\r\nresist? Only a few days after his appointment, the King had gone to\r\nBaden-Baden for a week, where he met the Queen. When he came back, he\r\nwas completely disheartened. Bismarck, who had travelled part of the way\r\nto meet him, got into the train at a small roadside station. He found\r\nthat the King, who was sitting alone in an ordinary first-class\r\ncarriage, was prepared to surrender. \"What will come of it?\" he said.\r\n\"Already I see the place before my castle on which your head will fall,\r\nand then mine will fall too.\" \"Well, as far as I am concerned,\" answered\r\nBismarck, \"I cannot think of a finer death than one on the field of\r\nbattle or the scaffold. I would fall like Lord Strafford; and your\r\nMajesty, not as Louis XVI., but as Charles I. That is a quite\r\nrespectable historical figure.\"\r\n\r\nFor the moment the centre of interest lay in the House. The new Minister\r\nbegan by what he intended as an attempt at reconciliation: he announced\r\nthat the Budget for 1863 would be withdrawn; the object of this was to\r\nlimit as much as possible the immediate scope of difference; a fresh\r\nBudget for the next year would be laid before them as soon as possible.\r\nThere would remain only the settlement of the Budget for the current\r\nyear. This announcement was badly received; the House was distrustful,\r\nand they interpreted it as an attempt to return to the old practice of\r\ndeferring consideration of the Budget until the beginning of the year to\r\nwhich it applied. The first discussion in which Bismarck took part was\r\nnot in the House itself, but in the Budget Committee. The Committee\r\nproposed a resolution requiring the Government at once to lay before the\r\nHouse the Budget for 1863, and declaring that it was unconstitutional\r\nto spend any money which had been expressly and definitely refused by\r\nthe House of Representatives. On this there took place a long\r\ndiscussion, in which Bismarck spoke repeatedly; for the discussions in\r\nCommittee, which consisted only of about thirty members, were\r\nconversational in their nature. There was no verbatim report, but the\r\nroom was crowded with members who had come to hear the new Minister.\r\nThey were not disappointed. He spoke with a wit, incisiveness, and\r\nversatility to which, as one observer remarked, they were not accustomed\r\nfrom Prussian Ministers. He warned them not to exaggerate their powers.\r\nThe Prussian Constitution did not give the House of Representatives the\r\nsole power of settling the Budget; it must be settled by arrangement\r\nwith the other House and the Crown. There was a difference of opinion in\r\nthe interpretation of the Constitution; all constitutional government\r\nrequired compromise; a constitution was not something dead, it must be\r\nenlivened; it was interpreted by custom and practice; it would be wiser\r\nnot to hasten this practice too quickly; then the question of law might\r\neasily become one of power. It was not the fault of the Government that\r\nthey had got into this position; people took the situation too\r\ntragically, especially in the press; they spoke as though the end of all\r\nthings was come; \"but,\" he added, \"a constitutional struggle is not a\r\ndisgrace, it is rather an honour; after all we are all children of the\r\nsame country.\" A true note, but one which he was not always able to\r\nmaintain in the struggle of the coming years. Then he expounded the\r\nview of the German character which we have learnt from his letters: it\r\nwas customary to speak of the sobriety of the Prussian people; yes, but\r\nthe great independence of the individual made it difficult in Prussia to\r\ngovern with the Constitution; in France it was different; there this\r\nindividual independence was wanting; \"we are perhaps too educated to\r\nendure a constitution; we are too critical\"; the capacity for judging\r\nmeasures of the Government and acts of the Representatives was too\r\nuniversal; there were in the country too many Catilinarian existences,\r\nwhich had an interest in revolutions. He reminded them that Germany did\r\nnot care for the Liberalism of Prussia, but for its power; Bavaria,\r\nWurtemberg, Baden, might indulge in Liberalism; Prussia must concentrate\r\nits power and hold itself ready for the favourable moment which had\r\nalready been passed over more than once; Prussia's boundaries, as fixed\r\nby the Congress of Vienna, were not favourable to a sound political\r\nlife; \"not by speeches and majority votes are the great questions of the\r\ntime decided--that was the great blunder of 1848 and 1849--but by blood\r\nand iron.\" He appealed for confidence: \"Do not force a quarrel; we are\r\nhonest people and you can trust us.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of these speeches was very unfavourable; the very quickness\r\nof thought and originality of expression produced a bad impression; even\r\nthe free indulgence in long foreign words offended patriotic\r\njournalists. They seemed to his audience reckless; what was this\r\nreference to the Treaties of Vienna but an imitation of Napoleonic\r\nstatesmanship? They had the consciousness that they were making history,\r\nthat they were involved in a great and tragic conflict, and they\r\nexpected the Minister to play his part seriously and solemnly; instead\r\nof that they had listened to a series of epigrams with no apparent\r\nlogical connection. We know how dangerous it is, even in England, for a\r\nresponsible statesman to allow himself to be epigrammatic in dealing\r\nwith serious affairs. Much more was it in Germany, where the Ministers\r\nwere nearly always officials by training. Bismarck had the dangerous\r\ngift of framing pregnant and pithy sentences which would give a ready\r\nhandle to his opponents: _Macht geht vor Recht_; he had not said these\r\nwords, but he had said something very much like them, and they\r\nundoubtedly represented what seemed to his audience the pith of his\r\nspeeches. And then these words, _blood and iron_. He has told us in\r\nlater years what he really meant:\r\n\r\n  \"Put the strongest possible military power, in other words, as\r\n  much blood and iron as you can, into the hands of the King of\r\n  Prussia, then he will be able to carry out the policy you wish;\r\n  it cannot be done with speeches and celebrations and songs, it\r\n  can only be done by blood and iron.\" [7]\r\n\r\nWhat everyone thought he meant was that blood must be shed and iron\r\nused; and perhaps they were not so far wrong.\r\n\r\nThe attempt at conciliation failed; the report of the Committee was\r\nadopted, and an amendment proposed by Vincke, which Bismarck was\r\nprepared to accept, was rejected. Bismarck warned the House not to push\r\nthe conflict too far; the time would come when the prospect of a\r\npeaceful solution would have disappeared; then the Government too would\r\nbe prepared to oppose theory to theory and interpretation to\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nHe showed to the President of the House a twig of olive. \"I gathered\r\nthis in Avignon to bring it to the House; it does not seem to be time\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Budget was sent up to the House of Lords in the amended form in\r\nwhich the House of Representatives had passed it; the Lords unanimously\r\nthrew it out, as they were legally justified in doing; not content with\r\nthat, they altered it to the original form in which it had been proposed\r\nby the Government and sent it down again to the Lower House. This was\r\nclearly illegal. Their action, however, was most useful to the\r\nGovernment. A conflict had now arisen between the two Houses, and\r\ntechnically the responsibility for the failure to bring the conciliation\r\nabout was taken away from the Government; they could entrench themselves\r\nbehind the impregnable position that the law required the Budget to be\r\npassed by both Houses; until this was done they could do nothing. The\r\nHouses would not agree; the Government was helpless. The House of\r\nRepresentatives at once passed a motion declaring the vote of the Upper\r\nHouse for altering the Budget null and void, as indeed it was; in the\r\nmiddle of the discussion a message was brought down by the President\r\nannouncing that the House was to be prorogued that afternoon; they had\r\njust time to pass the resolution and to send it in a cab which was\r\nwaiting at the door to the Upper House, where it was read out amidst the\r\nboisterous laughter of the Peers; then both Chambers were summoned to\r\nthe Palace, and the session closed. The first round in the conflict was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe recess was short; the next session was by the Constitution obliged\r\nto begin not later than January 15th; there were many who expected that\r\nthe Constitution would be ignored and the Parliament not summoned. This\r\nwas not Bismarck's plan; he fulfilled all the technical requirements in\r\nthe strictest way; he carefully abstained from any action which he could\r\nnot justify by an appeal to the letter of the Constitution; the\r\ngovernment of the country was carried on with vigour and success; he\r\nallowed no loophole by which his opponents might injure his influence\r\nwith the King. It is true that they were spending money which had not\r\nbeen voted, but then, as he explained, that was not his fault; the\r\nprovisions of the law were quite clear.\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the Government to submit the Budget to the Lower\r\nHouse, who could amend it; it had then to be passed in the form of a\r\nlaw, and for this the assent of both Houses of Parliament and of the\r\nCrown was required. The Upper House had not the right of proposing\r\namendments, but they had the right of rejecting them. In this case they\r\nhad made use of their right; no law had been passed the two Houses had\r\nnot agreed. What was to happen? The Constitution gave no help; there was\r\na gap in it. The Government therefore had to act as best they could.\r\nThey could not be expected to close the Government offices, cease to pay\r\nthe troops, and let the government of the country come to an end; they\r\nmust go on as best they could, taking all the responsibility until they\r\ncould come to some agreement.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the House met it began to vote an address to the King. They\r\nadopted the obvious fiction, which, in fact, they could not well avoid,\r\nthat he was being misled by his Ministers, and the attitude of the\r\ncountry misrepresented to him; even had they known as well as we do that\r\nthe Ministers were only carrying out the orders of the King, they could\r\nnot well have said so. Bismarck, however, did not attempt to conceal the\r\ntruth; the address, he said, touched the King; the acts complained of\r\nwere done in the name of the King; they were setting themselves against\r\nhim. The contest was, who was to rule in Prussia, the House of\r\nHohenzollern or the House of Parliament. He was at once accused of\r\ndisloyalty; he was, they said, protecting himself behind the person of\r\nthe sovereign, but, of course, it was impossible for him not to do so.\r\nThe whole justification for his action was that he was carrying out the\r\nKing's orders. What was at the root of the conflict but the question,\r\nwhether in the last resort the will of the King or the majority of the\r\nHouse should prevail? To have adopted the English practice, to have\r\nrefrained from mentioning the King's name, would have been to adopt the\r\nvery theory of the Constitution for which the House was contending, the\r\nEnglish theory that the sovereign has neither the right of deciding nor\r\nresponsibility; it would have been to undermine the monarchical side of\r\nthe Constitution which Bismarck was expressly defending. The King\r\nhimself never attempted to avoid the responsibility; in a public speech\r\nhe had already said that the army organisation was his own work: \"It is\r\nmy own and I am proud of it; I will hold firmly to it and carry it\r\nthrough with all my energy.\" In his answer to the address from the\r\nHouse, both on this and on later occasions, he expressly withdrew the\r\nassumption that he was not well informed or that he did not approve of\r\nhis Ministers' action.\r\n\r\nThe address was carried by a majority of 255 to 68; the King refused to\r\nreceive it in person. The House then proceeded to throw out a Bill for\r\nmilitary reorganisation which was laid before them; they adopted a\r\nresolution that they reserved for later discussion the question, for\r\nwhat part of the money illegally spent in 1862 they would hold the\r\nMinistry personally responsible. They then proceeded to the Budget of\r\n1863, and again rejected the army estimates; they refused the money\r\nasked for raising the salaries of the ambassadors (Bismarck himself,\r\nwhile at St. Petersburg, had suffered much owing to the insufficiency of\r\nhis salary, and he wished to spare his successors a similar\r\ninconvenience); and they brought in Bills for the responsibility of\r\nMinisters. The public attention, however was soon directed from these\r\ninternal matters to even more serious questions of foreign policy.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of February the Poles had once more risen in revolt\r\nagainst the Russian Government. Much sympathy was felt for them in\r\nWestern Europe. England, France, and Austria joined in representations\r\nand remonstrances to the Czar; they expected that Prussia would join\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more inconvenient to Bismarck; he was at the\r\ntime fully occupied in negotiations about German affairs, and he was\r\nprobably anxious to bring to a speedy issue the questions between\r\nPrussia and Austria; it was therefore most important to him to be on\r\ngood terms with France and England, for he would not challenge Austria\r\nunless he was sure that Austria would have no allies; now he must\r\nquarrel with either Russia or with France. An insurrection in Poland\r\nwas, however, a danger to which everything else must be postponed; on\r\nthis his opinion never varied, here there could be no compromise. He was\r\nperfectly open: \"The Polish question is to us a question of life and\r\ndeath,\" he said to Sir Andrew Buchanan. There were two parties among the\r\nPoles; the one, the extreme Republican, wished for the institution of an\r\nindependent republic; the other would be content with self-government\r\nand national institutions under the Russian Crown; they were supported\r\nby a considerable party in Russia itself. Either party if successful\r\nwould not be content with Russian Poland; they would demand Posen, they\r\nwould never rest until they had gained again the coast of the Baltic and\r\ndeprived Prussia of her eastern provinces. The danger to Prussia would\r\nbe greatest, as Bismarck well knew, if the Poles became reconciled to\r\nthe Russians; an independent republic on their eastern frontier would\r\nhave been dangerous, but Polish aspirations supported by the Panslavonic\r\nparty and the Russian army would have been fatal. Russia and Poland\r\nmight be reconciled, Prussia and Poland never can be. Prussia therefore\r\nwas obliged to separate itself from the other Powers; instead of sending\r\nremonstrances to the Czar, the King wrote an autograph letter proposing\r\nthat the two Governments should take common steps to meet the common\r\ndanger; General von Alvensleben, who took the letter, at once concluded\r\na convention in which it was agreed that Prussian and Russian troops\r\nshould be allowed to cross the frontier in pursuit of the insurgents; at\r\nthe same time two of the Prussian army corps were mobilised and drawn up\r\nalong the Polish frontier.\r\n\r\nThe convention soon became known and it is easy to imagine the\r\nindignation with which the Prussian people and the House of\r\nRepresentatives heard of what their Government had done. The feeling was\r\nakin to that which would have prevailed in America had the President\r\noffered his help to the Spanish Government to suppress the insurrection\r\nin Cuba. The answers to questions were unsatisfactory, and on February\r\n26th Heinrich von Sybel rose to move that the interests of Prussia\r\nrequired absolute neutrality. It was indeed evident that Bismarck's\r\naction had completely isolated Prussia; except the Czar, she had now\r\nnot a single friend in Europe and scarcely a friend in Germany. Bismarck\r\nbegan his answer by the taunt that the tendency to enthusiasm for\r\nforeign nationalities, even when their objects could only be realised at\r\nthe cost of one's own country, was a political disease unfortunately\r\nlimited to Germany. It was, however, an unjust taunt, for no one had\r\ndone more than Sybel himself in his historical work to point out the\r\nnecessity, though he recognised the injustice, of the part Prussia had\r\ntaken in the partition of Poland; nobody had painted so convincingly as\r\nhe had, the political and social demoralisation of Poland. Bismarck then\r\ndwelt on the want of patriotism in the House, which in the middle of\r\ncomplicated negotiations did not scruple to embarrass their own\r\nGovernment. \"No English House of Commons,\" he said, \"would have acted as\r\nthey did,\" a statement to which we cannot assent; an English Opposition\r\nwould have acted exactly as the majority of the Prussian Parliament did.\r\nWhen a Minister is in agreement with the House on the general principles\r\nof policy, then indeed there rests on them the obligation not to\r\nembarrass the Government by constant interpolation with regard to each\r\ndiplomatic step; self-restraint must be exercised, confidence shewn.\r\nThis was not the case here; the House had every reason to believe that\r\nthe objects of Bismarck were completely opposed to what they wished;\r\nthey could not be expected to repose confidence in him. They used this,\r\nas every other opportunity, to attempt to get rid of him.\r\n\r\nThe question of Poland is one on which Bismarck never altered his\r\nattitude. His first public expression of opinion on foreign affairs was\r\nan attack on the Polish policy of the Prussian Government in 1848.\r\n\r\n  \"No one then,\" he wrote, \"could doubt that an independent Poland\r\n  would be the irreconcilable enemy of Prussia and would remain so\r\n  till they had conquered the mouth of the Vistula and every\r\n  Polish-speaking village in West and East Prussia, Pomerania, and\r\n  Silesia.\"\r\n\r\nForty years later one of the last of his great speeches in the Reichstag\r\nwas devoted to attacking the Polish sympathies of the Catholic party in\r\nPrussia. He was never tired of laughing at the characteristic German\r\nromanticism which was so enthusiastic for the welfare of other nations.\r\nHe recalled the memories of his boyhood when, after the rebellion of\r\n1831, Polish refugees were received in every German town with honours\r\nand enthusiasm greater than those paid to the men who had fought for\r\nGermany, when German children would sing Polish national airs as though\r\nthey were their own.\r\n\r\nNothing shews the change which he has been able to bring about in German\r\nthought better than the attitude of the nation towards Poland. In the\r\nold days the Germans recollected only that the partition of Poland had\r\nbeen a great crime; it was their hope and determination that they might\r\nbe able to make amends for it. In those days the Poles were to be found\r\nin every country in Europe, foremost in fighting on the barricades; they\r\nhelped the Germans to fight for their liberty, and the Germans were to\r\nhelp them to recover independence. In 1848, Mieroslawski had been\r\ncarried like a triumphant hero through the streets of Berlin; the Baden\r\nrebels put themselves under the leadership of a Pole, and it was a Pole\r\nwho commanded the Viennese in their resistance to the Austrian army; a\r\nPole led the Italians to disaster on the field of Novara. At a time when\r\npoets still were political leaders, and the memory and influence of\r\nByron had not been effaced, there was scarcely a German poet, Platen,\r\nUhland, Heine, who had not stirred up the enthusiasm for Poland. It was\r\nagainst this attitude of mind that Bismarck had to struggle and he has\r\ndone so successfully. He has taught that it is the duty of Germany to\r\nuse all the power of the State for crushing and destroying the Polish\r\nlanguage and nationality; the Poles in Prussia are to become Prussian,\r\nas those in Russia have to become Russian. A hundred years ago the\r\nPolish State was destroyed; now the language and the nation must cease\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nIt is a natural result of the predominance of Prussia in Germany. The\r\nenthusiasm for Poland was not unnatural when the centre of gravity of\r\nGermany was still far towards the West. Germany could be great,\r\nprosperous, and happy, even if a revived Poland spread to the shores of\r\nthe Baltic, but Prussia would then cease to exist and Bismarck has\r\ntaught the Germans to feel as Prussians.\r\n\r\nThe danger during these weeks was real; Napoleon proposed that Austria,\r\nEngland, and France should present identical notes to Prussia\r\nremonstrating with and threatening her. Lord Russell refused; it was, as\r\nBismarck said in later years, only the friendly disposition of Lord\r\nRussell to Germany which saved Prussia from this danger. Bismarck's own\r\nposition was very insecure; but he withstood this attack as he did all\r\nothers, though few knew at what expense to his nerves and health; he\r\nused to attribute the frequent illnesses of his later years to the\r\nconstant anxiety of these months; he had a very nervous temperament,\r\nself-control was difficult to him, and we must remember that all the\r\ntime when he was defending the King's Government against this public\r\ncriticism he had to maintain himself against those who at Court were\r\nattempting to undermine his influence with the King.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, secured the firm friendship of Russia. When he was in\r\nSt. Petersburg he had gained the regard of the Czar; now to this\r\npersonal feeling was added a great debt of gratitude. What a contrast\r\nbetween the action of Austria and Prussia! The late Czar had saved\r\nAustria from dissolution, and what had been the reward? Opposition in\r\nthe East, and now Austria in the Polish affair was again supporting the\r\nWestern Powers. On the other hand Prussia, and Prussia alone, it was\r\nwhich had saved Russia from the active intervention of France and\r\nEngland. Napoleon had proposed that a landing should he made in\r\nLithuania in order to effect a junction with the Poles; Bismarck had\r\nimmediately declared that if this were done he should regard it as a\r\ndeclaration of war against Prussia. So deep was the indignation of\r\nAlexander that he wrote himself to the King of Prussia, proposing an\r\nalliance and a joint attack on France and Austria. It must have been a\r\ngreat temptation to Bismarck, but he now shewed the prudence which was\r\nhis great characteristic as a diplomatist; he feared that in a war of\r\nthis kind the brunt would fall upon Prussia, and that when peace was\r\nmade the control of negotiations would be with the Czar. He wished for\r\nwar with Austria, but he was determined that when war came he should\r\nhave the arrangement of the terms of peace. On his advice the King\r\nrefused the offer.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the feeling created by these debates on Poland\r\nthreatened to make it impossible for Ministers any longer to attend in\r\nthe House; Bismarck did his part in increasing it.\r\n\r\n  \"You ask me,\" he said, \"why, if we disagree with you, we do not\r\n  dissolve; it is that we wish the country to have an opportunity\r\n  of becoming thoroughly acquainted with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe was tired and angry when during one of these sittings he writes to\r\nMotley:\r\n\r\n  \"I am obliged to listen to particularly tasteless speeches out of\r\n  the mouths of uncommonly childish and excited politicians, and I\r\n  have therefore a moment of unwilling leisure which I cannot use\r\n  better than in giving you news of my welfare. I never thought\r\n  that in my riper years I should be obliged to carry on such an\r\n  unworthy trade as that of a Parliamentary Minister. As envoy,\r\n  although an official, I still had the feeling of being a\r\n  gentleman; as [Parliamentary] Minister one is a helot. I have\r\n  come down in the world, and hardly know how.\r\n\r\n  \"April 18th. I wrote as far as this yesterday, then the sitting\r\n  came to an end; five hours' Chamber until three o'clock; one\r\n  hour's report to his Majesty; three hours at an incredibly dull\r\n  dinner, old important Whigs; then two hours' work; finally, a\r\n  supper with a colleague, who would have been hurt if I had\r\n  slighted his fish. This morning, I had hardly breakfasted, before\r\n  Karolyi was sitting opposite to me; he was followed without\r\n  interruption by Denmark, England, Portugal, Russia, France, whose\r\n  Ambassador I was obliged to remind at one o'clock that it was\r\n  time for me to go to the House of phrases. I am sitting again in\r\n  the latter; hear people talk nonsense, and end my letter. All\r\n  these people have agreed to approve our treaties with Belgium, in\r\n  spite of which twenty speakers scold each other with the greatest\r\n  vehemence, as if each wished to make an end of the other; they\r\n  are not agreed about the motives which make them unanimous,\r\n  hence, alas! a regular German squabble about the Emperor's beard;\r\n  _querelle d'Allemand_. You Anglo-Saxon Yankees have something of\r\n  the same kind also.... Your battles are bloody; ours wordy; these\r\n  chatterers really cannot govern Prussia. I must bring some\r\n  opposition to bear against them; they have too little wit and too\r\n  much self-complacency--stupid and audacious. Stupid, in all its\r\n  meanings, is not the right word; considered individually, these\r\n  people are sometimes very clever, generally educated--the\r\n  regulation German university culture; but of politics, beyond the\r\n  interests of their own church tower, they know as little as we\r\n  knew as students, and even less; as far as external politics go,\r\n  they are also, taken separately, like children. In all other\r\n  questions they become childish as soon as they stand together _in\r\n  corpore_. In the mass stupid, individually intelligent.\"\r\n\r\nRecalling these days, Bismarck said in later years:\r\n\r\n  \"I shall never forget how I had every morning to receive the\r\n  visit of Sir Andrew Buchanan, the English Ambassador, and\r\n  Talleyrand, the representative of France, who made hell hot for\r\n  me over the inexcusable leanings of Prussian policy towards\r\n  Russia, and held threatening language towards us, and then at\r\n  midday I had the pleasure of hearing in the Prussian Parliament\r\n  pretty much the same arguments and attacks which in the morning\r\n  the foreign Ambassadors had made against me.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the language used in the House weakened his influence abroad,\r\nand the foreign Governments shewed more insistence when they found out\r\nthat the Prussian Parliament supported their demands. It was noticed\r\nwith satisfaction in the English Parliament that the nation had\r\ndissociated itself from the mean and disgraceful policy of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAt last personal friction reached such a point that the session had to\r\nbe closed. In order to understand the cause of this we must remember\r\nthat in Prussia the Ministers are not necessarily members of either\r\nHouse; they enjoy, however, by the Constitution, the right of attending\r\nthe debates and may at any time demand to be heard; they do not sit in\r\nthe House among the other members, but on a raised bench to the right of\r\nthe President, facing the members. They have not, therefore, any feeling\r\nof _esprit de corps_ as members of the assembly; Bismarck and his\r\ncolleagues when they addressed the House spoke not as members, not as\r\nthe representatives of even a small minority, but as strangers, as the\r\nrepresentatives of a rival and hostile authority; it is this which\r\nalone explains the almost unanimous opposition to him; he was the\r\nopponent not of one party in the House but of the Parliament itself and\r\nof every other Parliament. In the course of a debate he came into\r\nconflict with the Chair; the President pointed out that some of his\r\nremarks had nothing to do with the subject; Bismarck at once protested:\r\n\"I cannot allow the President the right to a disciplinary interruption\r\nin my speech. I have not the honour of being a member of this assembly;\r\nI have not helped to vote your standing orders; I have not joined in\r\nelecting the President; I am not subject to the disciplinary power of\r\nthe Chamber. The authority of the President ends at this barrier. I have\r\none superior only, his Majesty the King.\" This led to a sharp passage\r\nwith the President, who maintained that his power extended as far as the\r\nfour walls; he could not indeed withdraw the right of speech from a\r\nMinister, but could interrupt him. Bismarck at once repeated word for\r\nword the obnoxious passage of his speech. The President threatened, if\r\nhe did so again, to close the sitting; Bismarck practically gave way; \"I\r\ncannot,\" he said, \"prevent the President adjourning the House; what I\r\nhave said twice I need not repeat a third time\"; and the debate\r\ncontinued without further interruption. A few weeks later a similar\r\nscene occurred, but this time it was not Bismarck but Roon, and Roon had\r\nnot the same quick feeling for Parliamentary form; Bismarck had defied\r\nthe President up to the extreme point where his legal powers went, Roon\r\npassed beyond them. The President wished to interrupt the Minister;\r\nRoon refused to stop speaking; the President rang his bell. \"When I\r\ninterrupt the Minister,\" he said, \"he must be silent. For that purpose I\r\nuse my bell, and, if the Minister does not obey, I must have my hat\r\nbrought me.\" When the Chairman put on his hat the House would be\r\nadjourned. Roon answered, \"I do not mind if the President has his hat\r\nbrought; according to the Constitution I can speak if I wish, and no one\r\nhas the right to interrupt me.\" After a few more angry words on either\r\nside, as Roon continued to dispute the right of the President, the\r\nlatter rose from his seat and asked for his hat, which he placed on his\r\nhead. All the members rose and the House was adjourned. Unfortunately\r\nthe hat handed to him was not his own; it was much too large and\r\ncompletely covered his head and face, so that the strain of the\r\nsituation was relieved by loud laughter. After this the Ministers\r\nrefused to attend the House unless they received an assurance that the\r\nPresident no longer claimed disciplinary authority over them; a series\r\nof memoranda were exchanged between the House and the Ministry; the\r\nactual point in dispute was really a very small one; it is not even\r\nclear that there was _any_ difference of opinion; everyone acknowledged\r\nthat the Ministers might make as many speeches as they liked, and that\r\nthe Chairman could not require them to stop speaking. The only question\r\nwas whether he might interrupt them in order to make any remarks\r\nhimself; but neither side was prepared to come to an understanding. The\r\nKing, to whom the House appealed, supported the Ministry, and a few\r\ndays later the House was prorogued. The second session was over.\r\n\r\nThree days later, by Royal proclamation, a series of ordinances was\r\npublished creating very stringent regulations for the control of the\r\nPress; they gave the police the right of forbidding a newspaper to\r\nappear for no other reason except disapproval of its general tendency.\r\nIt was a power more extreme than in the worst days of the Carlsbad\r\ndecrees had ever been claimed by any German Government. The ordinances\r\nwere based on a clause in the Constitution which gave the Government at\r\ntimes of crisis, if Parliament were not sitting, the power of making\r\nspecial regulations for the government of the Press. The reference to\r\nthe Constitution seemed almost an insult; the kind of crisis which was\r\nmeant was obviously a period of civil war or invasion; it seemed as\r\nthough the Government had taken the first pretext for proroguing\r\nParliament to be able to avail themselves of this clause. The ordinances\r\nreminded men of those of Charles X.; surely, they said, this was the\r\nbeginning of a reign of violence.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was now no longer confined to Parliament. Parliament indeed\r\nwas clearly impotent; all that could be done by speeches and votes and\r\naddresses had been done and had failed; the King still supported the\r\nMinistry. It was now the time for the people at large; the natural\r\nleaders were the corporations of the large towns; the Liberal policy of\r\nthe Prussian Government had given them considerable independence; they\r\nwere elected by the people, and in nearly every town there was a large\r\nmajority opposed to the Government. Headed by the capital, they began a\r\nseries of addresses to the King; public meetings were organised; at\r\nCologne a great festival was arranged to welcome Sybel and the other\r\nrepresentatives from the Rhine. It was more serious that in so\r\nmonarchical a country the discontent with the personal action of the\r\nKing found public expression. The Crown Prince was at this time on a\r\ntour of military inspection in East Prussia; town after town refused the\r\nordinary loyal addresses; they would not welcome him or take part in the\r\nusual ceremonies; the ordinary loyal addresses to the King and other\r\nmembers of the Royal Family were refused. It was no longer a conflict\r\nbetween the Ministry and the Parliament, but between the King and the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the country learned that the Crown Prince himself, the Heir\r\nApparent to the throne, was on their side. He had always disliked\r\nBismarck; he was offended by the brusqueness of his manner. He disliked\r\nthe genial and careless _bonhommie_ with which Bismarck, who hated\r\naffectation, discussed the most serious subjects; he had opposed his\r\nappointment, and he now held a position towards his father's Government\r\nsimilar to that which ten years before his father had held towards his\r\nown brother. He was much influenced by his English relations, and the\r\nopinion of the English Court was strongly unfavourable to Bismarck.\r\nHitherto the Crown Prince had refrained from any public active\r\nopposition; he had, however, not been asked his opinion concerning the\r\nPress ordinances, nor had he even received an invitation to the council\r\nat which they were passed. Bitterly offended at this slight upon\r\nhimself, seriously alarmed lest the action of the Government might even\r\nendanger the dynasty, on his entry into Danzig he took occasion to\r\ndissociate himself from the action of the Government. He had not, he\r\nsaid, been asked; he had known nothing about it; he was not responsible.\r\nThe words were few and they were moderate, but they served to shew the\r\nwhole of Germany what hitherto only those about the Court had known,\r\nthat the Crown Prince was to be counted among the opponents of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAn incident followed a few days later which could only serve to increase\r\nthe breach. After his speech at Danzig, the Crown Prince had offered to\r\nsurrender all his official positions; the King had not required this of\r\nhim, but had strictly ordered him not again to come into opposition to\r\nhis Government. The Crown Prince had promised obedience, but continued\r\nhis private protests against \"these rude and insolent Ministers.\" The\r\nletters on both sides had been affectionate and dignified. A few days\r\nlater, however, the Berlin correspondent of the _Times_ was enabled to\r\npublish the contents of them. It is not known who was to blame for this\r\nvery serious breach of confidence; but the publication must have been\r\nbrought about by someone very closely connected with the Crown Prince;\r\nsuspicion was naturally directed towards the Court of Coburg. It was not\r\nthe last time that the confidence of the Crown Prince was to be abused\r\nin a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThe event naturally much increased Bismarck's dislike to the entourage\r\nof the Prince. There was indeed a considerable number of men, half men\r\nof letters, half politicians, who were glad to play a part by attaching\r\nthemselves to a Liberal Prince; they did not scruple to call in the help\r\nof the Press of the foreign countries, especially of England, and use\r\nits influence for the decision of Prussian affairs. Unfortunately their\r\nconnections were largely with England; they had a great admiration for\r\nEnglish liberty, and they were often known as the English party. This\r\nwant of discretion, which afterwards caused a strong prejudice against\r\nthem in Germany, was used to create a prejudice also against England.\r\nPeople in Germany confused with the English nation, which was supremely\r\nindifferent to Continental affairs, the opinions of a few writers who\r\nwere nearly always German. For many years after this, the relations\r\nbetween Bismarck and the Crown Prince were very distant, and the breach\r\nwas to be increased by the very decided line which the Crown Prince\r\nafterwards took with regard to the Schleswig-Holstein affair.\r\n\r\nThe event shewed that Bismarck knew well the country with which he was\r\ndealing; the Press ordinances were not actually illegal, they were\r\nstrictly enforced; many papers were warned, others were suppressed; the\r\nmajority at once changed their tone and moderated their expression of\r\nhostility to the Government. In England, under similar circumstances, a\r\nhost of scurrilous pamphlets have always appeared; the Prussian police\r\nwere too prompt for this to be possible. The King refused to receive the\r\naddresses; an order from the Home Office forbade town councils to\r\ndiscuss political matters; a Bürgermeister who disregarded the order was\r\nsuspended from his office; public meetings were suppressed. These\r\nmeasures were successful; the discontent remained and increased, but\r\nthere was no disorder and there were no riots. Great courage was\r\nrequired to defy public opinion, but with courage it could be defied\r\nwith as much impunity as that of the Parliament. Englishmen at the time\r\nasked why the people did not refuse to pay the taxes; the answer is\r\neasy: there would have been no legal justification for this, for though,\r\nuntil the estimates had been passed, the Ministers were not legally\r\nenabled to spend a farthing of public money, the taxes could still be\r\nlevied; they were not voted annually; once imposed, they continued until\r\na law was passed withdrawing them. The situation, in fact, was this,\r\nthat the Ministry were obliged to collect the money though they were not\r\nauthorised in spending it. To this we must add that the country was very\r\nprosperous; the revenue was constantly increasing; there was no\r\ndistress. The socialist agitation which was just beginning was directed\r\nnot against the Government but against society; Lassalle found more\r\nsympathy in Bismarck than he did with the Liberal leaders. He publicly\r\nexhorted his followers to support the Monarchy against these miserable\r\nBourgeois, as he called the Liberals. Except on the one ground of the\r\nconstitutional conflict, the country was well governed; there was no\r\nother interference with liberty of thought or action.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there was a general feeling that things could not last long;\r\nthe Liberals believed that the future was with them; time itself would\r\nbring revenge. At the worst they would wait till the death of the King;\r\nhe was already nearly seventy years of age; the political difficulties\r\nhad much injured his health. When he was gone, then with the Crown\r\nPrince the constitutional cause would triumph.\r\n\r\nHow different was the future to be! Year after year the conflict\r\ncontinued. Each year the House was summoned and the Budget laid before\r\nit; each year the House rejected the Budget; they threw out Government\r\nmeasures, they refused the loans, and they addressed the King to dismiss\r\nhis Ministers. The sessions, however, were very short; that of 1864\r\nlasted only a few weeks.\r\n\r\nEach year Bismarck's open contempt for the Parliament and their\r\nunqualified hatred of him increased. The people still continued to\r\nsupport their representatives. The cities still continued to withhold\r\ntheir loyal addresses to the King. With each year, however, the\r\nGovernment gained confidence. It was easy to see that the final result\r\nwould depend on the success of the Government in external affairs. To\r\nthese we must now turn.\r\n\r\nEnglish opinion at that time was unanimously opposed to the King; it is\r\ndifficult even now to judge the issue. It was natural for Englishmen to\r\nsympathise with those who wished to imitate them. Their pride was\r\npleased when they found the ablest Parliamentary leaders, the most\r\nlearned historians and keenest jurists desirous to assimilate the\r\ninstitutions of Prussia to those which existed in England. It is just\r\nthis which ought to make us pause. What do we think of politicians who\r\ntry to introduce among us the institutions and the faults of foreign\r\ncountries? \"Why will not the King of Prussia be content with the\r\nposition which the Queen of England holds, or the King of the\r\nBelgians,--then all his unpopularity would be gone?\" was a question\r\nasked at the time by an English writer. We may ask, on the other hand,\r\nwhy should the King of Prussia sacrifice his power and prerogative? The\r\nquestion is really as absurd as it would be to ask, why is not an\r\nEnglish Parliament content with the power enjoyed by the Prussian\r\nParliament? It was a commonplace of the time, that the continued\r\nconflict shewed a want of statesmanship; so it did, if it is\r\nstatesmanship always to court popularity and always to surrender one's\r\ncause when one believes it to be right, even at the risk of ruining\r\none's country. It must be remembered that through all these years the\r\nexistence of Prussia was at stake. If the Prussian Government insisted\r\non the necessity for a large and efficient army, they were accused of\r\nreckless militarism. People forgot that the Prussian Monarchy could no\r\nmore maintain itself without a large army than the British Empire could\r\nwithout a large navy. In all the secret diplomatic negotiations of the\r\ntime, the dismemberment of Prussia was a policy to be considered. France\r\nwished to acquire part of the left bank of the Rhine, Austria had never\r\nquite given up hope of regaining part of Silesia; it was not fifty years\r\nsince Prussia had acquired half the kingdom of Saxony; might not a\r\nhostile coalition restore this territory? And then the philanthropy of\r\nEngland and the intrigues of France were still considering the\r\npossibility of a revived Poland, but in Poland would have to be included\r\npart of the territory which Prussia had acquired.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that from this conflict must be dated the great growth\r\nof militarism in Europe; it is to the victory of the King and Bismarck\r\nthat we are to attribute the wars which followed and the immense\r\narmaments which since then have been built up in Europe. To a certain\r\nextent, of course, this is true, though it is not clear that the\r\npresence of these immense armies is an unmixed evil. It is, however,\r\nonly half the truth; the Prussian Government was not solely responsible.\r\nIt was not they who began arming, it was not they who first broke the\r\npeace which had been maintained in Europe since 1815. Their fault seems\r\nto have been, not that they armed first, but that when they put their\r\nhand to the work, they did it better than other nations. If they are\r\nexposed to any criticism in the matter, it must rather be this, that the\r\nGovernment of the late King had unduly neglected the army; they began to\r\nprepare not too soon but almost too late. It was in Austria in 1848 that\r\nthe new military dominion began; Austria was supported by Russia and\r\nimitated by France; Prussia, surrounded by these empires, each at least\r\ndouble herself in population, was compelled to arm in self-defence. By\r\nnot doing so sooner she had incurred the disgrace of Olmütz; her whole\r\npolicy had been weak and vacillating, because the Government was\r\nfrightened at stirring up a conflict in which they would almost\r\ncertainly be defeated.\r\n\r\nThere is one other matter with regard to the conflict so far as regards\r\nBismarck personally. We must always remember that he was not responsible\r\nfor it. It had originated at a time when he was absent from Germany, and\r\nhad very little influence on the conduct of affairs. Had he been\r\nMinister two years before, there probably would have been no conflict at\r\nall. The responsibility for it lies partly with the leaders of the\r\nLiberal party, who, as we know from memoirs that have since been\r\npublished, were acting against their own convictions, in opposing the\r\nmilitary demands of the Government, for they feared that otherwise the\r\nparty would not follow them. Much of the responsibility also rests with\r\nthe Ministry of the _new era_; they had mismanaged affairs; the\r\nmismanagement arose from the want of union among them, for the Liberal\r\nmajority were in many matters opposed to the King and the throne. It was\r\nthis want of cordial co-operation in the Ministry which led to the great\r\nblunder by which the Minister of War acted in a way which seemed to be,\r\nand in fact was, a breach of an engagement made by the Minister of\r\nFinance. Had Bismarck been in authority at the time, we can hardly doubt\r\nthat he would have found some way of effecting a compromise between the\r\nGovernment and the leaders of the Moderate Liberal party. At least no\r\nblame attached to him for what had happened. Still less can we afford\r\nhim anything but the highest commendation, that, when the King had got\r\ninto an absolutely untenable position, he came forward, and at the risk\r\nof his reputation, his future, perhaps his life, stood by his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN.\r\n\r\n1863-1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the result of the conflict would eventually depend\r\nupon the management of foreign affairs. Bismarck before his appointment\r\nhad always said that the Government could only gain freedom at home by a\r\nmore vigorous policy abroad. He was now in a position to follow the\r\npolicy he desired. The conflict made him indispensable to the King; if\r\nhe retired, the King would have to surrender to the House. This was\r\nalways present to his mind and enabled him to keep his influence against\r\nall his enemies, who throughout the spring had used every effort to\r\nundermine his authority with the King.\r\n\r\nThere were many who thought that he deliberately maintained the friction\r\nin order to make himself indispensable, and in truth his relations to\r\nthe Parliament had this advantage, that there was no use in attempting\r\nto take into consideration their wishes. Had he been supported by a\r\nfriendly House he would have had to justify his policy, perhaps to\r\nmodify it; as it was, since they were sure to refuse supplies whatever\r\nhe did, one or two more votes of censure were a matter of indifference\r\nto him, and he went on his own way directing the diplomacy of the\r\ncountry with as sure and firm a hand as though no Parliament existed.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn he had the first opportunity for shewing how great his\r\ninfluence already was. During the summer holidays, he was in almost\r\nconstant attendance on the King, who as usual had gone to Gastein for a\r\ncure. Perhaps he did not venture to leave the King, but he often\r\ncomplained of the new conditions in which his life was passed; he wished\r\nto be back with his wife and children in Pomerania. He writes to his\r\nwife from Baden: \"I wish that some intrigue would necessitate another\r\nMinistry, so that I might honourably turn my back on this basin of ink\r\nand live quietly in the country. The restlessness of this life is\r\nunbearable; for ten weeks I have been doing clerk's work at an inn--it\r\nis no life for an honest country gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of July, a proposal came from the Emperor of Austria which,\r\nbut for Bismarck's firmness, might have had very far-reaching results.\r\nThe Emperor had visited the King and discussed with him proposals for\r\nthe reform of the Confederation. He explained an Austrian plan for the\r\nreform which was so much needed, and asked the King if he would join in\r\nan assembly of all the German Princes to discuss the plan. The King for\r\nmany reasons refused; nevertheless two days afterwards formal\r\ninvitations were sent out to all the Princes and to the Burgomasters of\r\nthe free cities, inviting them to a Congress which was to meet at\r\nFrankfort. All the other Princes accepted, and the Congress met on the\r\n15th of August. The Emperor presided in person, and he hoped to be able\r\nto persuade them to adopt his proposals, which would be very favourable\r\nfor Austria. It was, however, apparent that without the presence of the\r\nKing of Prussia the Congress would come to no result; it was therefore\r\ndetermined to send a special deputation to invite him to reconsider his\r\nrefusal. The King had the day before moved from Karlsbad to Baden and\r\nwas therefore in the immediate neighbourhood of Frankfort. It was very\r\ndifficult for him not to accept this special invitation. \"How can I\r\nrefuse,\" he said, \"when thirty Princes invite me and they send the\r\nmessage by a King!\"\r\n\r\nPersonally he wished to go, though he agreed with Bismarck that it would\r\nbe wiser to stay away; all his relations pressed him to go. It would\r\nhave been pleasant for once to meet in friendly conclave all his fellow\r\nPrinces. Bismarck, however, was determined that it should not be. He\r\nalso had gone to Baden-Baden; the King consulted him before sending the\r\nanswer. After a long and exhausting struggle, Bismarck gained his point\r\nand a refusal was sent. He had threatened to resign if his advice were\r\nnot taken. As soon as the letter was sealed and despatched, Bismarck\r\nturned to a tray with glasses which stood on the table and smashed them\r\nin pieces. \"Are you ill?\" asked a friend who was in the room. \"No,\" was\r\nthe answer; \"I was, but I am better now. I felt I must break something.\"\r\nSo much were his nerves affected by the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe Congress went on without the representative of Prussia. The Kings\r\nand Princes discussed the proposals in secret session. They enjoyed this\r\nunaccustomed freedom; for the first time they had been able to discuss\r\nthe affairs of their own country without the intervention of their\r\nMinisters. The Ministers had, of course, come to Frankfort, but they\r\nfound themselves excluded from all participation in affairs. With what\r\nadmiration and jealousy must they have looked on Bismarck, but there was\r\nnone of them who had done for his Prince what Bismarck had for the King\r\nof Prussia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was his intention at once to press forward the struggle with\r\nAustria for supremacy in Germany. If so, he was to be disappointed. A\r\nnew difficulty was now appearing in the diplomatic world: the\r\nSchleswig-Holstein question, which had been so long slumbering, broke\r\nout into open fire, and nearly three years were to pass before Bismarck\r\nwas able to resume the policy on which he had determined. Men often\r\nspeak as though he were responsible for the outbreak of this difficulty\r\nand the war which followed; that was far from being the case; it\r\ninterrupted his plans as much as did the Polish question. We shall have\r\nto see with what ingenuity he gained for his country an advantage from\r\nwhat appeared at first to be a most inconvenient situation.\r\n\r\nWe must shortly explain the origin of this question, the most\r\ncomplicated that has ever occupied European diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe Duchy of Holstein had been part of the German Empire; for many\r\nhundreds of years the Duke of Holstein had also been King of Denmark;\r\nthe connection at first had been a purely personal union; it was,\r\nhowever, complicated by the existence of the Duchy of Schleswig.\r\nSchleswig was outside the Confederation, as it had been outside the\r\nGerman Empire, and had in old days been a fief of the Kingdom of\r\nDenmark. The nobles of Holstein had, however, gradually succeeded in\r\nextending German influence and the German language into Schleswig, so\r\nthat this Duchy had become more than half German. Schleswig and Holstein\r\nwere also joined together by very old customs, which were, it is said,\r\nfounded on charters given by the Kings of Denmark; it was claimed that\r\nthe two Duchies were always to be ruled by the same man, and also that\r\nthey were to be kept quite distinct from the Kingdom of Denmark. These\r\ncharters are not undisputed, but in this case, as so often happens in\r\npolitics, the popular belief in the existence of a right was to be more\r\nimportant than the legal question whether the right really existed.\r\n\r\nThe trouble began about 1830. There was a double question, the question\r\nof constitution and the question of inheritance. The Danes, desirous to\r\nconsolidate the Monarchy, had neglected the rights of the old local\r\nEstates in the Duchies; this led to an agitation and a conflict. It was\r\na struggle for the maintenance of local privileges against the Monarchy\r\nin Copenhagen. Moreover, a vigorous democratic party had arisen in\r\nDenmark; their object was to incorporate the whole of Schleswig in the\r\nDanish Monarchy; they did not care what happened to Holstein. This party\r\nwere called the Eider Danes, for they wished Denmark to be extended to\r\nthe Eider. Against this proposed separation of the two Duchies violent\r\nprotests were raised, and in 1848 a rebellion broke out. This was the\r\nrebellion which had been supported in that year by Prussia, and it had\r\nthe universal sympathy of everyone in Germany, Princes and people alike.\r\n\r\nThe question of constitution was complicated by one of succession. The\r\nmale line of the Royal House which ruled in Denmark was dying out;\r\naccording to a law introduced in 1660, descendants of the female branch\r\nmight succeed in the Kingdom. This law had probably never been legally\r\nenacted for the Duchies; in Schleswig and Holstein the old Salic law\r\nprevailed. In the ordinary course of things, on the death of Frederick\r\nVII., who had succeeded in 1847, the long connection between Holstein\r\nand Denmark would cease. Would, however, Schleswig go with Holstein or\r\nwith Denmark? Every Schleswig-Holsteiner and every German declared that\r\nthe two Duchies must remain for ever \"unvertheilt\"; the majority of the\r\nDanes determined, whatever the law might be, that they would keep\r\nSchleswig, which had once been Danish. The King took a different line;\r\nhe wished to maintain all the possessions in his House, and that the\r\nsame man should succeed both in the Kingdom and the Duchies. There was\r\nno authority qualified to decide the legal question; and therefore the\r\nquestion of right was sure to become one of power. At first, strange as\r\nit may seem, the power was on the side of the Danes. Germany was weak\r\nand disunited, the Prussian troops who had been sent to help the\r\nrebellion were withdrawn, and the surrender of Olmütz was fatal to the\r\ninhabitants of the Duchies. The whole question was brought before a\r\nEuropean Congress which met at London. The integrity of the Danish\r\nMonarchy was declared to be a European interest; and the Congress of the\r\nPowers presumed to determine who should succeed to the ducal and royal\r\npower. They chose Christian of Glucksburg, and all the Powers pledged\r\nthemselves to recognise him as ruler over all the dominions of the King\r\nof Denmark.\r\n\r\nPrussia and Austria were among the Powers who signed the Treaty of\r\nLondon, but the Diet of Frankfort was not bound by it. At the same time,\r\nDenmark had entered into certain engagements pledging itself to preserve\r\nthe separation between Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark, and also not to\r\noppress the German people in Schleswig. The Danes did not keep their\r\nengagement; despising the Germans, they renewed the old policy,\r\nattempted to drive back the German language, and introduced new laws\r\nwhich were inconsistent with the local privileges of Holstein and\r\nSchleswig. The Holstein Estates appealed for protection to the Diet. The\r\nGermans protested, but the Danes were obstinate. As years went on, the\r\nexcitement of the Germans grew; they believed, and justly believed, that\r\nit was a matter of honour to defend the rights of the Duchies.\r\nSchleswig-Holstein was the symbol of German weakness and disgrace, and\r\nin defence of them the national enthusiasm was again roused.\r\n\r\nWith this popular enthusiasm Bismarck had no sympathy; and he had no\r\ninterest for the cause of Schleswig-Holstein. He had originally\r\nconsidered the inhabitants merely as rebels against their lawful\r\nsovereign. He had learnt at Frankfort sufficient to make this\r\nindifferent to him, but he still regarded them as foreigners and looked\r\non their claims merely from the point of view of Prussian interests.\r\nBoth his sympathy and his reason led him in fact rather to take the\r\nDanish side. \"The maintenance of Denmark is in our interest,\" he wrote\r\nin 1857, but Denmark could only continue to exist if it were ruled, more\r\nor less arbitrarily, with provincial Estates as it has been for the last\r\nhundred years; and in another letter: \"We have no reason to desire that\r\nthe Holsteiners should live very happily under their Duke, for if they\r\ndo they will no longer be interested in Prussia, and under certain\r\ncircumstances their interest may be very useful to us. It is important\r\nthat, however just their cause may be, Prussia should act with great\r\nprudence.\" He recognised that if the complaints of the Duchies led again\r\nto a war between Germany and Denmark all the loss would fall on Prussia;\r\nthe coast of Prussia was exposed to the attacks of the Danish fleet. If\r\nthe war was successful, the result would be to strengthen the Diet and\r\nthe Federal Constitution; and, as we know, that was the last thing which\r\nBismarck desired; if it failed, the disgrace and the blame would fall\r\nupon Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe only thing which would have induced him warmly to take up the cause\r\nwas the prospect of winning the Duchies for Prussia, but of that there\r\nseemed little hope.\r\n\r\nSo long, therefore, as he remained at Frankfort, he had endeavoured to\r\nkeep the peace, and he continued this policy after he became Minister.\r\nThe greater number of the German States wished to carry out a Federal\r\nexecution in Holstein; he tried to avert this and warmly gave his\r\nsupport to Lord Russell in his attempt to settle the question by English\r\nmediation. His efforts, however, were unavailing, for the Danish\r\nGovernment, presuming on the weakness of Germany, continued their\r\nprovocative action. On March 30, 1863, a new Constitution was\r\nproclaimed, completely severing Holstein from the rest of the Monarchy.\r\nThe Holstein Estates had not been consulted and appealed to the Diet for\r\nprotection; the law of the Federation enabled the Diet in a case like\r\nthis to occupy the territory of the offending sovereign in order to\r\ncompel him to rule according to the Constitution. The national German\r\nparty wished to go farther, to confuse the questions of Schleswig and of\r\nHolstein, and so bring about a war with Denmark. Bismarck wrote to the\r\nDuke of Oldenburg to explain his objections to this: it would make the\r\nworst impression in England; and he insisted that they should attempt\r\nnothing more than Federal execution in Holstein. As Holstein belonged to\r\nthe Federation, this would be a purely German affair and no ground\r\nwould be given for interfering to England or France. In consequence, the\r\nsimple execution in Holstein was voted. Even now, however, Bismarck did\r\nnot give up hopes of keeping peace. He brought pressure to bear on the\r\nDanes and was supported by England. If only they would withdraw the\r\nproclamation of March 30th, and accept English mediation for Schleswig,\r\nhe promised them that he would use all his influence to prevent the\r\nexecution and would probably be successful.\r\n\r\nHis moderation, which received the warm approval of Lord Russell, of\r\ncourse only added to his unpopularity in Germany. The Danish Government,\r\nhowever, refused to accept Bismarck's proposal; they brought in still\r\nanother Constitution by which the complete incorporation of Schleswig\r\nwith the Monarchy was decreed. This was an overt breach of their treaty\r\nengagements and a declaration of war with Germany. At the beginning of\r\nNovember, it was carried through the Rigsrad by the required majority of\r\ntwo-thirds, and was sent up to the King to receive his signature. Before\r\nhe had time to sign it the King died.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the death of the King would make little difference\r\nin the situation, for it had been agreed that Christian of Glucksburg\r\nshould succeed to all the provinces of the Monarchy. The first act he\r\nhad to perform was the signature of the new Constitution; it is said\r\nthat he hesitated, but was told by the Ministers that if he refused they\r\nwould answer neither for his crown nor his head. On November 23d he\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\nBefore this had happened the situation had received an unexpected\r\nchange. A new claimant appeared to dispute his title to the Duchies. The\r\nday after the death of the King, Frederick, eldest son of the Duke of\r\nAugustenburg, published a proclamation announcing his succession to the\r\nDuchy under the title of Frederick VIII. No one seems to have foreseen\r\nthis step; it was supposed that after the agreement of 1853 the question\r\nof succession had been finally settled. The whole of the German nation,\r\nhowever, received with enthusiasm the news that it was again to be\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nThey believed that the Prince was the lawful heir; they saw in his claim\r\nthe possibility of permanently separating the Duchies from Denmark.\r\nNothing seemed to stand between this and accomplishment except the\r\nTreaty of London. Surely the rights of the Duchies, and the claim of\r\nAugustenburg, supported by united Germany, would be strong enough to\r\nbear down this treaty which was so unjust.\r\n\r\nThe question will be asked, was the claim of Augustenburg valid? No\r\npositive answer can be given, for it has never been tried by a competent\r\ncourt of law. It may, however, I think, be said that although there were\r\nobjections, which might invalidate his right to at least a part of the\r\nDuchies, it is almost certain that a quite impartial tribunal would have\r\ndecided that he had at least a better claim than any of his rivals. This\r\nat least would have been true fifteen years before. When, however, the\r\nTreaty of London was arranged it was necessary to procure the\r\nrenunciation of all the different claimants. That of the Emperor of\r\nRussia, the Duke of Oldenburg, and others was obtained without much\r\ndifficulty; the Duke of Augustenburg long refused. In order to compel\r\nhim to renounce, the Danish Government refused to restore to him his\r\nprivate property, which had been confiscated owing to the part he had\r\ntaken in the late rebellion. He had been enormously wealthy, but was now\r\nliving in exile and deprived of his revenues. By this means they had at\r\nlast induced him to sign a document, in which he promised, for himself\r\nand his successors, not to make any attempt to enforce his claims to the\r\nsuccession. The document was curiously worded; there was no actual\r\nrenunciation, only a promise to abstain from action. In return for this\r\na sum of money, not equal, however, to that which he had lost, was\r\nhanded over to him. Now it was Bismarck who, while envoy at Frankfort,\r\nhad carried on the negotiations; he had taken much trouble about the\r\nmatter, and earned the warm gratitude both of the King of Denmark and of\r\nthe Duke. There is, I think, no doubt that he believed that the\r\nagreement was a _bona fide_ one and would be maintained. Since then the\r\nDuke had renounced all his claims in favour of his eldest son; Prince\r\nFrederick had not signed the contract and maintained that he was not\r\nbound by it. Of course Bismarck could not admit this, and his whole\r\nattitude towards the Prince must from the beginning be hostile.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to point out that there was no reason whatever why the\r\nAugustenburgs should do anything more than that to which they were bound\r\nby the strict letter of the agreement; they had no ties of gratitude\r\ntowards Denmark; they had not, as is often said, sold their rights, for\r\nthey had received only a portion of their own possessions. However this\r\nmay be, his claim was supported, not only by the people and Parliaments,\r\nbut by leaders of the German Governments, headed by the King of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nBismarck was now asked to denounce the Treaty of London to which Prussia\r\nhad given her assent; to support the claims of Augustenburg; to carry\r\nout the policy of the Diet, and if necessary to allow the Prussian army\r\nto be used in fighting for Prince Frederick against the King of Denmark.\r\nThis he had not the slightest intention of doing. He had to consider\r\nfirst of all that Prussia was bound by treaties. As he said: \"We may\r\nregret that we signed, but the signature took place. Honour as well as\r\nwisdom allows us to leave no doubt as to our loyalty to our\r\nengagements.\" He had moreover to consider that if he acted as the\r\nGermans wished he would find himself opposed, not only by Denmark, but\r\nalso by Russia and England, and in military operations on the narrow\r\npeninsula the power of the English fleet would easily outbalance the\r\nsuperiority of the Prussian army. Moreover, and this was the point which\r\naffected him most, what good would come to Prussia even if she were\r\nsuccessful in this war? \"I cannot regard it as a Prussian interest to\r\nwage war in order in the most favourable result to establish a new Grand\r\nDuke in Schleswig-Holstein, who out of fear of Prussian aggression would\r\nvote against us at the Diet.\"\r\n\r\nHis policy, therefore, was clearly marked out for him: he must refuse\r\nto recognise the claims of Augustenburg; he must refuse to break the\r\nTreaty of London. This, however, would not prevent him from bringing\r\npressure to bear on the new King of Denmark, as he had done on his\r\npredecessor, to induce him to abide by his treaty engagements, and, if\r\nhe did not do so, from declaring war against him.\r\n\r\nThere was even at this time in his mind another thought. He had the hope\r\nthat in some way or other he might be able to gain a direct increase of\r\nterritory for Prussia. If they recognised the Augustenburg claims this\r\nwould be always impossible, for then either the Duchies would remain\r\nunder the King of Denmark or, if the Danes were defeated, they would\r\nhave to be given to the Prince.\r\n\r\nIn this policy he was supported by Austria. The Austrian Government was\r\nalso bound by the Treaty of London; they were much annoyed at the\r\nviolent and almost revolutionary agitation which had broken out in\r\nGermany; it was with much relief that they learned that Prussia, instead\r\nof heading the movement as in 1849, was ready to oppose it. The two\r\ngreat Powers so lately in opposition now acted in close union.\r\n\r\nIssue was joined at the Diet between the two parties. The Prince brought\r\nhis claim before it, and those who supported him proposed that, as the\r\nsuccession to the Duchies was in dispute, they should be occupied by a\r\nFederal army until the true ruler had been determined. Against this\r\nAustria and Prussia proposed that the Federal execution in Holstein,\r\nwhich had before been resolved on, should be at once carried out. If the\r\nexecution were voted it would be an indirect recognition of Christian as\r\nruler, for it would be carried out as against his Government; on this\r\npoint, execution or occupation, the votes were taken.\r\n\r\nBismarck was, however, greatly embarrassed by the strong influence which\r\nthe Prince of Augustenburg had in the Prussian Royal Family; he was an\r\nintimate friend of the Crown Princess, and the Crown Princess and the\r\nKing himself regarded his claims with favour. Directly after his\r\nproclamation the pretender came to Berlin; he had a very friendly\r\nreception from the King, who expressed his deep regret that he was tied\r\nby the London Convention, but clearly shewed that he hoped this\r\ndifficulty might be overcome. Bismarck took another line; he said that\r\nhe was trying to induce the new King not to sign the Constitution; the\r\nPrince, to Bismarck's obvious annoyance, explained that that would be no\r\nuse; he should maintain his claims just the same.\r\n\r\nThe King disliked the Treaty of London as much as everyone else did; he\r\nhad to agree to Bismarck's arguments that it would not be safe to\r\ndenounce it, but he would have been quite willing, supposing Prussia was\r\noutvoted in the Diet, to accept the vote and obey the decision of the\r\nmajority; he even hoped that this would be the result. Bismarck would\r\nhave regarded an adverse vote as a sufficient reason for retiring from\r\nthe Federation altogether. Were Prussia outvoted, it would be forced\r\ninto a European war, which he wished to avoid, and made to fight as a\r\nsingle member of the German Confederation. Rather than do this he would\r\nprefer to fight on the other side; \"Denmark is a better ally than the\r\nGerman States,\" he said. The two parties were contending as keenly at\r\nthe Prussian Court as at Frankfort; Vincke wrote a long and pressing\r\nletter to the King; Schleinitz appeared again, supported as of old by\r\nthe Queen; the Crown Prince was still in England, but he and his wife\r\nwere enthusiastic on the Prince's side.\r\n\r\nHow much Bismarck was hampered by adverse influences at Court we see\r\nfrom a letter to Roon:\r\n\r\n  \"I am far removed from any hasty or selfish resolution, but I\r\n  have a feeling that the cause of the King against the Revolution\r\n  is lost; his heart is in the other camp and he has more\r\n  confidence in his opponents than his friends. For us it will be\r\n  indifferent, one year or thirty years hence, but not for our\r\n  children. The King has ordered me to come to him before the\r\n  sitting to discuss what is to be said; I shall not say much,\r\n  partly because I have not closed my eyes all night and am\r\n  wretched, and then I really do not know what to say. They will\r\n  certainly reject the loan, and his Majesty at the risk of\r\n  breaking with Europe and experiencing a second Olmütz will at\r\n  last join the Democracy, and work with it in order to set up\r\n  Augustenburg and found a new State. What is the good of making\r\n  speeches and scolding? Without some miracle of God the game is\r\n  lost. Now and with posterity the blame will be laid upon us. As\r\n  God will. He will know how long Prussia has to exist. But God\r\n  knows I shall be sorry when it ceases.\"\r\n\r\nThe only ally that Bismarck had was Austria. Their combined influence\r\nwas sufficiently strong by a majority of one to carry through the Diet\r\nexecution instead of occupation; though there was appended to the motion\r\na rider that the question of succession was not thereby prejudiced.\r\n\r\nThe execution took place. During the month of December the Hanoverians\r\nand Saxons occupied Holstein; the Danes did not resist but retreated\r\nacross the Eider. At the end of the year the occupation was complete. In\r\nthe rear of the German troops had come also the Prince of Augustenburg,\r\nwho had settled himself in the land of which he claimed to be ruler.\r\n\r\nWhat was now to be done? The Augustenburg party wished at once to press\r\nforward with the question of the succession; let the Diet decide this\r\nimmediately; then hand over Holstein to the new Duke and immediately\r\nseize Schleswig also and vindicate it from Christian, the alien usurper.\r\nBismarck would not hear of this; he still maintained his policy that\r\nPrussia should not denounce the London Convention, should recognise the\r\nsovereignty of Christian, and should demand from him as lawful ruler of\r\nall the Danish possessions the repeal of the obnoxious November\r\nConstitution. In this he was still supported by Austria; if the Danes\r\ndid not acquiesce in these very moderate demands, the Germans should\r\nenter Schleswig and seize it as a security. Then he would be able when\r\nhe wished to free himself from the Treaty of London, for war dissolves\r\nall treaties.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this plan was that it entirely deprived England of any\r\ngrounds for interference; Prussia alone was now defending the London\r\nConvention; Prussia was preventing the Diet from a breach of treaty; the\r\nclaim of Denmark was one in regard to which the Danes were absolutely\r\nwrong. Bismarck had therefore on his side Austria, Russia, probably\r\nFrance, and averted the hostility of England. Against him was German\r\npublic opinion, the German Diet, and the Prussian Parliament; everyone,\r\nthat is, whom he neither feared nor regarded. So long as the King was\r\nfirm he could look with confidence to the future, even though he did not\r\nknow what it would bring forth.\r\n\r\nWith the Parliament indeed nothing was to be done; they, of course,\r\nstrongly supported Augustenburg. They refused to look at the question\r\nfrom a Prussian point of view. \"On your side,\" Bismarck said, \"no one\r\ndares honestly to say that he acts for the interests of Prussia and as a\r\nPrussian.\" They feared that he proposed to hand back the Duchies to\r\nDenmark; they refused to consider him seriously as Foreign Minister;\r\nthey spoke of him as a rash amateur. It was to attack him on his most\r\nsensitive point. Here, at least, he felt on completely secure ground;\r\ndiplomacy was his profession; what did the professors and talkers in the\r\nChamber know of it? They were trying to control the policy of the State,\r\nbut, he said, \"in these days an Assembly of 350 members cannot in the\r\nlast instance direct the policy of a great Power.\" The Government asked\r\nfor a loan for military operations; he appealed to their patriotism, but\r\nit was in vain; the House voted an address to the King, remonstrating\r\nagainst the conduct of foreign affairs, and threw out the loan by a\r\nmajority of 275 to 51. \"If you do not vote the money, we shall take it\r\nwhere we can get it,\" Bismarck had warned them. The House was\r\nimmediately prorogued after a session of only two months, not to meet\r\nagain till January, 1865.\r\n\r\nThis policy of Bismarck was proposed by Austria and Prussia at the Diet;\r\nthe other States refused to adopt it, as they wished to raise the\r\nquestion of succession; on a division Prussia was outvoted. The two\r\ngreat Powers therefore entered into a separate agreement in which, while\r\nstill recognising the integrity of the Danish Monarchy, they undertook\r\nto force the King to withdraw the obnoxious Constitution, and, if he did\r\nnot consent to do so, they agreed to occupy Schleswig.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian House, in its address to the King, had declared that the\r\nonly result of this policy would be to give back the Duchies to Denmark.\r\nWas there no fear of this? What would have happened had Denmark after\r\nall given in, as England strongly pressed her to do? Had she withdrawn\r\nthe obnoxious Constitution, and granted all that Bismarck asked, why\r\nthen Prussia and Austria would have been bound to support the integrity\r\nof Denmark, and, if necessary, by force of arms to eject the Federal\r\ntroops from Holstein. Bismarck had considered this contingency, and\r\nguarded himself against it. Many years later Beust put the question to\r\nhim. \"Oh, I was all right,\" he answered; \"I had assured myself that the\r\nDanes would not give in. I had led them to think that England would\r\nsupport them, though I knew this was not the case.\" He had, however,\r\neven a surer guarantee than this; the ultimatum presented to Denmark was\r\ncouched in such a form that even if he would the King could not comply\r\nwith it. The requirement was that the Constitution should be revoked\r\nbefore the 1st of January. By the Constitution the King could not do\r\nthis of his own prerogative; he must have the assent of the Rigsrad.\r\nThis assent could not be obtained for the following reasons: the Rigsrad\r\nof the old Constitution had been dissolved and had no longer a legal\r\nexistence; a new assembly could not be summoned before the 1st of\r\nJanuary--there was not time. If an assembly were summoned after that\r\ndate, it must be of course summoned according to the new Constitution.\r\nTo do this, however, would be to bring the obnoxious Constitution\r\nactually into force, and would mean, so to speak, a declaration of war\r\nagainst Prussia. If the King wished to give in he must have time; he\r\nmust be allowed to summon the new assembly, lay before it the German\r\ndemands, and require it to declare its own revocation. The English\r\nGovernment, still anxious to keep the peace, represented to Bismarck the\r\ndilemma in which he had placed the Danes. Lord Wodehouse, who was in\r\nBerlin in December, requested that at least more time should be allowed.\r\nBismarck refused to listen to the request.\r\n\r\n  \"These constitutional questions,\" he said, \"had nothing to do\r\n  with him; the Danes had put off the Germans for years; they could\r\n  not wait any longer. The King could always make a _coup d'état_;\r\n  he would have to do so sooner or later. Germany and Denmark could\r\n  never be at peace so long as the Democratic party had the\r\n  authority.\"\r\n\r\nDenmark did not give way; the help from England, on which they had\r\nreckoned, was not forthcoming; the fatal day passed; the Austrians and\r\nPrussians entered Holstein, marched across that Duchy, and in the early\r\npart of February began the invasion of Schleswig. The relations of the\r\nAllied troops to the Federal army of occupation were very remarkable.\r\nBoth were opposed to the Danes, but they were equally opposed to one\r\nanother; had they dared to do so, the Saxons would have opposed the\r\nPrussian advance. As it was they sullenly watched the Prussian and\r\nAustrian columns marching north to the invasion of Denmark.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that the remodelled Prussian army had been tested\r\non the field of battle; Bismarck had brought it about that they were\r\nfighting for the cause of Germany and in alliance with Austria. As soon\r\nas war began, his own position improved. The King and the army were, of\r\ncourse, all the more confident in a Minister who had given them so good\r\na cause of war and allowed them to take the field side by side with\r\ntheir old ally. Their superiority in number and discipline ensured\r\nsuccess in the military operations; the Danes evacuated their first\r\nposition at the Dannewirk; the German troops occupied the whole of\r\nSchleswig, then after some further delay advanced into Jutland, and\r\nfinally began the siege of the strong fortification of the Düppel. The\r\ntaking of this was a difficult piece of work, which, after some delay,\r\nwas successfully carried out at the beginning of April.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the diplomatic difficulties had continued. There had now come\r\nfrom England the proposal of a Conference. This Bismarck, always wishing\r\nto preserve the appearance of moderation, accepted. Before doing so, he\r\nknew that he had gained a very important ally. Napoleon was displeased\r\nwith the English Government; he it was who suggested to Bismarck that\r\nthe best solution of the difficulty would be the annexation of the\r\nDuchies to Prussia. It was just what Bismarck himself desired. Would he\r\nbe able to bring it about? This was what was in his mind when he had to\r\nconsider the attitude he should adopt at the Conference.\r\n\r\nHe could not, of course, propose it openly; he might be able to arrange\r\naffairs so that in the universal confusion this solution should be\r\nwelcomed. He first of all began to change his attitude towards the\r\nGerman agitation for Augustenburg; hitherto he had opposed and\r\ndiscouraged it; now he let it have free course. He wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"The present situation is such that it seems to me desirable to\r\n  let loose the whole pack against the Danes at the Congress; the\r\n  joint noise will work in the direction of making the subjugation\r\n  of the Duchies to Denmark appear impossible to foreigners; they\r\n  will have to consider programmes which the Prussian Government\r\n  cannot lay before them.\"\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that England and Russia were to be convinced that\r\nDenmark could not regain the Duchies; then they would have to consider\r\nwho should have them. Bismarck believed that Austria was irrevocably\r\nopposed to Augustenburg. \"She would rather see the Duchies in our hands\r\nthan in those of the Prince,\" he wrote. Austria and Russia would,\r\ntherefore, oppose this solution; if both Denmark and Augustenburg were\r\nimpossible, then would be the time for France to ask why should they not\r\nbe given to Prussia, and to join this proposal with another one for the\r\ndivision of the Duchies according to nationality.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, in accordance with his principles, wished entirely to\r\ndisregard the question of law; he was equally indifferent to the Treaty\r\nof London, the hereditary rights of Augustenburg, or the chartered\r\nprivileges of the Duchies. He wished to consult the inhabitants and\r\nallow each village to vote whether it wished to be German or Danish;\r\nthus, districts in the north where Danish was spoken would then be\r\nincorporated in Denmark; the whole of Holstein and the south of\r\nSchleswig would be permanently united to Germany, and by preference to\r\nPrussia. These revolutionary principles of Napoleon were in the eyes of\r\nthe Austrian statesmen criminal, for if applied consistently not only\r\nwould Austria be deprived of Venetia, but the whole Empire would be\r\ndissolved. It required all Bismarck's ingenuity to maintain the alliance\r\nwith Austria, which was still necessary to him, and at the same time to\r\nkeep Napoleon's friendship by giving his assent to doctrines that would\r\nbe so convenient to Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn considering Bismarck's diplomatic work we must not suppose that he\r\never deceived himself into thinking that he would be able clearly to\r\nforesee all that would happen; he knew too well the uncertain nature of\r\nthe pieces with which he had to deal: no one could quite foretell, for\r\ninstance, the result of the struggle which was going on in the English\r\nMinistry or the votes of the House of Commons; equally impossible was it\r\nto build on the assurances of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n  \"The longer I work at politics,\" he said, \"the smaller is my\r\n  belief in human calculation. I look at the affair according to my\r\n  human understanding, but gratitude for God's assistance so far,\r\n  raises in me the confidence that the Lord is able to turn our\r\n  errors to our own good; that I experience daily to my wholesome\r\n  humiliation.\"\r\n\r\nThis time he had been mistaken in his forecast. In a despatch of May 23d\r\nto Austria he suggested two solutions,--the Augustenburg succession, and\r\nannexation by Prussia; he inclined towards the former, though, as he\r\nsaid, if the Prince was to be recognised,\r\n\r\n  \"it would be imperatively necessary to obtain guarantees for a\r\n  Conservative administration, and some security that the Duchies\r\n  should not become the home of democratic agitations.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said elsewhere, \"Kiel must not become a second Gotha.\" He no doubt\r\nanticipated that Austria would refuse this first alternative; then the\r\nannexation by Prussia would naturally arise for discussion. Had Austria\r\nbeen consistent, all would have been well, but a change had taken place\r\nthere; the Government was not disinclined to win the popularity that\r\nwould accrue to them if they took up the Augustenburg cause; after all,\r\nAustria would be rather strengthened than weakened by the establishment\r\nof a new Federal State, which, as all the other smaller Princes, would\r\nprobably be inclined to take the Austrian side. In answer, therefore, to\r\nthis despatch the Austrians, throwing aside all attempt at consistency,\r\nproposed vigorously to press the Augustenburg claim. \"It is just what we\r\nwere going to suggest ourselves,\" they said. Bismarck therefore was\r\ncompelled now, as best he could, to get out of the difficulty, and, as\r\nAustria had not rejected it, he begins to withdraw the proposal he had\r\nhimself made. To Bernstorff, his envoy at the Congress, he writes:\r\n\r\n  \"Austria is endeavouring to establish irrevocably the candidacy\r\n  of Augustenburg in order by this means to render it difficult for\r\n  Prussia to impose special conditions. We cannot consent to this.\r\n  The dynastic questions must be discussed with special\r\n  consideration for Prussian interests, and, consequently, other\r\n  possibilities cannot be ruled out, until we have negotiated with\r\n  Augustenburg and ascertained in what relation to Prussia he\r\n  intends to place himself and his country. If the person of\r\n  Augustenburg meets with more opposition in the Conference than\r\n  the project of a division, then let the former drop.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal, however, had to be made; for once, all the German Powers\r\nappeared in agreement when they demanded from the neutrals the\r\nrecognition of Augustenburg; but Bismarck proposed it in such words as\r\nto avoid pledging himself to the legality. Of course the proposal was\r\nrejected by the Danes and Russians and it was allowed to fall to the\r\nground. For Bismarck the interest is for the moment diverted from London\r\nto Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe time had come when Bismarck should definitely decide on the attitude\r\nhe was to adopt toward Augustenburg. Hitherto he had avoided committing\r\nhimself irrevocably; it was still open to him either to adopt him as the\r\nPrussian candidate on such conditions as might seem desirable, or to\r\nrefuse to have any dealings with him. He had, in fact, kept both plans\r\nopen, for it was characteristic of his diplomatic work that he would\r\ngenerally keep in his mind, and, to some extent, carry out in action,\r\nseveral different plans at the same time. If one failed him he could\r\ntake up another. In this case he intended, if possible, to get the\r\nDuchies for Prussia; it was always to be foreseen that the difficulties\r\nmight be insurmountable; he had therefore to consider the next best\r\nalternative. This would be the creation of a new State, but one which\r\nwas bound to Prussia by a special and separate treaty. There were many\r\ndemands, some of them legitimate, which Prussia was prepared to make.\r\nBismarck attributed great importance to the acquisition of Kiel, because\r\nhe wanted to found a Prussian navy. Then he was very anxious to have a\r\ncanal made across Holstein so that Prussian vessels could reach the\r\nNorth Sea without passing the Sound; and of course he had to consider\r\nthe military protection on the north. It would therefore be a condition\r\nthat, whoever was made Duke, certain military and other privileges\r\nshould be granted to Prussia. On this, all through the summer,\r\nnegotiations were carried on unofficially between the Prince of\r\nAugustenburg and the Prussian authorities. We cannot here discuss them\r\nin detail, but the Prince seems to have been quite willing to acquiesce\r\nin these naval and military requirements. He made several suggestions\r\nand objections in detail, and he also pointed out that constitutionally\r\nhe could not enter into a valid treaty until after he had been made Duke\r\nand received the assent of the Estates. I think, however, that no one\r\ncan doubt that he was quite loyal to Prussia and really wished to bring\r\nthe matter to a satisfactory issue. As might be expected, he was very\r\ncautious in his negotiations with Bismarck, but his letters to the King\r\nare more open. Had Bismarck wished he could at any time have come to an\r\nagreement with the Prince, but he never gave the opportunity for a\r\nserious and careful discussion on the detailed wording of the\r\nconditions. He did not wish to be bound by them, but he kept the\r\nnegotiations open in case events occurred which might compel him to\r\naccept this solution.\r\n\r\nIn his treatment of the question he was, to some extent, influenced by\r\nthe personal dislike he always felt for the Prince.\r\n\r\nWhat was the cause of this enmity? There was nothing in the Prince's\r\ncharacter to justify it; he was a modest, honourable, and educated man;\r\nthough deficient in practical ability, he had at a very critical time\r\nannounced his claims to a decision and maintained them with resolution.\r\nBismarck, who in private life was always able to do justice to his\r\nenemies, recognised this: \"I should have acted in just the same way\r\nmyself had I been in your place,\" he said. He always himself said that\r\nhis distrust of the Prince was caused by his dislike of the men whom the\r\nlatter relied upon for advice. He was too closely connected with the\r\nProgressive party. He had surrounded himself with a kind of ministry,\r\nconsisting chiefly of men who, though by birth inhabitants of the\r\nDuchies, had for some years been living at Gotha under the protection of\r\nthe Duke of Coburg. They were strong Liberals and belonged to that party\r\nin Germany of which the Court of Coburg was the centre, who maintained a\r\nclose connection with the Crown Prince, and who undoubtedly were looking\r\nforward to the time when the Crown Prince would become King of Prussia,\r\nBismarck would be dismissed, and their party would come into office.\r\nThis is probably quite sufficient reason to explain Bismarck's personal\r\ndislike of Augustenburg, though it is probable that he laid more stress\r\non this aspect of the matter than he otherwise would have done, for he\r\nhoped thereby to prejudice the King against the Prince; as long as the\r\nKing recognised Augustenburg's claims, his own hands would be tied in\r\nthe attempt to win the Duchies for Prussia.\r\n\r\nHe had, as we have seen, had a short interview with the Prince at the\r\nend of the previous year now a new meeting was arranged, avowedly to\r\ndiscuss the conditions which Prussia would require if she supported the\r\nPrince. The Crown Prince, who was very anxious to help his friend,\r\npersuaded him to go to Berlin and if possible come to some clear\r\nunderstanding with the King and Bismarck. Augustenburg was reluctant to\r\ntake this step. Loyal as he was to Prussia he much distrusted Bismarck.\r\nHe feared that if he unreservedly placed his cause in Prussia's hands,\r\nBismarck would in some way betray him. The position he took up was\r\nperfectly consistent. He was, by hereditary right, reigning Duke; he\r\nonly wished to be left alone with the Duchies; he knew that if he was,\r\nthey would at once recognise him and he would enter into government. In\r\norder to win his dominions, he had required the help of Germany; it was\r\ncomparatively indifferent to him whether the help came from Prussia,\r\nAustria, or the Federation. But he quite understood that Prussia must\r\nhave some recompense for the help it had given. What he had to fear was\r\nthat, if he entered into any separate and secret engagements with\r\nPrussia, he would thereby lose the support he enjoyed in the rest of\r\nGermany, and that then Bismarck would find some excuse not to carry out\r\nhis promises, so that at the end he would be left entirely without\r\nsupport. We know that his suspicions were unfounded, for Bismarck was\r\nnot the man in this way to desert anyone who had entered into an\r\nagreement with him, but Augustenburg could not know this and had every\r\nreason for distrusting Bismarck, who was his avowed enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of May, the Prince, with many misgivings, came to Berlin.\r\nThe evening of the next day he had a long interview with Bismarck; it\r\nbegan about nine o'clock and lasted till after midnight. There is no\r\ndoubt that this interview was decisive against his chances. From that\r\ntime Bismarck was determined that under no circumstances should he\r\nsucceed, and we shall see that when Bismarck wished for anything he\r\nusually attained it. We would gladly, therefore, know exactly what\r\nhappened; both Bismarck and the Prince have given accounts of what took\r\nplace, but unfortunately they differ on very important points, and no\r\none else was present at the interview. It is clear that the Prince\r\nthroughout, for the reasons we have named, observed great reserve. It\r\nwould undoubtedly have been wiser of him openly to place himself\r\nentirely in Bismarck's hands, to throw himself on the generosity of\r\nPrussia, and to agree to the terms which Bismarck offered. Why he did\r\nnot do this we have explained. The conversation chiefly turned on the\r\nPrussian demands for the harbour of Kiel and certain other concessions;\r\nthe Prince expressed himself quite willing to grant most of what was\r\nrequired, but he could not enter into any formal treaty without the\r\nconsent of the Estates of the Duchies. When he left the room he seems to\r\nhave been fairly satisfied with what had been said. If so he deceived\r\nhimself grievously. Scarcely had he gone (it was already midnight) when\r\nBismarck sent off despatches to St. Petersburg, Paris, and London,\r\nexplaining that he was not inclined to support Augustenburg any longer,\r\nand instructing the Ambassadors to act accordingly. Not content with\r\nthis he at once brought forward an alternative candidate. Among the many\r\nclaimants to the Duchies had been the Duke of Oldenburg and the Czar,\r\nwho both belonged to the same branch of the family. The Czar had, at the\r\nend of May, transferred his claims to the Duke, and Bismarck now wrote\r\nto St. Petersburg that he would also be prepared to support him. We must\r\nnot suppose that in doing this he had the slightest intention of\r\nallowing the Duke to be successful. He gained, however, a double\r\nadvantage. First of all he pleased the Czar and prevented any\r\ndifficulties from Russia; secondly, the very fact of a rival candidate\r\ncoming forward would indefinitely postpone any settlement. So long as\r\nAugustenburg was the only German candidate there was always the danger,\r\nas at the Congress of London, that he might suddenly be installed and\r\nBismarck be unable to prevent it. If, however, the Duke of Oldenburg\r\ncame forward, Bismarck would at once take up the position that, as there\r\nwere rival claimants, a proper legal verdict must be obtained and that\r\nPrussia could not act so unjustly as to prejudice the decision by\r\nextending her support to either. It was not necessary for anyone to know\r\nthat he himself had induced the Duke of Oldenburg to revive his claim.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he took other steps to frustrate Augustenburg's hopes;\r\nhe caused the statement to be published in the Prussian papers that\r\nduring the conversation of May 31st the Prince had said that he had\r\nnever asked the Prussians for help, and that he could have got on very\r\nwell without them. It was just the sort of thing which would strongly\r\nprejudice the King against him, and Bismarck was very anxious to destroy\r\nthe influence which the Prince still had with the King and with many\r\nother Prussians. At that time, and always later, the Prince denied that\r\nhe had said anything of the kind. Even if, in the course of a long\r\nconversation, he had said anything which might have been interpreted to\r\nmean this, it was a great breach of confidence to publish these words\r\nfrom a private discussion taken out of their context. The Prussian Press\r\nreceived the word, and for years to come did not cease to pour out its\r\nvenom against the Prince. This action of Bismarck's seemed quite to\r\njustify the apprehension with which the Prince had gone to Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to look for any far-fetched explanation of\r\nBismarck's action; the simplest is the most probable. He had not\r\narranged the interview with any intention of entrapping Augustenburg; he\r\nhad really been doubtful whether, after all, it might not be wiser to\r\naccept the Prince and make a separate treaty with him. All depended on\r\nhis personal character and the attitude he adopted towards Prussia.\r\nBismarck, who had great confidence in his own judgment of mankind,\r\nregarded a personal interview as the best means of coming to a\r\nconclusion; the result of it was that he felt it impossible to rely on\r\nthe Prince, who, instead of being open, positive, and ready to do\r\nbusiness, was reserved, hesitating, distrustful, and critical. Bismarck\r\nhad given him his chance; he had failed to seize it. Instead of being a\r\ngrateful client he was a mere obstacle in the road of Prussian\r\ngreatness, and had to be swept away. Against him all the resources of\r\ndiplomacy were now directed. His influence must be destroyed, but not by\r\nforce, for his strength came from his very weakness; the task was to\r\nundermine the regard which the German people had for him and their\r\nenthusiasm for his cause--work to be properly assigned to the Prussian\r\nPress.\r\n\r\nThe Conference in London separated at the end of June without coming to\r\nany conclusion; it had, however, enabled Bismarck formally to dissociate\r\nhimself from the former Treaty of London, and henceforward he had a free\r\nhand in his dealings with Denmark.\r\n\r\nAnother brilliant feat of arms, the transference of the Prussian troops\r\nacross the sea to the island of Alsen, completed the war. Denmark had to\r\ncapitulate, and the terms of peace, which were ultimately decided at\r\nVienna, were that Schleswig, Holstein, and also Lauenburg should be\r\ngiven up. Christian transferred to the Emperor of Austria and the King\r\nof Prussia all the rights which he possessed. As to Lauenburg the matter\r\nwas simple--the authority of the King of Denmark over this Duchy was\r\nundisputed; as to Schleswig-Holstein all the old questions still\r\ncontinued; the King had transferred his rights, but what were his\r\nrights? He could only grant that which belonged to him; if the Prince of\r\nAugustenburg was Duke, then the King of Denmark could not confer another\r\nman's throne. There was, however, this difference: hitherto the question\r\nhad been a European one, but since the London Congress no other State\r\nhad any claim to interfere. The disputed succession of the Duchies must\r\nbe settled between Austria and Prussia. It was a special clause in the\r\nterms of peace that it should be decided by agreement between them and\r\nnot referred to the Diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY OF GASTEIN.\r\n\r\n1864-1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck always looked back with peculiar pleasure on the negotiations\r\nwhich were concluded by the Peace of Vienna. His conduct of the affair\r\nhad in fact been masterly; he had succeeded in permanently severing the\r\nDuchies from Denmark; he had done this without allowing foreign nations\r\nthe opportunity for interfering; he had maintained a close alliance with\r\nAustria; he had pleased and flattered the Emperors of Russia and France.\r\nWhat perhaps gave him most satisfaction was that, though the result had\r\nbeen what the whole of the German nation desired, he had brought it\r\nabout by means which were universally condemned, and the rescue of the\r\nDuchies had been a severe defeat to the Democratic and National party.\r\n\r\nWith the Peace a new stage begins; the Duchies had been transferred to\r\nthe Allied Powers; how were they now to be disposed of? We have seen\r\nthat Bismarck desired to acquire them for Prussia; if it were absolutely\r\nnecessary, he would accept an arrangement which would leave them to be\r\nruled by another Prince, provided very extensive rights were given to\r\nPrussia. He would acquiesce in this arrangement if annexation would\r\ninvolve a war with one of the European Powers. If, however, a Duke of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein was to be created he was determined that it should\r\nnot be the Prince of Augustenburg, whom he distrusted and disliked. The\r\nreal object of his diplomacy must be to get the Duchies offered to\r\nPrussia; it was, however, very improbable, as the Czar once said to him,\r\nthat this would happen.\r\n\r\nHe wished for annexation, but he wished to have it peacefully; he had\r\nnot forgotten his own resolution to have a war with Austria, but he did\r\nnot wish to make the Duchies the occasion of a war. Austria, however,\r\nrefused to assent to annexation unless the King of Prussia would give\r\nher a corresponding increase of territory; this the King positively\r\nrefused. It was an unchangeable principle with him that he would not\r\nsurrender a single village from the Prussian Monarchy; his pride\r\nrevolted from the idea of bartering old provinces for new. If Austria\r\nwould not offer the Duchies to Prussia, neither would the Diet; the\r\nmajority remained loyal to Augustenburg. The people of the Duchies were\r\nequally determined in their opposition to the scheme; attempts were made\r\nby Bismarck's friends and agents to get up a petition to incorporate\r\nthem with Prussia, but they always failed. Even the Prussian people were\r\nnot really very anxious for this acquisition, and it required two years\r\nof constant writing in the inspired Press to bring them into such a\r\nstate of mind that they would believe that it was, I will not say the\r\nmost honourable, but the most desirable solution. The King himself\r\nhesitated. It was true that ever since the taking of the Düppel the lust\r\nof conquest had been aroused in his mind; he had visited the place where\r\nso many Prussian soldiers had laid down their lives; and it was a\r\nnatural feeling if he wished that the country they had conquered should\r\nbelong to their own State. On the other hand, he still felt that the\r\nrights of Augustenburg could not be neglected; when he discussed the\r\nmatter with the Emperor of Austria and the subject of annexation was\r\nraised, he remained silent and was ill at ease.\r\n\r\nIf Bismarck was to get his way, he must first of all convince the King;\r\nthis done, an opportunity might be found. There was one man who was\r\nprepared to offer him the Duchies, and that man was Napoleon. It is\r\ninstructive to notice that as soon as the negotiations at Vienna had\r\nbeen concluded, Bismarck went to spend a few weeks at his old holiday\r\nresort of Biarritz. He took the opportunity of having some conversation\r\nwith both the Emperor and his Ministers.\r\n\r\nHe required rest and change after the prolonged anxieties of the two\r\nyears; at no place did he find it so well as in the south of France:\r\n\r\n  \"It seems like a dream to be here again,\" he writes to his wife.\r\n  \"I am already quite well, and would be quite cheerful if I only\r\n  knew that all was well with you. The life I lead at Berlin is a\r\n  kind of penal servitude, when I think of my independent life\r\n  abroad.\" Seabathing, expeditions across the frontier, and sport\r\n  passed three weeks. \"I have not for a long time found myself in\r\n  such comfortable conditions, and yet the evil habit of work has\r\n  rooted itself so deeply in my nature, that I feel some disquiet\r\n  of conscience at my laziness. I almost long for the\r\n  Wilhelmstrasse, at least if my dear ones were there.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 25th he left \"dear Biarritz\" for Paris, where he found plenty of\r\npolitics awaiting him; here he had another of those interviews with\r\nNapoleon and his Ministers on which so much depended, and then he went\r\nback to his labours at Berlin.\r\n\r\nAt that time he was not prepared to break with Austria, and he still\r\nhoped that some peaceful means of acquisition might be found, as he\r\nwrote some months later to Goltz, \"We have not got all the good we can\r\nfrom the Austrian alliance.\" Prussia had the distinct advantage that she\r\nwas more truly in possession of the Duchies than Austria. This\r\npossession would more and more guarantee its own continuance; it was\r\nimprobable that any Power would undertake an offensive war to expel her.\r\nOn the whole, therefore, Bismarck seems to have wished for the present\r\nto leave things as they were; gradually to increase the hold of Prussia\r\non the Duchies, and wait until they fell of themselves into his hands.\r\nIn pursuit of this policy it was necessary, however, to expel all other\r\nclaimants, and this could not be done without the consent of Austria;\r\nthis produced a cause of friction between the two great Powers which\r\nmade it impossible to maintain the co-dominium.\r\n\r\nThere were in Holstein the Confederate troops who had gone there a year\r\nago and had never been withdrawn; Augustenburg was still living at Kiel\r\nwith his phantom Court; and then there were the Austrian soldiers,\r\nPrussia's own allies. One after another they had to be removed. Bismarck\r\ndealt first with the Confederate troops.\r\n\r\nHe had, as indeed he always was careful to have, the strict letter of\r\nthe law on his side; he pointed out that as the execution had been\r\ndirected against the government of Christian, and Christian had ceased\r\nto have any authority, the execution itself must _ipso facto_ cease; he\r\ntherefore wrote asking Austria to join in a demand to Saxony and\r\nHanover; he was prepared, if the States refused, to expel their troops\r\nby force. Hanover--for the King strongly disliked Augustenburg--at once\r\nacquiesced; Saxony refused. Bismarck began to make military\r\npreparations; the Saxons began to arm; the Crown treasures were taken\r\nfrom Dresden to Königstein. Would Austria support Saxony or Prussia? For\r\nsome days the question was in debate; at last Austria determined to\r\nsupport a motion at the Diet declaring the execution ended. It was\r\ncarried by eight votes to seven, and the Saxons had to obey. The troops\r\non their return home refused to march across Prussian territory; and\r\nfrom this time Beust and the King of Saxony must be reckoned among the\r\ndetermined and irreconcilable enemies of Bismarck.\r\n\r\nThe first of the rivals was removed; there remained Austria and the\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\nJust at this time a change of Ministry had taken place in Austria;\r\nRechberg, who had kept up the alliance, was removed, and the\r\nanti-Prussian party came to the front. It was, therefore, no longer so\r\neasy to deal with the Prince, for he had a new and vigorous ally in\r\nAustria. Mensdorf, the new Minister, proposed in a series of lengthy\r\ndespatches his solution of the question; it was that the rights of the\r\ntwo Powers should be transferred to Augustenburg, and that\r\nSchleswig-Holstein should be established as an independent Confederate\r\nState. The Austrian position was from this time clearly defined, and it\r\nwas in favour of that policy to which Bismarck would never consent. It\r\nremained for him to propose an alternative. Prussia, he said, could only\r\nallow the new State to be created on condition that large rights were\r\ngiven to Prussia; what these were would require consideration; he must\r\nconsult the different departments. This took time, and every month's\r\ndelay was so much gain for Prussia; it was not till February, 1865, that\r\nBismarck was able to present his demands, which were, that Kiel should\r\nbe a Prussian port, Rendsburg a Prussian fortress; that the canal was to\r\nbe made by Prussia and belong to Prussia, the management of the post and\r\ntelegraph service to be Prussian and also the railways; the army was to\r\nbe not only organised on the Prussian system but actually incorporated\r\nwith the Prussian army, so that the soldiers would take the oath of\r\nallegiance not to their own Duke but to the King of Prussia. The Duchies\r\nwere to join the Prussian Customs' Union and assimilate their system of\r\nfinance with that of Prussia. The proposals were so drawn up that it\r\nwould be impossible for Austria to support, or for the Prince of\r\nAugustenburg to accept them. They were, in fact, as Bismarck himself\r\ntold the Crown Prince, not meant to be accepted. \"I would rather dig\r\npotatoes than be a reigning Prince under such conditions,\" said one of\r\nthe Austrian Ministers. When they were officially presented, Karolyi was\r\ninstructed to meet them with an unhesitating negative, and all\r\ndiscussion on them ceased.\r\n\r\nPrussia and Austria had both proposed their solution; each State even\r\nrefused to consider the suggestion made by the other. Meanwhile, since\r\nthe departure of the Confederate troops the administration of the\r\nDuchies was in their hands; each Power attempted so to manage affairs as\r\nto prepare the way for the final settlement it desired, Prussia for\r\nannexation, Austria for Augustenburg. Prince Frederick was still living\r\nat Kiel. His position was very anomalous: he assumed the style and title\r\nof a reigning Prince, he was attended by something like a Court and by\r\nMinisters; throughout Holstein, almost without exception, and to a great\r\nextent also in Schleswig, he was looked upon and treated by the\r\npopulation as their lawful sovereign; his birthday was celebrated as a\r\npublic holiday; he was often prayed for in church. All this the\r\nAustrians regarded with equanimity and indirectly supported; Bismarck\r\nwished to expel him from the country, but could not do so without the\r\nconsent of Austria. At the end of March the matter again came up in the\r\nDiet; Bavaria and Saxony brought in a motion that they expected that\r\nAustria and Prussia would transfer the administration to Frederick. The\r\nPrussian Envoy rose and explained that they might expect it, but that\r\nPrussia would not fulfil their expectations; he moved that the claims of\r\nall candidates should be considered by the Diet, not only those of\r\nAugustenburg and of the Duke of Oldenburg, but also of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nThe claims of Brandenburg were a new weapon of which Bismarck was glad\r\nto avail himself. No one supposed that they had really any foundation;\r\nthey were not seriously put forward; but if the motion was carried, the\r\nDiet would be involved in the solution of a very complicated and\r\nnecessarily very lengthy legal discussion. What the result was would be\r\nknown from the beginning, but the Diet and its committees always worked\r\nslowly, and Bismarck could with much force maintain that, until they had\r\ncome to a decision, there was no reason for handing over the\r\nadministration to Augustenburg; it was at least decent not to do this\r\ntill the claims of the rivals had been duly weighed. In the months that\r\nmust elapse many things might happen. In the meantime the Diet would be\r\nhelpless. When it had come to a decision he would then be able to point\r\nout, as he had already done, that they had no legal power for\r\ndetermining who was the ruler of any State, and that their decision\r\ntherefore was quite valueless, and everything would have been again\r\nexactly as it was before. Austria supported the motion of Saxony, which\r\nwas carried by nine votes to six. Prussia answered by sending her fleet\r\nfrom Danzig to Kiel, and occupying the harbour; the Government asked\r\nfor a vote for the erection of fortifications and docks and for the\r\nbuilding of a fleet; the Chamber refused the money, but Roon declared\r\npublicly in the House that Prussia would retain Kiel,--they had gone\r\nthere and did not intend to leave. The occupation of Kiel was an open\r\ndefiance to Austria; that it was intended to be so is shewn by the fact\r\nthat a few days later Bismarck wrote to Usedom, the Prussian Minister at\r\nFlorence, instructing him to sound the Italian Government as to whether\r\nthey would be willing to join Prussia in war against Austria. At the\r\nsame time he wrote to Goltz to find out in Paris whether there was any\r\nalliance between Austria and France. It would be some time before\r\nforeign relations could be sufficiently cleared up for him to determine\r\nwhether or not war would be safe. He occupied the intervening period by\r\ncontinuing the negotiations as to the principles on which the joint\r\nadministration should be conducted. He came forward with a new proposal\r\nand one which was extremely surprising, that the Estates of the Duchies\r\nshould be summoned, and negotiations entered into with them. It is one\r\nof the most obscure of all his actions; he did it contrary to the advice\r\nof those on the spot. Everyone warned him that if the Estates were\r\nsummoned their first action would be to proclaim Augustenburg as Duke.\r\nSome suppose that the King insisted on his taking this step; that is,\r\nhowever, very improbable; others that he proposed it in order that it\r\nmight be rejected by Austria, so that Austria might lose the great\r\ninfluence which by her support of Augustenburg she was gaining in\r\nGermany. Austria, however, accepted the proposal, and then negotiations\r\nbegan as to the form in which the Estates should be called together;\r\nwhat should be the relations to them of the two Powers? This gave rise\r\nto a minute controversy, which could not be settled, and no doubt\r\nBismarck did not wish that it should be settled. One of his conditions,\r\nhowever, was that, before the Estates were summoned, Augustenburg should\r\nbe compelled to leave Holstein. Of course the Prince refused, for he\r\nwell knew that, if he once went away, he would never be allowed to\r\nreturn. The Duke of Oldenburg, who was always ready to come forward when\r\nBismarck wished it, himself demanded the expulsion of the Prince. The\r\nKing of Prussia wrote a severe letter to Augustenburg, intimating his\r\ndispleasure at his conduct and warning him to leave the country. The\r\nPrince answered, as he always did to the King, expressing his gratitude\r\nand his constant loyalty to Prussia, but refused, and his refusal was\r\npublished in the papers. It was still impossible to remove him except by\r\nforce, but before he ventured on that Bismarck had to make secure the\r\nposition of Prussia.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of July events began to move towards a crisis. Bismarck\r\nhad appointed a commission of Prussian lawyers to report on the legal\r\nclaim of the different candidates for the Ducal throne; their report was\r\nnow published. They came to the conclusion, as we might anticipate that\r\nthey would, that Augustenburg had absolutely no claim, and that legally\r\nthe full authority was possessed by the two Powers who had the _de\r\nfacto_ government. Their opinion did not carry much weight even in\r\nPrussia itself, but they seem to have succeeded in convincing the King.\r\nHitherto he had always been haunted by the fear lest, in dispossessing\r\nAugustenburg, he would be keeping a German Prince from the throne which\r\nwas his right, and that to him was a very serious consideration. Now his\r\nconscience was set at rest. From this time the last support which\r\nAugustenburg had in Prussia was taken from him, for the Crown Prince,\r\nwho always remained faithful to him, was almost without influence.\r\nBismarck was henceforward able to move more rapidly. On the 5th of July\r\nthe Prince's birthday was celebrated throughout the Duchy with great\r\nenthusiasm; this gave bitter offence to the King; shortly afterwards\r\nBismarck left Berlin and joined the King, who was taking his annual cure\r\nat Carlsbad, and for July 28th a Council of State was summoned to meet\r\nat Regensburg. Probably this is the only instance of a King coming to so\r\nimportant a decision outside his own territories. The Council was\r\nattended not only by the Ministers, but also by some of the generals and\r\nby Goltz, who was summoned from Paris for the purpose. It was determined\r\nto send an ultimatum to Austria; the chief demand was that Austria\r\nshould withdraw all support from Augustenburg, and agree immediately to\r\neject him from the Duchies. If Austria refused to agree, Prussia would\r\ndo so herself; he was to be seized, put on board a ship, and carried off\r\nto East Prussia. To shew that they were in earnest, a beginning was made\r\nby seizing in Holstein Prussian subjects who had written in the\r\nnewspapers in a sense opposed to the wishes of the Prussian Government,\r\nand carrying them off to be tried at Berlin. In order to be prepared for\r\nall possibilities, an official request was sent to Italy to ask for her\r\nassistance in case of an outbreak of war. After these decisions were\r\narrived at, the King continued his journey to Gastein to complete his\r\ncure; there, on Austrian territory in company with Bismarck, he awaited\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\nIn Austria opinions were divided; the feeling of annoyance with Prussia\r\nhad been steadily growing during the last year. The military party was\r\ngaining ground; many would have been only too glad to take up the\r\nchallenge. It would indeed have been their wisest plan to do so--openly\r\nto support the claim of Augustenburg, to demand that the Estates of\r\nHolstein should be at once summoned, and if Bismarck carried out his\r\nthreats, to put herself at the head of Germany and in the name of the\r\noutraged right of a German Prince and a German State to take up the\r\nPrussian challenge.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, serious reasons against this. The Emperor was very\r\nreluctant to go to war, and, as so often, the personal feelings of the\r\nrulers had much to do with the policy of the Government. Then the\r\ninternal condition of Austria both politically and financially was very\r\nunsatisfactory; it would have been necessary to raise a loan and this\r\ncould not be easily done. There was also the constant danger from Italy,\r\nfor Austria knew that, even if there were no alliance, as soon as she\r\nwas attacked on one side by Prussia, the Italians on the other side\r\nwould invade Venetia. Count Metternich was instructed to ask Napoleon,\r\nbut received as an answer that they could not hope for a French\r\nalliance; the Austrians feared that he might already be engaged on the\r\nside of Prussia. For all these reasons it was determined to attempt to\r\nbring about a compromise. A change of Ministry took place, and Count\r\nBlome, one of the new Ministers, was sent to Gastein. He found both the\r\nKing and Bismarck not disinclined to some compromise. The reports both\r\nfrom Florence and Paris did not seem to Bismarck to be entirely\r\nsatisfactory: he did not find such readiness as he had hoped for; he\r\nfeared that some secret understanding might be arrived at between\r\nAustria and Napoleon; and then, as we have seen, he was really anxious\r\nto avoid war for the sake of the Duchies; he had not given up his\r\nintention of war with Austria some day, but it would be impossible to\r\nfind a less agreeable excuse for it.\r\n\r\n  \"Halbuber and Augustenburg are acting so that we shall soon have\r\n  to apply force; this will cause bad blood in Vienna; it is not\r\n  what I wish, but Austria gives us no choice,\"\r\n\r\nhe had written a few days before. After a few days of indecision a\r\ncompromise therefore was agreed upon. The joint administration of the\r\nDuchies was to be given up; Austria was to administer Holstein, Prussia,\r\nSchleswig; they both undertook not to bring the question before the\r\nDiet; the Duchy of Lauenburg was to be handed over absolutely to the\r\nKing of Prussia, the Emperor of Austria receiving two million thalers\r\nfor his share. Lauenburg was the first new possession which Bismarck\r\nwas able to offer to the King; the grateful monarch conferred on him the\r\ntitle of Count, and in later years presented to him large estates out of\r\nthe very valuable royal domains. It was from Lauenburg that in later\r\nyears the young German Emperor took the title which he wished to confer\r\non the retiring Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nOUTBREAK OF WAR WITH AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\n1865-1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangement made at Gastein could not be permanent; it was only a\r\ntemporary expedient to put off the conflict which henceforward was\r\ninevitable--inevitable, that is, if the Emperor of Austria still refused\r\nto sell Holstein to Prussia. It was, however, so far as it went, a great\r\ngain to Prussia, because it deprived Austria of the esteem of the other\r\nGerman States. Her strength had hitherto lain in her strict adhesion to\r\npopular feeling and to what the majority of the Germans, Princes and\r\npeople alike, believed was justice; by coming to a separate agreement\r\nwith Prussia, she had shaken their confidence. Bavaria especially was\r\nmuch annoyed by this change of front, and it seemed probable that the\r\nmost important of the southern States would soon be ranged on the side\r\nof Prussia. This was a consummation which Bismarck ardently desired, and\r\nto which he addressed himself with much energy.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of France was more important than that of the German\r\nStates, and in the autumn Bismarck made a fresh visit to that country.\r\nJust as he had done the year before, he went to take the sea-baths at\r\nBiarritz. This step was the more remarkable because Napoleon had\r\nreceived the news of the Treaty of Gastein with marked displeasure, and\r\nhad given public expression to his opinions. Bismarck saw Drouyn de\r\nLhuys at Paris and then went on to Biarritz where the Emperor was; for\r\nten days he lived there in constant association with the Imperial\r\nfamily. The personal impression which he made was very favourable: \"A\r\nreally great man,\" wrote Mérimée, \"free from feeling and full of\r\n_esprit_.\" He saw Napoleon again on his return through Paris; the two\r\nsucceeded in coming to an understanding. Napoleon assured him that he\r\nmight depend on the absolute neutrality of France, in case of a war\r\nbetween Prussia and Austria; it was agreed also that the annexation of\r\nthe Duchies to Prussia would not be an increase of territory which would\r\ncause any uneasiness at Paris; Napoleon would view it with favour.\r\nBismarck went farther than this; he opened the subject of a complete\r\nreform of the German Constitution on the lines that Prussia was to have\r\na free hand in the north of Germany; he pointed out\r\n\r\n  \"that the acquisition of the Duchies would only be an earnest for\r\n  the fulfilment of the pledge which history had laid upon the\r\n  State of Prussia; for the future prosecution of it we need the\r\n  most friendly relations with France. It seems to me in the\r\n  interest of France to encourage Prussia in the ambitious\r\n  fulfilment of her national duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor acquiesced; as we know, the division of Europe into large\r\nnational States was what he meant by Napoleonic ideas; he was willing\r\nenough to help in Germany a change such as that he had brought about in\r\nItaly. It was agreed that events should be allowed to develop\r\nthemselves; when the time came it would be easy enough to come to some\r\ndefinite agreement.\r\n\r\nThis however was not all; it was not to be expected that Napoleon should\r\nrender Prussia so valuable a service without receiving something in\r\nexchange; we know Bismarck's opinion of a statesman who, out of sympathy\r\nfor another country, would sacrifice the interests of his own. The\r\ncreation of a strong consolidated State in the north of Germany could\r\nnot be in the interests of France; the power of France had always been\r\nfounded on the weakness of Germany. Even if Napoleon himself, with his\r\ngenerous and cosmopolitan sympathies, was willing to make the sacrifice,\r\nFrance was not; Napoleon knew, and Bismarck knew, that Napoleon could\r\nnot disregard the feeling of the country; his power was based on\r\nuniversal suffrage and the popularity of his name; he could not, as a\r\nKing of Prussia could, brave the displeasure of the people. France must\r\nthen have some compensation. What was it to be? What were to be the\r\nterms of the more intimate and special understanding? We do not know\r\nexactly what was said; we do know that Bismarck led both the Emperor and\r\nhis Ministers to believe that Prussia would support them in an extension\r\nof the frontier. He clearly stated that the King would not be willing\r\nto surrender a single _Prussian_ village; he probably said that they\r\nwould not acquiesce in the restoration to France of any _German_\r\nterritory. France therefore must seek her reward in a French-speaking\r\npeople. It was perhaps an exaggeration if Drouyn de Lhuys said \"he\r\noffered us all kinds of things which did not belong to him,\" but\r\nNapoleon also in later years repeated that Bismarck had promised him all\r\nkinds of recompenses. No written agreement was made; that was reserved\r\nfor later negotiations, but there was a verbal understanding, which both\r\nparties felt was binding. This was the pendant to the interview of\r\nPlombières. But Bismarck had improved on Cavour's example; he did not\r\nwant so much, he asked only for neutrality: the King of Prussia would\r\nnot be called upon, like Victor Emmanuel, to surrender the old\r\npossessions of his House.\r\n\r\nBismarck returned to Berlin with his health invigorated by the Atlantic\r\nwinds and his spirits raised by success. The first step now was to\r\nsecure the help of Italy; he had seen Nigra, the Italian Minister, at\r\nParis, and told him that war was inevitable; he hoped he could reckon on\r\nItalian alliance, but there was still, however, much ground for anxiety\r\nthat Austria might succeed in arranging affairs with Italy.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the four Powers at this time were very remarkable. All\r\nturned on Venetia. The new Kingdom of Italy would not rest until it had\r\nsecured this province. Napoleon also was bound by honour to complete his\r\npromise and \"free Italy to the Adriatic\"; neither his throne nor that\r\nof his son would be secure if he failed to do so. A war between Austria\r\nand Prussia would obviously afford the best opportunity, and his whole\r\nefforts were therefore directed to preventing a reconciliation between\r\nthe two German Powers. His great fear was that Austria should come to\r\nterms with Prussia, and surrender the Duchies on condition that Prussia\r\nshould guarantee her Italian possessions. When Bismarck visited Napoleon\r\nat Biarritz, the first question of the Emperor was, \"Have you guaranteed\r\nVenetia to Austria?\" It was the fear of this which caused his anger at\r\nthe Treaty of Gastein. On the other hand, Bismarck had his reasons for\r\nanxiety. It was always possible that Austria, instead of coming to terms\r\nwith Prussia, might choose the other side; she might surrender Venetia\r\nin order to obtain French and Italian support in a German war. The\r\nsituation indeed was this: Austria was liable at any moment to be\r\nattacked by both Italy and Prussia; it would probably be beyond her\r\nstrength to resist both assailants at the same time. A wise statesman\r\nwould probably have made terms with one or the other. He would have\r\neither surrendered Venetia, which was really a source of weakness, to\r\nItaly, or agreed with Prussia over the Duchies and the German problem,\r\nthereby gaining Prussian support against Italy. The honourable pride of\r\nMensdorf and the military party in Austria refused to surrender anything\r\ntill it was too late.\r\n\r\nNone the less, the constant fear lest Austria should make terms with one\r\nof her enemies for a long time prevented an alliance between Prussia\r\nand Italy. The Italians did not trust Bismarck; they feared that if they\r\nmade a treaty with him, he would allow them to get entangled in war, and\r\nthen, as at Gastein, make up his quarrel with Austria. Bismarck did not\r\ntrust the Italians; he feared that they and Napoleon would even at the\r\nlast moment take Venetia as a present, and, as very nearly happened,\r\noffer Austria one of the Prussian provinces instead. It was impossible\r\nto have any reliance on Napoleon's promises, for he was constantly being\r\npulled two ways; his own policy and sympathies would lead him to an\r\nalliance with Prussia; the clerical party, which was yearly growing\r\nstronger and had the support of the Empress, wished him to side with the\r\nCatholic power. In consequence, even after his return from France,\r\nBismarck could not pass a day with full security that he might not find\r\nhimself opposed by a coalition of Austria, France, and Italy; the\r\nAustrians felt that they were to be made the victims of a similar\r\ncoalition between Prussia, France, and Italy; France always feared a\r\nnational union between the two great German Powers.\r\n\r\nBismarck began by completing and bringing to a conclusion the\r\narrangements for a commercial treaty with Italy; at the beginning of\r\nJanuary the King of Prussia sent Victor Emmanuel the order of the Black\r\nEagle; Bismarck also used his influence to induce Bavaria to join in the\r\ncommercial treaty and to recognise the Kingdom of Italy. Then on January\r\n13th he wrote to Usedom that the eventual decision in Germany would be\r\ninfluenced by the action of Italy; if they could not depend on the\r\nsupport of Italy, he hinted that peace would be maintained; in this way\r\nhe hoped to force the Italians to join him.\r\n\r\nAffairs in the Duchies gave Bismarck the opportunity for adopting with\r\ngood grounds a hostile attitude towards Austria; Gablenz, the new\r\nGovernor of Holstein, continued to favour the Augustenburg agitation.\r\nMany had expected that Austria would govern Holstein as a part of the\r\nEmpire; instead of doing so, with marked design the country was\r\nadministered as though it were held in trust for the Prince; no taxes\r\nwere levied, full freedom was allowed to the Press, and while the\r\nPrussians daily became more unpopular in Schleswig the Austrians by\r\ntheir leniency won the affection of Holstein. At the end of January,\r\nthey even allowed a mass meeting, which was attended by over 4000 men,\r\nto be held at Altona. This made a very unfavourable impression on the\r\nKing, and any action of Austria that offended the King was most useful\r\nto Bismarck. \"Bismarck is using all his activity to inspire the King\r\nwith his own views and feelings,\" wrote Benedetti, the French\r\nAmbassador, at this time. At the end of January he felt sufficiently\r\nsecure to protest seriously against the Austrian action in Holstein.\r\n\"Why,\" he asked, \"had they left the alliance against our common enemy,\r\nthe Revolution?\" Austria, in return, refused peremptorily to allow\r\nBismarck any voice in the administration of Holstein. Bismarck, when the\r\ndespatch was read to him, answered curtly that he must consider that\r\nhenceforth the relations of the two Powers had lost their intimate\r\ncharacter; \"we are as we were before the Danish war, neither worse nor\r\nbetter.\" He sent no answer to the Austrian despatch and ceased to\r\ndiscuss with them the affairs of the Duchies.\r\n\r\nThis was a fair warning to Austria and it was understood; they took it\r\nas an intimation that hostilities were intended, and from this day began\r\nquietly to make their preparations. As soon as they did this, they were\r\ngiven into Bismarck's hands; the Prussians, owing to the admirable\r\norganisation of the army, could prepare for war in a fortnight or three\r\nweeks' time less than the Austrians would require; Austria to be secure\r\nmust therefore begin to arm first; as soon as she did so the Prussian\r\nGovernment would be able, with full protestation of innocence, to point\r\nto the fact that they had not moved a man, and then to begin their own\r\nmobilisation, not apparently for offence but, as it were, to protect\r\nthemselves from an unprovoked attack. In a minute of February 22d Moltke\r\nwrites that it would be better for political reasons not to mobilise\r\nyet; then they would appear to put Austria in the wrong; Austria had now\r\n100,000 men in Bohemia and it would be impossible to undertake any\r\noffensive movement against Prussia with less than 150,000 or 200,000; to\r\ncollect these at least six weeks would be required, and the preparations\r\ncould not be concealed. Six days later a great council was held in\r\nBerlin. \"A war with Austria must come sooner or later; it is wiser to\r\nundertake it now, under these most favourable circumstances, than to\r\nleave it to Austria to choose the most auspicious moment for herself,\"\r\nsaid Bismarck. The rupture, he explained, had already really been\r\neffected; that had been completed at his last interview with Karolyi.\r\nBismarck was supported by most of the Ministers; the King said that the\r\nDuchies were worth a war, but he still hoped that peace would be kept.\r\nThe arrangement of the foreign alliances was now pushed on. The King\r\nwrote an autograph letter to Napoleon saying that the time for the\r\nspecial understanding had come; Goltz discussed with him at length the\r\nterms of French compensation. Napoleon did not ask for any definite\r\npromise, but suggested the annexation of some German territory to\r\nFrance; it was explained to him that Prussia would not surrender any\r\nGerman territory, but that, if France took part of Belgium, the Prussian\r\nfrontier must be extended to the Maas, that is, must include the\r\nnorth-east of Belgium.\r\n\r\nAgain no definite agreement was made, but Napoleon's favouring\r\nneutrality seemed secure. There was more difficulty with Italy, for here\r\nan active alliance was required, and the Italians still feared they\r\nwould be tricked. It was decided to send Moltke to Florence to arrange\r\naffairs there; this, however, was unnecessary, for Victor Emmanuel sent\r\none of his generals, Govone, nominally to gain some information about\r\nthe new military inventions; for the next three weeks, Govone and\r\nBarrel, the Italian Minister, were engaged in constant discussions as to\r\nthe terms of the treaty. Of course the Austrians were not entirely\r\nignorant of what was going on. The negotiations with Italy roused among\r\nthem intense bitterness; without actually mobilising they slowly and\r\ncautiously made all preliminary arrangements; a despatch was sent to\r\nBerlin accusing the Prussians of the intention of breaking the Treaty of\r\nGastein, and another despatch to the German Courts asking for their\r\nassistance. Karolyi waited on Bismarck, assured him that their military\r\npreparations, were purely defensive, and asked point-blank whether\r\nPrussia proposed to violate the treaty. The answer, of course, was a\r\nsimple \"No,\" but according to the gossip of Berlin, Bismarck added, \"You\r\ndo not think I should tell you if I did intend to do so.\" On March 24th\r\na despatch was sent to the envoys at all the German Courts drawing their\r\nattention to the Austrian preparations, for which it was said there was\r\nno cause; in view of this obvious aggression Prussia must begin to arm.\r\nThat this was a mere pretext is shewn by a confidential note of Moltke\r\nof this same date; in it he states that all the Austrian preparations up\r\nto this time were purely defensive; there was as yet no sign of an\r\nattempt to take the offensive. Two days later, a meeting of the Prussian\r\nCouncil was held and the orders for a partial mobilisation of the army\r\nwere given, though some time elapsed before they were actually carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nUnder the constant excitement of these weeks Bismarck's health again\r\nbegan to break down; except himself, there was in fact scarcely a single\r\nman who desired the war; the King still seized every opportunity of\r\npreserving the peace; England, as so often, was beginning to make\r\nproposals for mediation; all the Prussian diplomatists, he complained,\r\nwere working against his warlike projects. He made it clear to the\r\nItalians that the result would depend on them; if they would not sign a\r\ntreaty there would be no war. The great difficulty in arranging the\r\nterms of the treaty was to determine who should begin. The old suspicion\r\nwas still there: each side expected that if they began they would be\r\ndeserted by their ally. The suspicion was unjust, for on both sides\r\nthere were honourable men. The treaty was eventually signed on April\r\n9th; it was to the effect that if Prussia went to war with Austria\r\nwithin the next three months, Italy would also at once declare war;\r\nneither country was to make a separate peace; Prussia would continue the\r\nwar till Venetia was surrendered. On the very day that this treaty was\r\nsigned, Bismarck, in answer to an Austrian despatch, wrote insisting\r\nthat he had no intention of entering on an offensive war against\r\nAustria. In private conversation he was more open; to Benedetti he said:\r\n\"I have at last succeeded in determining a King of Prussia to break the\r\nintimate relations of his House with that of Austria, to conclude a\r\ntreaty of alliance with Italy, to accept arrangements with Imperial\r\nFrance; I am proud of the result.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a fresh impediment appeared: the Austrians, on April 18th,\r\nwrote proposing a disarming on both sides; the Prussian answer was\r\ndelayed for many days; it was said in Berlin that there was a difference\r\nof opinion between Bismarck and the King; Bismarck complained to\r\nBenedetti that he was wavering: when at last the answer was sent it was\r\nto accept the principle, but Bismarck boasted that he had accepted it\r\nunder such conditions that it could hardly be carried out. The\r\nreluctance of the King to go to war caused him much difficulty; all his\r\ninfluence was required; it is curious to read the following words which\r\nhe wrote at this time:\r\n\r\n  \"It is opposed to my feelings, I may say to my faith, to attempt\r\n  to use influence or pressure on your paternal feelings with\r\n  regard to the decision on peace or war; this is a sphere in\r\n  which, trusting to God alone, I leave it to your Majesty's heart\r\n  to steer for the good of the Fatherland; my part is prayer,\r\n  rather than counsel\";\r\n\r\nand then he again lays before the King the insuperable arguments in\r\nfavour of war.\r\n\r\nLet us not suppose that this letter was but a cunning device to win the\r\nconsent of the King. In these words more than in anything else we see\r\nhis deepest feelings and his truest character. Bismarck was no Napoleon;\r\nhe had determined that war was necessary, but he did not go to the\r\nterrible arbitrament with a light heart. He was not a man who from\r\npersonal ambition would order thousands of men to go to their death or\r\nbring his country to ruin. It was his strength that he never forgot that\r\nhe was working, not for himself, but for others. Behind the far-sighted\r\nplotter and the keen intriguer there always remained the primitive\r\nhonesty of his younger years. He may at times have complained of the\r\ndifficulties which arose from the reluctance of the King to follow his\r\nadvice, but he himself felt that it was a source of strength to him that\r\nhe had to explain, justify, and recommend his policy to the King.\r\n\r\nAll anxiety was, however, removed by news which came the next day. A\r\nreport was spread throughout the papers that Italy had begun to\r\nmobilise, and that a band of Garibaldians had crossed the frontier. The\r\nreport seems to have been untrue. How it originated we know not; when\r\nRoon heard of it he exclaimed, \"Now the Italians are arming, the\r\nAustrians cannot disarm.\" He was right. The Austrian Government sent a\r\nmessage to Berlin that they would withdraw part of their northern army\r\nfrom Bohemia, but must at once put the whole of their southern army on a\r\nwar footing. Prussia refused to accept this plea, and the order for the\r\nmobilisation of the Prussian army went out.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Austria had begun to mobilise, war was inevitable; the state\r\nof the finances of the Empire would not permit them to maintain their\r\narmy on a war footing for any time. None the less, another six weeks\r\nwere to elapse before hostilities began.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how throughout these complications Bismarck had desired, if\r\nhe fought Austria, to fight, not for the sake of the Duchies, but for a\r\nreform of the German Confederation.\r\n\r\nIn March he had said to the Italians that the Holstein question was not\r\nenough to warrant a declaration of war. Prussia intended to bring\r\nforward the reform of the Confederation. This would take several months.\r\nHe hoped that among other advantages, he would have at least Bavaria on\r\nhis side; for the kind of proposal he had in his mind, though at this\r\ntime he seems to have had no clear plan, was some arrangement by which\r\nthe whole of the north of Germany should be closely united to Prussia,\r\nand the southern States formed in a separate union with Bavaria at the\r\nhead. He had always pointed out, even when he was at Frankfort, that\r\nBavaria was a natural ally of Prussia. In a great war the considerable\r\narmy of Bavaria would not be unimportant.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of April Bismarck instructed Savigny, his envoy at the\r\nDiet, to propose the consideration of a reform in the Constitution. The\r\nproposal he made was quite unexpected. No details were mentioned as to\r\nchanges in the relations of the Princes, but a Parliament elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage and direct elections was to be chosen, to help in the\r\nmanagement of common German affairs. It is impossible to exaggerate the\r\nbewilderment and astonishment with which this proposal was greeted. Here\r\nwas the man who had risen into power as the champion of monarchical\r\ngovernment, as the enemy of Parliaments and Democracy, voluntarily\r\ntaking up the extreme demand of the German Radicals. It must be\r\nremembered that universal suffrage was at this time regarded not as a\r\nmere scheme of voting,--it was a principle; it was the cardinal\r\nprinciple of the Revolution; it meant the sovereignty of the people. It\r\nwas the basis of the French Republic of 1848, it had been incorporated\r\nin the German Constitution of 1849, and this was one of the reasons why\r\nthe King of Prussia had refused then to accept that Constitution. The\r\nproposal was universally condemned. Bismarck had perhaps hoped to win\r\nthe Liberals; if so, he was disappointed; their confidence could not be\r\ngained by this sudden and amazing change--they distrusted him all the\r\nmore; \"a Government that, despising the laws of its own country, comes\r\nforward with plans for Confederate reform, cannot have the confidence of\r\nthe German people,\" was the verdict of the National party. The Moderate\r\nLiberals, men like Sybel, had always been opposed to universal suffrage;\r\neven the English statesmen were alarmed; it was two years before\r\nDisraeli made his leap in the dark, and here was the Prussian statesman\r\nmaking a far bolder leap in a country not yet accustomed to the natural\r\nworking of representative institutions. He did not gain the adhesion of\r\nthe Liberals, and he lost the confidence of his old friends. Napoleon\r\nalone expressed his pleasure that the institutions of the two countries\r\nshould become so like one another.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, ample reason for distrust; universal suffrage meant\r\nnot only Democracy,--it was the foundation on which Napoleon had built\r\nhis Empire; he had shewn that the voice of the people might become the\r\ninstrument of despotism. All the old suspicions were aroused; people\r\nbegan to see fresh meaning in these constant visits to France; Napoleon\r\nhad found an apt pupil not only in foreign but in internal matters. It\r\ncould mean nothing more than the institution of a democratic monarchy;\r\nthis was Bonapartism; it seemed to be the achievement of that change\r\nwhich, years ago, Gerlach had foreboded. No wonder the King of Hanover\r\nbegan to feel his crown less steady on his head.\r\n\r\nWhat was the truth in the matter? What were the motives which influenced\r\nBismarck? The explanation he gave was probably the true one: by\r\nuniversal suffrage he hoped to attain a Conservative and monarchical\r\nassembly; he appealed from the educated and Liberal middle classes to\r\nthe peasants and artisans. We remember how often he had told the\r\nPrussian House of Commons that they were not the true representatives of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n  \"Direct election and universal suffrage I consider to be greater\r\n  guarantees of Conservative action than any artificial electoral\r\n  law; the artificial system of indirect election and elections by\r\n  classes is a much more dangerous one in a country of monarchical\r\n  traditions and loyal patriotism. Universal suffrage, doing away\r\n  as it does with the influence of the Liberal bourgeoisie, leads\r\n  to monarchical elections.\"\r\n\r\nThere was in his mind a vague ideal, the ideal of a king, the father of\r\nhis country, supported by the masses of the people. He had a genuine\r\ninterest in the welfare of the poorest; he thought he would find in them\r\nmore gratitude and confidence than in the middle classes. We know that\r\nhe was wrong; universal suffrage in Germany was to make possible the\r\nSocial Democrats and Ultramontanes; it was to give the Parliamentary\r\npower into the hands of an opponent far more dangerous than the Liberals\r\nof the Prussian Assembly. Probably no one had more responsibility for\r\nthis measure than the brilliant founder of the Socialist party. Bismarck\r\nhad watched with interest the career of Lassalle; he had seen with\r\nadmiration his power of organisation; he felt that here was a man who in\r\ninternal affairs and in the management of the people had something of\r\nthe skill and courage which he himself had in foreign affairs. He was a\r\ngreat demagogue, and Bismarck had already learnt that a man who aimed at\r\nbeing not only a diplomatist, but a statesman and a ruler, must have\r\nsomething of the demagogic art. From Lassalle he could learn much. We\r\nhave letters written two years before this in which Lassalle, obviously\r\nreferring to some previous conversation, says: \"Above all, I accuse\r\nmyself of having forgotten yesterday to impress upon you that the right\r\nof being elected must be given to all Germans. This is an immense means\r\nof power; the moral conquest of Germany.\" Obviously there had been a\r\nlong discussion, in which Lassalle had persuaded the Minister to adopt\r\nuniversal suffrage. The letters continue with reference to the machinery\r\nof the elections, and means of preventing abstention from the poll, for\r\nwhich Lassalle professes to have found a magic charm.\r\n\r\nOne other remark we must make: this measure, as later events were to\r\nprove, was in some ways characteristic of all Bismarck's internal\r\npolicy. Roon once complained of his strokes of genius, his unforeseen\r\ndecisions. In foreign policy, bold and decisive as he could be, he\r\nwas also cautious and prudent; to this he owes his success; he could\r\nstrike when the time came, but he never did so unless he had tested\r\nthe situation in every way; he never began a war unless he was sure\r\nto win, and he left nothing to chance or good fortune. In internal\r\naffairs he was less prudent; he did not know his ground so well, and\r\nhe exaggerated his own influence. Moreover, in giving up the simpler\r\nConservative policy of his younger years, he became an opportunist; he\r\nwould introduce important measures in order to secure the support of a\r\nparty, even though he might thereby be sacrificing the interests of his\r\ncountry to a temporary emergency. He really applied to home affairs the\r\nhabits he had learned in diplomacy; there every alliance is temporary;\r\nwhen the occasion of it has passed by, it ceases, and leaves no\r\npermanent effect. He tried to govern Germany by a series of political\r\nalliances; but the alliance of the Government with a party can never be\r\nbarren; the laws to which it gives birth remain. Bismarck sometimes\r\nthought more of the advantage of the alliance than of the permanent\r\neffect of the laws.\r\n\r\nEven after this there was still delay; there were the usual abortive\r\nattempts at a congress, which, as in 1859, broke down through the\r\nrefusal of Austria to give way. There were dark intrigues of Napoleon,\r\nwho even at the last moment attempted to divert the Italians from their\r\nPrussian alliance. In Germany there was extreme indignation against the\r\nman who was forcing his country into a fratricidal war. Bismarck had\r\noften received threatening letters; now an attempt was made on his life;\r\nas he was walking along _Unter den Linden_ a young man approached and\r\nfired several shots at him. He was seized by Bismarck, and that night\r\nput an end to his own life in prison. He was a South German who wished\r\nto save his country from the horrors of civil war. Moltke, now that all\r\nwas prepared, was anxious to begin. Bismarck still hesitated; he was so\r\ncautious that he would not take the first step. At last the final\r\nprovocation came, as he hoped it would, from Austria. He knew that if he\r\nwaited long enough they would take the initiative. They proposed to\r\nsummon the Estates of Holstein, and at the same time brought the\r\nquestion of the Duchies before the Diet. Bismarck declared that this was\r\na breach of the Treaty of Gastein, and that that agreement was therefore\r\nvoid; Prussian troops were ordered to enter Holstein. Austria appealed\r\nfor protection to the Diet, and moved that the Federal forces should be\r\nmobilised. The motion was carried by nine votes to seven. The Prussian\r\nEnvoy then rose and declared that this was a breach of the Federal law;\r\nPrussia withdrew from the Federation and declared war on all those\r\nStates which had supported Austria. Hanover and Hesse had to the end\r\nattempted to maintain neutrality, but this Bismarck would not allow;\r\nthey were given the alternative of alliance with Prussia or disarmament.\r\nThe result was that, when war began, the whole of Germany, except the\r\nsmall northern States, was opposed to Prussia. \"I have no ally but the\r\nDuke of Mecklenburg and Mazzini,\" said the King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF GERMANY.\r\n\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck had no part in the management of the army. This the King always\r\nkept in his own hands. He was himself Commander-in-Chief, and on all\r\nmilitary questions he took the advice of his Minister of War and the\r\nchief of the staff. When his power and influence in the State were\r\ngreatest, Bismarck's authority always ceased as soon as technical and\r\nmilitary matters arose for consideration. He often chafed at this\r\nlimitation and even in a campaign was eager to offer his advice; there\r\nwas soldier's blood in his veins, and he would have liked himself to\r\nbear arms in the war. At least he was able to be present on the field of\r\nbattle with the King and witness part of the campaign.\r\n\r\nWith the King he left Berlin on June 30th to join the army in Bohemia.\r\nAlready the news had come of the capitulation of the Hanoverians; the\r\nwhole of North-West Germany had been conquered in a week and the\r\nPrussian flank was secure. The effect of these victories was soon seen:\r\nhis unpopularity was wiped out in blood. Night by night as the\r\nbulletins arrived, crowds collected to cheer and applaud the Minister.\r\n\r\nThe King and his suite reached the army on July 1st; they were just in\r\ntime to be present at the decisive battle. At midnight on July 2d it was\r\nknown that the Austrians were preparing to give battle near Königgrätz\r\nwith the Elbe in their rear. Early the next morning the King with\r\nBismarck, Roon, and Moltke rode out and took up their positions on the\r\nhill of Dub, whence they could view what was to be the decisive battle\r\nin the history of Germany. Here, after the lapse of more than a hundred\r\nyears, they were completing the work which Frederick the Great had\r\nbegun. The battle was long and doubtful. The army of Prince Frederick\r\nCharles attacked the Austrian division under the eyes of the King, but\r\ncould make no advance against their powerful artillery. They had to wait\r\ntill the Crown Prince, who was many miles away, could come up and attack\r\nthe right flank of the Austrians. Hour after hour went by and the Crown\r\nPrince did not come; if he delayed longer the attack would fail and the\r\nPrussians be defeated. We can easily imagine what must have been\r\nBismarck's thoughts during this crisis. On the result depended his\r\nposition, his reputation, perhaps his life; into those few hours was\r\nconcentrated the struggle to which he had devoted so much of his\r\nlifetime, and yet he was quite helpless. Success or failure did not\r\ndepend on him. It is the crudest trial to the statesman that he must see\r\nhis best plans undone by the mistakes of the generals. Bismarck often\r\nlooked with anxiety at Moltke's face to see whether he could read in it\r\nthe result of the battle. The King, too, was getting nervous. Bismarck\r\nat last could stand it no longer; he rode up to Moltke, took out a cigar\r\ncase, and offered it to the General; Moltke looked at the cigars\r\ncarefully and took the best; \"then I knew we were all right,\" said\r\nBismarck in telling this story. It was after two when at last the cannon\r\nof the Crown Prince's army came into action, and the Austrian army,\r\nattacked on two sides, was overthrown.\r\n\r\n\"This time the brave grenadiers have saved us,\" said Roon. It was true;\r\nbut for the army which he and the King had made, all the genius of\r\nMoltke and Bismarck would have been unavailing.\r\n\r\n  \"Our men deserve to be kissed,\" wrote Bismarck to his wife.\r\n  \"Every man is brave to the death, quiet, obedient; with empty\r\n  stomachs, wet clothes, little sleep, the soles of their boots\r\n  falling off, they are friendly towards everyone; there is no\r\n  plundering and burning; they pay what they are able, though they\r\n  have mouldy bread to eat. There must exist a depth of piety in\r\n  our common soldier or all this could not be.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck might well be proud of this practical illustration which was\r\ngiven of that which he so often in older days maintained. This was a\r\ntrue comment on the pictures of the loyalty of the Prussian people and\r\nthe simple faith of the German peasants, which from his place in\r\nParliament he had opposed to the new sceptical teaching of the Liberals.\r\nAs soon as he was able he went about among the wounded; as he once\r\nsaid, the King of Prussia was accustomed to look into the eyes of\r\nwounded men on the field of battle and therefore would never venture on\r\nan unjust or unnecessary war, and in this Bismarck felt as the King. He\r\nwrites home for cigars for distributing among the wounded. Personally he\r\nendured something of the hardships of campaigning, for in the miserable\r\nBohemian villages there was little food and shelter to be had. He\r\ncomposed himself to sleep, as best he could, on a dung-heap by the\r\nroadside, until he was roused by the Prince of Mecklenburg, who had\r\nfound more acceptable quarters.\r\n\r\nIt was not for long that this life, which was to him almost a welcome\r\nreminiscence of his sporting days, could continue. Diplomatic cares soon\r\nfell upon him.\r\n\r\nNot two days had passed since the great battle, when a telegram from\r\nNapoleon was placed in the King's hands informing him that Austria had\r\nrequested France's mediation, that Venetia had been surrendered to\r\nFrance, and inviting the King to conclude an armistice. Immediately\r\nafterwards came the news that the surrender of Venetia to France had\r\nbeen published in the _Moniteur_.\r\n\r\nIf this meant anything, it meant that Napoleon intended to stop the\r\nfurther progress of the Prussian army, to rescue Austria, and to dictate\r\nthe terms of peace; it could not be doubted that he would be prepared to\r\nsupport his mediation by arms, and in a few days they might expect to\r\nhear that the French corps were being stationed on the frontier. What\r\nwas to be done? Bismarck neither doubted nor hesitated; it was\r\nimpossible to refuse French mediation. West Germany was almost\r\nundefended, the whole of the southern States were still unconquered;\r\nhowever imperfect the French military preparations might be, it was\r\nimpossible to run such a risk. At his advice the King at once sent a\r\ncourteous answer accepting the French proposal. He was more disposed to\r\nthis because in doing so he really bound himself to nothing. He accepted\r\nthe principle of French mediation; but he was still free to discuss and\r\nrefuse the special terms which might be offered. He said that he was\r\nwilling to accept an armistice, but it was only on condition that the\r\npreliminaries of peace were settled before hostilities ceased, and to\r\nthem the King could not agree except after consultation with the King of\r\nItaly. It was a friendly answer, which cost nothing, and meanwhile the\r\narmy continued to advance. An Austrian request for an armistice was\r\nrefused; Vienna was now the goal; Napoleon, if he wished to stop them,\r\nmust take the next move, must explain the terms of peace he wished to\r\nsecure, and shew by what measures he was prepared to enforce them.\r\n\r\nBy his prompt action, Bismarck, who knew Napoleon well, hoped to escape\r\nthe threatened danger. We shall see with what address he used the\r\nsituation, so that the vacillation of France became to him more useful\r\nthan even her faithful friendship would have been, for now he felt\r\nhimself free from all ties of gratitude. Whatever services France might\r\ndo to Prussia she could henceforth look to him for no voluntary\r\nrecompense. Napoleon had deceived him; he would henceforward have no\r\nscruples in deceiving Napoleon. He had entered on the war relying on the\r\nfriendship and neutrality of France; at the first crisis this had failed\r\nhim; he never forgot and he never forgave; years later, when the news of\r\nNapoleon's death was brought to him, this was the first incident in\r\ntheir long connection which came into his mind.\r\n\r\nIntercourse with Paris was slow and uncertain; the telegraph wires were\r\noften cut by the Bohemian peasants; some time must elapse before an\r\nanswer came. In the meanwhile, as the army steadily advanced towards the\r\nAustrian capital, Bismarck had to consider the terms of peace he would\r\nbe willing to accept. He had to think not only of what he would wish,\r\nbut of what it was possible to acquire. He wrote to his wife at this\r\ntime:\r\n\r\n  \"We are getting on well. If we are not extreme in our claims and\r\n  do not imagine that we have conquered the world, we shall obtain\r\n  a peace that is worth having. But we are as easily intoxicated as\r\n  we are discouraged, and I have the thankless task of pouring\r\n  water into the foaming wine and of pointing out that we are not\r\n  alone in Europe, but have three neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nOf the three neighbours there was little to fear from England. With the\r\ndeath of Lord Palmerston, English policy had entered on a new phase; the\r\ntraditions of Pitt and Canning were forgotten; England no longer aimed\r\nat being the arbitress of Europe; the leaders of both parties agreed\r\nthat unless her own interests were immediately affected, England would\r\nnot interfere in Continental matters. The internal organisation of\r\nGermany did not appear to concern her; she was the first to recognise\r\nthe new principle that the relations of the German States to one another\r\nwere to be settled by the Germans themselves, and to extend to Germany\r\nthat doctrine of non-intervention which she had applied to Spain and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nNeither France nor Russia would be so accommodating; France, we have\r\nalready seen, had begun to interfere, Russia would probably do so; if\r\nthey came to some agreement they would demand a congress; and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, a few days later the Czar proposed a congress, both in\r\nParis and in London. Of all issues this was the one which Bismarck\r\ndreaded most. A war with France he would have disliked, but at the worst\r\nhe was not afraid of it. But he did not wish that the terms of peace he\r\nproposed to dictate should be subjected to the criticism and revision of\r\nthe European Powers, nor to undergo the fate which fell on Russia twelve\r\nyears later. Had the congress, however, been supported by Russia and\r\nFrance he must have accepted it. It is for this reason that he was so\r\nready to meet the wishes of France, for if Napoleon once entered into\r\nseparate and private negotiations, then whatever the result of them\r\nmight be, he could not join with the other Powers in common action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the terms of peace, it was obvious that\r\nSchleswig-Holstein would now be Prussian; it could scarcely be doubted\r\nthat there must be a reform in the Confederation, which would be\r\nreorganised under the hegemony of Prussia, and that Austria would be\r\nexcluded from all participation in German affairs. It might, in fact, be\r\nanticipated that the very great successes of Prussia would enable her to\r\ncarry out the programme of 1849, and to unite the whole of Germany in a\r\nclose union. This, however, was not what Bismarck intended; for him the\r\nunity of Germany was a matter of secondary importance; what he desired\r\nwas complete control over the north. In this he was going back to the\r\nsound and true principles of Prussian policy; he, as nearly all other\r\nPrussian statesmen, looked on the line of the Main as a real division.\r\nHe, therefore, on the 9th of July, wrote to Goltz, explaining the ideas\r\nhe had of the terms on which peace might be concluded.\r\n\r\n\"The essential thing,\" he said, was that they should get control over\r\nNorth Germany in some form or other.\r\n\r\n  \"I use the term _North German Confederation_ without any\r\n  hesitation, because I consider that if the necessary\r\n  consolidation of the Federation is to be made certain it will be\r\n  at present impossible to include South Germany in it. The present\r\n  moment is very favourable for giving our new creation just that\r\n  delimitation which will secure it a firm union.\"\r\n\r\nThe question remained, what form the Union should take. On this he\r\nwrites: \"Your Excellency must have the same impression as myself, that\r\npublic opinion in our country demands the incorporation of Hanover,\r\nSaxony, and Schleswig.\" He adds that this would undoubtedly be the best\r\nsolution of the matter for all concerned, if it could be effected\r\nwithout the cession of other Prussian territory, but he did not himself\r\nconsider the difference between a satisfactory system of reform and the\r\nacquisition of these territories sufficient to justify him in risking\r\nthe fate of the whole monarchy. It was the same alternative which had\r\npresented itself to him about Schleswig-Holstein; now, as then,\r\nannexation was what he aimed at, and he was not the man easily to\r\nreconcile himself to a less favourable solution. At the same time that\r\nhe wrote this letter he sent orders that Falkenstein should quickly\r\noccupy all the territory north of the Main.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice the date at which this letter was sent. It\r\nshews us that these proposals were Bismarck's own. Attempts have often\r\nbeen made since to suggest that the policy of annexation was not his,\r\nbut was forced on him by the King, or by the military powers, or by the\r\nnation. This was not the case. He appeals indeed to public opinion, but\r\npublic opinion, had it been asked, would really have demanded, not the\r\ndethronement of the Kings of Hanover and Saxony, but the unity of all\r\nGermany; and we know that Bismarck would never pursue what he thought a\r\ndangerous policy simply because public opinion demanded it. It has also\r\nbeen said that the dethronement of the King of Hanover was the natural\r\nresult of the obstinacy of himself and his advisers, and his folly in\r\ngoing to Vienna to appeal there to the help of the Austrian Emperor.\r\n\r\nThis also is not true. We find that Bismarck has determined on this\r\npolicy some days before the King had left Thuringia. This, like all he\r\ndid, was the deliberate result of the consideration: What would tend\r\nmost to the growth of Prussian power? He had to consider three\r\nalternatives: that these States should be compelled to come into a union\r\nwith Prussia on the terms that the Princes should hand over the command\r\nof their forces to the Prussian King, but he knew that the King of\r\nHanover would never consent to this, and probably the King of Saxony\r\nwould also refuse; he might also require the reigning Kings to abdicate\r\nin place of their sons; or he might leave them with considerable\r\nfreedom, but cripple their power by taking away part of their territory.\r\nThese solutions seemed to him undesirable because they would leave\r\ndynasties, who would naturally be hostile, jealous, and suspicious, with\r\nthe control of large powers of government. Surely it would be better,\r\nsafer, and wiser to sweep them away altogether. It may be objected that\r\nthere was no ground in justice for so doing. This is true, and Bismarck\r\nhas never pretended that there was. He has left it to the writers of the\r\nPrussian Press to justify an action which was based purely on policy, by\r\nthe pretence that it was the due recompense of the crimes of the rival\r\ndynasties.\r\n\r\nSybel says that Bismarck determined on these terms because they were\r\nthose which would be most acceptable to France; that he would have\r\npreferred at once to secure the unity of the whole of Germany, but that\r\nfrom his knowledge of French thought and French character he foresaw\r\nthat this would be possible only after another war, and he did not wish\r\nto risk the whole. So far as our information goes, it is against this\r\nhypothesis; it is rather true to say that he used the danger of French\r\ninterference as a means of persuading the King to adopt a policy which\r\nwas naturally repugnant to him. It is true that these terms would be\r\nagreeable to Napoleon. It would appear in France and in Europe as if it\r\nwas French power which had persuaded Prussia to stop at the Main and to\r\nspare Austria; Bismarck did not mind that, because what was pleasant to\r\nFrance was convenient to him. He knew also that the proposal to annex\r\nthe conquered territories would be very agreeable to Napoleon; the\r\ndethronement of old-established dynasties might be regarded as a\r\ndelicate compliment to the principles he had always maintained and to\r\nthe traditional policy of his house. If, however, we wish to find\r\nBismarck's own motives, we must remember that before the war broke out\r\nhe had in his mind some such division of Germany; he knew that it would\r\nbe impossible at once to unite the whole in a firm union. If Bavaria\r\nwere to be included in the new Confederation they would lose in harmony\r\nwhat they gained in extent. As he said in his drastic way:\r\n\r\n  \"We cannot use these Ultramontanes, and we must not swallow more\r\n  than we can digest. We will not fall into the blunder of\r\n  Piedmont, which has been more weakened than strengthened by the\r\n  annexation of Naples.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he could not express this openly, and even now German writers\r\nobscure the thought, for in Germany, as in Italy, the desire for unity\r\nwas so powerful that it was difficult to pardon any statesman who did\r\nnot take the most immediate path to this result. It was fortunate for\r\nGermany that Bismarck was strong enough not to do so, for the\r\nConfederation of the north could be founded and confirmed before the\r\nCatholic and hostile south was included. The prize was in his hands; he\r\ndeliberately refused to pick it up.\r\n\r\nSupposing, however, that, after all, France would not accept the terms\r\nhe suggested--during the anxious days which passed, this contingency was\r\noften before him. It was not till the 14th that Goltz was able to send\r\nhim any decisive information, for the very good reason that Napoleon had\r\nnot until then made up his own mind. Bismarck's anxiety was increased by\r\nthe arrival of Benedetti. He had received instructions to follow the\r\nKing, and, after undergoing the discomfort of a hasty journey in the\r\nrear of the Prussian army, reached headquarters on the 10th at Zwittau.\r\nHe was taken straight to Bismarck's room although it was far on into the\r\nnight. He found him sitting in a deserted house, writing, with a large\r\nrevolver by his side; for as Roon complains, even during the campaign\r\nBismarck would not give up his old custom of working all night and\r\nsleeping till midday or later. Bismarck received the French Ambassador\r\nwith his wonted cordiality and the conversation was prolonged till three\r\nor four o'clock in the morning, and continued on the following days.\r\nBismarck hoped that he had come with full powers to treat, or at least\r\nwith full information on the intentions of his Government; that was not\r\nthe case; he had no instructions except to use his influence to persuade\r\nPrussia to moderation; Napoleon was far too much divided in his own mind\r\nto be able to tell him anything further. Bismarck with his usual\r\nfrankness explained what he wished, laying much stress on the\r\nannexations in North Germany; Benedetti, so little did he follow\r\nNapoleon's thought, protested warmly against this. \"We are not,\" he\r\nsaid, \"in the times of Frederick the Great.\" Bismarck then tried to\r\nprobe him on other matters; as before, he assumed that Napoleon's\r\nsupport and good-will were not to be had for nothing. He took it as a\r\nmatter of course that if France was friendly to Prussia, she would\r\nrequire some recompense. He had already instructed Goltz to enquire what\r\nnon-German compensation would be asked; he was much disturbed when\r\nBenedetti met his overtures with silence; he feared that Napoleon had\r\nsome other plan. Benedetti in his report writes:\r\n\r\n\"Without any encouragement on my part, he attempted to prove to me that\r\nthe defeat of Austria permitted France and Prussia to modify their\r\nterritorial limits and to solve the greater part of the difficulties\r\nwhich continued to menace the peace of Europe. I reminded him that there\r\nwere treaties and that the war which he desired to prevent would be the\r\nfirst result of a policy of this kind. M. de Bismarck answered that I\r\nmisunderstood him, that France and Prussia united and resolved to\r\nrectify their respective countries, binding themselves by solemn\r\nengagements henceforth to regulate together these questions, need not\r\nfear any armed resistance either from England or from Russia.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was Bismarck's motive in making these suggestions and enquiries?\r\nGerman writers generally take the view that he was not serious in his\r\nproposal, that he was deliberately playing with Napoleon, that he wished\r\nto secure from him some compromising document which he might then be\r\nable, as, in fact, was to happen, to use against him. They seem to find\r\nsome pleasure in admiring him in the part of _Agent provocateur_.\r\nPerhaps we may interpret his thought rather differently. We have often\r\nseen that it was not his practice to lay down a clear and definite\r\ncourse of action, but he met each crisis as it occurred. The immediate\r\nnecessity was to secure the friendship of France; believing, as he did,\r\nthat in politics no one acted simply on principle or out of friendship,\r\nhe assumed that Napoleon, who had control of the situation, would not\r\ngive his support unless he had the promise of some important recompense.\r\nThe natural thing for him, as he always preferred plain dealing, was to\r\nask straight out what the Emperor wanted. When the answer came, then\r\nfresh questions would arise; if it was of such a kind that Bismarck\r\nwould be able to accept it, a formal treaty between the two States might\r\nbe made; if it was more than Bismarck was willing to grant, then there\r\nwould be an opportunity for prolonging negotiations with France, and\r\nhaggling over smaller points, and he would be able to come to some\r\nagreement with Austria quickly. If he could not come to any agreement\r\nwith France, and war were to break out, he would always have this\r\nadvantage, that he would be able to make it appear that the cause of war\r\narose not in the want of moderation of Prussia, but in the illegitimate\r\nclaims of France. Finally he had this to consider, that so long as\r\nFrance was discussing terms with him, there was no danger of their\r\naccepting the Russian proposal for a congress. Probably the one\r\ncontingency which did not occur to him was that which, in fact, was\r\nnearest to the truth, namely, that Napoleon did not care much for any\r\nrecompense, and that he had not seriously considered what he ought to\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, prepared for the case that France should not be\r\naccommodating. He determined to enter on separate negotiations with\r\nAustria. As he could not do this directly, he let it be known at Vienna\r\nby way of St. Petersburg that he was willing to negotiate terms of\r\npeace. At Brunn, where he was living, he opened up a new channel of\r\nintercourse. An Austrian nobleman, who was well disposed towards\r\nPrussia, undertook an unofficial mission, and announced to the Emperor\r\nthe terms on which Prussia would make peace. They were extraordinarily\r\nlenient, namely, that, with the exception of Venetia, the territory of\r\nAustria should remain intact, that no war indemnity should be expected,\r\nthat the Main should form the boundary of Prussian ambition, that South\r\nGermany should be left free, and might enter into close connection with\r\nAustria if it chose; the only condition was that no intervention or\r\nmediation of France should be allowed. If the negotiations with France\r\nwere successful, then the French and Prussian armies united would bid\r\ndefiance to the world. If those with France failed, then he hoped to\r\nbring about an understanding with Austria; the two great Powers would\r\ndivide Germany between them, but present a united front to all\r\noutsiders. If both negotiations broke down, he would be reduced to a\r\nthird and more terrible alternative: against a union of France and of\r\nAustria he would put himself at the head of the German national\r\nmovement; he would adopt the programme of 1849; he would appeal to the\r\nRevolution; he would stir up rebellion in Hungary; he would encourage\r\nthe Italians to deliver a thrust into the very heart of the Austrian\r\nMonarchy; and, while Austria was destroyed by internal dissensions, he\r\nwould meet the French invasion at the head of a united army of the other\r\nGerman States.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, Napoleon withdrew his opposition. It was represented\r\nto him that he had not the military force to carry out his new\r\nprogramme; Italy refused to desert Prussia or even to receive Venetia\r\nfrom the hands of France; Prince Napoleon warned his cousin against\r\nundoing the work of his lifetime. The Emperor himself, broken in health\r\nand racked by pain, confessed that his action of July 5th had been a\r\nmistake; he apologised to Goltz for his proclamation; he asked only that\r\nPrussia should be moderate in her demands; the one thing was that the\r\nunity of Germany should be avoided, if only in appearance. This, we have\r\nseen, was Bismarck's own view. Napoleon accepted the terms which Goltz\r\nproposed, but asked only that the Kingdom of Saxony should be spared;\r\nif this was done, he would not only adopt, he would recommend them. An\r\nagreement was quickly come to. Benedetti went on to Vienna; he and\r\nGramont had little difficulty in persuading the Emperor to agree to\r\nterms of peace by which the whole loss of the war would fall not upon\r\nhim, not even upon his only active and faithful ally, the King of\r\nSaxony, but on those other States who had refused to join themselves to\r\neither party. What a triumph was it of Bismarck's skill that the\r\naddition of 4,000,000 subjects to the Prussian Crown and complete\r\ndominion over Northern Germany should appear, not as the demand which,\r\nas a ruthless conqueror, he enforced on his helpless enemies, but as the\r\nsolution of all difficulties which was recommended to him in reward for\r\nhis moderation by the ruler of France!\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of July an armistice was agreed on, and a conference was held\r\nat Nikolsburg to arrange the preliminaries of peace. There was no delay.\r\nIn olden days Bismarck had shewn how he was able to prolong negotiations\r\nyear after year when it was convenient to him that they should come to\r\nno conclusion; now he hurried through in three days the discussion by\r\nwhich the whole future of Germany and Europe were to be determined. When\r\nall were agreed on the main points, difficulties on details were easily\r\novercome. It remained only to procure the assent of the King. Here\r\nagain, as so often before, Bismarck met with most serious resistance. He\r\ndrew up a careful memorandum which he presented to the monarch, pressing\r\non him in the very strongest terms the acceptance of these conditions,\r\nUp to the last moment, however, there seems to have been a great\r\nreluctance; Sybel represents the difficulties as rising from the\r\nimmoderate demands of the military party at Court; they were not\r\nprepared, after so great a victory, to leave Austria with undiminished\r\nterritory; they wished at least to have part of Austrian Silesia. This\r\naccount seems misleading. It was not that the King wanted more than\r\nBismarck had desired; he wanted his acquisition of territory to come in\r\na different way. He was not reconciled to the dethronement of the King\r\nof Hanover; he wished to take part of Hanover, part of Saxony, part of\r\nBavaria, and something from Darmstadt; to his simple and honest mind it\r\nseemed unjust that those who had been his bitterest enemies should be\r\ntreated with the greatest consideration. It was the old difficulty which\r\nBismarck had met with in dealing with Schleswig-Holstein: the King had\r\nmuch regard for the rights of other Princes. This time, however,\r\nBismarck, we are surprised to learn, had the influential support of the\r\nCrown Prince; the scruples which he had felt as regards\r\nSchleswig-Holstein did not apply to Hanover. He was sent in to his\r\nfather; the interview lasted two hours; what passed we do not know; he\r\ncame out exhausted and wearied with the long struggle, but the King had\r\ngiven in, and the policy of Bismarck triumphed. The preliminaries of\r\nNikolsburg were signed, and two days afterwards were ratified, for\r\nBismarck pressed on the arrangements with feverish impetuosity.\r\n\r\nHe had good reason to do so; he had just received intelligence that the\r\nEmperor of Russia was making an official demand for a congress and fresh\r\nnews had come from France. On the 25th Benedetti had again come to him\r\nand had sounded him with regard to the recompense which France might\r\nreceive. On the 26th, just as Bismarck was going to the final sitting of\r\nthe Conference, the French Ambassador again called on him, this time to\r\nlay before him a despatch in which Drouyn de Lhuys stated that he had\r\nnot wished to impede the negotiations with Austria, but would now\r\nobserve that the French sanction to the Prussian annexations presupposed\r\na fair indemnification to France, and that the Emperor would confer with\r\nPrussia concerning this as soon as his rôle of mediator was at an end.\r\nWhat madness this was! As soon as the rôle of mediator was at an end, as\r\nsoon as peace was arranged with Austria, the one means which France had\r\nfor compelling the acquiescence of Prussia was lost.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened was this: Napoleon had, in conversation with Goltz,\r\nrefused to consider the question of compensation: it was not worth\r\nwhile, he said; the gain of a few square miles of territory would not be\r\nof any use. He therefore, when he still might have procured them, made\r\nno conditions. Drouyn de Lhuys, however, who had disapproved of the\r\nwhole of the Emperor's policy, still remained in office; he still\r\nwished, as he well might wish, to strengthen France in view of the great\r\nincrease of Prussian power. He, therefore, on the 21st again approached\r\nNapoleon and laid before him a despatch in which he brought up the\r\nquestion of compensation. He was encouraged to this course by the\r\nreports which Benedetti had sent of his conversations with Bismarck; it\r\nwas clear that Bismarck expected some demand; he had almost asked that\r\nit should be made. \"We wish to avoid any injury to the balance of\r\npower,\" Goltz had said; \"we will either moderate our demands or discuss\r\nthose of France.\" It appeared absurd not to accept this offer. Napoleon\r\nwas still reluctant to do so, but he was in a paroxysm of pain. \"Leave\r\nme in peace,\" was his only answer to his Minister's request, and the\r\nMinister took it as an assent.\r\n\r\nBismarck, when Benedetti informed him of the demand that was to be made,\r\nat once answered that he was quite ready to consider the proposal.\r\nBenedetti then suggested that it would probably concern certain strips\r\nof territory on the left bank of the Rhine; on this, Bismarck stopped\r\nhim: \"Do not make any official announcements of that kind to me to-day.\"\r\nHe went away, the Conference was concluded, the preliminaries were\r\nsigned and ratified. France had been too late, and when the demand was\r\nrenewed Bismarck was able to adopt a very different tone.\r\n\r\nLet us complete the history of these celebrated negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe discussion which had been broken off so suddenly at Nikolsburg was\r\ncontinued at Berlin; during the interval the matter had been further\r\ndiscussed in Paris, and it had been determined firmly to demand\r\ncompensation. Benedetti had warned the Government that Bismarck would\r\nnot surrender any German territory; it was no good even asking for this,\r\nunless the demand was supported by urgent and threatening language. The\r\nresult of the considerations was that he was instructed categorically to\r\nrequire the surrender to France of the Palatinate and Mayence. Benedetti\r\nundertook the task with some reluctance; in order to avoid being present\r\nat the explosion of anger which he might expect, he addressed the demand\r\nto Bismarck on August 5th, by letter. Two days he waited for an answer,\r\nbut received none; on the evening of the 7th, he himself called on the\r\nCount, and a long discussion took place. Bismarck adopted a tone of\r\nindignation: \"The whole affair makes us doubt Napoleon and threatens to\r\ndestroy our confidence.\" The pith of it was contained in the last words:\r\n\"Do you ask this from us under threat of war?\" said Bismarck. \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid Benedetti. \"Then it will be war.\" Benedetti asked to have an\r\ninterview with the King; it was granted, and he received the same\r\nanswer. This was the result he had anticipated, and the next evening he\r\nreturned to Paris to consider with the Government what was to be done.\r\nBismarck meanwhile had taken care that some information as to these\r\nsecret negotiations should become known; with characteristic cleverness\r\nhe caused it to be published in a French paper, _Le Siècle_, that France\r\nhad asked for the Rhine country and been refused. Of course, the German\r\nPress took up the matter; with patriotic fervour they supported the King\r\nand Minister. Napoleon found himself confronted by the danger of a\r\nunion of all Germany in opposition to French usurpation, and his own\r\ndiplomatic defeat had become known in a most inconvenient form; he at\r\nonce travelled to Paris, consulted Benedetti, returned to his former\r\npolicy, and asked that the demand of August 5th might be forgotten; it\r\nwas withdrawn, and things were to be as if it had never been made.\r\n\r\nWere they, however, still to give up all hope of some increase of French\r\nterritory? The demand for German soil had been refused; it was not at\r\nall clear that Bismarck would not support the acquisition of at least\r\npart of Belgium. In conversation with Benedetti, on August 7th, he had\r\nsaid: \"Perhaps we will find other means of satisfying you.\" Goltz was\r\nstill very sympathetic; he regarded the French desire as quite\r\nlegitimate in principle. It was determined, therefore, now to act on\r\nthese hints and suggestions which had been repeated so often during the\r\nlast twelve months; Benedetti was instructed to return with a draft\r\ntreaty; the French demands were put in three forms; first of all he was\r\nto ask for the Saar Valley, Landau, Luxemburg, and Belgium; if this was\r\ntoo much, he was to be content with Belgium and Luxemburg, and if it\r\nseemed desirable he should offer that Antwerp be made a free city; by\r\nthis perhaps the extreme hostility of England would be averted. With\r\nthis demand, on August 20th, he again appeared before Bismarck. Of\r\ncourse, the Minister, as soon as Saarbrück and Landau were mentioned,\r\ndrew himself up to his full height, adopted an angry air, and reminded\r\nBenedetti of his repeated declaration that they were not going to give\r\nup a single German village. Benedetti, therefore, in accordance with his\r\ninstructions, withdrew this clause. The rest of the treaty he and\r\nBismarck discussed together carefully; they took it line by line and\r\nclause by clause, Bismarck dealing with the matter in a serious and\r\npractical manner. After this had been finished a revised draft was\r\nwritten out by Benedetti, Bismarck dictating to him the alterations\r\nwhich had been made. This revised draft consisted of five articles: (1)\r\nThe Emperor recognised the recent acquisitions of Prussia; (2) the King\r\nof Prussia should bind himself to assist France in acquiring Luxemburg\r\nfrom the King of Holland by purchase or exchange; (3) the Emperor bound\r\nhimself not to oppose a union of the North German Federation with the\r\nSouth German States and the establishment of a common Parliament; (4) if\r\nthe Emperor at any time wished to acquire Belgium, the King of Prussia\r\nwas to support him and give him military assistance against the\r\ninterference of any other Power; (5) a general treaty of alliance.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this treaty consists of two parts. The first refers\r\nto what has already taken place,--the Emperor of the French in return\r\nfor past assistance is to have Luxemburg; this part would naturally come\r\ninto operation immediately. The next two clauses referred to the future;\r\nthe union of all Germany would in the natural course of events not be\r\nlong delayed; this would seriously alter the balance of power and weaken\r\nFrance. Napoleon would naturally in the future use all his efforts to\r\nprevent it, as he had done during this year, and by an alliance with\r\nAustria he would probably be able to do so. He would, however, withdraw\r\nhis opposition if he was allowed to gain a similar increase of territory\r\nfor France. After all, the acquisition of at least part of Belgium by\r\nFrance might be justified by the same arguments by which the\r\ndethronement of the King of Hanover was defended. Many of the Belgians\r\nwere French; there was no natural division between Belgium and France;\r\nprobably the people would offer no opposition.\r\n\r\nBismarck had to remember that he could not complete the union of Germany\r\nwithout considering Napoleon; there were only two ways of doing the\r\nwork, (1) by war with France, (2) by an alliance. Need we be surprised\r\nthat he at least considered whether the latter would not be the safer,\r\nthe cheaper, and the more humane? Was it not better to complete the work\r\nby the sacrifice of Belgian independence rather than by the loss of\r\n300,000 lives?\r\n\r\nBenedetti sent the revised draft to Paris; it was submitted to the\r\nEmperor, accepted in principle, and returned with some small alterations\r\nand suggestions. Benedetti sent in the revision to Bismarck and said he\r\nwould be ready at any time to meet the Minister and finish the\r\nnegotiations. He himself left Berlin for Carlsbad and there awaited the\r\nsummons. It never came. Week after week went by, Bismarck retired to his\r\nPomeranian estate; he did not return to Berlin till December and he\r\nnever renewed the negotiations. The revised draft in Benedetti's\r\nhandwriting was in his hands; four years later, when war had been\r\ndeclared against France, he published it in order to destroy whatever\r\nsympathy for Napoleon there might be in England.\r\n\r\nBismarck did not continue the negotiations, for he had found a better\r\nway. Till August 23d his relations to Austria were still doubtful; he\r\nalways had to fear that there was some secret understanding between\r\nFrance and Austria, that a coalition of the two States had been\r\ncompleted, and that Prussia might suddenly find herself attacked on both\r\nsides. He had, therefore, not wished to offend France. Moreover his\r\nrelations to Russia were not quite satisfactory. The Czar took a very\r\nserious view of the annexations in North Germany: \"I do not like it,\" he\r\nsaid; \"I do not like this dethronement of dynasties.\" It was necessary\r\nto send General Manteuffel on a special mission to St. Petersburg; the\r\nCzar did not alter his opinion, but Bismarck found it possible at least\r\nto quiet him. We do not know all that passed, but he seems to have used\r\na threat and a promise. If the Czar attempted to interfere in Germany,\r\nBismarck hinted, as he had already done, that he might have to put\r\nhimself at the head of the Revolution, and proclaim the Constitution of\r\n1849; then what would happen to the monarchical principles? He even\r\nsuggested that a Revolution which began in Germany might spread to\r\nPoland. The Czar explained that he was discontented with many clauses in\r\nthe Treaty of Paris. There was an understanding, if there was no formal\r\ncompact, that Prussia would lend her support, when the time came for\r\nthe Czar to declare that he was no longer willing to observe this\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nBy the end of August Bismarck had therefore removed the chief dangers\r\nwhich threatened him. Russia was quieted, France was expectant, Austria\r\nwas pacified. He had, however, done more than this: he had already laid\r\nthe foundation for the union of the whole of Germany which Napoleon\r\nthought he had prevented.\r\n\r\nThe four southern States had joined in the war against Prussia. In a\r\nbrilliant and interesting campaign a small Prussian army had defeated\r\nthe Federal forces and occupied the whole of South Germany. The conquest\r\nof Germany by Prussia was complete. These States had applied at\r\nNikolsburg to be allowed to join in the negotiations. The request was\r\nrefused, and Bismarck at this time treated them with a deliberate and\r\nobtrusive brutality. Baron von der Pfortden, the Bavarian Minister, had\r\nhimself travelled to Nikolsburg to ask for peace. He was greeted by\r\nBismarck with the words: \"What are you doing here? You have no\r\nsafe-conduct. I should be justified in treating you as a prisoner of\r\nwar.\" He had to return without achieving anything. Frankfort had been\r\noccupied by the Prussian army; the citizens were required to pay a war\r\nindemnity of a million pounds; Manteuffel, who was in command,\r\nthreatened to plunder the town, and the full force of Prussian\r\ndispleasure was felt by the city where Bismarck had passed so many\r\nyears. It was arranged with Austria and France that the southern States\r\nshould participate in the suspension of hostilities; that they should\r\npreserve their independence and should be allowed to enter into any kind\r\nof Federal alliance with one another. The result of this would have been\r\nthat South Germany would be a weak, disunited confederation, which would\r\nbe under the control partly of France and partly of Austria. This would\r\nhave meant the perpetuation in its worst form of French influence over\r\nSouth Germany. When this clause was agreed on, the terms of peace\r\nbetween these States and Prussia had not yet been arranged. The King of\r\nPrussia wished that they should surrender to him some parts of their\r\nterritory. Bismarck, however, opposed this. He was guided by the same\r\nprinciples which had influenced him all along. Some States should be\r\nentirely absorbed in Prussia, the others treated so leniently that the\r\nevents of this year should leave no feeling of hostility. If Bavaria had\r\nto surrender Bayreuth and Anspach, he knew that the Bavarians would\r\nnaturally take part in the first coalition against Prussia. With much\r\ntrouble he persuaded the King to adopt this point of view. The wisdom of\r\nit was soon shewn. At the beginning of August he still maintained a very\r\nimperious attitude, and talked to the Bavarians of large annexations.\r\nPfortden in despair had cried, \"Do not drive us too far; we shall have\r\nto go for help to France.\" Then was Bismarck's turn. He told the\r\nBavarian Minister of Napoleon's suggestion, shewed him that it was\r\nPrussia alone who had prevented Napoleon from annexing a large part of\r\nBavaria, and then appealed to him through his German patriotism: Would\r\nnot Bavaria join Prussia in an alliance? Pfortden was much moved, the\r\nCount and the Baron embraced one another, and by the end of August\r\nBismarck had arranged with all the four southern States a secret\r\noffensive and defensive alliance. By this they bound themselves to\r\nsupport Prussia if she was attacked. Prussia guaranteed to them their\r\nterritory; in case of war they would put their army under the command of\r\nthe King of Prussia. He was now sure, therefore, of an alliance of all\r\nGermany against France. He no longer required French assistance. The\r\nunity of Germany, when it was made, would be achieved by the unaided\r\nforces of the united German States. The draft treaty with Napoleon might\r\nnow be put aside.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations mark indeed a most important change in Bismarck's own\r\nattitude. Hitherto he had thought and acted as a Prussian; he had\r\ndeliberately refused on all occasions to support or adopt the German\r\nprogramme. He had done this because he did not wish Germany to be made\r\nstrong until the ascendancy of Prussia was secured. The battle of\r\nKöniggrätz had done that; North Germany was now Prussian; the time had\r\ncome when he could begin to think and act as a German, for the power of\r\nPrussia was founded on a rock of bronze.\r\n\r\nThis change was not the only one which dates from the great victory. The\r\nconstitutional conflict had still to be settled. The Parliament had been\r\ndissolved just before the war; the new elections had taken place on the\r\n3d of July, after the news of the first victory was known. The result\r\nwas shewn in a great gain of seats to the Government and to the\r\nModerate Liberal party. The great question, however, was, how would\r\nBismarck use his victory over the House? for a victory it was. It was\r\nthe cannon of Königgrätz which decided the Parliamentary conflict. The\r\nHouse had refused the money to reorganise the army, and it was this\r\nreorganised army which had achieved so unexampled a triumph. Would the\r\nGovernment now press their victory and use the enthusiasm of the moment\r\npermanently to cripple the Constitution? This is what the Conservative\r\nparty, what Roon and the army wished to do. It was not Bismarck's\r\nintention. He required the support of the patriotic Liberals for the\r\nwork he had to do; he proposed, therefore, that the Government should\r\ncome before the House and ask for an indemnity. They did not confess\r\nthat they had acted wrongly, they did not express regret, but they\r\nrecognised that in spending the money without a vote of the House there\r\nhad been an offence against the Constitution; this could now only be\r\nmade good if a Bill was brought in approving of what had happened. He\r\ncarried his opinion, not without difficulty; the Bill of indemnity was\r\nintroduced and passed. He immediately had his reward. The Liberal party,\r\nwhich had hitherto opposed him, broke into two portions. The extreme\r\nRadicals and Progressives still continued their opposition; the majority\r\nof the party formed themselves into a new organisation, to which they\r\ngave the name of National Liberals. They pledged themselves to support\r\nthe National and German policy of the Government, while they undertook,\r\nso far as they were able, to maintain and strengthen the constitutional\r\nrights of Parliament. By this Bismarck had a Parliamentary majority, and\r\nhe more and more depended upon them rather than his old friends, the\r\nConservatives. He required their support because henceforward he would\r\nhave to deal not with one Parliament, but two. The North German\r\nConfederation was to have its Parliament elected by universal suffrage.\r\nBismarck foresaw that the principles he had upheld in the past could not\r\nbe applied in the same form to the whole of the Confederation. The\r\nPrussian Conservative party was purely Prussian, it was Particularist;\r\nhad he continued to depend upon it, then all the members sent to the new\r\nReichstag, not only from Saxony, but also from the annexed States, would\r\nhave been thrown into opposition; the Liberal party had always been not\r\nPrussian but German; now that he had to govern so large a portion of\r\nGermany, that which had in the past been the great cause of difference\r\nwould be the strongest bond of union. The National Liberal party was\r\nalone able to join him in the work of creating enthusiasm for the new\r\ninstitutions and new loyalty. How often had he in the old days\r\ncomplained of the Liberals that they thought not as Prussians, that they\r\nwere ashamed of Prussia, that they were not really loyal to Prussia. Now\r\nhe knew that just for this reason they would be most loyal to the North\r\nGerman Confederation.\r\n\r\nBismarck's moderation in the hour of victory must not obscure the\r\nimportance of his triumph. The question had been tried which should\r\nrule--the Crown or the Parliament; the Crown had won not only a\r\nphysical but a moral victory. Bismarck had maintained that the House of\r\nRepresentatives could not govern Prussia; the foreign affairs of the\r\nState, he had always said, must be carried on by a Minister who was\r\nresponsible, not to the House, but to the King. No one could doubt that\r\nhad the House been able to control him he would not have won these great\r\nsuccesses. From that time the confidence of the German people in\r\nParliamentary government was broken. Moreover, it was the first time in\r\nthe history of Europe in which one of these struggles had conclusively\r\nended in the defeat of Parliament. The result of it was to be shewn in\r\nthe history of every country in Europe during the next thirty years. It\r\nis the most serious blow which the principle of representative\r\ngovernment has yet received.\r\n\r\nBy the end of August most of the labour was completed; there remained\r\nonly the arrangement of peace with Saxony; this he left to his\r\nsubordinates and retired to Pomerania for the long period of rest which\r\nhe so much required.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence a motion was brought before Parliament for conferring\r\na donation on the victorious generals. At the instance of one of his\r\nmost consistent opponents Bismarck's name was included in the list on\r\naccount of his great services to his country; a protest was raised by\r\nVirchow on the ground that no Minister while in office should receive a\r\npresent, and that of all men Bismarck least deserved one, but scarcely\r\nfifty members could be found to oppose the vote. The donation of 40,000\r\nthalers he used in purchasing the estate of Varzin, in Pomerania which\r\nwas to be his home for the next twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE NORTH GERMAN CONFEDERATION.\r\n\r\n1866-1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto seen Bismarck in the character of party leader,\r\nParliamentary debater, a keen and accomplished diplomatist; now he comes\r\nbefore us in a new rôle, that of creative statesman; he adopts it with\r\nthe same ease and complete mastery with which he had borne himself in\r\nthe earlier stages of his career. The Constitution of the North German\r\nConfederation was his work, and it shews the same intellectual resource,\r\nthe originality, and practical sense which mark all he did.\r\n\r\nBy a treaty of August 18, 1866, all the North German States which had\r\nsurvived entered into a treaty with one another and with Prussia; they\r\nmutually guaranteed each other's possessions, engaged to place their\r\nforces under the command of the King of Prussia, and promised to enter\r\ninto a new federation; for this purpose they were to send envoys to\r\nBerlin who should agree on a Constitution, and they were to allow\r\nelections to take place by universal suffrage for a North German\r\nParliament before which was to be laid the draft Constitution agreed\r\nupon by the envoys of the States. These treaties did not actually create\r\nthe new federation; they only bound the separate States to enter into\r\nnegotiations, and, as they expired on August 30, 1867, it was necessary\r\nthat the new Constitution should be completed and ratified by that date.\r\nThe time was short, for in it had to be compressed both the negotiations\r\nbetween the States and the debates in the assembly; but all past\r\nexperience had shewn that the shorter the time allowed for making a\r\nConstitution the more probable was it that the work would be completed.\r\nBismarck did not intend to allow the precious months, when enthusiasm\r\nwas still high and new party factions had not seized hold of men's\r\nminds, to be lost.\r\n\r\nHe had spent the autumn in Pomerania and did not return to Berlin till\r\nthe 21st of December; not a week remained before the representatives of\r\nthe North German States would assemble in the capital of Prussia. To the\r\nastonishment and almost dismay of his friends, he had taken no steps for\r\npreparing a draft. As soon as he arrived two drafts were laid before\r\nhim; he put them aside and the next day dictated the outlines of the new\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThis document has not been published, but it was the basis of the\r\ndiscussion with the envoys; Bismarck allowed no prolonged debates; they\r\nwere kept for some weeks in Berlin, but only three formal meetings took\r\nplace. They made suggestions and criticisms, some of which were\r\naccepted, but they were of course obliged to assent to everything on\r\nwhich Bismarck insisted. The scheme as finally agreed upon by the\r\nconference was then laid before the assembly which met in Berlin on\r\nFebruary 24th.\r\n\r\nA full analysis of this Constitution, for which we have no space here,\r\nwould be very instructive; it must not be compared with those elaborate\r\nconstitutions drawn up by political theorists of which so many have been\r\nintroduced during this century. Bismarck's work was like that of\r\nAugustus; he found most of the institutions of government to his hand,\r\nbut they were badly co-ordinated; what he had to do was to bring them\r\ninto better relations with each other, and to add to them where\r\nnecessary. Many men would have swept away everything which existed, made\r\na clear field, and begun to build up a new State from the foundations.\r\nBismarck was much too wise to attempt this, for he knew that the\r\nfoundations of political life cannot be securely laid by one man or in\r\none generation. He built on the foundations which others had laid, and\r\nfor this reason it is probable that his work will be as permanent as\r\nthat of the founder of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nWe find in the new State old and new mixed together in an inseparable\r\nunion, and we find a complete indifference to theory or symmetry; each\r\npoint is decided purely by reference to the political situation at the\r\nmoment. Take, for instance, the question of diplomatic representation;\r\nBismarck wished to give the real power to the King of Prussia, but at\r\nthe same time to preserve the external dignity and respect due to the\r\nAllied Princes. He arranged that the King of Prussia as President of\r\nthe Confederation appointed envoys and ambassadors to foreign States;\r\nfrom this time there ceased to be a Prussian diplomatic service, and, in\r\nthis matter, Prussia is entirely absorbed in Germany. It would have been\r\nonly natural that the smaller Allied States should also surrender their\r\nright to enter into direct diplomatic relations with foreign Powers.\r\nThis Bismarck did not require. Saxony, for instance, continued to have\r\nits own envoys; England and France, as in the old days, kept a Minister\r\nin Dresden. Bismarck was much criticised for this, but he knew that\r\nnothing would so much reconcile the King of Saxony to his new position,\r\nand it was indeed no small thing that the Princes thus preserved in a\r\nformal way a right which shewed to all the world that they were not\r\nsubjects but sovereign allies. When it was represented to Bismarck that\r\nthis right might be the source of intrigues with foreign States, he\r\nanswered characteristically that if Saxony wished to intrigue nothing\r\ncould prevent her doing so; it was not necessary to have a formal\r\nembassy for this purpose. His confidence was absolutely justified. A few\r\nmonths later Napoleon sent to the King of Saxony a special invitation to\r\na European congress; the King at once sent on the invitation to Berlin\r\nand let it be known that he did not wish to be represented apart from\r\nthe North German Confederation. The same leniency was shewn in 1870.\r\nNothing is a better proof of Bismarck's immense superiority both in\r\npractical wisdom and in judgment of character. The Liberal Press in\r\nGermany had never ceased to revile the German dynasties; Bismarck knew\r\nthat their apparent disloyalty to Germany arose not from their wishes\r\nbut was a necessary result of the faults of the old Constitution. He\r\nmade their interests coincide with the interests of Germany, and from\r\nthis time they have been the most loyal supporters, first of the\r\nConfederation, and afterwards of the Empire. This he was himself the\r\nfirst to acknowledge; both before and after the foundation of the Empire\r\nhe has on many occasions expressed his sense of the great services\r\nrendered to Germany by the dynasties. \"They,\" he said once, \"were the\r\ntrue guardians of German unity, not the Reichstag and its parties.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important provisions of the Constitution were those by which\r\nthe military supremacy of Prussia was secured; in this chapter every\r\ndetail is arranged and provided for; the armies of all the various\r\nStates were henceforth to form one army, under the command of the King\r\nof Prussia, with common organisation and similar uniform in every State;\r\nin every State the Prussian military system was to be introduced, and\r\nall the details of Prussian military law.\r\n\r\nNow let us compare with this the navy: the army represented the old\r\nGermany, the navy the new; the army was arranged and organised as\r\nPrussian, Saxon, Mecklenburg; the navy, on the other hand, was German\r\nand organised by the new Federal officials. There was a Federal Minister\r\nof Marine, but no Federal Minister of War; the army continued the living\r\nsign of Prussian supremacy among a group of sovereign States, the navy\r\nwas the first fruit of the united German institutions which were to be\r\nbuilt up by the united efforts of the whole people--a curious\r\nresemblance to the manner in which Augustus also added an Imperial navy\r\nto the older Republican army.\r\n\r\nThe very form in which the Constitution was presented is characteristic;\r\nin the Parliamentary debates men complained that there was no preamble,\r\nno introduction, no explanation. Bismarck answered that this was omitted\r\nfor two reasons: first, there had not been time to draw it up, and\r\nsecondly, it would be far more difficult to agree on the principles\r\nwhich the Constitution was to represent than on the details themselves.\r\nThere is no attempt at laying down general principles, no definitions,\r\nand no enumeration of fundamental rights; all these rocks, on which so\r\noften in Germany, as in France, precious months had been wasted, were\r\nentirely omitted.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us turn to that which after the organisation of the army was\r\nof most importance,--the arrangement of the administration and\r\nlegislation. Here it is that we see the greatest originality. German\r\nwriters have often explained that it is impossible to classify the new\r\nState in any known category, and in following their attempts to find the\r\ntechnical definition for the authority on which it rests, one is led\r\nalmost to doubt whether it really exists at all.\r\n\r\nThere are two agents of government, the Federal Council, or\r\n_Bundesrath_, and the Parliament, or _Reichstag_. Here again we see the\r\nblending of the old and new, for while the Parliament was now created\r\nfor the first time, the Council was really nothing but the old Federal\r\nDiet. Even the old system of voting was retained; not that this was\r\nbetter than any other system, but, as Bismarck explained, it was easier\r\nto preserve the old than to agree on a new. Any system must have been\r\npurely arbitrary, for had each State received a number of votes\r\nproportionate to its population even the appearance of a federation\r\nwould have been lost, and Bismarck was very anxious not to establish an\r\nabsolute unity under Prussia.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, why was Bismarck now so careful in his treatment of\r\nthe smaller States? The answer will be found in words which he had\r\nwritten many years ago:\r\n\r\n  \"I do not wish to see Germany substituted for Prussia on our\r\n  banner until we have brought about a closer and more practical\r\n  union with our fellow-countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nNow the time had come, and now he was to be the first and most patriotic\r\nof Germans as in old days he had been the strictest of Prussians. Do not\r\nlet us in welcoming the change condemn his earlier policy. It was only\r\nhis loyalty to Prussia which had made Germany possible; for it is indeed\r\ntrue that he could never have ruled Germany had he not first conquered\r\nit. The real and indisputable supremacy of Prussia was still preserved;\r\nand Prussia was now so strong that she could afford to be generous. It\r\nwas wise to be generous, for the work was only half completed; the\r\nsouthern States were still outside the union; he wished to bring them\r\ninto the fold, but to do so not by force of arms but of their own free\r\nwill; and they certainly would be more easily attracted if they saw that\r\nthe North German States were treated with good faith and kindness.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the Council we have the Reichstag; this was, in\r\naccordance with the proposal made in the spring of 1866, to be elected\r\nby universal suffrage. And now we see that this proposal, which a few\r\nmonths ago had appeared merely as a despairing bid for popularity by a\r\nstatesman who had sacrificed every other means of securing his policy,\r\nhad become a device convincing in its simplicity; at once all\r\npossibility of discussion or opposition was prevented; not indeed that\r\nthere were not many warning voices raised, but as Bismarck, in defending\r\nthis measure, asked,--what was the alternative? Any other system would\r\nhave been purely arbitrary, and any arbitrary system would at once have\r\nopened the gate to a prolonged discussion and political struggle on\r\nquestions of the franchise. In a modern European State, when all men can\r\nread and write, and all men must serve in the army, there is no means of\r\nlimiting the franchise in a way which will command universal consent. In\r\nGermany there was not any old historical practice to which men could\r\nappeal or which could naturally be applied to the new Parliament;\r\nuniversal suffrage at least gave something clear, comprehensible, final.\r\nMen more easily believed in the permanence of the new State when every\r\nGerman received for the first time the full privilege of citizenship. We\r\nmust notice, however, that Bismarck had always intended that voting\r\nshould be open; the Parliament in revising the Constitution introduced\r\nthe ballot. He gave his consent with much reluctance; voting seemed to\r\nhim to be a public duty, and to perform it in secret was to undermine\r\nthe roots of political life. He was a man who was constitutionally\r\nunable to understand fear. We have then the Council and the Parliament,\r\nand we must now enquire as to their duties. In nearly every modern State\r\nthe popular representative assembly holds the real power; before it,\r\neverything else is humbled; the chief occupation of lawgivers is to find\r\nsome ingenious device by which it may at least be controlled and\r\nmoderated in the exercise of its power. It was not likely that Bismarck\r\nwould allow Germany to be governed by a democratic assembly; he was not\r\nsatisfied with creating an artificial Upper House which might, perhaps,\r\nbe able for one year or two to check the extravagances of a popular\r\nHouse, or with allowing to the King a veto which could only be exercised\r\nwith fear and trembling. Generally the Lower House is the predominant\r\npartner; it governs; the Upper House can only amend, criticise,\r\nmoderate. Bismarck completely reversed the situation: the true\r\ngovernment, the full authority in the State was given to the Council;\r\nthe Parliament had to content itself with a limited opportunity for\r\ncriticism, with the power to amend or veto Bills, and to refuse its\r\nassent to new taxes. In England the government rests in the House of\r\nCommons; in Germany it is in the Federal Council, and for the same\r\nreason--that the Council has both executive and legislative power.\r\nConstitutions have generally been made by men whose chief object was to\r\nweaken the power of the Government, who believed that those rulers do\r\nleast harm who have least power, with whom suspicion is the first of\r\npolitical virtues, and who would condemn to permanent inefficiency the\r\ninstitutions they have invented. It was not likely Bismarck would do\r\nthis. The ordinary device is to separate the legislative and executive\r\npower; to set up two rival and equal authorities which may check and\r\nneutralise each other. Bismarck, deserting all the principles of the\r\nbooks, united all the powers of government in the Council. The whole\r\nadministration was subjected to it; all laws were introduced in it. The\r\ndebates were secret; it was an assembly of the ablest statesmen in\r\nGermany; the decisions at which it arrived were laid in their complete\r\nform before the Reichstag. It was a substitute for a Second Chamber, but\r\nit was also a Council of State; it united the duties of the Privy\r\nCouncil and the House of Lords; it reminds us in its composition of the\r\nAmerican Senate, but it would be a Senate in which the President of the\r\nRepublic presided.\r\n\r\nBismarck never ceased to maintain the importance of the Federal Council;\r\nhe always looked on it as the key to the whole new Constitution. Shortly\r\nafter the war with France, when the Liberals made an attempt to\r\noverthrow its authority, he warned them not to do so.\r\n\r\n  \"I believe,\" he said, \"that the Federal Council has a great\r\n  future. Great as Prussia is, we have been able to learn much from\r\n  the small, even from the smallest member of it; they on their\r\n  side have learnt much from us. From my own experience I can say\r\n  that I have made considerable advance in my political education\r\n  by taking part in the sittings of the Council and by the life\r\n  which comes from the friction of five and twenty German centres\r\n  with one another. I beg you do not interfere with the Council. I\r\n  consider it a kind of Palladium for our future, a great guarantee\r\n  for the future of Germany in its present form.\"\r\n\r\nNow, from the peculiar character of the Council arose a very noticeable\r\nomission; just as there was no Upper House (though the Prussian\r\nConservatives strongly desired to see one), so, also, there was no\r\nFederal Ministry. In every modern State there is a Council formed of the\r\nheads of different administrative departments; this was so universal\r\nthat it was supposed to be essential to a constitution. In the German\r\nEmpire we search for it in vain; there is only one responsible Minister,\r\nand he is the Chancellor, the representative of Prussia and Chairman of\r\nthe Council. The Liberals could not reconcile themselves to this strange\r\ndevice; they passed it with reluctance in the stress of the moment, but\r\nthey have never ceased to protest against it. Again and again, both in\r\npublic and in private, we hear the same demand: till we have a\r\nresponsible Ministry the Constitution will never work. Two years later a\r\nmotion was introduced and passed through the Reichstag demanding the\r\nformation of a Federal Ministry; Bismarck opposed the motion and refused\r\nto carry it out.\r\n\r\nHe had several reasons for omitting what was apparently almost a\r\nnecessary institution. The first was respect for the rights of the\r\nFederal States. If a Ministry, responsible to Parliament, had existed,\r\nthe executive power would have been taken away from the Bundesrath, and\r\nthe Princes of the smaller States would really have been subjected to\r\nthe new organ; the Ministers must have been appointed by the President;\r\nthey would have looked to him and to the Reichstag for support, and\r\nwould soon have begun to carry out their policy, not by agreement with\r\nthe Governments arrived at by technical discussions across the table of\r\nthe Council-room, but by orders and decrees based on the will of the\r\nParliament. This would inevitably have aroused just what Bismarck wished\r\nto avoid. It would have produced a struggle between the central and\r\nlocal authorities; it would again have thrown the smaller Governments\r\ninto opposition to national unity; it would have frightened the southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHis other reasons for opposing the introduction of a Ministry were that\r\nhe did not wish to give more power to the Parliament, and above all he\r\ndisliked the system of collegiate responsibility.\r\n\r\n  \"You wish,\" he said, \"to make the Government responsible, and do\r\n  it by introducing a board. I say the responsibility will\r\n  disappear as soon as you do so; responsibility is only there when\r\n  there is a single man who can be brought to task for any\r\n  mistakes.... I consider that in and for itself a Constitution\r\n  which introduces joint ministerial responsibility is a political\r\n  blunder from which every State ought to free itself as soon as it\r\n  can. Anyone who has ever been a Minister and at the head of a\r\n  Ministry, and has been obliged to take resolutions upon his own\r\n  responsibility, ceases at last to fear this responsibility, but\r\n  he does shrink from the necessity of convincing seven people that\r\n  that which he wishes is really right. That is a very different\r\n  work from governing a State.\"\r\n\r\nThese reasons are very characteristic of him; the feeling became more\r\nconfirmed as he grew older. In 1875 he says:\r\n\r\n  \"Under no circumstances could I any longer submit to the\r\n  thankless rôle of Minister-President of Prussia in a Ministry\r\n  with joint responsibility, if I were not accustomed, from my old\r\n  affection, to submit to the wishes of my King and Master. So\r\n  thankless, so powerless, and so little responsible is that\r\n  position; one can only be responsible for that which one does of\r\n  one's own will; a board is responsible for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe always said himself that he would be satisfied with the position of\r\nan English Prime Minister. He was thinking, of course, of the\r\nconstitutional right which the Prime Minister has, to appoint and\r\ndismiss his colleagues, which if he has strength of character will, of\r\ncourse, give him the real control of affairs, and also of the right\r\nwhich he enjoys of being the sole means by which the views of the\r\nMinisters are represented to the sovereign. In Prussia the\r\nMinister-President had not acquired by habit these privileges, and the\r\npower of the different Ministers was much more equal. In the new\r\nFederation he intended to have a single will directing the whole\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe matter is of some interest because of the light it throws on one\r\nside of his character. He was not a man with whom others found it easy\r\nto work; he did not easily brook opposition, and he disliked having to\r\nexplain and justify his policy to anyone besides the King. He was not\r\nable to keep a single one of his colleagues throughout his official\r\ncareer. Even Roon found it often difficult to continue working with him;\r\nhe complained of the Hermit of Varzin, \"who wishes to do everything\r\nhimself, and nevertheless issues the strictest prohibition that he is\r\nnever to be disturbed.\" What suited him best was the position of almost\r\nabsolute ruler, and he looked on his colleagues rather as subordinates\r\nthan as equals.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be objected, if there was to be a single will governing the\r\nwhole, the government could not be left to the Council; a board\r\ncomprising the representatives of twenty States could not really\r\nadminister, and in truth the Council was but the veil; behind it is the\r\nall-pervading power of the King of Prussia--and his Minister. The ruler\r\nof Germany was the Chancellor of the Federation; it was he alone that\r\nunited and inspired the whole. Let us enumerate his duties. He was sole\r\nMinister to the President of the Confederation (after 1870 to the\r\nEmperor). The President (who was King of Prussia) could declare peace\r\nand war, sign treaties, and appointed all officials, but all his acts\r\nrequired the signature of the Chancellor, who was thereby Foreign\r\nMinister of the Confederation and had the whole of the patronage. More\r\nthan this, he was at the head of the whole internal administration; from\r\ntime to time different departments of State were created,--marine,\r\npost-office, finance,--but the men who stood at the head of each\r\ndepartment were not co-ordinate with the Chancellor; they were not his\r\ncolleagues, but were subordinates to whom he delegated the work. They\r\nwere not immediately responsible to the Emperor, Council, or Reichstag,\r\nbut to him; he, whenever he wished, could undertake the immediate\r\ncontrol of each department, he could defend its actions, and was\r\ntechnically responsible to the Council for any failure. Of course, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the different departments generally were left to work\r\nalone, but if at any time it seemed desirable, the Chancellor could\r\nalways interfere and issue orders which must be obeyed; if the head of\r\nthe department did not agree, then he had nothing to do but resign, and\r\nthe Chancellor would appoint his successor.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor was, then, the working head of the Government; but it\r\nwill be said that his power would be so limited by the interference of\r\nthe Emperor, the Council, the Parliament, that he would have no freedom.\r\nThe contrary is the truth. There were five different sources of\r\nauthority with which he had to deal: the President of the Federation\r\n(the Emperor), who was King of Prussia, the Council, the Prussian\r\nParliament, the German Parliament, and the Prussian Ministry. Now in the\r\nCouncil he presided, and also represented the will of Prussia, which\r\nwas almost irresistible, for if the Constitution was to work well there\r\nmust be harmony of intention between Prussia and the Federal Government;\r\nhere therefore he could generally carry out his policy: but in the\r\nPrussian Ministry he spoke as sole Minister of the Federation and the\r\nimmense authority he thus enjoyed raised him at once to a position of\r\nsuperiority to all his colleagues. More than this, he was now free from\r\nthe danger of Parliamentary control; it was easier to deal with one\r\nParliament than two; they had no _locus standi_ for constitutional\r\nopposition to his policy. The double position he held enabled him to\r\nelude all control. Policy was decided in the Council; when he voted\r\nthere he acted as representative of the King of Prussia and was bound by\r\nthe instructions he received from the Prussian Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs; the Reichstag had nothing to do with Prussian policy and had no\r\nright to criticise the action of the Prussian Minister. It did not\r\nmatter that Bismarck himself was not only Chancellor of the Diet, but\r\nalso Minister-President of Prussia and Foreign Minister, and was really\r\nacting in accordance with the instructions he had given to himself[8];\r\nthe principle remained,--each envoy to the Diet was responsible, not to\r\nthe Reichstag, but to the Government he represented. When, however, he\r\nappeared in the Reichstag to explain and defend the policy adopted by\r\nthe Council, then he stood before them as representative not necessarily\r\nof his own policy, but of that which had been decided on by a board in\r\nwhich he had possibly been outvoted. The Reichstag could reject the\r\nproposal if it were a law or a tax; they could criticise and debate, but\r\nthere was no ground on which they could constitutionally demand the\r\ndismissal of the Minister.\r\n\r\nOf course Bismarck did not attempt to evade the full moral\r\nresponsibility for the policy which he advocated, but he knew that so\r\nlong as he had the confidence of the King of Prussia and the majority of\r\nthe Allied States, all the power of Parliament could not injure him.\r\n\r\nWhat probably not even he foresaw was that the new Constitution so\r\ngreatly added to the power of the Minister that even the authority of\r\nthe King began to pale before it. As before, there was only one\r\ndepartment of State where his authority ceased,--the army.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily understood that this Constitution, when it was laid\r\nbefore the assembly, was not accepted without much discussion and many\r\nobjections. There were some--the representatives of conquered districts,\r\nPoles, Hanoverians, and the deputies from Schleswig-Holstein--who wished\r\nto overthrow the new Federation which was built up on the destruction of\r\nthe States to which they had belonged. Theirs was an enmity which was\r\nopen, honourable, and easy to meet. More insidious and dangerous was the\r\ncriticism of those men who, while they professed to desire the ends\r\nwhich Bismarck had attained, refused to approve of the Constitution\r\nbecause they would have to renounce some of the principles of the\r\nparties to which they belonged.\r\n\r\nThere were some to whom it seemed that he gave too much freedom to the\r\nindividual States; they wished for a more complete unity, but now\r\nBismarck, for the first time, was strong enough to shew the essential\r\nmoderation of his character; he knew what the Liberals were ready to\r\nforget, that moderation, while foolish in the moment of conflict, is the\r\nproper adornment of the conqueror. When they asked him to take away many\r\nof the privileges reserved to the smaller States, he reminded them that,\r\nthough Mecklenburg and the Saxon duchies were helpless before the\r\nincreased power of the Prussian Crown, they were protected by Prussian\r\npromises, and that a King of Prussia, though he might strike down his\r\nenemies, must always fulfil in spirit and in letter his obligations to\r\nhis friends. The basis of the new alliance must be the mutual confidence\r\nof the allies; he had taught them to fear Prussia, now they must learn\r\nto trust her.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Conservatives feared that the power of the Prussian King\r\nand the independence of the Prussian State would be affected; but\r\nBismarck's influence with them was sufficient to prevent any open\r\nopposition. More dangerous were the Progressives, who apprehended that\r\nthe new Constitution would limit the influence of the Prussian\r\nParliament. On many points they refused to accept the proposals of the\r\nGovernment; they feared for liberty. For them Bismarck had no sympathy\r\nand no words but contempt, and he put curtly before them the question,\r\ndid they wish to sacrifice all he had attained to their principles of\r\nParliamentary government? They demanded, for instance, that, as the\r\nConstitution of Prussia could not be altered without the consent of the\r\nPrussian Parliament, the new Federal Constitution must be laid before\r\nthe Prussian Parliament for discussion and ratification. It is curious\r\nto notice that this is exactly the same claim which Bismarck in 1852 had\r\nsupported as against Radowitz; he had, however, learned much since then;\r\nhe pointed out that the same claim which was made by the Prussian\r\nParliament might be made by the Parliament of each of the twenty-two\r\nStates. It was now his duty to defend the unification of Germany against\r\nthis new _Particularism_; in old days Particularism found its support in\r\nthe dynasties, \"now it is,\" he said, \"in the Parliaments.\r\n\r\n  \"Do you really believe,\" he said, \"that the great movement which\r\n  last year led the peoples to battle from the Belt to the Sicilian\r\n  Sea, from the Rhine to the Pruth and the Dniester, in the throw\r\n  of the iron dice when we played for the crowns of kings and\r\n  emperors, that the millions of German warriors who fought against\r\n  one another and bled on the battle-fields from the Rhine to the\r\n  Carpathians, that the thousands and ten thousands who were left\r\n  dead on the battle-field and struck down by pestilence, who by\r\n  their death have sealed the national decision,--that all this can\r\n  be pigeon-holed by a resolution of Parliament? Gentlemen, in this\r\n  case you really do not stand on the height of the situation.... I\r\n  should like to see the gentlemen who consider this possibility\r\n  answer an invalid from Königgrätz when he asks for the result of\r\n  this mighty effort. You would say to him: 'Yes, indeed, for the\r\n  German unity nothing is achieved, the occasion for that will\r\n  probably come, that we can have easily, we can come to an\r\n  understanding any day, but we have saved the Budget-right of the\r\n  Chamber of Deputies, we have saved the right of the Prussian\r\n  Parliament every year to put the existence of the Prussian army\r\n  in question,' ... and therewith the invalid must console himself\r\n  for the loss of his limbs and the widow as she buries her\r\n  husband.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this speech with the similar speech he made\r\nafter Olmütz: how great is the similarity in thought and expression, how\r\nchanged is the position of the speaker! He had no sympathy with these\r\ndoubts and hesitations; why so much distrust of one another? His\r\nConstitution might not be the best, it might not be perfect, but at\r\nleast let it be completed. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"let us work quickly,\r\nlet us put Germany in the saddle; it will soon learn to ride.\" He was\r\nannoyed and irritated by the opposition he met.\r\n\r\n  \"If one has struggled hard for five years to achieve that which\r\n  now lies before us, if one has spent one's time, the best years\r\n  of one's life, and sacrificed one's health for it, if one\r\n  remembers the trouble it has cost to decide quite a small\r\n  paragraph, even a question of punctuation, with two and twenty\r\n  Governments, if at last we have agreed on that as it here lies\r\n  before us, then gentlemen who have experienced little of all\r\n  these struggles, and know nothing of the official proceedings\r\n  which have gone before, come forward in a manner which I can only\r\n  compare to that of a man who throws a stone at my window without\r\n  knowing where I stand. He knows not where he hits me, he knows\r\n  not what business he impedes.\"\r\n\r\nHe compared himself with Hotspur when after the battle he met the\r\ncourtier who came to demand his prisoners, and when wounded and tired\r\nfrom the fight had to hear a long lecture over instruments of slaughter\r\nand internal wounds.\r\n\r\nThe debates were continued for two months with much spirit and ability;\r\nagain and again a majority of the Parliament voted amendments against\r\nwhich Bismarck had spoken. When they had completed the revision of the\r\nConstitution, these had again to be referred to the separate\r\nGovernments. Forty were adopted; on two only Bismarck informed the\r\nParliament that their proposals could not be accepted. One of these was\r\nthe arrangements for the army Budget; so soon did a fresh conflict on\r\nthis matter threaten. A compromise was agreed upon; in consideration of\r\nthe immediate danger (it was just the time when a war with France\r\nregarding Luxemburg appeared imminent), the House voted the money\r\nrequired for the army for the next four years; in 1871 a new arrangement\r\nwould have to be made, but for this time the Government was able to\r\nmaintain the army at the strength which they wished for. The other\r\nmatter was of less immediate importance: the majority of the House had\r\nvoted that members of the Parliament should receive payment for their\r\nservices. Bismarck had spoken strongly against this; now he made it a\r\nquestion of confidence, and warned them that the Governments would not\r\naccept it. The House had no alternative except to withdraw their vote.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution as finally agreed on exists to this day as that of the\r\nGerman Empire. Notwithstanding the evil forebodings made at the time, it\r\nhas worked well for over thirty years.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that the new State had been created and the new\r\nConstitution adopted, a great change took place in Bismarck's public\r\nposition. He was no longer merely the first and ablest servant of\r\nthe Prussian King; he was no longer one in the distinguished series\r\nof Prussian Ministers. His position was--let us recognise it\r\nclearly--greater than that of the King and Emperor, for he was truly the\r\nFather of the State: it was his will which had created and his brain\r\nwhich had devised it; he watched over it with the affection of a father\r\nfor his son; none quite understood it but himself; he alone could\r\nauthoritatively expound the laws of the Constitution. A criticism of it\r\nwas an attack upon himself; opposition to him was scarcely to be\r\ndistinguished from treason to the State. Is it not inevitable that as\r\nyears went on we should find an increasing intolerance of all rivals,\r\nwho wished to alter what he had made, or to take his place as captain of\r\nhis ship, and at the same time a most careful and strict regard for the\r\nloyal fulfilment of the law and spirit of the Constitution? From this\r\ntime all other interests are laid aside, his whole life is absorbed in\r\nthe prosperity of Germany.\r\n\r\nOf course Germany did not at once settle down to political rest; there\r\nwere many difficulties to be overcome on which we cannot enter here. The\r\nmost serious arose from the regulation of the affairs in the conquered\r\nprovinces, and especially in the Kingdom of Hanover. The annexation to\r\nPrussia was very unpopular among all classes except the tradesmen and\r\nmiddle classes of the towns. The Hanoverian deputies to both the\r\nPrussian Parliament and the Parliament of the North German Confederation\r\non principle opposed all measures of the Government. The King himself,\r\nthough in exile, kept up a close connection with his former subjects.\r\nThere were long negotiations regarding his private property. At last it\r\nwas agreed that this should be paid over to him. The King, however, used\r\nthe money for organising a Legion to be used when the time came against\r\nPrussia; it was therefore necessary to cease paying him funds which\r\ncould be used for this purpose. This is the origin of the notorious\r\n_Welfenfond_. The money was to be appropriated for secret service and\r\nespecially for purposes of the Press. The party of the Guelphs, of\r\ncourse, maintained a bitter feud against the Government in their papers.\r\nBismarck, who had had ample experience of this kind of warfare, met them\r\non their own ground.\r\n\r\nHe defended this proposal by drawing attention to one of the weaknesses\r\nof Germany. What other country, he asked, was there where a defeated\r\nparty would look forward to the help of foreign armies? \"There are\r\nunfortunately,\" he said, \"many Coriolani in Germany, only the Volsci are\r\nwanting; if they found their Volsci they would soon be unmasked.\"\r\nEveryone knew that the Volsci from over the Rhine would not be slow to\r\ncome when the occasion offered.\r\n\r\n  \"It was,\" he said, \"a melancholy result of the centuries of\r\n  disunion. There were traitors in the country; they did not hide\r\n  themselves; they carried their heads erect; they found public\r\n  defenders even in the walls of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThen he continued:\r\n\r\n  \"Everywhere where corruption is found there a form of life begins\r\n  which no one can touch with clean kid gloves. In view of these\r\n  facts you speak to me of espionage. In my nature I am not born to\r\n  be a spy, but I believe we deserve your thanks if we condescend\r\n  to follow malignant reptiles into their cave to observe their\r\n  actions.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the origin of the expression \"the _reptile Press,\"_ for the name\r\nwas given by the people not to those against whom the efforts of the\r\nGovernment were directed, but to the paid organs to which, if report is\r\ntrue, so large a portion of the Guelph fund was given.\r\n\r\nBut we must pass on to the events by which the work of 1866 was to be\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTBREAK OF WAR WITH FRANCE.\r\n\r\n1867-1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the conclusion of peace, the danger of a conflict between\r\nFrance and Germany had been apparent. It was not only the growing\r\ndiscontent and suspicion of the French nation and the French army, who\r\ntruly felt that the supremacy of France had been shaken by the growth of\r\nthis new power; it was not only that the deep-rooted hatred of France\r\nwhich prevailed in Germany had been stirred by Napoleon's action, and\r\nthat the Germans had received confidence from the consciousness of their\r\nown strength. Had there been nothing more than this, year after year\r\nmight have gone by and, as has happened since and had happened before, a\r\nwar always anticipated might have been always deferred. We may be sure\r\nthat Bismarck would not have gone to war unless he believed it to be\r\nnecessary and desirable, and he would not have thought this unless there\r\nwas something to be gained. He has often shewn, before and since, that\r\nhe was quite as well able to use his powers in the maintenance of peace\r\nas in creating causes for war. There was, however, one reason which\r\nmade war almost inevitable. The unity of Germany was only half\r\ncompleted; the southern States still existed in a curious state of\r\nsemi-isolation. This could not long continue; their position must be\r\nregulated. War arises from that state of uncertainty which is always\r\npresent when a political community has not found a stable and permanent\r\nconstitution. In Germany men were looking forward to the time when the\r\nsouthern States should join the north. The work was progressing; the\r\ntreaties of offensive and defensive alliance had been followed by the\r\ncreation of a new Customs' Union, and it was a further step when at\r\nBismarck's proposal a Parliament consisting of members elected\r\nthroughout the whole of Germany was summoned at Berlin for the\r\nmanagement of matters connected with the tariff. Further than this,\r\nhowever, he was not able to go; the new Constitution was working well;\r\nthey could risk welcoming the States of the south into it; but this\r\ncould not be done without a war with France. Bismarck had rejected the\r\nFrench proposal for an alliance. He knew, and everyone else knew, that\r\nFrance would oppose by the sword any attempt to complete the unity of\r\nGermany; and, which was more serious, unless great caution was used,\r\nthat she would be supported by Austria and perhaps by the anti-Prussian\r\nparty in Bavaria. There were some who wished to press it forward at\r\nonce. Bismarck was very strongly pressed by the National Liberals to\r\nhasten the union with the south; at the beginning of 1870 the Grand Duke\r\nof Baden, himself a son-in-law of the King of Prussia and always the\r\nchief supporter of Prussian influence in the south, formally applied to\r\nbe admitted into the Federation. The request had to be refused, but\r\nBismarck had some difficulty in defending his position against his\r\nenthusiastic friends. He had to warn them not to hurry; they must not\r\npress the development too quickly. If they did so, they would stir the\r\nresentment of the anti-Prussian party; they would play into the hands of\r\nNapoleon and Austria. But if there was danger in haste, there was equal\r\ndanger in delay; the prestige of Prussia would suffer.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that there was one way in which the union might be brought\r\nabout almost without resistance, and that was, if France were to make an\r\nunprovoked attack upon Germany, an attack so completely without reason\r\nand excuse that the strong national passion it provoked might in the\r\nenthusiasm of war sweep away all minor differences and party feelings.\r\n\r\nThere was another element which we must not omit. These years witnessed\r\nthe growth in determination and in power of the Ultramontane party. We\r\ncan find their influence in every country in Europe; their chief aim was\r\nthe preservation of the temporal power of the Pope and the destruction\r\nof the newly created Kingdom of Italy. They were also opposed to the\r\nunity of Germany under Prussia. They were very active and powerful in\r\nSouth Germany, and at the elections in 1869 had gained a majority. Their\r\nreal object must be to win over the Emperor of the French to a complete\r\nagreement with themselves, to persuade him to forsake his earlier\r\npolicy and to destroy what he had done so much to create. They had a\r\nstrong support in the person of the Empress, and they joined with the\r\ninjured vanity of the French to press the Emperor towards war.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, war had almost broken out on the question of Luxemburg.\r\nNapoleon had attempted to get at least this small extension of\r\nterritory; relying on the support of Prussia he entered into\r\nnegotiations with the King of Holland; the King agreed to surrender the\r\nGrand Duchy to France, making, however, a condition that Napoleon should\r\nsecure the assent of Prussia to this arrangement. At the very last\r\nmoment, when the treaty was almost signed, Bismarck made it clear that\r\nthe national feeling in Germany was so strong that if the transaction\r\ntook place he would have to declare war against France. At the same\r\ntime, he published the secret treaties with the southern States. These\r\nevents destroyed the last hope of maintaining the old friendly relations\r\nwith Napoleon; \"I have been duped,\" said the Emperor, who at once began\r\nreorganising and rearming his forces. For some weeks there was great\r\ndanger of war concerning the right of garrisoning Luxemburg; this had\r\nhitherto belonged to Prussia, but of course with the dissolution of the\r\nGerman Confederation the right had lapsed. The German nation, which was\r\nmuch excited and thought little of the precise terms of treaties, wished\r\nto defend the right; Bismarck knew that in this matter the Prussian\r\nclaim could not be supported; moreover, even if he had wished to go to\r\nwar with France he was not ready; for some time must elapse before the\r\narmy of the North German Confederation could be reorganised on the\r\nPrussian model. He therefore preserved the peace and the matter was\r\nsettled by a European Congress. In the summer of 1867, he visited Paris\r\nwith the King; externally the good relations between the two States were\r\nrestored, but it was in reality only an armed peace.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to decipher Napoleon's wishes; he seems to have believed\r\nthat war was inevitable; there is no proof that he desired it. He made\r\npreparations; the army was reorganised, the numbers increased, and a new\r\nweapon introduced. At the same time he looked about for allies.\r\nNegotiations were carried on with Austria; in 1868 a meeting was\r\narranged between the two Emperors; Beust, who was now Chancellor of the\r\nAustrian Empire, was anxious to make an attempt to overthrow the power\r\nof Prussia in Germany. In 1870, negotiations were entered into for a\r\nmilitary alliance; a special envoy, General Lebrun, was sent to Vienna\r\nto discuss the military arrangements in case of war. No treaty was\r\nsigned, but it was an almost understood thing that sooner or later an\r\nalliance between the two Emperors should be formed against Prussia.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen then that at the beginning of 1870 everything was\r\ntending towards war, and that under certain circumstances war was\r\ndesirable, both for France and for Germany; much seemed to depend on the\r\noccasion of the outbreak. If Prussia took the offensive, if she\r\nattempted by force to win the southern States, she would be faced by a\r\ncoalition of France and Austria, supported only too probably by Bavaria,\r\nand this was a coalition which would find much sympathy among the\r\ndiscontented in North Germany. On the other hand, it was for the\r\nadvantage of Prussia not to delay the conflict: the King was growing\r\nold; Bismarck could never be sure how long he would remain in office;\r\nmoreover, the whole forces of North Germany had now been completely\r\nreorganised and were ready for war, but with the year 1871 it was to be\r\nforeseen that a fresh attempt would be made to reduce their numbers; it\r\nwas desirable to avoid a fresh conflict on the military budget;\r\neverything shews that 1870 was the year in which it would be most\r\nconvenient for Prussia to fight.\r\n\r\nPrussia, at this time, had no active allies on whom she could depend;\r\nBismarck indeed had secured the neutrality of Russia, but he did not\r\nknow that the Czar would come actively to his help; we may feel sure\r\nthat he would prefer not to have to call upon Russia for assistance,\r\nfor, as we have seen in older days, a war between France and Russia, in\r\nwhich Germany joined, would be very harmful to Germany. It was in these\r\ncircumstances that an opportunity shewed itself of gaining another ally\r\nwho would be more subservient than Russia. One of the many revolutions\r\nwhich had harassed Spain during this century had broken out. Queen\r\nIsabella had lost the throne, and General Prim found himself obliged to\r\nlook about for a new sovereign. He applied in vain to all the Catholic\r\nCourts; nobody was anxious to accept an honour coupled with such danger\r\nas ruling over the Spanish people. Among others he applied to Leopold,\r\nhereditary Prince of Hohenzollern, eldest son of that Prince of\r\nHohenzollern who a few years before had been President of the Prussian\r\nMinistry. The choice seemed a good one: the Prince was an amiable,\r\ncourageous man; he was a Catholic; he was, moreover, connected with the\r\nNapoleonic family. His brother had, three years before, been appointed\r\nKing of Roumania with Napoleon's good-will.\r\n\r\nThe proposal was probably made in all good faith; under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, the Prince, had he been willing to accept, would have\r\nbeen a very proper candidate. It was, however, known from the first that\r\nNapoleon would not give his consent, and, according to the comity of\r\nEurope, he had a right to be consulted. Nor can we say that Napoleon was\r\nnot justified in opposing the appointment. It has indeed been said that\r\nthe Prince was not a member of the Prussian Royal House and that his\r\nconnection with Napoleon was really closer than that with the King of\r\nPrussia. This is true, but to lay stress on it is to ignore the very\r\nremarkable voluntary connection which united the two branches of the\r\nHouse of Hohenzollern. The Prince's father had done what no sovereign\r\nprince in Germany has ever done before or since: out of loyalty to\r\nPrussia he had surrendered his position as sovereign ruler and presented\r\nhis dominions to the King of Prussia; he had on this occasion been\r\nadopted into the Royal Family; he had formally recognised the King as\r\nHead of the House, and subjected himself to his authority. More than\r\nthis, he had even condescended to accept the position of Prussian\r\nMinister. Was not Napoleon justified if he feared that the son of a man\r\nwho had shewn so great an affection to Prussia would not be an agreeable\r\nneighbour on the throne of Spain?\r\n\r\nIt was in the early spring of 1869 that the first proposals were made to\r\nthe Prince; our information as to this is very defective, but it seems\r\nthat they were at once rejected. Benedetti's suspicions were, however,\r\naroused. He heard that a Spanish diplomatist, who had formerly been\r\nAmbassador at Berlin, had again visited the city and had had two\r\ninterviews with Bismarck. He feared that perhaps he had some mission\r\nwith regard to the Hohenzollern candidature, and, in accordance with\r\ninstructions from his Government, enquired first of Thiele and, after a\r\nvisit to Paris, saw Bismarck himself. The Count was quite ready to\r\ndiscuss the matter; with great frankness he explained all the reasons\r\nwhy, if the throne were offered to the Prince, the King would doubtless\r\nadvise him not to accept it. Benedetti was still suspicious, but for the\r\ntime the matter dropped. From what happened later, though we have no\r\nproof, we must, I think, share his suspicion that Bismarck was already\r\nconsidering the proposal and was prepared to lend it his support.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year, the affair began to advance. Prim sent\r\nSalazar, a Spanish gentleman, to Germany with a semi-official commission\r\nto invite the Prince to become a candidate, and gave him a letter to a\r\nGerman acquaintance who would procure him an introduction to the\r\nPrince. This German acquaintance was no other than Herr von Werther,\r\nPrussian Ambassador at Vienna. If we remember the very strict discipline\r\nwhich Bismarck maintained in the Diplomatic Service we must feel\r\nconvinced that Werther was acting according to instructions.[9] He\r\nbrought the envoy to the Prince of Hohenzollern; the very greatest\r\ncaution was taken to preserve secrecy; the Spaniard did not go directly\r\nto the castle of Weinburg, but left the train at another station, waited\r\nin the town till it was dark, and only approached the castle when hidden\r\nfrom observation by night and a thick mist. He first of all asked Prince\r\nCharles himself to accept the throne, and when he refused, offered it to\r\nPrince Leopold, who also, though he did not refuse point-blank, left no\r\ndoubt that he was disinclined to the proposal; he could only accept, he\r\nsaid, if the Spanish Government procured the assent of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon and the King of Prussia. Notwithstanding the reluctance of the\r\nfamily to take the proffered dignity, Herr von Werther (and we must look\r\non him as Bismarck's agent[9]) a fortnight later travelled from Munich\r\nin order to press on the Prince of Roumania that he should use his\r\ninfluence not to allow the House of Hohenzollern to refuse the throne.\r\nFor the time, however, the subject seems to have dropped. A few months\r\nlater, for the third time, the offer was repeated, and now Bismarck uses\r\nthe whole of his influence in its favour. At the end of February,\r\nSalazar came on an official mission to Berlin; he had three letters,\r\none to the King, one to Bismarck, one to the Prince. The King refused to\r\nreceive him; Prince Leopold did not waver in his refusal and was\r\nsupported by his father; their attitude was that they should not\r\nconsider the matter seriously unless higher reasons of State required\r\nit. With Prince Bismarck, however, the envoy was more successful; he had\r\nseveral interviews with the Minister, and then left the city in order\r\nthat suspicions might not be aroused or the attention of the French\r\nGovernment directed to the negotiations. Bismarck pleaded with great\r\nwarmth for the acceptance of the offer; in a memoir to the King, he\r\ndwelt on the great importance which the summons of a Hohenzollern prince\r\nto the Spanish throne would have for Germany; it would be politically\r\ninvaluable to have a friendly land in the rear of France; it would be of\r\nthe greatest economic advantage for Germany and Spain if this thoroughly\r\nmonarchical country developed its resources under a king of German\r\ndescent. In consequence of this, a conference was held at Berlin, at\r\nwhich there were present, besides the King, the Crown Prince, Prince\r\nCarl Anton, and Prince Leopold, Bismarck, Roon, Moltke, Schleinitz,\r\nThiele, and Delbrück. By summoning the advice of these men, the matter\r\nwas taken out of the range of a private and family matter; it is true\r\nthat it was not officially brought before the Prussian Ministry, but\r\nthose consulted were the men by whom the policy of the State was\r\ndirected. The unanimous decision of the councillors was for acceptance\r\non the ground that it was the fulfilment of a patriotic duty to\r\nPrussia. The Crown Prince saw great difficulties in the way, and warned\r\nhis cousin, if he accepted, not to rely on Prussian help in the future,\r\neven if, for the attainment of a definite end, the Prussian Government\r\nfurthered the project for the moment. The King did not agree with his\r\nMinisters; he had many serious objections, and refused to give any\r\ndefinite order to the Prince that he should accept the offer; he left\r\nthe final decision to him. He eventually refused.\r\n\r\nBismarck, however, was not to be beaten; he insisted that the\r\nHohenzollerns should not let the matter drop; and, as he could not\r\npersuade the King to use his authority, acted directly upon the family\r\nwith such success that Prince Carl Anton telegraphed to his third son,\r\nFrederick, to ask if he would not accept instead of his brother.\r\nBismarck had now declared that the acceptance by one of the Princes was\r\na political necessity; this he said repeatedly and with the greatest\r\nemphasis. At the same time, he despatched a Prussian officer of the\r\ngeneral staff and his private secretary, Lothar Bucher, to Spain in\r\norder that they might study the situation. It was important that as far\r\nas possible the official representative of Prussia should have no share\r\nin the arrangement of this matter.\r\n\r\nPrince Frederick came to Berlin, but, like his brother, he refused,\r\nunless the King gave a command. At the end of April, the negotiations\r\nseemed again to have broken down. Bismarck, who was in ill health, left\r\nBerlin for Varzin, where he remained for six weeks.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, not surprised, since we know that Bismarck's interest\r\nwas so strongly engaged, that he was able after all to carry the matter\r\nthrough. He seems to have persuaded Prince Carl Anton; he then wrote to\r\nPrim telling him not to despair; the candidature was an excellent thing\r\nwhich was not to be lost sight of; he must, however, negotiate not with\r\nthe Prussian Government, but with the Prince himself. When he wrote this\r\nhe knew that he had at last succeeded in breaking down the reluctance of\r\nthe Prince, and that the King, though he still was unwilling to\r\nundertake any responsibility, would not refuse his consent if the Prince\r\nvoluntarily accepted. Prince Leopold was influenced not only by his\r\ninterest in the Spanish race, but also by a letter from Bismarck, in\r\nwhich he said that he ought to put aside all scruples and accept in the\r\ninterests of Prussia. The envoys had also returned from Spain and\r\nbrought back a favourable report; they received an extraordinarily\r\nhearty welcome; we may perhaps suspect with the King that they had\r\nallowed their report to receive too rosy a colour; no doubt, however,\r\nthey were acting in accordance with what they knew were the wishes of\r\nthe man who had sent them out. In the beginning of June the decision was\r\nmade; Prince Leopold wrote to the King that he accepted the crown which\r\nhad been offered to him, since he thereby hoped to do a great service to\r\nhis Fatherland. King William immediately answered that he approved of\r\nthe decision.\r\n\r\nBismarck then at last was successful. A few days later Don Salazar again\r\ntravelled to Germany; this time he brought a formal offer, which was\r\nformally-accepted. The Cortes were then in session; it was arranged that\r\nthey should remain at Madrid till his return; the election would then be\r\nat once completed, for a majority was assured. The secrecy had been\r\nstrictly maintained; there were rumours indeed, but no one knew of all\r\nthe secret interviews; men might suspect, but they could not prove that\r\nit was an intrigue of Bismarck. If the election had once been made the\r\nsolemn act of the whole nation, Napoleon would have been confronted with\r\na _fait accompli_. To have objected would have been most injurious; he\r\nwould have had to do, not with Prussia, which apparently was not\r\nconcerned, but with the Spanish nation. The feeling of France would not\r\nallow him to acquiesce in the election, but it would have deeply\r\noffended the dignity and pride of Spain had he claimed that the King who\r\nhad been formally accepted should, at his demand, be rejected. He could\r\nscarcely have done so without bringing about a war; a war with Spain\r\nwould have crippled French resources and diverted their attention from\r\nPrussia; even if a war did not ensue, permanent ill feeling would be\r\ncreated. It is not difficult to understand the motives by which Bismarck\r\nhad been influenced. At the last moment the plan failed. A cipher\r\ntelegram from Berlin was misinterpreted in Madrid; and in consequence\r\nthe Cortes, instead of remaining in session, were prorogued till the\r\nautumn. All had depended on the election being carried out before the\r\nsecret was disclosed; a delay of some weeks must take place, and some\r\nindiscreet words of Salazar disclosed the truth. General Prim had no\r\ncourse left him but to send to the French Ambassador, to give him\r\nofficial information as to what had been done and try to calm his\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nWhat were Bismarck's motives in this affair? It is improbable that he\r\nintended to use it as a means of bringing about a war with France. He\r\ncould not possibly have foreseen the very remarkable series of events\r\nwhich were to follow, and but for them a war arising out of this would\r\nhave been very unwise, for German public opinion and the sympathy of all\r\nthe neutral Powers would have been opposed to Prussia, had it appeared\r\nthat the Government was disturbing the peace of Europe simply in order\r\nto put a Prussian prince on the throne of Spain contrary to the wishes\r\nof France. He could not ignore German public opinion now as he had done\r\nin old days; he did not want to conquer South Germany, he wished to\r\nattract it. It seems much more probable that he had no very clear\r\nconception of the results which would follow; he did not wish to lose\r\nwhat might be the means of gaining an ally to Germany and weakening\r\nFrance. It would be quite invaluable if, supposing there were to be war\r\n(arising from this or other causes), Spain could be persuaded to join in\r\nthe attack on France and act the part which Italy had played in 1866.\r\nWhat he probably hoped for more than anything else was that France would\r\ndeclare war against Spain; then Napoleon would waste his strength in a\r\nnew Mexico; he would no longer be a danger to Germany, and whether\r\nGermany joined in the war or not, she would gain a free hand by the\r\npreoccupation of France. If none of these events happened, it would be\r\nan advantage that some commercial gain might be secured for Germany.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the affair is not one which shews his strongest points as\r\na diplomatist; it was too subtle and too hazardous.\r\n\r\nThe news aroused the sleeping jealousy of Prussia among the French\r\npeople; the suspicion and irritation of the Government was extreme, and\r\nthis feeling was not ill-founded. They assumed that the whole matter was\r\nan intrigue of Bismarck's, though, owing to the caution with which the\r\nnegotiations had been conducted, they had no proofs. They might argue\r\nthat a Prussian prince could not accept such an offer without the\r\npermission of his sovereign, and they had a great cause of complaint\r\nthat this permission had been given without any communication with\r\nNapoleon, whom the matter so nearly concerned. The arrangement itself\r\nwas not alone the cause of alarm. The secrecy with which it had been\r\nsurrounded was interpreted as a sign of malevolence.\r\n\r\nOf course they must interfere to prevent the election being completed.\r\nWhere, however, were they to address themselves? With a just instinct\r\nthey directed their remonstrance, not to Madrid, but to Berlin; they\r\nwould thereby appear not to be interfering with the independence of the\r\nSpaniards, but to be acting in self-defence against the insidious\r\nadvance of German power.\r\n\r\nThey could not, however, approach Bismarck; he had retired to Varzin,\r\nto recruit his health; the other Ministers also were absent; the King\r\nwas at Ems. It was convenient that at this sudden crisis they should be\r\naway, for it was imperative that the Prussian Government should deny all\r\ncomplicity. Bismarck must not let it appear that he had any interest in,\r\nor knowledge of, the matter; he therefore remained in the seclusion of\r\nPomerania.\r\n\r\nBenedetti also was absent in the Black Forest. On the 4th of July,\r\ntherefore, the French _Chargé d'Affaires,_ M. de Sourds, called at the\r\nForeign Office and saw Herr von Thiele. \"Visibly embarrassed,\" he\r\nwrites, \"he told me that the Prussian Government was absolutely ignorant\r\nof the matter and that it did not exist for them.\" This was the only\r\nanswer to be got; in a despatch sent on the 11th to the Prussian agents\r\nin Germany, Bismarck repeated the assertion. \"The matter has nothing to\r\ndo with Prussia. The Prussian Government has always considered and\r\ntreated this affair as one in which Spain and the selected candidate are\r\nalone concerned.\" This was literally true, for it had never been brought\r\nbefore the Prussian Ministry, and no doubt the records of the office\r\nwould contain no allusion to it; the majority of the Ministers were\r\nabsolutely ignorant of it.\r\n\r\nOf course M. de Sourds did not believe Herr von Thiele's statement, and\r\nhis Government was not satisfied with the explanation; the excitement in\r\nParis was increasing; it was fomented by the agents of the Ministry, and\r\nin answer to an interpolation in the Chamber, the Duc de Grammont on the\r\n6th declared that the election of the Prince was inadmissible; he\r\ntrusted to the wisdom of the Prussian and the friendship of the Spanish\r\npeople not to proceed in it, but if his hope were frustrated they would\r\nknow how to do their duty. They were not obliged to endure that a\r\nforeign Power by setting one of its Princes on the throne of Charles V.\r\nshould destroy the balance of power and endanger the interests and\r\nhonour of France. He hoped this would not happen; they relied on the\r\nwisdom of the German and the friendship of the Spanish people to avoid\r\nit; but if it were necessary, then, strong in the support of the nation\r\nand the Chamber, they knew how to fulfil their duty without hesitation\r\nor weakness.\r\n\r\nThe French Ministry hereby publicly declared that they held the Prussian\r\nGovernment responsible for the election, and they persisted in demanding\r\nthe withdrawal, not from Spain, but from Prussia; Prim had suggested\r\nthat as the Foreign Office refused to discuss the matter, Grammont\r\nshould approach the King personally. Benedetti received instructions to\r\ngo to the King at Ems and request him to order or advise the Prince to\r\nwithdraw. At first Grammont wished him also to see the Prince himself;\r\non second thoughts he forbade this, for, as he said, it was of the first\r\nimportance that the messages should be conveyed by the King; he was\r\ndetermined to use the opportunity for the humiliation of Germany.\r\n\r\nIf it was the desire of the French in this way to establish the\r\ncomplicity of Prussia, it was imperative that the Prussian Government\r\nshould not allow them to do so. They were indeed in a disagreeable\r\nsituation; they could not take up the French challenge and allow war to\r\nbreak out; not only would the feeling of the neutral Powers, of England\r\nand of Russia, be against them, but that of Germany itself would be\r\ndivided. With what force would the anti-Prussian party in Bavaria and\r\nWurtemberg be able to oppose a war undertaken apparently for the\r\ndynastic interests of the Hohenzollern! If, however, the Prince now\r\nwithdrew, the French would be able to proclaim that he had done so in\r\nconsequence of the open threats of France; supposing they were able to\r\nconnect the King in any way with him, then they might assert that they\r\nhad checked the ambition of Prussia; Prussian prestige would be\r\nseriously injured at home, and distrust of Prussian good faith would be\r\naroused abroad.\r\n\r\nThe King therefore had a difficult task when Benedetti asked for an\r\ninterview. He had been brought into this situation against his own will,\r\nand his former scruples seemed fully justified. He complained of the\r\nviolence of the French Press and the Ministry; he repeated the assertion\r\nthat the Prussian Government had been unconnected with the negotiations\r\nand had been ignorant of them; he had avoided associating himself with\r\nthem, and had only given an opinion when Prince Leopold, having decided\r\nto accept, asked his consent. He had then acted, not in his sovereign\r\ncapacity as King of Prussia, but as head of the family. He had neither\r\ncollected nor summoned his council of Ministers, though he had informed\r\nCount Bismarck privately. He refused to use his authority to order the\r\nPrince to withdraw, and said that he would leave him full freedom as he\r\nhad done before.\r\n\r\nThese statements were of course verbally true; probably the King did not\r\nknow to what extent Bismarck was responsible for the acceptance by the\r\nPrince. They did not make the confidence of the French any greater; it\r\nwas now apparent that the King had been asked, and had given his consent\r\nwithout considering the effect on France; they could not acquiesce in\r\nthis distinction between his acts as sovereign and his acts as head of\r\nthe family, for, as Benedetti pointed out, he was only head of the\r\nfamily because he was sovereign.\r\n\r\nAll this time Bismarck was still at Varzin; while Paris was full of\r\nexcitement, while there were hourly conferences of the Ministers and the\r\ncity was already talking of war, the Prussian Ministers ostentatiously\r\ncontinued to enjoy their holidays. There was no danger in doing so; the\r\narmy was so well prepared that they could afford quietly to await what\r\nthe French would do. What Bismarck's plans and hopes were we do not\r\nknow; during these days he preserved silence; the violence of the French\r\ngave him a further reason for refusing to enter into any discussion.\r\nWhen, however, he heard of Benedetti's visit to Ems he became uneasy; he\r\nfeared that the King would compromise himself; he feared that the French\r\nwould succeed in their endeavour to inflict a diplomatic defeat on\r\nPrussia. He proposed to go to Ems to support the King, and on the 12th\r\nleft Varzin; that night he arrived in Berlin. There he received the news\r\nthat the Prince of Hohenzollern, on behalf of his son, had announced\r\nhis withdrawal.\r\n\r\nThe retirement was probably the spontaneous act of the Prince and his\r\nfather; the decisive influence was the fear lest the enmity of Napoleon\r\nmight endanger the position of the Prince of Roumania. Everyone was\r\ndelighted; the cloud of war was dispelled; two men only were\r\ndissatisfied--Bismarck and Grammont. It was the severest check which\r\nBismarck's policy had yet received; he had persuaded the Prince to\r\naccept against his will; he had persuaded the King reluctantly to keep\r\nthe negotiations secret from Napoleon; however others might disguise the\r\ntruth, he knew that they had had to retreat from an untenable position,\r\nand retreat before the noisy insults of the French Press and the open\r\nmenace of the French Government; his anger was increased by the fact\r\nthat neither the King nor the Prince had in this crisis acted as he\r\nwould have wished.\r\n\r\nWe have no authoritative statement as to the course he himself would\r\nhave pursued; he had, according to his own statement, advised the King\r\nnot to receive the French Ambassador; probably he wished that the Prince\r\nshould declare that as the Spaniards had offered him the crown and he\r\nhad accepted it, he could not now withdraw unless he were asked to do so\r\nby Spain; the attempt of Grammont to fasten a quarrel on Prussia would\r\nhave been deprived of any responsible pretext; he would have been\r\ncompelled to bring pressure to bear on the Spaniards, with all the\r\ndangers that that course would involve. We may suspect that he had\r\nadvised this course and that his advice had been rejected. However this\r\nmay be, Bismarck felt the reverse so keenly that it seemed to him\r\nimpossible he could any longer remain Minister, unless he could obtain\r\nredress for the insults and menaces of France. What prospect was there\r\nnow of this? It was no use now going on to Ems; he proposed to return\r\nnext day to Varzin, and he expected that when he did so he would be once\r\nmore a private man.\r\n\r\nHe was to be saved by the folly of the French. Grammont, vain, careless,\r\nand inaccurate, carried away by his hatred of Prussia, hot-headed and\r\nblustering, did not even see how great an advantage he had gained. When\r\nGuizot, now a very old man, living in retirement, heard that the Prince\r\nhad withdrawn, he exclaimed: \"What good fortune these people have! This\r\nis the finest diplomatic victory which has been won in my lifetime.\"\r\nThis is indeed the truth; how easy it would have been to declare that\r\nFrance had spoken and her wishes had been fulfilled! the Government need\r\nhave said no more, but every Frenchman would have always told the story\r\nhow Bismarck had tried to put a Hohenzollern on the throne of Spain, had\r\nbeen foiled by the word of the Emperor, and had been driven from office.\r\nGrammont prepared to complete the humiliation of Prussia, and in doing\r\nso he lost all and more than all he had won.\r\n\r\nHe had at first declared that the withdrawal of the Prince was worthless\r\nwhen it was officially communicated to him by Prussia; now he extended\r\nhis demands. He suggested to the Prussian Ambassador at Paris that the\r\nKing should write to the Emperor a letter, in which he should express\r\nhis regret for what had happened and his assurance that he had had no\r\nintention of injuring France. To Benedetti he telegraphed imperative\r\norders that he was to request from the King a guarantee for the future,\r\nand a promise that he would never again allow the Prince to return to\r\nthe candidature. It was to give himself over to an implacable foe. As\r\nsoon as Bismarck heard from Werther of the first suggestion, he\r\ntelegraphed to him a stern reprimand for having listened to demands so\r\nprejudicial to the honour of his master, and ordered him, under the\r\npretext of ill health, to depart from Paris and leave a post for which\r\nhe had shewn himself so ill-suited.\r\n\r\nThat same morning he saw Lord Augustus Loftus, and he explained that the\r\nincident was not yet closed; Germany, he said, did not wish for war, but\r\nthey did not fear it. They were not called on to endure humiliations\r\nfrom France; after what had happened they must have some security for\r\nthe future; the Duc de Grammont must recall or explain the language he\r\nhad used; France had begun to prepare for war and that would not be\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n  \"It is clear,\" writes the English Ambassador, \"that Count\r\n  Bismarck and the Prussian Ministry regret the attitude which the\r\n  King has shewn to Count Benedetti, and feel, in regard to public\r\n  opinion, the necessity of guarding the honour of the nation.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Crown Prince, who had come to Berlin, Bismarck was more open; he\r\ndeclared that war was necessary.\r\n\r\nThis very day there were taking place at Ems events which were to give\r\nhim the opportunity for which he longed. On Benedetti had fallen the\r\ntask of presenting the new demands to the King; it was one of the most\r\nungrateful of the many unpleasant duties which had been entrusted to him\r\nduring the last few years. In the early morning, he went out in the hope\r\nthat he might see someone of the Court; he met the King, himself who was\r\ntaking the waters. The King at once beckoned to him, entered into\r\nconversation, and shewed him a copy of the _Cologne Gazette_ containing\r\nthe statement of the Prince's withdrawal. Benedetti then, as in duty\r\nbound, asked permission to inform his Government that the King would\r\nundertake that the candidature should not be resumed at any time. The\r\nKing, of course, refused, and, when Benedetti pressed the request,\r\nrepeated the refusal with some emphasis, and then, beckoning to his\r\nadjutant, who had withdrawn a few paces, broke off the conversation.\r\nWhen a few hours later the King received a letter from the Prince of\r\nHohenzollern confirming the public statement, he sent a message to\r\nBenedetti by his aide-decamp, Count Radziwill, and added to it that\r\nthere would now be nothing further to say, as the incident was closed.\r\nBenedetti twice asked for another interview, but it was refused.\r\n\r\nHe had done his duty, he had made his request, as he expected, in vain,\r\nbut between him and the King there had been no departure by word or\r\ngesture from the ordinary courtesy which we should expect from these\r\ntwo accomplished gentlemen. All the proceedings indeed had been unusual,\r\nfor it was not the habit of the King, as it was of Napoleon, to receive\r\nforeign envoys except on the advice of his Ministers, and the last\r\nconversation had taken place on the public promenade of the fashionable\r\nwatering-place; but the exception had been explained and justified by\r\nthe theory that the King's interest in the affair was domestic and not\r\npolitical. Both were anxious to avoid war, and the King to the last\r\ntreated Benedetti with marked graciousness; he had while at Ems invited\r\nhim to the royal table, and even now, the next morning before leaving\r\nEms, granted him an audience, at the station to take leave.\r\nNevertheless, he had been seriously annoyed by this fresh demand; he was\r\npained and surprised by the continuance of the French menaces; he could\r\nnot but fear that there was a deliberate intention to force a quarrel on\r\nhim. He determined, therefore, to return to Berlin, and ordered Abeken,\r\nSecretary to the Foreign Office, who was with him, to telegraph to\r\nBismarck an account of what had taken place, with a suggestion that the\r\nfacts should be published.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Bismarck, when the telegram arrived, was dining with\r\nRoon and Moltke, who had both been summoned to Berlin. The three men\r\nwere gloomy and depressed; they felt that their country had been\r\nhumiliated, and they saw no prospect of revenge. This feeling was\r\nincreased when Bismarck read aloud the telegram to his two colleagues.\r\nThese repeated and impatient demands, this intrusion on the King's\r\nprivacy, this ungenerous playing with his kindly and pacific\r\ndisposition, stirred their deepest indignation; to them it seemed that\r\nBenedetti had been treated with a consideration he did not deserve; the\r\nman who came with these proposals should have been repulsed with more\r\nmarked indignation. But in the suggestion that the facts should be\r\npublished, Bismarck saw the opportunity he had wished. He went into the\r\nnext room and drafted a statement; he kept to the very words of the\r\noriginal telegram, but he left out much, and arranged it so that it\r\nshould convey to the reader the impression, not of what had really\r\noccurred, but of what he would have wished should happen. With this he\r\nreturned, and as he read it to them, Roon and Moltke brightened; here at\r\nlast was an answer to the French insults; before, it sounded like a\r\n\"Chamade\" (a retreat), now it is a \"Fanfare,\" said Moltke. \"That is\r\nbetter,\" said Roon. Bismarck asked a few questions about the army. Roon\r\nassured him that all was prepared; Moltke, that, though no one could\r\never foretell with certainty the result of a great war, he looked to it\r\nwith confidence; they all knew that with the publication of this\r\nstatement the last prospect of peace would be gone. It was published\r\nlate that night in a special edition of the _North German Gazette_, and\r\nat the same time a copy was sent from the Foreign Office to all German\r\nembassies and legations.\r\n\r\nIt is not altogether correct to call this (as has often been done) a\r\nfalsification of the telegram. Under no circumstances could Bismarck\r\nhave published in its original form the confidential message to him\r\nfrom his sovereign; all he had to do was to communicate to the\r\nnewspapers the facts of which he had been informed, or so much of the\r\nfacts as it seemed to him desirable that the public should know. He, of\r\ncourse, made the selection in such a form as to produce upon public\r\nopinion the particular effect which for the purposes of his policy he\r\nwished. What to some extent justifies the charge is that the altered\r\nversion was published under the heading, \"Ems.\" The official statement\r\nwas supplemented by another notice in the _North German Gazette_, which\r\nwas printed in large type, and stated that Benedetti had so far\r\nforgotten all diplomatic etiquette that he had allowed himself to\r\ndisturb the King in his holidays, to intercept him on the promenade, and\r\nto attempt to force demands upon him. This was untrue, but on this point\r\nthe telegram to Bismarck had been itself incorrect. Besides this,\r\nBismarck doubtless saw to it that the right instructions should be given\r\nto the writers for the Press.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, this was hardly necessary; the statement itself was a call\r\nto arms. During all these days the German people had been left almost\r\nwithout instruction or guidance from the Government; they had heard with\r\nastonishment the sudden outbreak of Gallic wrath; they were told, and\r\nwere inclined to believe it, that the Prussian Government was innocent\r\nof the hostile designs attributed to it; and the calm of the Government\r\nhad communicated itself to them. They remained quiet, but they were\r\nstill uneasy, they knew not what to think; now all doubt was removed.\r\nIt was then true that with unexampled eagerness the French had fastened\r\nan alien quarrel upon them, had without excuse or justification advanced\r\nfrom insult to insult and menace to menace; and now, to crown their\r\nunparalleled acts, they had sent this foreigner to intrude on the\r\nreserve of the aged King, and to insult him publicly in his own country.\r\nThen false reports came from Ems; it was said that the King had publicly\r\nturned his back on Benedetti on the promenade, that the Ambassador had\r\nfollowed the King to his house, and had at last been shewn the door, but\r\nthat even then he had not scrupled again to intrude on the King at the\r\nrailway station.[10] From one end of Germany to another a storm of\r\nindignation arose; they had had enough of this French annoyance; if the\r\nFrench wished for war then war should they have; now there could no\r\nlonger be talk of Prussian ambition; all differences of North and South\r\nwere swept away; wherever the German tongue was spoken men felt that\r\nthey had been insulted in the person of the King, that it was theirs to\r\nprotect his honour, and from that day he reigned in their hearts as\r\nuncrowned Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe telegram was as successful in France as in Germany. There the\r\nquestion of peace and war was still in debate; there was a majority for\r\npeace, and indeed there was no longer an excuse for war which would\r\nsatisfy even a Frenchman. Then there came in quick succession the\r\nrecall and disavowment of the Prussian Ambassador, news of the serious\r\nlanguage Bismarck had used to Lord A. Loftus, and then despatches from\r\nother Courts that an official message had been sent from Berlin carrying\r\nthe record of an insult offered to the King by the French Ambassador;\r\nadd to this the changed tone of the German Press, the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich the French challenge had been taken up; they could have no doubt\r\nthat they had gone too far; they would now be not the accuser but the\r\naccused; had they wished, they did not dare retreat with the fear of the\r\nParis mob before them, and so they decided on war, and on the 15th the\r\nofficial statement was made and approved in the Chamber.\r\n\r\nIt was on this same day that the King travelled from Ems to Berlin. When\r\nhe left Ems he still refused to believe in the serious danger of war,\r\nbut as he travelled north and saw the excited crowd that thronged to\r\nmeet him at every station his own belief was almost overthrown. To his\r\nsurprise, when he reached Brandenburg he found Bismarck and the Crown\r\nPrince awaiting him; the news that they had come to meet the King was\r\nitself looked on almost as a declaration of war; all through the return\r\njourney Bismarck unsuccessfully tried to persuade his master to give the\r\norder for mobilisation. When they reached Berlin they found the station\r\nagain surrounded by a tumultuous throng; through it pressed one of the\r\nsecretaries of the Foreign Office; he brought the news that the order\r\nfor mobilisation had been given in France. Then, at last, the\r\nreluctance of the King was broken down; he gave the order, and at once\r\nthe Crown Prince, who was standing near, proclaimed the news to all\r\nwithin earshot. The North German Parliament was summoned, and five days\r\nlater Bismarck was able to announce to them that he had received the\r\nDeclaration of War from France, adding as he did so that this was the\r\nfirst official communication which throughout the whole affair he had\r\nreceived from the French Government, a circumstance for which there was\r\nno precedent in history.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast is there between the two countries! On the one hand, a\r\nKing and a Minister who by seven years of loyal co-operation have learnt\r\nto trust and depend upon one another, who together have faced danger,\r\nwho have not shrunk from extreme unpopularity, and who, just for this\r\nreason, can now depend on the absolute loyalty of the people. On the\r\nother side, the Emperor broken in health, his will shattered by\r\nprolonged pain and sickness, trying by the introduction of liberal\r\ninstitutions to free himself from the burden of government and weight of\r\nresponsibility which he had voluntarily taken upon his shoulders. At\r\nBerlin, Bismarck's severity and love of power had brought it about that\r\nthe divergent policy and uncertainty of early years had ceased; there\r\nwas one mind and one will directing this State; the unauthorised\r\ninterference and amateur criticism of courtiers were no longer\r\npermitted. In France, all the evils from which Prussia had been freed by\r\nBismarck were increasing; here there was no single will; the Ministry\r\nwere divided, there was no authority over them; no one could foresee by\r\nwhom the decision of the Emperor would be determined; the deliberate\r\nresults of long and painful negotiations might be overthrown in ten\r\nminutes by the interference of the Empress or the advice of Prince\r\nNapoleon. The Emperor would pursue half a dozen inconsistent policies in\r\nas many hours. And then, below all, there was this fatal fact, that\r\nNapoleon could not venture to be unpopular. He knew the folly of the\r\ncourse into which he was being driven, but he did not dare to face the\r\nmob of Paris, or to defy the Chamber of Deputies. He owed his throne to\r\nuniversal suffrage, and he knew that the people who had set him up could\r\nquickly overthrow him. No man can ever govern who fears unpopularity.\r\nBismarck did not, Napoleon did.\r\n\r\nBefore the campaign began, two events took place which we must record.\r\nThe first was the publication in the _Times_ of the text of the treaty\r\nwith France regarding Belgium. We need not add anything further to what\r\nwe have said regarding it; published at this moment it had a great\r\neffect on English public opinion. The other arose out of the opposition\r\nwhich the exiled King of Hanover had continued to maintain. He had used\r\nthe very large sums of money which he possessed to keep together a\r\nHanoverian Legion, recruited from former officers and soldiers of the\r\nHanoverian army. He had hoped that war would break out before this and\r\nwould be accompanied by a rising in Hanover. His means had now come to\r\nan end, and the unfortunate men were living in Paris almost without\r\nsupport. They were now exposed to a terrible alternative. They could not\r\nreturn to Germany; they did not wish to take part in a war on the French\r\nside. Their only hope was emigration to America. Bismarck heard of their\r\nposition; he offered to pardon them all and to pay to them from the\r\nPrussian funds the full pension which they would have received had they\r\ncontinued to serve in the Hanoverian army. It was a timely act of\r\ngenerosity, and it had the effect that the last element of hostility in\r\nGermany was stilled and the whole nation could unite as one man in this\r\nforeign war.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In this chapter, besides the ordinary authorities, I have\r\ndepended largely on the memoirs of the King of Roumania. Bismarck, in\r\nhis own memoirs, states that the writer was not accurately informed; but\r\neven if there are some errors in detail, the remarkable statements\r\ncontained in this work must command belief until they are fully\r\ncontradicted and disproved. There has, I believe, been no attempt to do\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR WITH FRANCE AND FOUNDATION OF THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n1870-1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 1870, Bismarck left Berlin with the King for the seat of\r\nwar, for, as in 1866, he was to accompany the army in the field. For the\r\nnext few months indeed Germany was to be governed from the soil of\r\nFrance, and it was necessary for the Minister to be constantly with the\r\nKing. Bismarck never forgot that he was a soldier; he was more proud of\r\nhis general's uniform than of his civil rank, and, though not a\r\ncombatant, it was his pride and pleasure that he should share something\r\nof the hardships and dangers of war. He was as a matter of fact never so\r\nwell as during the campaign: the early hours, the moderate and at times\r\nmeagre food, the long hours in the saddle and the open air, restored the\r\nnerves and health which had been injured by the annoyances of office,\r\nlate hours, and prolonged sedentary work. He was accompanied by part of\r\nthe staff of the Foreign Office, and many of the distinguished strangers\r\nwho followed the army were often guests at his table; he especially\r\nshewed his old friendliness for Americans: General Sheridan and many\r\nothers of his countrymen found a hearty welcome from the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the 17th of August that the headquarters came up with\r\nthe fighting front of the army; but the next day, during the decisive\r\nbattle of Gravelotte, Bismarck watched the combat by the side of the\r\nKing, and, as at Königgrätz, they more than once came under fire. At one\r\nperiod, Bismarck was in considerable danger of being taken prisoner. His\r\ntwo sons were serving in the army; they were dragoons in the Cuirassiers\r\nof the Guards, serving in the ranks in the same regiment whose uniform\r\ntheir father was entitled to wear. They both took part in the terrible\r\ncavalry charge at Mars-la-Tour, in which their regiment suffered so\r\nseverely; the eldest, Count Herbert, was wounded and had to be invalided\r\nhome. Bismarck could justly boast that there was no nepotism in the\r\nPrussian Government when his two sons were serving as privates. It was\r\nnot till the war had gone on some weeks and they had taken part in many\r\nengagements, that they received their commissions. This would have\r\nhappened in no other country or army. This was the true equality, so\r\ndifferent from the exaggerated democracy of France,--an equality not of\r\nprivilege but of obligation; every Pomeranian peasant who sent his son\r\nto fight and die in France knew that the sons of the most powerful man\r\nin the country and in Europe were fighting with them not as officers but\r\nas comrades. Bismarck was more fortunate than his friends in that\r\nneither of his sons--nor any of his near relatives--lost his life;\r\nRoon's second son fell at Sedan, and the bloody days of Mars-la-Tour and\r\nGravelotte placed in mourning nearly every noble family in Prussia.\r\n\r\nFrom Gravelotte to Sedan he accompanied the army, and he was by the\r\nKing's side on that fatal day when the white flag was hoisted on the\r\ncitadel of Sedan, and the French general came out of the town with the\r\nmessage that Napoleon, having in vain sought death at the head of his\r\ntroops, placed his sword in the hands of the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Sedan was a military event, and the conditions had to\r\nbe arranged between Moltke and Wimpffen, who had succeeded MacMahon in\r\ncommand, but Bismarck was present at the conference, which was held in\r\nhis quarters, in case political questions arose. As they rode down\r\ntogether to Doncheroy he and Moltke had agreed that no terms could be\r\noffered except the unconditional surrender of the whole army, the\r\nofficers alone being allowed to retain their swords. Against these\r\nconditions Wimpffen and his companions struggled long, but in vain.\r\nMoltke coldly assured them that they could not escape, and that it would\r\nbe madness to begin the fight again; they were surrounded; if the\r\nsurrender were not complete by four o'clock the next morning the\r\nbombardment of the town would begin. Wimpffen suggested that it would be\r\nmore politic of the Germans to show generosity; they would thereby earn\r\nthe gratitude of France, and this might be made the beginning of a\r\nlasting peace; otherwise what had they to look forward to but a long\r\nseries of wars? Now was the time for Bismarck to interfere; it was\r\nimpossible, he declared, to reckon on the gratitude of nations; at times\r\nmen might indeed build with confidence on that of a sovereign and his\r\nfamily; \"but I repeat, nothing can be expected from the gratitude of a\r\nnation.\" Above all was this true of France. \"The Governments there have\r\nso little power, the changes are so quick and so unforeseen, that there\r\nis nothing on which one can rely.\" Besides, it would be absurd to\r\nimagine that France would ever forgive us our successes. \"You are an\r\nirritable and jealous people, envious and jealous to the last degree.\r\nYou have not forgiven us Sadowa, and would you forgive us Sedan? Never.\"\r\n\r\nThey could not therefore modify the terms in order to win the gratitude\r\nand friendship of France; they might have done so had there been\r\nprospects of immediate peace. One of the officers, General Castelnau,\r\nannounced that he had a special message from Napoleon, who had sent his\r\nsword to the King and surrendered in the hope that the King would\r\nappreciate the sacrifice and grant a more honourable capitulation.\r\n\"Whose sword is it that the Emperor Napoleon has surrendered?\" asked\r\nBismarck; \"is it the sword of France or his own? If it is the sword of\r\nFrance the conditions can be greatly softened; your message would have\r\nan extraordinary importance.\" He thought and he hoped that the Emperor\r\nwished to sue for peace, but it was not so. \"It is only the sword of the\r\nEmperor,\" answered the General. \"All then remains as it was,\" said\r\nMoltke; he insisted on his demands; Wimpffen asked at least that time\r\nmight be allowed him to return to Sedan and consult his colleagues. He\r\nhad only come from Algeria two days before; he could not begin his\r\ncommand by signing so terrible a surrender. Even this Moltke refused.\r\nThen Wimpffen declared the conference ended; rather than this they would\r\ncontinue the battle; he asked that his horses might be brought. A\r\nterrible silence fell on the room; Moltke, with Bismarck by his side,\r\nstood cold and impenetrable, facing the three French officers; their\r\nfaces were lighted by two candles on the table; behind stood the\r\nstalwart forms of the German officers of the staff, and from the walls\r\nof the room looked down the picture of Napoleon I. Then again Bismarck\r\ninterfered; he begged Wimpffen not in a moment of pique to take a step\r\nwhich must have such horrible consequences; he whispered a few words to\r\nMoltke, and procured from him a concession; hostilities should not be\r\nrenewed till nine o'clock the next morning. Wimpffen might return to\r\nSedan and report to the Emperor and his colleagues.\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight when the conference broke up; before daybreak\r\nBismarck was aroused by a messenger who announced that the Emperor had\r\nleft Sedan and wished to see him. He hastily sprang up, and as he was,\r\nunwashed, without breakfast, in his undress uniform, his old cap, and\r\nhis high boots, shewing all the marks of his long day in the saddle, he\r\nmounted his horse and rode down to the spot near the highroad where the\r\nEmperor in his carriage, accompanied by three officers and attended by\r\nthree more on horseback, awaited him. Bismarck rode quickly up to him,\r\ndismounted, and as he approached saluted and removed his cap, though\r\nthis was contrary to etiquette, but it was not a time when he wished\r\neven to appear to be wanting in courtesy. Napoleon had come to plead for\r\nthe army; he wished to see the King, for he hoped that in a personal\r\ninterview he might extract from him more favourable terms. Bismarck was\r\ndetermined just for this reason that the sovereigns should not meet\r\nuntil the capitulation was signed; he answered, therefore, that it was\r\nimpossible, as the King was ten miles away. He then accompanied the\r\nEmperor to a neighbouring cottage; there in a small room, ten feet\r\nsquare, containing a wooden table and two rush chairs, they sat for some\r\ntime talking; afterwards they came down and sat smoking in front of the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\n  \"A wonderful contrast to our last meeting in the Tuileries,\"\r\n  wrote Bismarck to his wife. \"Our conversation was difficult, if I\r\n  was to avoid matters which would be painful to the man who had\r\n  been struck down by the mighty hand of God. He first lamented\r\n  this unhappy war, which he said he had not desired; he had been\r\n  forced into it by the pressure of public opinion. I answered that\r\n  with us also no one, least of all the King, had wished for the\r\n  war. We had looked on the Spanish affair as Spanish and not as\r\n  German.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor asked for more favourable terms of surrender, but Bismarck\r\nrefused to discuss this with him; it was a military question which must\r\nbe settled between Moltke and Wimpffen. On the other hand, when\r\nBismarck enquired if he were inclined for negotiations for peace,\r\nNapoleon answered that he could not discuss this; he was a prisoner of\r\nwar and could not treat; he referred Bismarck to the Government in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThis meeting had therefore no effect on the situation. Bismarck\r\nsuggested that the Emperor should go to the neighbouring Château of\r\nBelle Vue, which was not occupied by wounded; there he would be able to\r\nrest. Thither Bismarck, now in full uniform (for he had hurried back to\r\nhis own quarters), accompanied him, and in the same house the\r\nnegotiations of the previous evening were continued; Bismarck did not\r\nwish to be present at them, for, as he said, the military men could be\r\nharsher; and so gave orders that after a few minutes he should be\r\nsummoned out of the room by a message that the King wished to see him.\r\nAfter the capitulation was signed, he rode up with Moltke to present it\r\nto the King, who received it on the heights whence he had watched the\r\nbattle, surrounded by the headquarters staff and all the princes who\r\nwere making the campaign. Then, followed by a brilliant cavalcade, he\r\nrode down to visit the captive sovereign.\r\n\r\nBismarck would at this time willingly have made peace, but there was no\r\nopportunity of opening negotiations and it is doubtful whether even his\r\ninfluence would have been able successfully to combat the desire of the\r\narmy to march on Paris. On September 4th, the march, which had been\r\ninterrupted ten days before, was begun. Immediately afterwards news came\r\nwhich stopped all hopes of a speedy peace. How soon was his warning as\r\nto the instability of French Governments to be fulfilled! A revolution\r\nhad broken out in Paris, the dethronement of the Emperor had been\r\nproclaimed, and a Provisional Government instituted. They at once\r\ndeclared that they were a government of national defence, they would not\r\nrest till the invaders were driven from the land, they appealed to the\r\nmemories of 1792. They were indeed ready to make peace, for the war,\r\nthey said, had been undertaken not against France but against the\r\nEmperor; the Emperor had fallen, a free France had arisen; they would\r\nmake peace, but they would not yield an inch of their country or a stone\r\nof their fortresses. With great energy they prepared the defence of\r\nParis and the organisation of new armies; M. Thiers was instructed to\r\nvisit the neutral Courts and to beg for the support of Europe.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was Bismarck's duty to explain the German\r\nview; he did so in two circular notes of September 13th and September\r\n16th. He began by expounding those principles he had already expressed\r\nto Wimpffen, principles which had already been communicated by his\r\nsecretaries to the German Press and been repeated in almost every paper\r\nof the country. The war had not been caused by the Emperor; it was the\r\nnation which was responsible for it. It had arisen from the intolerance\r\nof the French character, which looked on the prosperity of other nations\r\nas an insult to themselves. They must expect the same feeling to\r\ncontinue:\r\n\r\n  \"We cannot seek guarantees for the future in French feeling. We\r\n  must not deceive ourselves; we must soon expect a new attack; we\r\n  cannot look forward to a lasting peace, and this is quite\r\n  independent of the conditions we might impose on France. It is\r\n  their defeat which the French nation will never forgive. If now\r\n  we were to withdraw from France without any accession of\r\n  territory, without any contribution, without any advantage but\r\n  the glory of our arms, there would remain in the French nation\r\n  the same hatred, the same spirit of revenge, for the injury done\r\n  to their vanity and to their love of power.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst this they must demand security; the demand was addressed not to\r\nany single Government but to the nation as a whole; South Germany must\r\nbe protected from the danger of French attack; they would never be safe\r\nso long as Strasburg and Metz were in French hands; Strasburg was the\r\ngate of Germany; restored to Germany, these cities would regain their\r\ndefensive character. Twenty times had France made war on Germany, but\r\nfrom Germany no danger of disturbance to the peace of Europe was to be\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nFor the first time he hereby officially stated that Germany would not\r\nmake peace without some accession of territory; that this would be the\r\ncase, everyone had known since the beginning of the war. At a council of\r\nwar directly after Gravelotte it was determined to require Alsace; after\r\nSedan the terms naturally rose. The demand for at least some territory\r\nwas indeed inevitable. The suggestion that from confidence in the\r\npeaceful and friendly character of the French nation they should\r\nrenounce all the advantages gained by their unparalleled victories\r\nscarcely deserved serious consideration. Had the French been successful\r\nthey would have taken all the left bank of the Rhine; this was actually\r\nspecified in the draft treaty which General Le Brun had presented to the\r\nEmperor of Austria. What claim had France to be treated with a leniency\r\nwhich she has never shewn to any conquered enemy? Bismarck had to meet\r\nthe assumption that France was a privileged and special land; that she\r\nhad freedom to conquer, pillage, and divide the land of her neighbours,\r\nbut that every proposal to win back from her what she had taken from\r\nothers was a crime against humanity.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Provisional Government adopted the attitude that they\r\nwould not even consider peace on the basis of some surrender of\r\nterritory, there was no prospect of any useful negotiations. The armies\r\nmust advance, and beneath the walls of Paris the struggle be fought out\r\nto its bitter end. Bismarck meanwhile treated the Government with great\r\nreserve. They had no legal status; as he often pointed out, the Emperor\r\nwas still the only legal authority in France, and he would be quite\r\nprepared to enter into negotiations with him. When by the medium of the\r\nEnglish Ambassador they asked to be allowed to open negotiations for an\r\narmistice and discuss the terms of peace, he answered by the question,\r\nwhat guarantee was there that France or the armies in Metz and Strasburg\r\nwould recognise the arrangements made by the present Government in\r\nParis, or any that might succeed it? It was a quite fair question; for\r\nas events were to shew, the commander of the army in Metz refused to\r\nrecognise them, and wished to restore the Emperor to the throne; and the\r\nGovernment themselves had declared that they would at once be driven\r\nfrom power if they withdrew from their determination not to accept the\r\nprinciple of a cession of territory. They would be driven from power by\r\nthe same authority to which they owed their existence,--the mob of\r\nParis; it was the mob of Paris which, from the beginning, was really\r\nresponsible for the war. What use was there in a negotiation in which\r\nthe two parties had no common ground? None the less Bismarck consented\r\nto receive M. Jules Favre, who held the portfolio of Foreign Affairs,\r\nand who at the advice of Lord Lyons came out from Paris, even at the\r\nrisk of a rebuff, to see if by a personal interview he might not be able\r\nto influence the German Chancellor. \"It is well at least to see what\r\nsort of man he is,\" was the explanation which Bismarck gave; but as the\r\ninterview was not strictly official he did not, by granting it, bind\r\nhimself to recognise Favre's authority.\r\n\r\nJules Favre met Bismarck on September 18th. They had a long conversation\r\nthat evening, and it was continued the next day at Ferneres, Baron\r\nRothschild's house, in which the King was at that time quartered. The\r\nFrench envoy did not make a favourable impression; a lawyer by\r\nprofession, he had no experience in diplomatic negotiations; vain,\r\nverbose, rhetorical, and sentimental, his own report of the interview\r\nwhich he presented to his colleagues in Paris is sufficient evidence of\r\nhis incapacity for the task he had taken upon himself. \"He spoke to me\r\nas if I were a public meeting,\" said Bismarck afterwards, using an\r\nexpression which in his mouth was peculiarly contemptuous, for he had a\r\nplatonic dislike of long speeches. But let us hear Favre himself:\r\n\r\n  \"Although fifty-eight years of, age Count Bismarck appeared to be\r\n  in full vigour. His tall figure, his powerful head, his strongly\r\n  marked features gave him an aspect both imposing and severe,\r\n  tempered, however, by a natural simplicity amounting to\r\n  good-nature. His manners were courteous and grave, and quite free\r\n  from stiffness or affectation. As soon as the conversation\r\n  commenced he displayed a communicativeness and good-will which he\r\n  preserved while it lasted. He certainly regarded me as a\r\n  negotiator unworthy of him and he had the politeness not to let\r\n  this be seen, and appeared interested by my sincerity. I was\r\n  struck with the clearness of his ideas, his vigorous good sense,\r\n  and his originality of mind. His freedom from all pretensions was\r\n  no less remarkable.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare with this the account given by another\r\nFrenchman of one of the later interviews between the two men[11]:\r\n\r\n  \"The negotiations began seriously and quietly. The Chancellor\r\n  said simply and seriously what he wanted with astonishing\r\n  frankness and admirable logic. He went straight to the mark and\r\n  at every turn he disconcerted Jules Favre, who was accustomed to\r\n  legal quibbles and diplomatic jobbery, and did not in the least\r\n  understand the perfect loyalty of his opponent or his superb\r\n  fashion of treating questions, so different from the ordinary\r\n  method. The Chancellor expressed himself in French with a\r\n  fidelity I have never met with except among the Russians. He made\r\n  use of expressions at once elegant and vigorous, finding the\r\n  proper word to describe an idea or define a situation without\r\n  effort or hesitation.\"\r\n\r\n  \"I was at the outset struck by the contrast between the two\r\n  negotiators. Count Bismarck wore the uniform of the White\r\n  Cuirassiers, white tunic, white cap, and yellow band. He looked\r\n  like a giant. In his tight uniform, with his broad chest and\r\n  square shoulders and bursting with health and strength, he\r\n  overwhelmed the stooping, thin, tall, miserable-looking lawyer\r\n  with his frock coat, wrinkled all over, and his white hair\r\n  falling over his collar. A look, alas, at the pair was sufficient\r\n  to distinguish between the conqueror and the conquered, the\r\n  strong and the weak.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, was four months later, when Jules Favre was doubtless\r\nmuch broken by the anxieties of his position, and perhaps also by the\r\nwant of sufficient food, and Comte d'Hérisson is not an impartial\r\nwitness, for, though a patriotic Frenchman, he was an enemy of the\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nBismarck in granting the interview had said that he would not discuss an\r\narmistice, but only terms of peace. For the reasons we have explained,\r\nFavre refused to listen even to the proposition of the only terms which\r\nBismarck was empowered to bring forward. The Chancellor explained those\r\nideas with which we are already acquainted: \"Strasburg,\" he said, \"is\r\nthe key of our house and we must have it.\" Favre protested that he could\r\nnot discuss conditions which were so dishonourable to France. On this\r\nexpression we need only quote Bismarck's comment:\r\n\r\n  \"I did not succeed in convincing him that conditions, the\r\n  fulfilment of which France had required from Italy, and demanded\r\n  from Germany without having been at war, conditions which France\r\n  would undoubtedly have imposed upon us had we been defeated and\r\n  which had been the result of nearly every war, even in the latest\r\n  time, could not have anything dishonourable in themselves for a\r\n  country which had been defeated after a brave resistance, and\r\n  that the honour of France was not of a different kind to that of\r\n  other countries.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to refuse to discuss terms of an armistice; as in 1866\r\nthe military authorities objected to any kind of armistice because from\r\na military point of view any cessation of hostilities must be an\r\nadvantage to France; it would enable them to continue their preparations\r\nand get together new armies, while Germany would have the enormous\r\nexpense of maintaining 500,000 men in a foreign country. Bismarck\r\nhimself from a political point of view also knew the advantage of\r\nbringing the war to a rapid close, while the moral effect of the great\r\nvictories had not been dissipated. However, France had no Government; a\r\nlegal Government could not be created without elections, and Favre\r\nrefused to consider holding elections during the progress of\r\nhostilities. After a long discussion Bismarck, other suggestions being\r\nrejected, offered an armistice on condition that the war should\r\ncontinue round Metz and Paris, but that Toul and Strasburg should be\r\nsurrendered and the garrison of Strasburg made prisoners of war. \"The\r\ntowns would anyhow fall into our hands,\" he said; \"it is only a question\r\nof engineering.\" \"At these words,\" says Favre, \"I sprang into the air\r\nfrom pain and cried out, 'You forget that you speak to a Frenchman. To\r\nsacrifice an heroic garrison which is the object of our admiration and\r\nthat of the world would be a cowardice. I do not promise even to say\r\nthat you have offered such a condition.'\" Bismarck said that he had no\r\nwish to offend him; if the King allowed it the article might be\r\nmodified; he left the room, and after a quarter of an hour returned,\r\nsaying that the King would accept no alteration on this point. \"My\r\npowers were exhausted,\" writes Favre; \"I feared for a moment that I\r\nshould fall down; I turned away to overcome the tears which choked me,\r\nand, while I excused myself for this involuntary weakness, I took leave\r\nwith a few simple words.\" He asked Bismarck not to betray his weakness.\r\nThe Count, who seems really to have been touched by the display of\r\nemotion, attempted in some sort of way to console him, but a few days\r\nlater his sympathy was changed into amusement when he found that the\r\ntears which he had been asked to pass over in silence were paraded\r\nbefore the people of Paris to prove the patriotism of the man. \"He may\r\nhave meant it,\" said Bismarck, \"but people ought not to bring sentiment\r\ninto politics.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms which Bismarck had offered were as a matter of fact not at\r\nall harsh; a week later the garrison of Strasburg had become prisoners\r\nof war; had the French accepted the armistice and begun negotiations for\r\npeace they would probably, though they could not have saved Strasburg\r\nand Alsace, have received far better terms than those to which they had\r\nto assent four months later.\r\n\r\nBismarck in refusing to recognise the Provisional Government always\r\nreminded them that the Emperor was still the only legitimate Government\r\nin France. He professed that he was willing to negotiate with the\r\nEmperor, and often talked of releasing him from his confinement in\r\nGermany, coming to terms with Bazaine, and allowing the Emperor at the\r\nhead of the army at Metz to regain his authority in France. We do not\r\nquite know to what extent he was serious in using this language, for he\r\noften threatened more than he intended to perform. It is at least\r\npossible that he only used it as a means for compelling the Provisional\r\nGovernment quickly to come to terms and thereby to bring the war to an\r\nend. It is, however, certain that negotiations went on between him and\r\nthe Empress and also with Bazaine. They came to nothing because the\r\nEmpress absolutely refused to negotiate if she was to be required to\r\nsurrender any French territory. In this she adopted the language of the\r\nProvisional Government in Paris, and was supported by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with the Provisional Government were more than once\r\nrenewed; soon after the investiture of Paris had begun, General Burnside\r\nand another American passed as unofficial messengers between the French\r\nand German Governments, and at the beginning of November, Thiers came as\r\nthe official agent of the Government in Tours; these attempts were,\r\nhowever, always without result; the French would not accept an armistice\r\non the only conditions which Bismarck was authorised by the King and the\r\nmilitary authorities to offer. During the rest of the year there was\r\nlittle direct communication with the French authorities. Bismarck,\r\nhowever, was not idle. In his quarters at Versailles he had with him\r\nmany of the Foreign Office staff; he had not only to conduct important\r\ndiplomatic negotiations, but also to maintain control over the nation,\r\nto keep in touch with the Press, to communicate to the newspapers both\r\nevents and comments on them. At this crisis he could not leave public\r\nopinion without proper direction; he had to combat the misstatements of\r\nthe French, who had so long had the ear of Europe, and were still\r\ncarrying their grievances to the Courts of the neutral Powers, and found\r\noften eager advocates in the Press of the neutral countries. He had to\r\ncheck the proposal of the neutral Powers to interfere between the two\r\ncombatants, to inform the German public of the demands that were to be\r\nmade on France and the proposals for the unity of the country, and to\r\njustify the policy of the Government; all this was done not only by\r\nofficial notes, but by articles written at his dictation or under his\r\ninstruction, and by information or suggestions conveyed by his\r\nsecretaries to his newspapers. In old days the Prussian Government had\r\nbeen inarticulate, it had never been able to defend itself against the\r\nattacks of foreign critics; it had suffered much by misrepresentation;\r\nit had lost popularity at home and prestige abroad. In the former\r\nstruggles with France the voice of Germany had scarcely been heard;\r\nEurope, which was accustomed to listen to every whisper from Paris,\r\nignored the feelings and the just grievances of Germany. Bismarck\r\nchanged all this; now he saw to it that the policy of the Government\r\nshould be explained and defended in Germany itself; for though he\r\ndespised public opinion when it claimed to be the canon by which the\r\nGovernment should be directed, he never neglected this, as he never\r\nneglected any means by which the Government might be strengthened.\r\nSpeaking now from Versailles, he could be confident that Europe would\r\nlisten to what Germany said, and it was no small benefit to his nation\r\nthat it had as its spokesman a man whose character and abilities ensured\r\nthat no word that he uttered would be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe neutral Powers really gave him little concern. There was no\r\nintention of supporting France either in England, Russia, or Austria. He\r\nshewed great activity, however, in defending the Germans from the\r\ncharges so freely made against them by the French Press, of conducting\r\nthe war in a cruel manner; charges which were untrue, for, according to\r\nthe unanimous testimony of foreign observers who accompanied the army,\r\nthe moderation of the German soldiers was as remarkable as their\r\nsuccesses. Bismarck was not content with rebutting unjust\r\naccusations,--he carried on the war into the enemy's camp. He was\r\nespecially indignant at the misuse made by the French of irregular\r\ntroops; he often maintained that the German soldiers ought never to\r\nimprison the _franc-tireurs,_ but shoot them at once. He feared that if\r\ncivilians were encouraged to take part in the war it would necessarily\r\nassume a very cruel character. At Meaux he came upon a number of\r\n_franc-tireurs_ who had been taken prisoners. \"You are assassins,\r\ngentlemen,\" he said to them; \"you will all be hung.\" And, indeed, these\r\nmen who fired secretly on the German troops from behind hedges and in\r\nforests, and had no kind of uniform, could not claim to be treated as\r\nprisoners of war. When the bombardment of Paris began he took great\r\npains to defend a measure which was much attacked in other countries; he\r\nhad used all his influence that the bombardment should not be delayed,\r\nand often spoke with great annoyance of the reluctance of the military\r\nauthorities to begin. He wished every measure to be taken which would\r\nbring the war to an end as soon as possible. The long delay before Paris\r\nseems to have affected his nerves and spirits; there were many anxious\r\nhours, and it was always difficult for him to wait patiently the result\r\nof what others were doing. The military authorities were, as always,\r\nvery jealous of all attempts by him to interfere in their department,\r\nand he was not always satisfied with their decisions. Like all the\r\nGermans he was surprised and angry at the unexpected resistance of\r\nParis, and the success of Gambetta's appeal to the nation. He was\r\nespecially indignant at the help which Garibaldi gave: \"This,\" he said,\r\n\"is the gratitude of the Italians\"; he declared that he would have the\r\nGeneral taken prisoner and paraded through the streets of Berlin.\r\n\r\nDuring the long weeks at Versailles, Bismarck was much occupied with\r\nGerman affairs. The victory of Sedan was the foundation of German unity;\r\nBismarck's moderation and reserve now earned its reward; he had always\r\nrefused to press the southern States into the Federation; now the offer\r\nto join came from them. Baden asked, as she had already done at the\r\nbeginning of the year, to be received into the Union; the settlement\r\nwith Wurtemberg, and above all with Bavaria, was less simple. At the\r\nrequest of the Bavarian Government Delbrück was sent to Munich for an\r\ninterchange of opinion, and the negotiations which were begun there were\r\nafterwards continued at Versailles and Berlin. There were many\r\ndifficulties to be overcome: the Bavarians were very jealous of their\r\nindependence and were not prepared to put themselves into the position\r\nwhich, for instance, Saxony occupied. But the difficulties on the\r\nPrussian side were equally great: the Liberal party wished that the\r\nConstitution should be revised and those points in it which they had\r\nalways disliked altered; they would have made the government of the\r\nFederal authorities more direct, have created a Federal Ministry and a\r\nFederal Upper House, and so really changed the Federation into a simple\r\nState, thereby taking away all the independence of the dynasties. It was\r\nquite certain that Bavaria would not accept this, and there was some\r\nconsiderable danger that their exaggerated demands might lead to a\r\nreaction in South Germany. Probably under any circumstances the\r\nunification of Germany would have been completed, but it required all\r\nBismarck's tact to prevent the outbreak of a regular party struggle. The\r\nmost extreme line was taken by the Crown Prince of Prussia; he desired\r\nthe immediate creation of an emperor who should have sovereign authority\r\nover the whole of Germany, and he even went so far as to suggest that,\r\nif the Bavarians would not accept this voluntarily, they might be\r\ncompelled to do so. He had repeated conversations with Bismarck on this,\r\nand on one occasion at least it ended in an angry scene. The Crown\r\nPrince wished to threaten the South Germans. \"There is no danger,\" he\r\nsaid; \"let us take a firm and commanding attitude. You will see I was\r\nright in maintaining that you are not nearly sufficiently conscious of\r\nyour own power.\" It is almost incredible that he should have used such\r\nlanguage, but the evidence is conclusive; he was at this time commanding\r\nthe Bavarian troops against the French; Bavaria had with great loyalty\r\nsupported Prussia through the war and performed very valuable services,\r\nand now he proposed to reward their friendship by compelling them to\r\naccept terms by which the independence of the King and the very\r\nexistence of the State would be endangered. The last request which the\r\nKing of Bavaria had sent to the Crown Prince as he left Munich to take\r\ncommand of the Bavarian army was that nothing might be done to interfere\r\nwith Bavarian independence. Of course Bismarck refused to listen to\r\nthese suggestions; had he done so, the probable result would have been\r\nthat the Bavarian army would have been withdrawn from France and then\r\nall the result of the victories would have been lost.\r\n\r\nWhat Bismarck did was in accordance with his usual practice to make no\r\ngreater alteration in existing institutions than was absolutely\r\nnecessary; he did not therefore undertake any reform of the Federal\r\nConstitution, but simply proposed treaties by which the southern States,\r\neach separately, entered into the existing alliance. Certain special\r\nconditions were allowed: the King of Bavaria was to maintain the command\r\nover his troops in time of peace; a Voice was given to Bavaria in the\r\nmanagement of foreign affairs; she retained her own post and telegraph,\r\nand there were certain special privileges with regard to finance to meet\r\nthe system of taxation on beer; and then the Prussian military code was\r\nnot to apply to Bavaria, and Bavaria was to retain her own special laws\r\nwith regard to marriage and citizenship. These concessions were\r\nundoubtedly very considerable, but Bismarck granted them, for, as he\r\nsaid to the Bavarian envoys, \"we do not want a discontented Bavaria; we\r\nwant one which will join us freely.\" The Liberal Publicists in Germany\r\nwith characteristic intolerance complained that when they had hoped to\r\nsee the Constitution made simpler and the central government stronger it\r\nhad really become more federal; they did not see that this federalism\r\nwas merely the expression of existing facts which could not be ignored.\r\nThey prophesied all kinds of difficulties which have not been\r\nfulfilled, for they forgot that harmonious working, in an alliance\r\nvoluntarily made, would be a firmer bond of union than the most\r\nstringent articles of treaties which were looked on as an unjust burden.\r\nBismarck's own words, spoken the evening after the agreements were\r\nsigned, give the true account of the matter:\r\n\r\n  \"The newspapers will not be satisfied, the historian may very\r\n  likely condemn our Conventions; he may say, 'The stupid fellow\r\n  might easily have asked for more, he would have got it, they\r\n  would have had to give it him; his might was his right.' I was\r\n  more anxious that these people should go away heartily satisfied.\r\n  What is the use of treaties which men are forced to sign? I know\r\n  that they went away satisfied. I do not wish to press them or to\r\n  take full advantage of the situation. The Convention has its\r\n  defects, but it is all the stronger on account of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe could afford now to be generous because in 1866 he had been so stern;\r\nhe had refused to take in Bavaria when it would have weakened the\r\nassociation of the North; now that the nucleus had been formed he could\r\nallow the Catholic South greater freedom. He was right; the concessions\r\ngranted to Bavaria have not been in any way a danger to the Empire.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had signed the Convention he looked into the room where\r\nhis secretaries were and said: \"The work is done; the unity of Germany\r\nis completed and with it Kaiser and Reich.\" Up to this time he had\r\ntaken no open steps towards the proclamation of the Empire; but it was\r\nunanimously demanded by almost the whole nation and especially by the\r\nSouth Germans. But here he kept himself in the background; he refused to\r\nmake it appear as though he were to make the Emperor or found the\r\nEmpire. He allowed the natural wish of the people to work itself out\r\nspontaneously. There was indeed some reluctance to assume the title at\r\nthe Prussian Court; the King himself was not anxious for a new dignity\r\nwhich would obscure that title which he and his ancestors had made so\r\nhonourable. This feeling was shared by many of the nobility and the\r\nofficers; we find it strongest in Roon, who in this represents the\r\ngenuine feeling of the older Prussian nobility. They disliked a change\r\nwhich must mean that the Prussia to which they were so devotedly\r\nattached was to become merged in a greater Germany. There was also some\r\napprehension that with the new title the old traditions of the Prussian\r\nCourt, traditions of economy, almost of parsimony, might be forgotten,\r\nand that a new career might begin in which they would attempt to imitate\r\nthe extravagance and pomp of less prudent sovereigns. With this perhaps\r\nBismarck himself had some sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe King would, of course, only assume the new title if it was offered\r\nto him by his fellow-princes; there was some danger lest the Reichstag,\r\nwhich had been summoned to ratify the treaties, might ask him to assume\r\nit before the princes did; had they done so, he would probably have\r\nrefused. The Crown Prince, who was very eager for the new title, and\r\nthe Grand Duke of Baden used all their influence with their\r\nfellow-princes. The initiative must come from the King of Bavaria; he\r\nwas in difficulty as to the form in which the offer should be made.\r\nBismarck, who throughout the whole negotiations worked behind the\r\nscenes, smoothing away difficulties, thereupon drafted a letter which he\r\nsent by special messenger to the King of Bavaria. The King at once\r\nadopted it, copied it out and signed it, and at the same time wrote\r\nanother letter to the other princes, asking them to join in the request\r\nwhich he had made to the King of Prussia, to assume the title of Emperor\r\nwhich had been in abeyance for over sixty years. So it came about that\r\nthe letter by which the offer to the King was made had really emanated\r\nfrom his own Chancellor. It shews to what good purpose Bismarck used the\r\nconfidence which, by his conduct in the previous negotiations, the King\r\nof Bavaria had been led to place in him.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January, 1871, in the Palace of Versailles, the King\r\npublicly assumed the new title; a few days later Bismarck was raised to\r\nthe rank of Prince.\r\n\r\nA few days later Paris fell; the prolonged siege was over and the power\r\nof resistance exhausted; then again, as three months before, Favre asked\r\nfor an audience, this time to negotiate the capitulation of the city; we\r\nneed not here dwell on the terms of the capitulation--we need only quote\r\nwhat Favre himself says of Bismarck's attitude:\r\n\r\n  \"I should be unfaithful to truth if I did not recognise that in\r\n  these mournful discussions I always found the Chancellor eager to\r\n  soften in form the cruelty of his requirements. He applied\r\n  himself as much as was possible to temper the military harshness\r\n  of the general staff, and on many points he consented to make\r\n  himself the advocate of our demands.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks were allowed for elections to be held and an assembly to\r\nmeet at Bordeaux, and then once more M. Thiers appeared, to negotiate\r\nthe terms of peace. He knew that the demands would be very heavy; he\r\nanticipated that they would be asked to surrender Alsace, including\r\nBelfort, and of Lorraine at least the department of the Moselle, with\r\nMetz; he expected a large war indemnity--five thousand million francs.\r\nThe terms Bismarck had to offer were almost identical with these, except\r\nthat the indemnity was placed at six thousand million francs. The part\r\nThiers had to play was a very difficult one; he knew that if Germany\r\ninsisted on her full demands he must accept; he was too experienced a\r\npolitician to be misled by any of the illusions under which Favre had\r\nlaboured. He, as all other Frenchmen, had during the last three months\r\nlearned a bitter lesson. \"Had we made peace,\" he said, \"before the fall\r\nof Metz, we might at least have saved Lorraine.\" He hoped against hope\r\nthat he might still be able to do so. With all the resources of his\r\nintellect and his eloquence he tried to break down the opposition of the\r\nCount. When Metz was refused to him then he pleaded for Belfort. Let us\r\nhear what Favre, who was present at the decisive interview, tells us; we\r\nmay use his authority with more confidence that he was a silent and\r\npassive auditor.\r\n\r\n  \"One must have been present at this pathetic scene to have an\r\n  idea of the superhuman resources which the illustrious statesman\r\n  displayed. I still see him, pale, agitated, now sitting, now\r\n  springing to his feet; I hear his voice broken by grief, his\r\n  words cut short, his tones in turn suppliant and proud; I know\r\n  nothing grander than the sublime passion of this noble heart\r\n  bursting out in petitions, menaces, prayers, now caressing, now\r\n  terrible, growing by degrees more angry in face of this cruel\r\n  refusal, ready for the last extremities, impervious to the\r\n  counsels of reason, so violent and sacred were the sentiments by\r\n  which he was governed.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck remained obdurate; he would surrender neither Metz nor Belfort.\r\nThen Thiers cried out:\r\n\r\n  \"Well, let it be as you will; these negotiations are a pretence.\r\n  We appear to deliberate, we have only to pass under your yoke. We\r\n  ask for a city absolutely French, you refuse it to us; it is to\r\n  avow that you have resolved to wage against us a war of\r\n  extremity. Do it! Ravish our provinces, burn our houses, cut the\r\n  throats of their unoffending inhabitants, in a word, complete\r\n  your work. We will fight to the last breath; we shall succumb at\r\n  last, but we will not be dishonoured.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a burst of passion, all the more admirable that Thiers knew his\r\nthreats were vain; but it was not ineffective. Bismarck was troubled; he\r\nsaid he understood what they suffered; he would be glad to make a\r\nconcession, \"but,\" he added, \"I can promise nothing; the King has\r\ncommanded me to maintain the conditions, he alone has the right to\r\nmodify them; I will take his orders; I must consult with Mons. de\r\nMoltke.\" He left the room; it was nearly an hour before he could find\r\nMoltke; then he returned to give the answer to the Frenchmen. \"You had\r\nrefused that we should enter Paris; if you will agree that the German\r\ntroops occupy Paris, then Belfort shall be restored to you.\" There could\r\nbe no doubt as to the answer, and some hours later the assent of the\r\nKing was given to this alteration in the conditions. Before this the\r\nindemnity had been reduced to five thousand million francs; below that\r\nall the efforts of the French were not able to bring it. There were many\r\nother exciting scenes during the progress of the negotiations; on one\r\noccasion Thiers threatened Bismarck with interposition of the neutral\r\nPowers; \"If you speak to me of Europe, I will speak of the Emperor,\" was\r\nBismarck's answer. He threatened to open negotiations with him and to\r\nsend him back to France at the head of Bazaine's army. On another\r\noccasion--it was during the discussion of finance--another scene took\r\nplace which Favre describes:\r\n\r\n  \"As the discussion continued, he grew animated, he interrupted\r\n  Thiers at every word, accused him of wishing to spoil everything;\r\n  he said that he was ill, at the end of his powers, he was\r\n  incapable of going further, in a work that we were pleased to\r\n  make of no use. Then, allowing his feelings to break out, walking\r\n  up and down the little room in which we were deliberating with\r\n  great strides, he cried, 'It is very kind of me to take the\r\n  trouble to which you condemn me; our conditions are\r\n  ultimatums--you must accept or reject them. I will not take part\r\n  in it any longer; bring an interpreter to-morrow, henceforward I\r\n  will not speak French any longer.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began forthwith to talk German at a great rate, a language which\r\nof course neither of the Frenchmen understood.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare with this Bismarck's own account of the\r\nsame scene:\r\n\r\n  \"When I addressed a definite demand to Thiers, although he\r\n  generally could command himself, he sprang up and cried, 'Mais\r\n  c'est un indignité.' I took no notice but began to talk German.\r\n  For a time he listened, but obviously did not know what to think\r\n  of it. Then in a plaintive voice he said, 'But, Count, you know\r\n  that I do not understand German.' I answered him now in French.\r\n  'When just now you spoke of _indignité_, I found that I did not\r\n  understand French enough and preferred to speak German, here I\r\n  know what I say and hear.' He understood what I meant and at once\r\n  agreed to that which he had just refused as an indignité.\"\r\n\r\nBismarck's part in these negotiations was not altogether an easy one,\r\nfor it is probable that, in part at least, he secretly sympathised with\r\nthe arguments and protests of the French. He was far too loyal to his\r\nmaster and his country not to defend and adopt the policy which had been\r\naccepted; but there is much reason to believe that, had he been\r\ncompletely master, Germany would not have insisted on having Metz, but\r\nwould have made the demand only to withdraw it. The arguments for the\r\nannexation of Alsace were indeed unanswerable, and again and again\r\nBismarck had pointed out that Germany could never be safe so long as\r\nFrance held Strasburg, and a French army supported on the strong basis\r\nof the Vosges could use Strasburg as a gate whence to sally forth into\r\nGermany. No one indeed who has ever stood on the slopes of the Black\r\nForest and looked across the magnificent valley, sheltered by the hills\r\non either side, through which the Rhine flows, can doubt that this is\r\nall one country, and that the frontier must be sought, not in the river,\r\nwhich is not a separation, but the chief means of communication, but on\r\nthe top of the hills on the further side. Every argument, however, which\r\nis used to support German claims to Strasburg may be used with equal\r\nforce to support French claims to Metz. If Strasburg in French hands is\r\nthe gate of Germany, Metz in German hands is, and always will remain, a\r\nmilitary post on the soil of France. No one who reads Bismarck's\r\narguments on this point can fail to notice how they are all nearly\r\nconclusive as to Strasburg, but that he scarcely takes the trouble to\r\nmake it even appear as though they applied to Metz. Even in the speech\r\nbefore the Reichstag in which he explains and justifies the terms of\r\npeace, he speaks again and again of Strasburg but hardly a word of Metz.\r\nHe told how fourteen years before, the old King of Würtemberg had said\r\nto him, at the time of the Crimean troubles, that Prussia might count on\r\nhis voice in the Diet as against the Western Powers, but only till war\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\n  \"Then the matter takes another form. I am determined as well as\r\n  any other to maintain the engagements I have entered into. But do\r\n  not judge me unjustly; give us Strasburg and we shall be ready\r\n  for all eventualities, but so long as Strasburg is a sally-port\r\n  for a Power which is always armed, I must fear that my country\r\n  will be overrun by foreign troops before my confederates can come\r\n  to my help.\"\r\n\r\nThe King was right; Germany would never be secure so long as Strasburg\r\nwas French; but can France ever be secure so long as Metz is German?\r\n\r\nThe demand for Metz was based purely on military considerations; it was\r\nsupported on the theory, which we have already learnt, that Germany\r\ncould never take the offensive in a war with France, and that the\r\npossession of Metz would make it impossible, as indeed is the case, for\r\nFrance to attack Germany. It was not, however, Bismarck's practice to\r\nsubordinate political considerations to military. It may be said that\r\nFrance would never acquiesce in the loss of either province, but while\r\nwe can imagine a generation of Frenchmen arising who would learn to\r\nrecognise the watershed of the Vosges as a permanent boundary between\r\nthe two nations, it is difficult to believe that the time will ever come\r\nwhen a single Frenchman will regard with contentment the presence of the\r\nGermans on the Upper Moselle.\r\n\r\nEven after the preliminaries of peace were settled fresh difficulties\r\narose; the outbreak of the Commune in Paris made it impossible for the\r\nFrench to fulfil all the arrangements; Bismarck, who did not trust the\r\nFrench, treated them with much severity, and more than once he\r\nthreatened again to begin hostilities. At last Favre asked for a fresh\r\ninterview; the two statesmen met at Frankfort, and then the final treaty\r\nof peace was signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n1871-1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH the peace of Frankfort, Bismarck's work was completed. Not nine\r\nyears had passed since he had become Minister; in that short time he\r\ncompleted the work which so many statesmen before him had in vain\r\nattempted. Nine years ago he had found the King ready to retire from the\r\nthrone; now he had made him the most powerful ruler in Europe. Prussia,\r\nwhich then had been divided in itself and without influence in the\r\ncouncils of Europe, was the undisputed leader in a United Germany.\r\n\r\nFate, which always was so kind to Bismarck, was not to snatch him away,\r\nas it did Cavour, in the hour of his triumph; twenty years longer he was\r\nto preside over the State which he had created and to guide the course\r\nof the ship which he had built. A weaker or more timid man would quickly\r\nhave retired from public life; he would have considered that nothing\r\nthat he could do could add to his fame, and that he was always risking\r\nthe loss of some of the reputation he had attained. Bismarck was not\r\ninfluenced by such motives. The exercise of power had become to him a\r\npleasure; he was prepared if his King required it to continue in office\r\nto the end of his days, and he never feared to hazard fame and\r\npopularity if he could thereby add to the prosperity of the State.\r\n\r\nThese latter years of Bismarck's life we cannot narrate in detail; space\r\nalone would forbid it. It would be to write the history of the German\r\nEmpire, and though events are not so dramatic they are no less numerous\r\nthan in the earlier period. Moreover, we have not the material for a\r\ncomplete biographical narrative; there is indeed a great abundance of\r\npublic records; but as to the secret reasons of State by which in the\r\nlast resource the policy of the Government was determined, we have\r\nlittle knowledge. From time to time indeed some illicit disclosure, the\r\npublication of some confidential document, throws an unexpected light on\r\na situation which is obscure; but these disclosures, so hazardous to the\r\ngood repute of the men who are responsible and the country in which they\r\nare possible, must be treated with great reserve. Prompted by motives of\r\nprivate revenge or public ambition, they disclose only half the truth,\r\nand a portion of the truth is often more misleading than complete\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nIn foreign policy he was henceforward sole, undisputed master; in\r\nParliament and in the Press scarcely a voice was raised to challenge his\r\npre-eminence; he enjoyed the complete confidence of the allied\r\nsovereigns and the enthusiastic affection of the nation; even those\r\nparties which often opposed and criticised his internal policy supported\r\nhim always on foreign affairs. Those only opposed him who were hostile\r\nto the Empire itself, those whose ideals or interests were injured by\r\nthis great military monarchy--Poles and Ultramontanes, Guelphs and\r\nSocialists; in opposing Bismarck they seemed to be traitors to their\r\ncountry, and he and his supporters were not slow to divide the nation\r\ninto the loyal and the _Reichsfeindlich_.\r\n\r\nHe deserved the confidence which was placed in him. He succeeded in\r\npreserving to the newly founded Empire all the prestige it had gained;\r\nhe was enabled to soothe the jealousy of the neutral Powers. He did so\r\nby his policy of peace. Now he pursued peace with the same decision with\r\nwhich but two years before he had brought about a war. He was guided by\r\nthe same motive; as war had then been for the benefit of Germany, so now\r\nwas peace. He had never loved war for the sake of war; he was too good a\r\ndiplomatist for this; war is the negation of diplomacy, and the\r\nstatesman who has recourse to it must for the time give over the control\r\nto other hands. It is always a clumsy method. The love of war for the\r\nsake of war will be found more commonly among autocratic sovereigns who\r\nare their own generals than among skilled and practised ministers, and\r\ngenerally war is the last resource by which a weak diplomatist attempts\r\nto conceal his blunders and to regain what he has lost.\r\n\r\nThere had been much anxiety in Europe how the new Empire would deport\r\nitself; would it use this power which had been so irresistible for\r\nfresh conflicts? The excuse might easily have been found; Bismarck might\r\nhave put on his banner, \"The Union of All Germans in One State\"; he\r\nmight have recalled and reawakened the enthusiasm of fifty years ago; he\r\nmight have reminded the people that there were still in Holland and in\r\nSwitzerland, in Austria and in Russia, Germans who were separated from\r\ntheir country, and languishing under a foreign rule. Had he been an\r\nidealist he would have done so, and raised in Germany a cry like that of\r\nthe Italian Irredentists. Or he might have claimed for his country its\r\nnatural boundaries; after freeing the upper waters of the Rhine from\r\nforeign dominion he might have claimed that the great river should flow\r\nto the sea, German. This is what Frenchmen had done under similar\r\ncircumstances, but he was not the man to repeat the crimes and blunders\r\nof Louis and Napoleon.\r\n\r\nHe knew that Germany desired peace; a new generation must grow up in the\r\nnew order of things; the old wounds must be healed by time, the old\r\ndivisions forgotten; long years of common work must cement the alliances\r\nthat he had made, till the jealousy of the defeated was appeased and the\r\nnew Empire had become as firm and indissoluble as any other State in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger came from France; in that unhappy country the cry for\r\nrevenge seemed the only link with the pride which had been so rudely\r\noverthrown. The defeat and the disgrace could not be forgotten; the\r\nrecovery of the lost provinces was the desire of the nation, and the\r\nprogramme of every party. As we have seen, the German statesmen had\r\nforeseen the danger and deliberately defied it. They cared not for the\r\nhostility of France, now that they need not fear her power. _Oderint dum\r\nmetuant._ Against French demands for restitution they presented a firm\r\nand unchangeable negative; it was kinder so and juster, to allow no\r\nopening for hope, no loophole for negotiation, no intervention by other\r\nPowers. Alsace-Lorraine were German by the right of the hundred thousand\r\nGerman soldiers who had perished to conquer them. Any appearance of\r\nweakness would have led to hopes which could never be realised,\r\ndiscussions which could have had no result. The answer to all\r\nsuggestions was to be found in the strength of Germany; the only\r\ndiplomacy was to make the army so strong that no French statesman, not\r\neven the mob of Paris, could dream of undertaking single-handed a war of\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nThis was not enough; it was necessary besides to isolate France. There\r\nwere many men in Europe who would have wished to bring about a new\r\ncoalition of the armies by whose defeat Germany had been built\r\nup--France and Austria, Denmark and the Poles; then it was always to be\r\nexpected that Russia, who had done so much for Germany in the past,\r\nwould cease to regard with complacency the success of her protégé; after\r\nall, the influence of the Czar in Europe had depended upon the divisions\r\nof Germany as much as had that of France. How soon would the Russian\r\nnation wake up, as the French had done, to the fact that the sympathies\r\nof their Emperor had created a great barrier to Russian ambition and\r\nRussian diplomacy? It was especially the Clerical party who wished to\r\nbring about some coalition; for them the chief object was the overthrow\r\nof Italy, and the world still seemed to centre in Rome; they could not\r\ngain the assistance of Germany in this work, and they therefore looked\r\non the great Protestant Empire as an enemy. They would have liked by\r\nmonarchical reaction to gain control of France; by the success of the\r\nCarlist movement to obtain that of Spain, and then, assisted by Austria,\r\nto overthrow the new order in Europe. Against this Bismarck's chief\r\nenergies were directed; we shall see how he fought the Ultramontanes at\r\nhome. With regard to France, he was inclined to support the Republic,\r\nand refused all attempts which were made by some German statesmen, and\r\nespecially by Count Arnim, the Ambassador at Paris, to win German\r\nsympathy and support to the monarchical party. In Spain his support and\r\nsympathy were given to the Government, which with difficulty maintained\r\nitself against the Carlists; a visit of Victor Emmanuel to Berlin\r\nconfirmed the friendship with Italy, over which the action of Garibaldi\r\nin 1870 had thrown a cloud. The greatest triumph of Bismarck's policy\r\nwas, however, the reconciliation with Austria. One of the most intimate\r\nof his councillors, when asked which of Bismarck's actions he admired\r\nmost, specified this. It was peculiarly his own; he had long worked for\r\nit; even while the war of 1866 was still being waged, he had foreseen\r\nthat a day would come when Germany and Austria, now that they were\r\nseparated, might become, as they never had been when joined by an\r\nunnatural union, honest allies. It was probably to a great extent\r\nbrought about by the strong regard and confidence which the Austrian\r\nEmperor reposed in the German Chancellor. The beginnings of an\r\napproximation were laid by the dismissal of Beust, who himself now was\r\nto become a personal friend of the statesman against whom he had for so\r\nlong and with such ingenuity waged an unequal conflict. The union was\r\nsealed when, in December, 1872, the Czar of Russia and Francis Joseph\r\ncame to Berlin as guests of the Emperor. There was no signed contract,\r\nno written alliance, but the old union of the Eastern monarchies under\r\nwhich a generation before Europe had groaned, was now restored, and on\r\nthe Continent there was no place to which France could look for help or\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nThe years that followed were those in which foreign affairs gave\r\nBismarck least anxiety or occupation. He even began to complain that he\r\nwas dull; after all these years of conflict and intrigue he found the\r\nsecurity which he now enjoyed uninteresting. Now and again the shadow of\r\nwar passed over Europe, but it was soon dispelled. The most serious was\r\nin 1875.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the French reforms of the army and some movements of\r\nFrench troops had caused alarm at Berlin; I say alarm, though it is\r\ndifficult to believe that any serious concern could have been felt.\r\nThere was, however, a party who believed that war must come sooner or\r\nlater, and it was better, they said, not to wait till France was again\r\npowerful and had won allies; surely the wisest thing was while she was\r\nstill weak and friendless to take some excuse (and how easy would it be\r\nto find the excuse!), fall upon her, and crush her--crush and destroy,\r\nso that she could never again raise her head; treat her as she had in\r\nold days treated Germany. How far this plan was deliberately adopted we\r\ndo not know, but in the spring of this year the signs became so alarming\r\nthat both the Russian and the English Governments were seriously\r\ndisturbed, and interfered. So sober a statesman as Lord Derby believed\r\nthat the danger was real. The Czar, who visited Berlin at the beginning\r\nof April, dealt with the matter personally; the Queen of England wrote a\r\nletter to the German Emperor, in which she said that the information she\r\nhad could leave no doubt that an aggressive war on France was meditated,\r\nand used her personal influence with the sovereign to prevent it. The\r\nEmperor himself had not sympathised with the idea of war, and it is said\r\ndid not even know of the approaching danger. It did not require the\r\nintervention of other sovereigns to induce him to refuse his assent to a\r\nwanton war, but this advice from foreign Powers of course caused great\r\nindignation in Bismarck; it was just the kind of thing which always\r\nangered him beyond everything. He maintained that he had had no warlike\r\nintentions, that the reports were untrue. The whole story had its\r\norigin, he said, in the intrigues of the Ultramontanes and the vanity of\r\nGortschakoff; the object was to make it appear that France owed her\r\nsecurity and preservation to the friendly interference of Russia, and\r\nthereby prepare the way for an alliance between the two Powers. It is\r\nalmost impossible to believe that Bismarck had seriously intended to\r\nbring about a war; he must have known that the other Powers of Europe\r\nwould not allow a second and unprovoked attack on France; he would not\r\nbe likely to risk all he had achieved and bring about a European\r\ncoalition against him. On the other hand his explanation is probably not\r\nthe whole truth; even German writers confess that the plan of attacking\r\nFrance was meditated, and it was a plan of a nature to recommend itself\r\nto the military party in Prussia.\r\n\r\nYet this may have been the beginning of a divergence with Russia. The\r\nunion had depended more on the personal feelings of the Czar than on the\r\nwishes of the people or their real interests. The rising Pan-Slavonic\r\nparty was anti-German; their leader was General Ignatieff, but\r\nGortschakoff, partly perhaps from personal hostility to Bismarck, partly\r\nfrom a just consideration of Russian interests, sympathised with their\r\nanti-Teutonic policy. The outbreak of disturbances in the East roused\r\nthat national feeling which had slept for twenty years; in truth the\r\nstrong patriotism of modern Germany naturally created a similar feeling\r\nin the neighbouring countries; just as the Germans were proud to free\r\nthemselves from the dominant culture of France, so the Russians began to\r\nlook with jealousy on the Teutonic influence which since the days of\r\nPeter the Great had been so powerful among them.\r\n\r\nIn internal matters the situation was very different; here Bismarck\r\ncould not rule in the same undisputed manner; he had rivals, critics,\r\nand colleagues. The power of the Prussian Parliament and the Reichstag\r\nwas indeed limited, but without their assent no new law could be passed;\r\neach year their assent must be obtained to the Budget. Though they had\r\nwaived all claim to control the foreign policy, the parties still\r\ncriticised and often rejected the laws proposed by the Government. Then\r\nin Prussian affairs he could not act without the good-will of his\r\ncolleagues; in finance, in legal reform, the management of Church and\r\nschools, the initiative belonged to the Ministers responsible for each\r\ndepartment. Some of the difficulties of government would have been met\r\nhad Bismarck identified himself with a single party, formed a party\r\nMinistry and carried out their programme. This he always refused to do;\r\nhe did not wish in his old age to become a Parliamentary Minister, for\r\nhad he depended for his support on a party, then if he lost their\r\nconfidence, or they lost the confidence of the country, he would have\r\nhad to retire from office. The whole work of his earlier years would\r\nhave been undone. What he wished to secure was a Government party, a\r\nBismarck party _sans phrase_, who would always support all his measures\r\nin internal as well as external policy. In this, however, he did not\r\nsucceed. He was therefore reduced to another course: in order to get the\r\nmeasures of the Government passed, he executed a series of alliances,\r\nnow with one, now with another party. In these, however, he had to give\r\nas well as to receive, and it is curious to see how easily his pride\r\nwas offended and his anger roused by any attempt of the party with which\r\nat the time he was allied to control and influence his policy. No one of\r\nthe alliances lasted long, and he seems to have taken peculiar pleasure\r\nin breaking away from each of them in turn when the time came.\r\n\r\nThe alliance with the Conservatives which he had inherited from the\r\nolder days had begun to break directly after 1866. Many of them had been\r\ndisappointed by his policy in that year. The grant of universal suffrage\r\nhad alarmed them; they had wished that he would use his power to check\r\nand punish the Parliament for its opposition; instead of that he asked\r\nfor an indemnity. They felt that they had borne with him the struggle\r\nfor the integrity of the Prussian Monarchy; no sooner was the victory\r\nwon than he held out his hand to the Liberals and it was to them that the\r\nprize went. They were hurt and disappointed, and this personal feeling\r\nwas increased by Bismarck's want of consideration, his brusqueness of\r\nmanner, his refusal to consider complaints and remonstrances. Even the\r\nsuccess of 1870 had not altogether reconciled them; these Prussian\r\nnobles, the men to whom in earlier days he himself had belonged, saw\r\nwith regret the name of King of Prussia hidden behind the newer glory\r\nof the German Emperor; it is curious to read how even Roon speaks with\r\nsomething of contempt and disgust of this new title: \"I hope,\" he\r\nwrites, \"Bismarck will be in a better temper now that the Kaiser egg\r\nhas been safely hatched.\" It was, however, the struggle with the\r\nCatholic Church which achieved the separation; the complete subjection\r\nof the Church to the State, the new laws for school inspection, the\r\nintroduction of compulsory civil marriage, were all opposed to the\r\nstrongest and the healthiest feelings of the Prussian Conservatives.\r\nThese did not seem to be matters in which the safety of the Empire\r\nwas concerned; Bismarck had simply gone over to, and adopted the\r\nprogramme of, the Liberals; he was supporting that all-pervading power\r\nof the Prussian bureaucracy which he, in his earlier days, had so\r\nbitterly attacked. Then came a proposal for change in the local\r\ngovernment which would diminish the influence of the landed proprietors.\r\nThe Conservatives refused to support these measures; the Conservative\r\nmajority in the House of Lords threw them out. Bismarck's own brother,\r\nall his old friends and comrades, were now ranged against him. He\r\naccepted opposition from them as little as from anyone else; the consent\r\nof the King was obtained to the creation of new peers, and by this means\r\nthe obnoxious measures were forced through the unwilling House. Bismarck\r\nby his speeches intensified the bitterness; he came down himself to make\r\nan attack on the Conservatives. \"The Government is disappointed,\" he\r\nsaid; \"we had looked for confidence from the Conservative party;\r\nconfidence is a delicate plant; if it is once destroyed it does not grow\r\nagain. We shall have to look elsewhere for support.\"\r\n\r\nA crisis in his relations to the party came at the end of 1872; up to\r\nthis time Roon had still remained in the Government; now, in\r\nconsequence of the manner in which the creation of peers had been\r\ndecided upon, he requested permission to resign. The King, who could not\r\nbear to part with him, and who really in many matters of internal policy\r\nhad more sympathy with him than with Bismarck, refused to accept the\r\nresignation. The crisis which arose had an unexpected ending: Bismarck\r\nhimself resigned the office of Minister-President of Prussia, which was\r\ntransferred to Roon, keeping only that of Foreign Minister and\r\nChancellor of the Empire.\r\n\r\nA letter to Roon shews the deep depression under which he laboured at\r\nthis time, chiefly the result of ill-health. \"It was,\" he said, \"an\r\nunheard-of anomaly that the Foreign Minister of a great Empire should be\r\nresponsible also for internal affairs.\" And yet he himself had arranged\r\nthat it should be so. The desertion of the Conservative party had, he\r\nsaid, deprived him of his footing; he was dispirited by the loss of his\r\nold friends and the illness of his wife; he spoke of his advancing years\r\nand his conviction that he had not much longer to live; \"the King\r\nscarcely knows how he is riding a good horse to death.\" He would\r\ncontinue to do what he could in foreign affairs, but he would no longer\r\nbe responsible for colleagues over whom he had no influence except by\r\nrequests, and for the wishes of the Emperor which he did not share. The\r\narrangement lasted for a year, and then Roon had again to request, and\r\nthis time received, permission to retire into private life; his health\r\nwould no longer allow him to endure the constant anxiety of office. His\r\nretirement occasioned genuine grief to the King; and of all the\r\nseverances which he had to undergo, this was probably that which\r\naffected Bismarck most. For none of his colleagues could he ever have\r\nthe same affection he had had for Roon; he it was who had brought him\r\ninto the Ministry, and had gone through with him all the days of storm\r\nand trouble. \"It will be lonely for me,\" he writes, \"in my work; ever\r\nmore so, the old friends become enemies and one makes no new ones. As\r\nGod will.\" In 1873 he again assumed the Presidency. The resignation of\r\nRoon was followed by a complete breach with the party of the _Kreuz\r\nZeitung_; the more moderate of the Conservatives split off from it and\r\ncontinued to support the Government; the remainder entered on a campaign\r\nof factious opposition.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel was inevitable, for quite apart from the question of\r\nreligion it would indeed have been impossible to govern Germany\r\naccording to their principles. We may, however, regret that the quarrel\r\nwas not conducted with more amenity. These Prussian nobles were of the\r\nsame race as Bismarck himself; they resembled him in character if not in\r\nability; they believed that they had been betrayed, and they did not\r\neasily forgive. They were not scrupulous in the weapons they adopted;\r\nthe Press was used for anonymous attacks on his person and his\r\ncharacter; they accused him of using his public position for making\r\nmoney by speculation, and of sacrificing to that the alliance with\r\nRussia. More than once he had recourse to the law of libel to defend\r\nhimself against these unworthy insults. When he publicly in the\r\nReichstag protested against the language of the _Kreuz Zeitung_, the\r\ndishonourable attacks and the scandalous lies it spread abroad, a large\r\nnumber of the leading men among the Prussian nobility signed a\r\ndeclaration formally defending the management of the paper, as true\r\nadherents of the monarchical and Conservative banner. These\r\n_Declaranten_, as they were called, were henceforward enemies whom he\r\ncould never forgive. At the bottom of the list we read, not without\r\nemotion, the words, \"Signed with deep regret, A. von Thadden\"; so far\r\napart were now the two knight-errants of the Christian Monarchy. It was\r\nin reality the end of the old Conservative party; it had done its work;\r\nBismarck was now thrown on the support of the National Liberals.\r\n\r\nSince 1866 they had grown in numbers and in weight. They represented at\r\nthis time the general sense of the German people; it was with their help\r\nthat during the years down to 1878 the new institutions for the Empire\r\nwere built up. In the elections of 1871 they numbered 120; in 1874 their\r\nnumbers rose to 152; they had not an absolute majority, but in all\r\nquestions regarding the defence of the Empire, foreign policy, and the\r\narmy they were supported by the moderate Conservatives; in the conflict\r\nwith the Catholics and internal matters they could generally depend on\r\nthe support of the Progressives; so that as long as they maintained\r\ntheir authority they gave the Government the required majority in both\r\nthe Prussian and the German Parliament. There were differences in the\r\nparty which afterwards were to lead to a secession, but during this\r\ntime, which they looked upon as the golden era of the Empire, they\r\nsucceeded in maintaining their unity. They numbered many of the ablest\r\nleaders, the lawyers and men of learning who had opposed Bismarck at the\r\ntime of the conflict. Their leader was Bennigsen; himself a Hanoverian,\r\nhe had brought no feelings of hostility from the older days of conflict.\r\nModerate, tactful, restrained, patriotic, he was the only man who, when\r\ndifficulties arose, was always able to approach the Chancellor, sure of\r\nfinding some tenable compromise. Different was it with Lasker, the\r\nablest of Parliamentary orators, whose subordination to the decisions of\r\nthe party was often doubtful, and whose criticism, friendly as it often\r\nwas, always aroused Bismarck's anger.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the alliance was, however, never complete; it was\r\nalways felt that at any moment some question might arise on which it\r\nwould be wrecked. This was shewn by Bismarck's language as early as\r\n1871; in a debate on the army he explained that what he demanded was\r\nfull support; members, he said, were expressly elected to support him;\r\nthey had no right to make conditions or withdraw their support; if they\r\ndid so he would resign. The party, which was very loyal to him,\r\nconstantly gave up its own views when he made it a question of\r\nconfidence, but the strain was there and was always felt. The great\r\nquestion now as before was that of the organisation of the army. It will\r\nbe remembered that, under the North German Confederation, a provisional\r\narrangement was made by which the numbers of the army in peace were to\r\nbe fixed at one per cent. of the population. This terminated at the end\r\nof 1871; the Government, however, did not then consider it safe to alter\r\nthe arrangement, and with some misgiving the Reichstag accepted the\r\nproposal that this system should be applied to the whole Empire for\r\nthree years. If, however, the numbers of the army were absolutely fixed\r\nin this way, the Reichstag would cease to have any control over the\r\nexpenses; all other important taxes and expenses came before the\r\nindividual States. In 1874, the Government had to make their proposal\r\nfor the future. This was that the system which had hitherto been\r\nprovisionally accepted should become permanent, and that the army should\r\nhenceforward in time of peace always consist of the same number of men.\r\nTo agree to this would be permanently to give up all possibility of\r\nexercising any control over the finance. It was impossible for the\r\nNational Liberal party to accept the proposal without giving up at the\r\nsame time all hope of constitutional development; Bismarck was ill and\r\ncould take no part in defending the law; they voted against it, it was\r\nthrown out, and it seemed as though a new conflict was going to arise.\r\n\r\nWhen the Reichstag adjourned in April for the Easter holidays the\r\nagitation spread over the country, but the country was determined not\r\nagain to have a conflict on the Budget. \"There was a regular fanaticism\r\nfor unconditional acceptance of the law; those even on the Left refused\r\nto hear anything of constitutional considerations,\" writes one member\r\nof the National Liberty party after meeting his constituents. If the\r\nReichstag persisted in their refusal and a dissolution took place, there\r\nwas no doubt that there would be a great majority for the Government. It\r\nwas the first time since 1870 that the question of constitutional\r\nprivileges was raised, and now it was found, as ever afterwards was the\r\ncase, that, for the German people, whatever might be the opinion of\r\ntheir elected representatives, the name of Bismarck alone outweighed all\r\nelse. Bennigsen arranged a compromise and the required number of men was\r\nagreed to, not indeed permanently, but for seven years. For four years\r\nmore the alliance was continued.\r\n\r\nAt this time all other questions were thrown into the shade by the great\r\nconflict with the Roman Catholic Church on which the Government had\r\nembarked. Looking back now, it is still difficult to judge or even to\r\nunderstand the causes which brought it about. Both sides claim that they\r\nwere acting in self-defence. Bismarck has often explained his motives,\r\nbut we cannot be sure that those he puts forward were the only\r\nconsiderations by which he was moved. He, however, insisted that the\r\nstruggle was not religious but political; he was not moved by Protestant\r\nanimosity to the Catholic Church, but by his alarm lest in the\r\norganisation of the Roman hierarchy a power might arise within the\r\nEmpire which would be hostile to the State. But even if the Chancellor\r\nhimself was at first free from Protestant hatred to Catholicism,--and\r\nthis is not quite clear,--he was forced into alliance with a large party\r\nwho appealed at once to the memories of the Reformation, who stirred up\r\nall that latent hatred of Rome which is as strong a force in North\r\nGermany as in England; and with others who saw in this an opportunity\r\nfor more completely subduing all, Protestant and Catholic alike, to the\r\ntriumphant power of the State, and making one more step towards the\r\ndissociation of the State from any religious body.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the struggle was the proclamation of the\r\ninfallibility of the Pope. It might be thought that this change or\r\ndevelopment in the Constitution of the Roman Church was one which\r\nconcerned chiefly Roman Catholics. This is the view which Bismarck seems\r\nto have taken during the meetings of the Vatican Council. The opposition\r\nto the decrees was strongest among the German Bishops, and Prince\r\nHohenlohe, the Prime Minister of Bavaria, supported by his brother the\r\nCardinal, was anxious to persuade the Governments of Europe to\r\ninterfere, and, as they could have done, to prevent the Council from\r\ncoming to any conclusion. Bismarck refused on behalf of the Prussian\r\nGovernment to take any steps in this direction. The conclusion of the\r\nCouncil and the proclamation of the decrees took place just at the time\r\nof the outbreak of war with France. For some months Bismarck, occupied\r\nas he was with other matters, was unable to consider the changes which\r\nmight be caused; it was moreover very important for him during the\r\nnegotiations with Bavaria, which lasted all through the autumn, not to\r\ndo anything which would arouse the fears of the Ultramontanes or\r\nintensify their reluctance to enter the Empire.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1870 the first sign of the dangers ahead was to be\r\nseen. They arose from the occupation of Rome by the Italians. The\r\ninevitable result of this was that the Roman Catholics of all countries\r\nin Europe were at once given a common cause of political endeavour; they\r\nwere bound each of them in his own State to use his full influence to\r\nprocure interference either by diplomacy or by arms, and to work for the\r\nrescue of the prisoner of the Vatican. The German Catholics felt this as\r\nstrongly as their co-religionists, and, while he was still at\r\nVersailles, a cardinal and bishop of the Church addressed a memorial to\r\nthe King of Prussia on this matter. This attempt to influence the\r\nforeign policy of the new Empire, and to use it for a purpose alien to\r\nthe direct interest of Germany, was very repugnant to Bismarck and was\r\nquite sufficient to arouse feelings of hostility towards the Roman\r\nCatholics. These were increased when he heard that the Roman Catholic\r\nleaders were combining to form a new political party; in the elections\r\nfor the first Reichstag this movement was very successful and fifty\r\nmembers were returned whose sole bond of union was religion. This he\r\nlooked upon as \"a mobilisation of the Church against the State\"; the\r\nformation of a political party founded simply on unity of confession\r\nwas, he said, an unheard-of innovation in political life. His distrust\r\nincreased when he found that their leader was Windthorst, a former\r\nMinister of the King of Hanover, and, as a patriotic Hanoverian, one of\r\nthe chief opponents of a powerful and centralised Government. The\r\ninfluence the Church had in the Polish provinces was a further cause of\r\nhostility, and seemed to justify him in condemning them as anti-German.\r\nDuring the first session the new party prominently appeared on two\r\noccasions. In the debate on the address to the Crown they asked for the\r\ninterference of Germany on behalf of the Pope; in this they stood alone\r\nand on a division found no supporters. Then they demanded that in the\r\nConstitution of the Empire certain clauses from the Prussian\r\nConstitution should be introduced which would ensure freedom to all\r\nreligious denominations. Here they gained considerable support from some\r\nother parties.\r\n\r\nAn impartial observer will find it difficult to justify from these acts\r\nthe charge of disloyalty to the Empire, but a storm of indignation arose\r\nin the Press, especially in the organs of the National Liberal party,\r\nand it was supported by those of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe desire for conflict was awakened; meetings were held in the autumn\r\nof 1871 to defend the Protestant faith, which hardly seemed to have been\r\nattacked, and a clearer cause for dispute soon occurred. It was required\r\nby the authorities of the Church that all bishops and priests should\r\ndeclare their assent to the new Vatican decrees; the majority did so,\r\nbut a certain number refused; they were of course excommunicated; a\r\nsecession from the Roman Catholic Church took place, and a new communion\r\nformed to which the name of Old Catholics was given. The bishops\r\nrequired that all the priests and religious teachers at the universities\r\nand schools who had refused to obey the orders of the Pope should be\r\ndismissed from their office; the Prussian Government refused their\r\nassent. The legal question involved was a difficult one. The Government\r\nheld that as the Roman Catholic Church had changed its teachings, those\r\nwho maintained the old doctrine must be supported in the offices\r\nconferred on them. The Church authorities denied there had been any\r\nessential change. On the whole we may say that they were right; a priest\r\nof the Catholic Church held his position not only in virtue of his\r\nassent to the actual doctrines taught, but was also bound by his vow of\r\nobedience to accept any fresh teaching which, in accordance with the\r\nConstitution of the Church and by the recognised organ of Government,\r\nshould in the future also be declared to be of faith. The duty of every\r\nman to obey the laws applies not only to the laws existing at any\r\nmoment, but to any future laws which may be passed by the proper agent\r\nof legislation. Even though the doctrine of infallibility were a new\r\ndoctrine, which is very doubtful, it had been passed at a Council; and\r\nthe proceedings of the Council, even if, in some details, they were\r\nirregular, were not more so than those of any other Council in the past.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Government in supporting the Old Catholics may,\r\nhowever, be attributed to another motive. The Catholics maintained that\r\nBismarck desired to take this opportunity of creating a national German\r\nChurch, and reunite Protestants and Catholics. To have done so, had it\r\nbeen possible, would have been indeed to confer on the country the\r\ngreatest of all blessings. We cannot doubt that the thought had often\r\ncome into Bismarck's mind; it would be the proper and fitting conclusion\r\nto the work of creating a nation. It was, however, impossible; under no\r\ncircumstances could it have been done by a Protestant statesman; the\r\nimpulse must have come from Bavaria, and the opposition of the Bavarian\r\nbishops to the Vatican decrees had been easily overcome. Twice an\r\nopportunity had presented itself of making a national German Church:\r\nonce at the Reformation, once after the Revolution. On both occasions it\r\nwas lost and it will never recur.\r\n\r\nThe result, however, was that a bitter feeling of opposition was created\r\nbetween Church and State. The secessionist priests were maintained in\r\ntheir positions by the Government, they were excommunicated by the\r\nbishops; students were forbidden to attend their lectures and the people\r\nto worship in the churches where they ministered. It spread even to the\r\narmy, when the Minister of War required the army chaplain at Cologne to\r\ncelebrate Mass in a church which was used also by the Old Catholics. He\r\nwas forbidden to do so by his bishop, and the bishop was in consequence\r\ndeprived of his salary and threatened with arrest.\r\n\r\nThe conflict having once begun soon spread; a new Minister of Culture\r\nwas appointed; in the Reichstag a law was proposed expelling the Jesuits\r\nfrom Germany; and a number of important laws, the so-called May laws,\r\nwere introduced into the Prussian Parliament, giving to the State great\r\npowers with regard to the education and appointment of priests; it was,\r\nfor instance, ordered that no one should be appointed to a cure of\r\nsouls who was not a German, and had not been brought up and educated in\r\nthe State schools and universities of Prussia. Then other laws were\r\nintroduced, to which we have already referred, making civil marriage\r\ncompulsory, so as to cripple the very strong power which the Roman\r\nCatholic priests could exercise, not only by refusing their consent to\r\nmixed marriages, but also by refusing to marry Old Catholics; a law was\r\nintroduced taking the inspection of elementary schools out of the hands\r\nof the clergy, and finally a change was made in those articles of the\r\nPrussian Constitution which ensured to each denomination the management\r\nof its own affairs. Bismarck was probably not responsible for the\r\ndrafting of all these laws; he only occasionally took part in the\r\ndiscussion and was often away from Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between these proposals and the principles he had\r\nmaintained in his earlier years was very marked; his old friend Kleist\r\nrecalled the eloquent speech which in former years he had made against\r\ncivil marriage. Bismarck did not attempt to defend himself against the\r\ncharge of inconsistency; he did not even avow that he had changed his\r\npersonal opinions; he had, however, he said, learnt to submit his\r\npersonal convictions to the requirements of the State; he had only done\r\nso unwillingly and by a great struggle. This was to be the end of the\r\ndoctrine of the Christian State. With Gneist, Lasker, Virchow, he was\r\nsubduing the Church to this new idol of the State; he was doing that\r\nagainst which in the old days he had struggled with the greatest\r\nresolution and spoken with the greatest eloquence. Not many years were\r\nto go by before he began to repent of what he had done, for, as he saw\r\nthe new danger from Social Democracy, he like many other Germans\r\nbelieved that the true means of defeating it was to be found in\r\nincreased intensity of religious conviction. It was, however, then too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nHe, however, especially in the Prussian Upper House, threw all the\r\nweight of his authority into the conflict. It was, he said, not a\r\nreligious conflict but a political one; they were not actuated by hatred\r\nof Catholicism, but they were protecting the rights of the State.\r\n\r\n  \"The question at issue,\" he said, \"is not a struggle of an\r\n  Evangelical dynasty against the Catholic Church; it is the old\r\n  struggle ... a struggle for power as old as the human race ...\r\n  between king and priest ... a struggle which is much older than\r\n  the appearance of our Redeemer in this world.... a struggle which\r\n  has filled German history of the Middle Ages till the destruction\r\n  of the German Empire, and which found its conclusion when the\r\n  last representative of the glorious Swabian dynasty died on the\r\n  scaffold, under the axe of a French conqueror who stood in\r\n  alliance with the Pope.[12] We are not far from an analogous\r\n  solution of the situation, always translated into the customs of\r\n  our time.\"\r\n\r\nHe assured the House that now, as always, he would defend the Empire\r\nagainst internal and external enemies. \"Rest assured we will not go to\r\nCanossa,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking this struggle with the Church he had two enemies to\r\ncontend with--the Pope and the government of the Church on the one side,\r\non the other the Catholic population of Germany. He tried to come to\r\nsome agreement with the Pope and to separate the two; it seemed in fact\r\nas if the real enemy to be contended against was not the foreign\r\npriesthood, but the Catholic Democracy in Germany. All Bismarck's\r\nefforts to separate the two and to procure the assistance of the Pope\r\nagainst the party of the Centre were to be unavailing; for some years\r\nall official communication between the German Government and the Papal\r\nSee was broken off. It was not till the death of Pius IX. and the\r\naccession of a more liberal-minded Pope that communication was restored;\r\nthen we are surprised to find Bismarck appealing to the Pope to use his\r\ninfluence on the Centre in order to persuade them to vote for a proposed\r\nincrease in the German army. This is a curious comment on the boast, \"We\r\nwill not go to Canossa.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is that in undertaking the conflict and associating himself\r\nwith the anti-Clerical party Bismarck had stirred up an enemy whom he\r\nwas not able to overcome. He soon found that the priests and the\r\nCatholics were men of a different calibre to the Liberals. They dared to\r\ndo what none of the Progressives had ventured on--they disobeyed the\r\nlaw. With them it was not likely that the conflict would be confined to\r\nParliamentary debates. The Government attempted to meet this resistance,\r\nbut in vain. The priests were deprived of their cures, bishops were\r\nthrown into prison, nearly half the Catholic parishes in Prussia were\r\ndeprived of their spiritual shepherds, the churches were closed, there\r\nwas no one to celebrate baptisms or weddings. Against this resistance\r\nwhat could the Government do? The people supported the leaders of the\r\nparty, and a united body of one hundred members under Windhorst, ablest\r\nof Parliamentary leaders, was committed to absolute opposition to every\r\nGovernment measure so long as the conflict continued. Can we be\r\nsurprised that as the years went on Bismarck looked with some concern on\r\nthe result of the struggle he had brought about?\r\n\r\nHe attempted to conceal the failure: \"The result will be,\" he said,\r\n\"that we shall have two great parties--one which supports and maintains\r\nthe State, and another which attacks it. The former will be the great\r\nmajority and it will be formed in the school of conflict.\" These words\r\nare the strongest condemnation of his policy. It could not be wise for\r\nany statesman to arrange that party conflict should take the form of\r\nloyalty and disloyalty to the Empire.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that his sense of failure helped to bring\r\nabout a feeling of enmity towards the National Liberals. Suddenly in the\r\nspring of 1877 he sent in his resignation. There were, however, other\r\nreasons for doing this. He had become aware that the financial policy of\r\nthe Empire had not been successful; on every side it seemed that new\r\nblood and new methods were required. In financial matters he had little\r\nexperience or authority; he had to depend on his colleagues and he\r\ncomplained of their unfruitfulness. Influenced perhaps by his perception\r\nof this, under the pretext--a genuine pretext--of ill-health, he asked\r\nthe Emperor to relieve him of his offices. The Emperor refused. \"Never,\"\r\nhe wrote on the side of the minute. Instead he granted to Bismarck\r\nunlimited leave of absence. In the month of April the Chancellor retired\r\nto Varzin; for ten months he was absent from Berlin, and when he\r\nreturned, recruited in health, in February, 1878, it was soon apparent\r\nthat a new period in his career and in the history of the Empire was to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIPLE ALLIANCE AND ECONOMIC REFORM.\r\n\r\n1878-1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1878 forms a turning-point both in internal and in external\r\npolitics. Up to this year Prussia has been allied with the two Eastern\r\nmonarchies; the Empire has been governed by the help of the National\r\nLiberal party; the chief enemy has been the Clericals. The traditions of\r\nthe time before the war are still maintained. After this year the\r\nunderstanding with Russia breaks down; instead of it the peace of Europe\r\nis preserved by the Triple Alliance with Austria and Italy. In internal\r\naffairs the change is even more marked; the rising power of the\r\nSocialists is the enemy to be fought against; for this conflict, peace\r\nhas to be made with the Catholics--the May laws are modified or\r\nrepealed. The alliance with Liberalism breaks down, and the efforts of\r\nthe Government are devoted to a far-reaching scheme of financial reform\r\nand social legislation.\r\n\r\nWhen, in April, 1877, the Emperor refused to accept Bismarck's\r\nresignation, the whole country applauded the decision. In the Reichstag\r\na great demonstration was made of confidence in the Chancellor. Everyone\r\nfelt that he could not be spared at a time when the complications in the\r\nEast were bringing new dangers upon Europe, and in the seclusion of\r\nVarzin he did not cease during the next months to direct the foreign\r\npolicy of the Empire. He was able with the other Governments of Europe\r\nto prevent the spread of hostilities from Turkey to the rest of Europe,\r\nand when the next year the English Government refused its assent to the\r\nprovisional peace of San Stefano, it was the unanimous desire of all the\r\nother States that the settlement of Turkey should be submitted to a\r\nCongress at Berlin over which he should preside. It was the culmination\r\nof his public career; it was the recognition by Europe in the most\r\nimpressive way of his primacy among living statesmen. In his management\r\nof the Congress he answered to the expectations formed of him. \"We do\r\nnot wish to go,\" he had said, \"the way of Napoleon; we do not desire to\r\nbe the arbitrators or schoolmasters of Europe. We do not wish to force\r\nour policy on other States by appealing to the strength of our army. I\r\nlook on our task as a more useful though a humbler one; it is enough if\r\nwe can be an honest broker.\" He succeeded in the task he had set before\r\nhimself, and in reconciling the apparently incompatible desires of\r\nEngland and Russia. Again and again when the Congress seemed about to\r\nbreak up without result he made himself the spokesman of Russian wishes,\r\nand conveyed them to Lord Beaconsfield, the English plenipotentiary.\r\nNone the less the friendship of Russia, which had before wavered, now\r\nbroke down. A bitter attack on Germany and Bismarck was begun in the\r\nRussian Press; the new German fiscal policy led to misunderstandings;\r\nthe Czar in private letters to the Emperor demanded in the negotiations\r\nthat were still going on the absolute and unconditional support of\r\nGermany to all Russian demands as the condition of Russian friendship.\r\nIn the autumn of the next year matters came near to war; it was in these\r\ncircumstances that Bismarck brought about that alliance which ever since\r\nthen has governed European politics. He hastily arranged a meeting with\r\nCount Andrassy, the Austrian Minister, and in a few days the two\r\nstatesmen agreed on a defensive alliance between the two Empires. Many\r\nyears later, in 1886, the instrument of alliance was published. It was\r\nagreed that if either of the German States was attacked by Russia the\r\nother would join to defend it; if either was attacked by France the\r\nother would observe neutrality; but if the French were supported by\r\nRussia then the first clause would come into force. The Emperor of\r\nAustria willingly gave his assent; it was only after a prolonged\r\nstruggle that Bismarck was able to gain the assent of his own sovereign.\r\nThis alliance, which in the next year was joined by Italy, again gave\r\nGermany the ruling position in Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring this crisis in foreign affairs Bismarck was occupied by another,\r\nwhich threatened to be equally serious, in home politics. In the spring\r\nof 1878 an attempt was made on the life of the Emperor; a young man,\r\nnamed Hobel, a shoemaker's apprentice, shot at him in the streets of\r\nBerlin, fortunately without result. The attempt naturally created\r\nintense indignation throughout the country. This was increased when it\r\nbecame known that he had been to some extent connected with the\r\nSocialist party, and it seemed as though the motives of the crime were\r\nsupplied by the violent speeches made at Socialist gatherings. Bismarck\r\nhad long regarded the growth of Socialism with concern. He determined to\r\nuse this opportunity to crush it. He at once brought into the Bundesrath\r\na very severe law, forbidding all Socialist agitation and propaganda. He\r\nsucceeded in passing it through the Council, but it was thrown out in\r\nthe Reichstag by a very large majority. No one voted for it except the\r\nConservatives. The law indeed was so drawn up that one does not see how\r\nanyone could have voted for it; the first clause began, \"Printed\r\nwritings and unions which follow the aims of Social Democracy may be\r\nforbidden by the Federal Council,\" but, as was pointed out, among the\r\naims of Social Democracy were many which were good in themselves, and\r\nmany others which, though they might be considered harmful by other\r\nparties, were at least legitimate. Directly afterwards the Reichstag was\r\nprorogued. Ten days later, another attempt was made on the Emperor's\r\nlife; this time a man of the name of Nobeling (an educated man who had\r\nstudied at the University) shot at him while driving in the Unter den\r\nLinden, and wounded him severely in the head and arms with large shot.\r\nThe Emperor was driven home to his palace almost unconscious, and for\r\nsome time his life was in danger. This second attempt in so short a time\r\non the life of a man almost eighty years of age, so universally loved\r\nand respected, who had conferred such benefits on his country, naturally\r\naroused a storm of indignation. When Bismarck received the news his\r\nfirst words were, \"Now the Reichstag must be dissolved.\" This was done;\r\nthe general elections took place while the excitement was still hot, and\r\nof course resulted in a great loss to those parties--especially the\r\nNational Liberals--who had voted against the Socialist law; the Centre\r\nalone retained its numbers. Before this new Parliament a fresh law was\r\nlaid, drafted with much more skill. It absolutely forbade all speeches\r\nor writing in favour of plans for overthrowing the order of society, or\r\ndirected against marriage and property. It enabled the Government to\r\nproclaim in all large towns a state of siege, and to expel from them by\r\nthe mere decree of the police anyone suspected of Socialist agitation.\r\nThe law, which was easily carried, was enforced with great severity; a\r\nstate of siege was proclaimed in Berlin and many other places. Socialist\r\npapers, and even books, for instance the writings of Lassalle, were\r\nforbidden; they might not even be read in public libraries; and for the\r\nnext twelve years the Socialist party had to carry on their propaganda\r\nby secret means.\r\n\r\nThis Socialist law is very disappointing; we find the Government again\r\nhaving recourse to the same means for checking and guiding opinion which\r\nMetternich had used fifty years before. Not indeed that the Socialists\r\nthemselves had any ground for complaint; their avowed end was the\r\noverthrow of government and society; they professed to be at war with\r\nall established institutions; if they confined their efforts to legal\r\nmeasures and did not use violence, it was only because the time had not\r\nyet come. The men who avowed admiration for the Paris Commune, who were\r\nopenly preparing for a revolution more complete than any which Europe\r\nhad hitherto seen, could not complain if the Government, while there was\r\nyet time, used every means for crushing them. The mistake was in\r\nsupposing that this measure would be successful. Bismarck would, indeed,\r\nhad he been able, have made it far more severe; his own idea was that\r\nanyone who had been legally convicted of holding Socialist opinions\r\nshould be deprived of the franchise and excluded from the Parliament.\r\nWhat a misunderstanding does this shew of the whole object and nature of\r\nrepresentative institutions! It had been decided that in Germany\r\nParliament was not to govern; what then was its function except to\r\ndisplay the opinions of the people? If, as was the case, so large a\r\nproportion of the German nation belonged to a party of discontent, then\r\nit was above all desirable that their wishes and desires should have\r\nopen expression, and be discussed where they could be overthrown. The\r\nGovernment had enormous means of influencing opinion. In the old days\r\nthe men of letters had been on principle in opposition; now Germany was\r\nflooded by papers, books, and pamphlets; all devoted to the most\r\nextravagant praise of the new institutions. The excuse which was made\r\nfor these laws was not a sufficient one. It is seldom necessary to meet\r\npolitical assassination by repressive measures, for they must always\r\ncreate a danger which they intend to avert. There was not the slightest\r\nground for supposing that either Hobel or Nobeling had any confederates;\r\nthere was no plot; it was but the wild and wicked action of an\r\nindividual. It was as absurd to put a large party under police control\r\nfor this reason as it was to punish Liberals for the action of Sand. And\r\nit was ineffective, as the events of the next years shewed; for the\r\nSocialist law did not spare Germany from the infection of outrage which\r\nin these years overran Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist laws were soon followed by other proposals of a more\r\nuseful kind, and now we come to one of the most remarkable episodes in\r\nBismarck's career. He was over sixty years of age; his health was\r\nuncertain; he had long complained of the extreme toil and the constant\r\nannoyance which his public duties brought upon him. It might appear that\r\nhe had finished his work, and, if he could not retire altogether, would\r\ngive over the management of all internal affairs to others. That he\r\nwould now take upon himself a whole new department of public duties,\r\nthat he would after his prolonged absence appear again as leader and\r\ninnovator in Parliamentary strife--this no one anticipated.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1876 he had taken little active part in finance; his\r\nenergies had been entirely absorbed by foreign affairs and he had been\r\ncontent to adopt and support the measures recommended by his technical\r\nadvisers. When he had interfered at all it had only been on those\r\noccasions when, as with regard to commercial treaties, the policy of his\r\ncolleagues had impeded his own political objects. In 1864 he had been\r\nmuch annoyed because difference on commercial matters had interfered\r\nwith the good understanding with Austria, which at that time he was\r\ntrying to maintain. Since the foundation of the Empire almost the\r\ncomplete control over the commercial policy of the Empire had been\r\nentrusted to Delbrück, who held the very important post of President of\r\nthe Imperial Chancery, and was treated by Bismarck with a deference and\r\nconsideration which no other of his fellow-workers received, except\r\nMoltke and Roon. Delbrück was a confirmed Free-Trader, and the result\r\nwas that, partly by commercial treaties, and partly by the abolition of\r\ncustoms dues, the tariff had been reduced and simplified. The years\r\nfollowing the war had, however, not been altogether prosperous; a great\r\noutbreak of speculation was followed in 1873 by a serious commercial\r\ncrisis. And since that year there had been a permanent decrease in the\r\nImperial receipts. This was, for political reasons, a serious\r\ninconvenience. By the arrangement made in 1866 the proceeds of the\r\ncustoms and of the indirect taxation (with some exceptions) were paid\r\ninto the Exchequer of the Federation, and afterwards of the Empire. If\r\nthe receipts from these sources were not sufficient to meet the Imperial\r\nrequirements, the deficit had to be made up by contributions paid (in\r\nproportion to their population) by the separate States. During later\r\nyears these contributions had annually increased, and it is needless to\r\npoint out that this was sufficient to make the relations of the State\r\nGovernments to the central authorities disagreeable, and to cause some\r\ndiscontent with the new Constitution. This meant also an increase of the\r\namount which had to be raised by direct taxation. Now Bismarck had\r\nalways much disliked direct taxes; he had again and again pointed out\r\nthat they were paid with great reluctance, and often fell with peculiar\r\nhardship on that very large class which could only just, by constant and\r\nassiduous labour, make an income sufficient for their needs. Worst of\r\nall was it when they were unable to pay even the few shillings required;\r\nthey then had to undergo the hardship and disgrace of distraint, and see\r\ntheir furniture seized and sold by the tax-collectors. He had therefore\r\nalways wished that the income derived from customs and indirect taxation\r\nshould be increased so as by degrees to do away with the necessity for\r\ndirect taxation, and if this could be done, then, instead of the States\r\npaying an annual contribution to the Empire, they would receive from the\r\ncentral Government pecuniary assistance.\r\n\r\nThe dislike of direct taxation is an essential part of Bismarck's\r\nreform; he especially disapproved of the Prussian system, the barbarous\r\nsystem, as he called it, according to which every man had to pay a small\r\nportion, it might be even a few _groschen_, in direct taxes.\r\n\r\n  \"I ascribe,\" he said, \"the large part of our emigration\r\n  to the fact that the emigrant wishes to escape the\r\n  direct pressure of the taxes and execution, and to go to\r\n  a land where the _klassensteuer_ does not exist, and where\r\n  he will also have the pleasure of knowing that the produce\r\n  of his labours will be protected against foreign\r\n  interference.\"\r\n\r\nHis opinion cannot be called exaggerated if it is true that, as he\r\nstated, there were every year over a million executions involving the\r\nseizure and sale of household goods on account of arrears of taxation.\r\nIt was not only the State taxes to which he objected; the local rates\r\nfor municipal expenses, and especially for education, fell very heavily\r\non the inhabitants of large cities such as Berlin. He intended to devote\r\npart of the money which was raised by indirect taxation to relieving the\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nHis first proposals for raising the money were of a very sweeping\r\nnature. He wished to introduce a State monopoly for the sale of tobacco,\r\nbrandy, and beer. He entered into calculations by which he proved that\r\nwere his policy adopted all direct taxation might be repealed, and he\r\nwould have a large surplus for an object which he had very much at\r\nheart--the provision of old-age pensions. It was a method of legislation\r\ncopied from that which prevails in France and Italy. He pointed out with\r\nperfect justice that the revenue raised in Germany from the consumption\r\nof tobacco was much smaller than it ought to be. The total sum gained by\r\nthe State was not a tenth of that which was produced in England by the\r\ntaxing of tobacco, but no one could maintain that smoking was more\r\ncommon in England than in Germany. In fact tobacco was less heavily\r\ntaxed in Germany than in any other country in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn introducing a monopoly Bismarck intended and hoped not only to\r\nrelieve the pressure of direct taxation,--though this would have been a\r\nchange sufficient in its magnitude and importance for most men,--but\r\nproposed to use the very large sum which the Government would have at\r\nits disposal for the direct relief of the working classes. The Socialist\r\nlaw was not to go alone; he intended absolutely to stamp out this\r\nobnoxious agitation, but it was not from any indifference as to the\r\ncondition of the working classes. From his earliest days he had been\r\nopposed to the Liberal doctrine of _laissez-faire_; it will be\r\nremembered how much he had disliked the _bourgeois_ domination of the\r\nJuly Monarchy; as a young man he had tried to prevent the abolition of\r\nguilds. He considered that much of the distress and discontent arose\r\nfrom the unrestricted influence of capital. He was only acting in\r\naccordance with the oldest and best traditions of the Prussian Monarchy\r\nwhen he called in the power of the State to protect the poor. His plan\r\nwas a very bold one; he wished to institute a fund from which there\r\nshould be paid to every working man who was incapacitated by sickness,\r\naccident, or old age, a pension from the State. In his original plan he\r\nintended the working men should not be required to make any contribution\r\nthemselves towards this fund. It was not to be made to appear to them as\r\na new burden imposed on them by the State. The tobacco monopoly, he\r\nsaid, he looked on as \"the patrimony of the disinherited.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not fear the charge of Socialism which might be brought against\r\nhim; he defended himself by the provisions of the Prussian law. The Code\r\nof Frederick the Great contained the words:\r\n\r\n  \"It is the duty of the State to provide for the sustenance and support\r\n  of those of its citizens who cannot procure sustenance themselves\"; and\r\n  again, \"work adapted to their strength and capacity shall be supplied to\r\n  those who lack means and opportunity of earning a livelihood for\r\n  themselves and those dependent on them.\"\r\n\r\nIn the most public way the new policy was introduced by an Imperial\r\nmessage, on November 17, 1881, in which the Emperor expressed his\r\nconviction that the social difficulties could not be healed simply by\r\nthe repression of the exaggerations of Social Democracy, but at the same\r\ntime the welfare of the workmen must be advanced. This new policy had\r\nthe warm approval of both the Emperor and the Crown Prince; no one\r\ngreeted more heartily the change than Windthorst.\r\n\r\n  \"Allow me,\" he once said to Bismarck, \"to speak\r\n  openly: you have done me much evil in my life, but, as\r\n  a German patriot, I must confess to you my gratitude\r\n  that after all his political deeds you have persuaded our\r\n  Imperial Master to turn to this path of Social Reform.\"\r\n\r\nThere were, he said, difficulties to be met; he approved of the end, but\r\nnot of all the details,\r\n\r\n  \"and,\" he continued, \"something of the difficulty, if I\r\n  may say so, you cause yourself. You are often too stormy\r\n  for us; you are always coming with something new and\r\n  we cannot always follow you in it, but you must not\r\n  take that amiss. We are both old men and the Emperor\r\n  is much older than we are, but we should like ourselves\r\n  in our lifetime to see some of these reforms established.\r\n  That I wish for all of us and for our German country,\r\n  and we will do our best to help in it.\"\r\n\r\nOpinions may differ as to the wisdom of Bismarck's social and financial\r\npolicy; nobody can deny their admiration for the energy and patriotism\r\nwhich he displayed. It was no small thing for him, at his age, to come\r\nout of his comparative retirement to bring forward proposals which would\r\nbe sure to excite the bitterest opposition of the men with whom he had\r\nbeen working, to embark again on a Parliamentary conflict as keen as any\r\nof those which had so taxed his energies in his younger years. Not\r\ncontent with inaugurating and suggesting these plans, he himself\r\nundertook the immediate execution of them. In addition to his other\r\noffices, in 1880 he undertook that of Minister of Trade in Prussia, for\r\nhe found no one whom he could entirely trust to carry out his proposals.\r\nDuring the next years he again took a prominent part in the\r\nParliamentary debates; day after day he attended to answer objections\r\nand to defend his measures in some of his ablest and longest speeches.\r\nBy his proposals for a duty on corn he regained the support of most of\r\nthe Conservatives, but in the Reichstag which was elected in 1884 he\r\nfound himself opposed by a majority consisting of the Centre,\r\nSocialists, and Progressives. Many of the laws were rejected or\r\namended, and it was not until 1890 that, in a modified form, the whole\r\nof the social legislation had been carried through.\r\n\r\nFor the monopoly he gained no support; scarcely a voice was raised in\r\nits favour, nor can we be surprised at this. It was a proposal very\r\ncharacteristic of his internal policy; he had a definite aim in view and\r\nat once took the shortest, boldest, and most direct road towards it,\r\nputting aside the thought of all further consequences. In this others\r\ncould not follow him; quite apart from the difficulties of organisation\r\nand the unknown effect of the law on all those who gained their\r\nlivelihood by the growth, preparation, and sale of tobacco, there was a\r\ndeep feeling that it was not safe to entrust the Government with so\r\nenormous a power. Men did not wish to see so many thousands enrolled in\r\nthe army of officials, already too great; they did not desire a new\r\ncheck on the freedom of life and occupation, nor that the Government\r\nshould have the uncontrolled use of so great a sum of money. And then\r\nthe use he proposed to make of the proceeds: if the calculations were\r\ncorrect, if the results were what he foretold, if from this monopoly\r\nthey would be able to pay not only the chief expenses of the Government\r\nbut also assign an old-age pension to every German workman who reached\r\nthe age of seventy--what would this be except to make the great majority\r\nof the nation prospective pensioners of the State? With compulsory\r\nattendance at the State schools; with the State universities as the only\r\nentrance to public life and professions; when everyone for three years\r\nhad to serve in the army; when so large a proportion of the population\r\nearned their livelihood in the railways, the post-office, the customs,\r\nthe administration--the State had already a power and influence which\r\nmany besides the Liberals regarded with alarm. What would it be when\r\nevery working man looked forward to receiving, after his working days\r\nwere over, a free gift from the Government? Could not this power be used\r\nfor political measures also; could not it become a means for checking\r\nthe freedom of opinions and even for interfering in the liberty of\r\nvoting?\r\n\r\nHe had to raise the money he wanted in another way, and, in 1879, he\r\nbegan the great financial change that he had been meditating for three\r\nyears; he threw all his vigour into overthrowing Free Trade and\r\nintroducing a general system of Protection.\r\n\r\nIn this he was only doing what a large number of his countrymen desired.\r\nThe results of Free Trade had not been satisfactory. In 1876 there was a\r\ngreat crisis in the iron trade; owing to overproduction there was a\r\ngreat fall of prices in England, and Germany was being flooded with\r\nEnglish goods sold below cost price. Many factories had to be closed,\r\nowners were ruined, and men thrown out of work; it happened that, by a\r\nlaw passed in 1873, the last duty on imported iron would cease on the\r\n31st of December, 1876. Many of the manufacturers and a large party in\r\nthe Reichstag petitioned that the action of the law might at any rate be\r\nsuspended. Free-Traders, however, still had a majority, for the greater\r\nportion of the National Liberals belonged to that school, and the law\r\nwas carried out. It was, however, apparent that not only the iron but\r\nother industries were threatened. The building of railways in Russia\r\nwould bring about an increased importation of Russian corn and\r\nthreatened the prosperity, not only of the large proprietors, but also\r\nof the peasants. It had always been the wise policy of the Prussian\r\nGovernment to maintain and protect by legislation the peasants, who were\r\nconsidered the most important class in the State. Then the trade in\r\nSwedish wood threatened to interfere with the profits from the German\r\nforests, an industry so useful to the health of the country and the\r\nprosperity of the Government. But if Free Trade would injure the market\r\nfor the natural products of the soil, it did not bring any compensating\r\nadvantages by helping industry. Germany was flooded with English\r\nmanufactures, so that even the home market was endangered, and every\r\nyear it became more apparent that foreign markets were being closed. The\r\nsanguine expectations of the Free-Traders had not been realised;\r\nAmerica, France, Russia, had high tariffs; German manufactured goods\r\nwere excluded from these countries. What could they look forward to in\r\nthe future but a ruined peasantry and the crippling of the iron and\r\nweaving industries? \"I had the impression,\" said Bismarck, \"that under\r\nFree Trade we were gradually bleeding to death.\"\r\n\r\nHe was probably much influenced in his new policy by Lothar Bucher, one\r\nof his private secretaries, who was constantly with him at Varzin.\r\nBucher, who had been an extreme Radical, had, in 1849, been compelled\r\nto fly from the country and had lived many years in England. In 1865 he\r\nhad entered Bismarck's service. He had acquired a peculiar enmity to the\r\nCobden Club, and looked on that institution as the subtle instrument of\r\na deep-laid plot to persuade other nations to adopt a policy which was\r\nentirely for the benefit of England. He drew attention to Cobden's\r\nwords--\"All we desire is the prosperity and greatness of England.\" We\r\nmay in fact look on the Cobden Club and the principles it advocated from\r\ntwo points of view. Either they are, as Bucher maintained, simply\r\nEnglish and their only result will be the prosperity of England, or they\r\nare merely one expression of a general form of thought which we know as\r\nLiberalism; it was an attempt to create cosmopolitan institutions and to\r\ninduce German politicians to take their economic doctrines from England,\r\njust as a few years before they had taken their political theories. In\r\neither case these doctrines would be very distasteful to Bismarck, who\r\ndisliked internationalism in finance as much as he did in constitutional\r\nlaw or Socialist propaganda.\r\n\r\nBismarck in adopting Protection was influenced, not by economic theory,\r\nbut by the observation of facts. \"All nations,\" he said, \"which have\r\nProtective duties enjoy a certain prosperity; what great advantages has\r\nAmerica reached since it threatened to reduce duties twice, five times,\r\nten times as high as ours!\" England alone clung to Free Trade, and why?\r\nBecause she had grown so strong under the old system of Protection that\r\nshe could now as a Hercules step down into the arena and challenge\r\neveryone to come into the lists. In the arena of commerce England was\r\nthe strongest. This was why she advocated Free Trade, for Free Trade was\r\nreally the right of the most powerful. English interests were furthered\r\nunder the veil of the magic word Freedom, and by it German enthusiasts\r\nfor liberty were enticed to bring about the ruin and exploitation of\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the matter purely from the economic point of view, it is\r\nindeed difficult to see what benefits Germany would gain from a policy\r\nof Free Trade. It was a poor country; if it was to maintain itself in\r\nthe modern rivalry of nations, it must become rich. It could only become\r\nrich through manufactures, and manufactures had no opportunity of\r\ngrowing unless they had some moderate protection from foreign\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Bismarck's attention to finance was not limited to these\r\ngreat reforms; he directed the whole power of the Government to the\r\nsupport of all forms of commercial enterprise and to the removal of all\r\nhindrances to the prosperity of the nation. To this task he devoted\r\nhimself with the same courage and determination which he had formerly\r\nshewn in his diplomatic work.\r\n\r\nOne essential element in the commercial reform was the improvement of\r\nthe railways. Bismarck's attention had long been directed to the\r\ninconveniences which arose from the number of private companies, whose\r\nduty it was to regard the dividends of the shareholders rather than the\r\ninterests of the public. The existence of a monopoly of this kind in\r\nprivate hands seemed to him indefensible. His attention was especially\r\ndirected to the injury done to trade by the differential rate imposed on\r\ngoods traffic; on many lines it was the custom to charge lower rates on\r\nimported than on exported goods, and this naturally had a very bad\r\neffect on German manufactures. He would have liked to remedy all these\r\ndeficiencies by making all railways the property of the Empire (we see\r\nagain his masterful mind, which dislikes all compromise); in this,\r\nhowever, he was prevented by the opposition of the other States, who\r\nwould not surrender the control of their own lines. In Prussia he was\r\nable to carry out this policy of purchase of all private lines by the\r\nState; by the time he laid down the Ministry of Commerce hardly any\r\nprivate companies remained. The acquisition of all the lines enabled the\r\nGovernment greatly to improve the communication, to lower fares, and to\r\nintroduce through communications; all this of course greatly added to\r\nthe commercial enterprise and therefore the wealth of the country.\r\n\r\nHe was now also able to give degrees his encouragement and support to\r\nthose Germans who for many years in countries beyond the sea had been\r\nattempting to lay the foundations for German commerce and even to\r\nacquire German colonies. Bismarck's attitude in this matter deserves\r\ncareful attention. As early as 1874 he had been approached by German\r\ntravellers to ask for the support of the Government in a plan for\r\nacquiring German colonies in South Africa. They pointed out that here\r\nwas a country fitted by its climate for European occupation; the\r\npresent inhabitants of a large portion of it, the Boers, were anxious to\r\nestablish their independence of England and would welcome German\r\nsupport. It was only necessary to acquire a port, either at Santa Lucia\r\nor at Delagoa Bay, to receive a small subsidy from the Government, and\r\nthen private enterprise would divert the stream of German emigration\r\nfrom North America to South Africa. Bismarck, though he gave a courteous\r\nhearing to this proposal, could not promise them assistance, for, as he\r\nsaid, the political situation was not favourable. He must foresee that\r\nan attempt to carry out this or similar plans would inevitably bring\r\nabout very serious difficulties with England, and he had always been\r\naccustomed to attach much importance to his good understanding with the\r\nEnglish Government. During the following years, however, the situation\r\nwas much altered. First of all, great enterprise had been shewn by the\r\nGerman merchants and adventurers in different parts of the world,\r\nespecially in Africa and in the Pacific. They, in those difficulties\r\nwhich will always occur when white traders settle in half-civilised\r\nlands, applied for support to the German Government. Bismarck, as he\r\nhimself said, did not dare to refuse them this support.\r\n\r\n  \"I approached the matter with some reluctance; I\r\n  asked myself, how could I justify it, if I said to these\r\n  enterprising men, over whose courage, enthusiasm, and\r\n  vigour I have been heartily pleased: 'That is all very\r\n  well, but the German Empire is not strong enough, it\r\n  would attract the ill-will of other States.' I had not the\r\n  courage as Chancellor to declare to them this bankruptcy\r\n  of the German nation for transmarine enterprises.\"\r\n\r\nIt must, however, happen that wherever these German settlers went, they\r\nwould be in the neighbourhood of some English colony, and however\r\nfriendly were the relations of the Governments of the two Powers,\r\ndisputes must occur in the outlying parts of the earth. In the first\r\nyears of the Empire Bismarck had hoped that German traders would find\r\nsufficient protection from the English authorities, and anticipated\r\ntheir taking advantage of the full freedom of trade allowed in the\r\nBritish colonies; they would get all the advantages which would arise\r\nfrom establishing their own colonies, while the Government would be\r\nspared any additional responsibility. He professed, however, to have\r\nlearnt by experience from the difficulties which came after the\r\nannexation of the Fiji Islands by Great Britain that this hope would not\r\nbe fulfilled; he acknowledged the great friendliness of the Foreign\r\nOffice, but complained that the Colonial Office regarded exclusively\r\nBritish interests. As a complaint coming from his mouth this arouses\r\nsome amusement; the Colonial Office expressed itself satisfied to have\r\nreceived from so high an authority a testimonial to its efficiency which\r\nit had rarely gained from Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe real change in the policy of the Empire must, however, be attributed\r\nnot to any imaginary shortcomings of the English authorities; it was an\r\ninevitable result of the abandonment of the policy of Free Trade, and\r\nof the active support which the Government was now giving to all forms\r\nof commercial enterprise. It was shewn, first of all, in the grant of\r\nsubsidies to mail steamers, which enabled German trade and German\r\ntravellers henceforward to be carried by German ships; before they had\r\ndepended entirely on English and French lines. It was not till 1884 that\r\nthe Government saw its way to undertake protection of German colonists.\r\nThey were enabled to do so by the great change which had taken place in\r\nthe political situation. Up to this time Germany was powerless to help\r\nor to injure England, but, on the other hand, required English support.\r\nAll this was changed by the occupation of Egypt. Here England required a\r\nsupport on the Continent against the indignation of France and the\r\njealousy of Russia. This could only be found in Germany, and therefore a\r\nclose approximation between the two countries was natural. Bismarck let\r\nit be known that England would find no support, but rather opposition,\r\nif she, on her side, attempted, as she so easily could have done, to\r\nimpede German colonial enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn his colonial policy Bismarck refused to take the initiative; he\r\nrefused, also, to undertake the direct responsibility for the government\r\nof their new possessions. He imitated the older English plan, and left\r\nthe government in the hands of private companies, who received a charter\r\nof incorporation; he avowedly was imitating the East India Company and\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company. The responsibilities of the German Government\r\nwere limited to a protection of the companies against the attack or\r\ninterference by any other Power, and a general control over their\r\nactions. In this way it was possible to avoid calling on the Reichstag\r\nfor any large sum, or undertaking the responsibility of an extensive\r\ncolonial establishment, for which at the time they had neither men nor\r\nexperience. Another reason against the direct annexation of foreign\r\ncountries lay in the Constitution of the Empire; it would have been\r\neasier to annex fresh land to Prussia; this could have been done by the\r\nauthority of the King; there was, however, no provision by which the\r\nBundesrath could undertake this responsibility, and it probably could\r\nnot be done even with the assent of the Reichstag unless some change\r\nwere made in the Constitution. It was, however, essential that the new\r\nacquisitions should be German and not Prussian.\r\n\r\nAll these changes were not introduced without much opposition; the\r\nProgressives especially distinguished themselves by their prolonged\r\nrefusal to assent even to the subsidies for German lines of steamers. In\r\nthe Parliament of 1884 they were enabled often to throw out the\r\nGovernment proposals. It was at this time that the conflict between\r\nBismarck and Richter reached its height. He complained, and justly\r\ncomplained, that the policy of the Progressives was then, as always,\r\nnegative. It is indeed strange to notice how we find reproduced in\r\nGermany that same feeling which a few years before had in England nearly\r\nled to the loss of the colonies and the destruction of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is too soon even now to consider fully the result of this new\r\npolicy; the introduction of Protection has indeed, if we are to judge by\r\nappearances, brought about a great increase in the prosperity of the\r\ncountry; whether the scheme for old-age pensions will appease the\r\ndiscontent of the working man seems very doubtful. One thing, however,\r\nwe must notice: the influence of the new policy is far greater than the\r\nimmediate results of the actual laws passed. It has taught the Germans\r\nto look to the Government not only as a means of protecting them against\r\nthe attacks of other States, but to see in it a thoughtful, and I think\r\nwe may say kindly, guardian of their interests. They know that every\r\nattempt of each individual to gain wealth or power for his country will\r\nbe supported and protected by the Government; they know that there is\r\nconstant watchfulness as to the dangers to life and health which arise\r\nfrom the conditions of modern civilisation. In these laws, in fact,\r\nBismarck, who deeply offended and irretrievably alienated the survivors\r\nof his own generation, won over and secured for himself and also for the\r\nGovernment the complete loyalty of the rising generation. It might be\r\nsupposed that this powerful action on the part of the State would\r\ninterfere with private enterprise; the result shews that this is not the\r\ncase. A watchful and provident Government really acts as an incentive to\r\neach individual. Let us also recognise that Bismarck was acting exactly\r\nas in the old days every English Government acted, when the foreign\r\npolicy was dictated by the interests of British trade and the home\r\npolicy aimed at preserving, protecting, and assisting the different\r\nclasses in the community.\r\n\r\nBismarck has often been called a reactionary, and yet we find that by\r\nthe social legislation he was the first statesman deliberately to apply\r\nhimself to the problem which had been created by the alteration in the\r\nstructure of society. Even if the solutions which he proposed do not\r\nprove in every case to have been the best, he undoubtedly foresaw what\r\nwould be the chief occupation for the statesmen of the future. In these\r\nreforms he had, however, little help from the Reichstag; the Liberals\r\nwere bitterly opposed, the Socialists sceptical and suspicious, the\r\nCatholics cool and unstable allies; during these years the chronic\r\nquarrel between himself and Parliament broke out with renewed vigour.\r\nHow bitterly did he deplore party spirit, the bane of German life, which\r\nseemed each year to gain ground!\r\n\r\n\"It has,\" he said, \"transferred itself to our modern public life and the\r\nParliaments; the Governments, indeed, stand together, but in the German\r\nReichstag I do not find that guardian of liberty for which I had hoped.\r\nParty spirit has overrun us. This it is which I accuse before God and\r\nhistory, if the great work of our people achieved between 1866 and 1870\r\nfall into decay, and in this House we destroy by the pen what has been\r\ncreated by the sword.\"\r\n\r\nIn future years it will perhaps be regarded as one of his chief claims\r\nthat he refused to become a party leader. He saved Germany from a\r\nserious danger to which almost every other country in Europe which has\r\nattempted to adopt English institutions has fallen a victim--the\r\nsacrifice of national welfare to the integrity and power of a\r\nParliamentary fraction. His desire was a strong and determined\r\nGovernment, zealously working for the benefit of all classes, quick to\r\nsee and foresee present and future evil; he regarded not the personal\r\nwishes of individuals, but looked only in each matter he undertook to\r\nits effect on the nation as a whole. \"I will accept help,\" he said,\r\n\"wherever I may get it. I care not to what party any man belongs. I have\r\nno intention of following a party policy; I used to do so when I was a\r\nyoung and angry member of a party, but it is impossible for a Prussian\r\nor German Minister.\" Though the Constitution had been granted, he did\r\nnot wish to surrender the oldest and best traditions of the Prussian\r\nMonarchy; and even if the power of the King and Emperor was limited and\r\nchecked by two Parliaments it was still his duty, standing above all\r\nparties, to watch over the country as a hundred years before his\r\nancestors had done.\r\n\r\nHis power, however, was checked by the Parliaments. Bismarck often\r\nsighed for a free hand; he longed to be able to carry out his reforms\r\ncomplete and rounded as they lay clear before him in his own brain; how\r\noften did he groan under all the delay, the compromise, the surrender,\r\nwhich was imposed upon him when, conscious as he was that he was only\r\nstriving for the welfare of his country, he had to win over not only the\r\nKing, not only his colleagues in the Prussian Ministry, his\r\nsubordinates, who had much power to check and impede his actions, but,\r\nabove all, the Parliaments. It was inevitable that his relation to them\r\nshould often be one of conflict; it was their duty to submit to a\r\nsearching criticism the proposals of the Government and to amend or\r\nreject them, and let us confess that it was better they were there. The\r\nmodifications they introduced in the bills he proposed were often\r\nimprovements; those they rejected were not always wise. The drafting of\r\nGovernment bills was often badly done; the first proposals for the\r\nSocialistic law, the original drafts of many of his economic reforms,\r\nwere all the better when they had been once rejected and were again\r\nbrought forward in a modified form. More than this, we must confess that\r\nBismarck did not possess that temperament which would make it wise to\r\nentrust him with absolute dictatorial power in internal matters. He\r\nattempted to apply to legislation habits he had learnt in diplomacy. And\r\nit is curious to notice Bismarck's extreme caution in diplomacy, where\r\nhe was a recognised master, and his rashness in legislation, where the\r\nground was often new to him. In foreign affairs a false move may easily\r\nbe withdrawn, a change of alliance quickly made; it often happens that\r\nspeed is more important than wisdom. In internal affairs it is\r\ndifferent; there, delay is in itself of value; moreover, false\r\nlegislation cannot be imposed with impunity, laws cannot be imposed and\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nBismarck often complained of the conduct of the Reichstag. There were in\r\nit two parties, the Socialists and the Centre, closely organised,\r\nadmirably disciplined, obedient to leaders who were in opposition by\r\nprinciple; they looked on the Parliamentary campaign as a struggle for\r\npower, and they maintained the struggle with a persistency and success\r\nwhich had not been surpassed by any Parliamentary Opposition in any\r\nother country. Apart from them the attitude of all the parties was\r\nnormally that of moderate criticism directed to the matter of the\r\nGovernment proposals. There were, of course, often angry scenes;\r\nBismarck himself did not spare his enemies, but we find no events which\r\nshew violence beyond what is, if not legitimate, at least inevitable in\r\nall Parliamentary assemblies. The main objects of the Government were\r\nalways attained; the military Budgets were always passed, though once\r\nnot until after a dissolution. In the contest with the Clerical party\r\nand the Socialists the Government had the full support of a large\r\nmajority. Even in the hostile Reichstag of 1884, in which the\r\nSocialists, Clericals, and Progressives together commanded a majority, a\r\nseries of important laws were passed. Once, indeed, the majority in\r\nopposition to the Government went beyond the limits of reason and honour\r\nwhen they refused a vote of £1000 for an additional director in the\r\nForeign Office. It was the expression of a jealousy which had no\r\njustification in facts; at the time the German Foreign Office was the\r\nbest managed department in Europe; the labour imposed on the secretaries\r\nwas excessive, and the nation could not help contrasting this vote with\r\nthe fact that shortly before a large number of the members had voted\r\nthat payments should be made to themselves. The nation could not help\r\nasking whether it would not gain more benefit from another £1000 a year\r\nexpended on the Foreign Office than from £50,000 a year for payment of\r\nmembers. Even this unfortunate action was remedied a few months later,\r\nwhen the vote was passed in the same Parliament by a majority of twenty.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all their internal differences and the extreme party\r\nspirit which often prevailed, the Reichstag always shewed determination\r\nin defending its own privileges. More than once Bismarck attacked them\r\nin the most tender points. At one time it was on the privileges of\r\nmembers and their freedom from arrest; both during the struggle with the\r\nClericals and with the Socialists the claim was made to arrest members\r\nduring the session for political utterances. When Berlin was subject to\r\na state of siege, the President of the Police claimed the right of\r\nexpelling from the capital obnoxious Socialist members. On these\r\noccasions the Government found itself confronted by the unanimous\r\nopposition of the whole House. In 1884, Bismarck proposed that the\r\nmeetings of the Reichstag should be biennial and the Budget voted for\r\ntwo years; the proposal was supported on the reasonable grounds that\r\nthereby inconvenience and press of work would be averted, which arose\r\nfrom the meeting of the Prussian and German Parliaments every winter.\r\nFew votes, however, could be obtained for a suggestion which seemed to\r\ncut away the most important privileges of Parliament.\r\n\r\nAnother of the great causes of friction between Bismarck and the\r\nParliament arose from the question as to freedom of debate. Both before\r\n1866, and since that year, he made several attempts to introduce laws\r\nthat members should be to some extent held responsible, and under\r\ncertain circumstances be brought before a court of law, in consequence\r\nof what they had said from their places in Parliament. This was\r\nrepresented as an interference with freedom of speech, and was bitterly\r\nresented. Bismarck, however, always professed, and I think truly, that\r\nhe did not wish to control the members in their opposition to the\r\nGovernment, but to place some check on their personal attacks on\r\nindividuals. A letter to one of his colleagues, written in 1883, is\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n  \"I have,\" he says, \"long learned the difficulties which educated\r\n  people, who have been well brought up, have to overcome in order\r\n  to meet the coarseness of our Parliamentary _Klopfechter_\r\n  [pugilists] with the necessary amount of indifference, and to\r\n  refuse them in one's own consciousness the undeserved honour of\r\n  moral equality. The repeated and bitter struggles in which you\r\n  have had to fight alone will have strengthened you in your\r\n  feeling of contempt for opponents who are neither honourable\r\n  enough nor deserve sufficient respect to be able to injure you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a serious evil arising from the want of the feeling of\r\nresponsibility in a Parliamentary assembly which had no great and\r\nhonourable traditions. He attempted to meet it by strengthening the\r\nauthority of the House over its own members; the Chairman did not\r\npossess any power of punishing breaches of decorum. Bismarck often\r\ncontrasted this with the very great powers over their own members\r\npossessed by the British Houses of Parliament. He drew attention to the\r\nprocedure by which, for instance, Mr. Plimsoll could be compelled to\r\napologise for hasty words spoken in a moment of passion. It is strange\r\nthat neither the Prussian nor the German Parliament consented to adopt\r\nrules which are really the necessary complement for the privileges of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were much disappointed by the constant quarrels and disputes\r\nwhich were so frequent in public life; they had hoped that with the\r\nunity of their country a new period would begin; they found that, as\r\nbefore, the management of public affairs was disfigured by constant\r\npersonal enmities and the struggle of parties. We must not, however,\r\nlook on this as a bad sign; it is rather more profitable to observe that\r\nthe new institutions were not affected or weakened by this friction. It\r\nwas a good sign for the future that the new State held together as\r\nfirmly as any old-established monarchy, and that the most important\r\nquestions of policy could be discussed and decided without even raising\r\nany point which might be a danger to the permanence of the Empire.\r\n\r\nBismarck himself did much to put his relations with the Parliament on a\r\nnew and better footing. Acting according to his general principle, he\r\nfelt that the first thing to be done was to induce mutual confidence by\r\nunrestrained personal intercourse. The fact that he himself was not a\r\nmember of the Parliament deprived him of those opportunities which an\r\nEnglish Minister enjoys. He therefore instituted, in 1868, a\r\nParliamentary reception. During the session, generally one day each\r\nweek, his house was opened to all members of the House. The invitations\r\nwere largely accepted, especially by the members of the National Liberal\r\nand Conservative parties. Those who were opponents on principle, the\r\nCentre, the Progressives, and the Socialists, generally stayed away.\r\nThese receptions became the most marked feature in the political life of\r\nthe capital, and they enabled many members to come under the personal\r\ncharm of the Chancellor. What an event was it in the life of the young\r\nand unknown Deputy from some obscure provincial town, when he found\r\nhimself sitting, perhaps, at the same table as the Chancellor, drinking\r\nthe beer which Bismarck had brought into honour at Berlin, and for which\r\nhis house was celebrated, and listening while, with complete freedom\r\nfrom all arrogance or pomposity, his host talked as only he could!\r\n\r\nThe weakest side of his administration lay in the readiness with which\r\nhe had recourse to the criminal law to defend himself against political\r\nadversaries. He was, indeed, constantly subjected to attacks in the\r\nPress, which were often unjust and sometimes unmeasured, but no man who\r\ntakes part in public life is exempt from calumny. He was himself never\r\nslow to attack his opponents, both personally in the Parliament, and\r\nstill more by the hired writers of the Press. None the less, to defend\r\nhimself from attacks, he too often brought his opponents into the police\r\ncourt, and _Bismarckbeleidigung_ became a common offence. Even the\r\neditor of _Kladderadatsch_ was once imprisoned. He must be held\r\npersonally responsible, for no action could be instituted without his\r\nown signature to the charge. We see the same want of generosity in the\r\nuse which he made of attempts, or reputed attempts, at assassination. In\r\n1875, while he was at Kissingen, a young man shot at him; he stated that\r\nhe had been led to do so owing to the attacks made on the Chancellor by\r\nthe Catholic party. No attempt, however, was made to prove that he had\r\nany accomplices; it was not even suggested that he was carrying out the\r\nwishes of the party. It was one of those cases which will always occur\r\nin political struggles, when a young and inexperienced man will be\r\nexcited by political speeches to actions which no one would foresee, and\r\nwhich would not be the natural result of the words to which he had\r\nlistened. Nevertheless, Bismarck was not ashamed publicly in the\r\nReichstag to taunt his opponents with the action, and to declare that\r\nwhether they would or not their party was Kuhlmann's party; \"he clings\r\nto your coat-tails,\" he said. A similar event had happened a few years\r\nbefore, when a young man had been arrested on the charge that he\r\nintended to assassinate the Chancellor. No evidence in support of the\r\ncharge was forthcoming, but the excuse was taken by the police for\r\nsearching the house of one of the Catholic leaders with whom the accused\r\nhad lived. No incriminating documents of any kind were found, but among\r\nthe private papers was the correspondence between the leaders in the\r\nparty of the Centre dealing with questions of party organisation and\r\npolitical tactics. The Government used these private papers for\r\npolitical purposes, and published one of them. The constant use of the\r\npolice in political warfare belonged, of course, to the system he had\r\ninherited, but none the less it was to have been hoped that he would\r\nhave been strong enough to put it aside. The Government was now firmly\r\nestablished; it could afford to be generous. Had he definitely cut\r\nhimself off from these bad traditions he would have conferred on his\r\ncountry a blessing scarcely less than all the others.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the parties in the Reichstag to his policy and person\r\ndid not represent the feelings of the country. As the years passed by\r\nand the new generation grew up, the admiration for his past achievements\r\nand for his character only increased. His seventieth birthday, which he\r\ncelebrated in 1885, was made the occasion for a great demonstration of\r\nregard, in which the whole nation joined. A national subscription was\r\nopened and a present of two million marks was made to him. More than\r\nhalf of this was devoted to repurchasing that part of the estate at\r\nSchoenhausen which had been sold when he was a young man. The rest he\r\ndevoted to forming an institution for the help of teachers in higher\r\nschools. A few years before, the Emperor had presented to him the\r\nSachsen Wald, a large portion of the royal domains in the Duchy of\r\nLauenburg. He now purchased the neighbouring estate of Friedrichsruh, so\r\nthat he had a third country residence to which he could retire. It had a\r\ndouble advantage: its proximity to the great forest in which he loved\r\nto wander, and also to a railway, making it little more than an hour\r\ndistant from Berlin. He was able, therefore, at Friedrichsruh, to\r\ncontinue his management of affairs more easily than he could at Varzin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nRETIREMENT AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n1887-1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell was it for Germany that Bismarck had not allowed her to fall into\r\nthe weak and vacillating hands of a Parliamentary government. Peace has\r\nits dangers as well as war, and the rivalry of nations lays upon them a\r\nburden beneath which all but the strongest must succumb. The future was\r\ndark; threatening clouds were gathering in the East and West; the\r\nhostility of Russia increased, and in France the Republic was wavering;\r\na military adventurer had appeared, who threatened to use the desire for\r\nrevenge as a means for his personal advancement. Germany could no longer\r\ndisregard French threats; year by year the French army had been\r\nincreased, and in 1886 General Boulanger introduced a new law by which\r\nin time of peace over 500,000 men would be under arms. Russia had nearly\r\n550,000 soldiers on her peace establishment, and, against this, Germany\r\nonly 430,000. They were no longer safe; the duty of the Government was\r\nclear; in December, 1886, they brought forward a law to raise the army\r\nto 470,000 men and keep it at that figure for seven years. \"We have no\r\ndesire for war,\" said Bismarck, in defending the proposal; \"we belong\r\n(to use an expression of Prince Metternich's) to the States whose\r\nappetite is satisfied; under no circumstances shall we attack France;\r\nthe stronger we are, the more improbable is war; but if France has any\r\nreason to believe that she is more powerful than we, then war is\r\ncertain.\" It was, he said, no good for the House to assure the\r\nGovernment of their patriotism and their readiness for sacrifice when\r\nthe hour of danger arrived; they must be prepared beforehand. \"Words are\r\nnot soldiers and speeches not battalions.\"\r\n\r\nThe House (there was a majority of Catholics, Socialists, and\r\nProgressives) threw out the bill, the Government dissolved, and the\r\ncountry showed its confidence in Bismarck and Moltke; Conservatives and\r\nNational Liberals made a coalition, the Pope himself ordered the\r\nCatholics not to oppose the Government (his support had been purchased\r\nby the partial repeal of a law expelling religious orders from Prussia),\r\nand the Emperor could celebrate his ninetieth birthday, which fell in\r\nMarch, 1887, hopeful that the beneficent work of peaceful reform would\r\ncontinue. And yet never was Bismarck's resource so needed as during the\r\nlast year in which he was to serve his old master.\r\n\r\nFirst, a French spy was arrested on German soil; the French demanded his\r\nrelease, maintaining that German officers had violated the frontier.\r\nUnless one side gave way, war was inevitable; the French Government,\r\ninsecure as it was, could not venture to do so; Bismarck was strong\r\nenough to be lenient: the spy was released and peace was preserved.\r\nThen, on the other side, the passionate enmity of Russia burst out in\r\nlanguage of unaccustomed violence; the national Press demanded the\r\ndismissal of Bismarck or war; the Czar passed through Germany on his way\r\nto Copenhagen, but ostentatiously avoided meeting the Emperor; the\r\nslight was so open that the worst predictions were justified. In\r\nNovember, on his return, he spent a few hours in Berlin. Bismarck asked\r\nfor an audience, and then he found that despatches had been laid before\r\nthe Czar which seemed to shew that he, while avowedly supporting Russia\r\nin Bulgarian affairs, had really been undermining her influence. The\r\ndespatches were forged; we do not yet know who it was that hoped to\r\nprofit by stirring up a war between the two great nations. We can well\r\nbelieve that Bismarck, in the excitement of the moment, spoke with an\r\nopenness to which the Czar was not accustomed; he succeeded, however, in\r\nbringing about a tolerable understanding. The Czar assured him that he\r\nhad no intention of going to war, he only desired peace; Bismarck did\r\nall that human ingenuity could to preserve it. By the Triple Alliance he\r\nhad secured Germany against the attack of Russia. He now entered into a\r\nfresh and secret agreement with Russia by which Germany agreed to\r\nprotect her against an attack from Austria; he thereby hoped to be able\r\nto prevent the Czar from looking to France for support against the\r\nTriple Alliance. It was a policy of singular daring to enter into a\r\ndefensive alliance with Russia against Austria, at the same time that he\r\nhad another defensive alliance with Austria against Russia.[13] To shew\r\nthat he had no intention of deserting his older ally, he caused the text\r\nof the treaty with Austria to be published. This need no longer be\r\ninterpreted as a threat to Russia. Then, that Germany, if all else\r\nfailed, might be able to stand on her own resources, another increase of\r\nthe army was asked for. By the reorganisation of the reserve, 500,000\r\nmen could be added to the army in time of war. This proposal was brought\r\nbefore the Reichstag, together with one for a loan of twenty-eight\r\nmillion marks to purchase the munitions of war which would be required,\r\nand in defence of this, Bismarck made the last of his great speeches.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary to plead for the bill. He was confident of the\r\npatriotism of the House; his duty was to curb the nervous anxiety which\r\nrecent events had produced. These proposals were not for war, but for\r\npeace; but they must indeed be prepared for war, for that was a danger\r\nthat was never absent, and by a review of the last forty years he shewed\r\nthat scarcely a single year had gone by in which there had not been the\r\nprobability of a great European conflict, a war of coalitions in which\r\nall the great States of Europe would be ranged on one side or the other.\r\nThis danger was still present, it would never cease; Germany, now, as\r\nbefore, must always be prepared; for the strength of Germany was the\r\nsecurity of Europe.\r\n\r\n   \"We must make greater exertions than other Powers on account of\r\n  our geographical position. We lie in the middle of Europe; we can\r\n  be attacked on all sides. God has put us in a situation in which\r\n  our neighbours will not allow us to fall into indolence or\r\n  apathy. The pike in the European fish-pond prevent us from\r\n  becoming carp.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not their fault if the old alliance with Russia had broken down;\r\nthe alliance with Austria still continued. But, above all, Germany must\r\ndepend on her army, and then they could look boldly into the future. \"It\r\nwill calm our citizens if they think that if we are attacked on two\r\nsides we can put a million good soldiers on the frontier, and in a few\r\nweeks support them by another million.\" But let them not think that this\r\nterrible engine of war was a danger to the peace of Europe. In words\r\nwhich represent a profound truth he said: \"It is just the strength at\r\nwhich we aim that makes us peaceful. That sounds paradoxical, but it is\r\nso. With the powerful engine into which we are forming the German army\r\none undertakes no offensive war.\" In truth, when the army was the\r\nnation, what statesman was there who would venture on war unless he were\r\nattacked? \"If I were to say to you, 'We are threatened by France and\r\nRussia; it is better for us to fight at once; an offensive war is more\r\nadvantageous for us,' and ask for a credit of a hundred millions, I do\r\nnot know whether you would grant it,--I hope not.\" And he concluded: \"It\r\nis not fear which makes us lovers of peace, but the consciousness of our\r\nown strength. We can be won by love and good-will, but by them alone;\r\n_we Germans fear God and nothing else in the world, and it is the fear\r\nof God which makes us seek peace and ensue it_.\"\r\n\r\nThese are words which will not be forgotten so long as the German tongue\r\nis spoken. Well will it be if they are remembered in their entirety.\r\nThey were the last message of the older generation to the new Germany\r\nwhich had arisen since the war; for already the shadow of death lay over\r\nthe city; in the far South the Crown Prince was sinking to his grave,\r\nand but a few weeks were to pass before Bismarck stood at the bedside of\r\nthe dying Emperor. He died on March 9, 1888, a few days before his\r\nninety-first birthday, and with him passed the support on which\r\nBismarck's power rested.\r\n\r\nHe was not a great man, but he was an honourable, loyal, and courteous\r\ngentleman; he had not always understood the course of Bismarck's policy\r\nor approved the views which his Minister adopted. The restraint he had\r\nimposed had often been inconvenient, and Bismarck had found much\r\ndifficulty in overcoming the prejudices of his master; but it had none\r\nthe less been a gain for Bismarck that he was compelled to explain and\r\njustify his action to a man whom he never ceased to love and respect.\r\nHow beneficial had been the controlling influence of his presence the\r\nworld was to learn by the events which followed his death.\r\n\r\nThat had happened to which for five and twenty years all Bismarck's\r\nenemies had looked forward. The foundation on which his power rested was\r\ntaken away; men at once began to speculate on his fall. The noble\r\npresence of the Crown Prince, his cheerful and kindly manners, his known\r\nattachment to liberal ideas, his strong national feeling, the success\r\nwith which he had borne himself on the uncongenial field of battle, all\r\nhad made him the hope of the generation to which he belonged. Who was so\r\nwell suited to solve the difficulties of internal policy with which\r\nBismarck had struggled so long? Hopes never to be fulfilled! Absent from\r\nhis father's deathbed, he returned to Berlin a crippled and dying man,\r\nand when a few weeks later his body was lowered into the grave, there\r\nwere buried with him the hopes and aspirations of a whole generation.\r\n\r\nHis early death was indeed a great misfortune for his country. Not that\r\nhe would have fulfilled all the hopes of the party that would have made\r\nhim their leader. It is never wise to depend on the liberalism of a\r\nCrown Prince. When young and inexperienced he had been in opposition to\r\nhis father's government--but his father before him had, while heir to\r\nthe throne, also held a similar position to his own brother. As Crown\r\nPrince, he had desired and had won popularity; he had been even too\r\nsensitive to public opinion. His, however, was a character that required\r\nonly responsibility to strengthen it; with the burden of sovereignty he\r\nwould, we may suppose, have shewn a fixity of purpose which many of his\r\nadmirers would hardly have expected of him, nor would he have been\r\ndeficient in those qualities of a ruler which are the traditions of his\r\nfamily. He was not a man to surrender any of the prerogatives or\r\nauthority of the Crown. He had a stronger will than his father, and he\r\nwould have made his will felt. His old enmity to Bismarck had almost\r\nceased. It is not probable that with the new Emperor the Chancellor\r\nwould long have held his position, but he would have been able to\r\ntransfer the Crown to a man who had learnt wisdom by prolonged\r\ndisappointment. How he would have governed is shewn by the only act of\r\nauthority which he had time to carry out. He would have done what was\r\nmore important than giving a little more power to the Parliament: he\r\nwould at once have stopped that old and bad system by which the Prussian\r\nGovernment has always attempted to schoolmaster the people. During his\r\nshort reign he dismissed Herr von Puttkammer, the Minister of the\r\nInterior, a relative of Bismarck's wife, for interfering with the\r\nfreedom of election; we may be sure that he would have allowed full\r\nfreedom of speech; and that he would not have consented to govern by aid\r\nof the police. Under him there would not have been constant trials for\r\n_Majestätsbeleidigung_ or _Bismarckbeleidigung_. This he could have done\r\nwithout weakening the power of the Crown or the authority of the\r\nGovernment; those who know Germany will believe that it was the one\r\nreform which was still required.\r\n\r\nThe illness of the Emperor made it desirable to avoid points of\r\nconflict; both he and Bismarck knew that it was impossible, during the\r\nfew weeks that his life would be spared, to execute so important a\r\nchange as the resignation of the Chancellor would have been. On many\r\npoints there was a difference of opinion, but Bismarck did not unduly\r\nexpress his view, nor did he threaten to resign if his advice were not\r\nadopted. When, for instance, the Emperor hesitated to give his assent to\r\na law prolonging the period of Parliament, Bismarck did not attempt to\r\ncontrol his decision. When Herr Puttkammer was dismissed, Bismarck did\r\nnot remonstrate against an act which was almost of the nature of a\r\npersonal reprimand to himself. It was, however, different when the\r\nforeign policy of the Empire was affected, for here Bismarck, as before,\r\nconsidered himself the trustee and guarantor for the security of\r\nGermany. An old project was now revived for bringing about a marriage\r\nbetween the Princess Victoria of Prussia and Prince Alexander of\r\nBattenberg. This had been suggested some years before, while the Prince\r\nwas still ruler of Bulgaria; at Bismarck's advice, the Emperor William\r\nhad refused his consent to the marriage, partly for the reason that\r\naccording to the family law of the Hohenzollerns a marriage with the\r\nBattenberger family would be a mésalliance. He was, however, even more\r\nstrongly influenced by the effect this would have on the political\r\nsituation of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Bismarck's policy was the maintenance of friendship\r\nwith Russia; this old-established alliance depended, however, on the\r\npersonal good-will of the Czar, and not on the wishes of the Russian\r\nnation or any identity of interests between the two Empires. A marriage\r\nbetween a Prussian princess and a man who was so bitterly hated by the\r\nCzar as was Prince Alexander must have seriously injured the friendly\r\nrelations which had existed between the two families since the year\r\n1814. Bismarck believed that the happiness of the Princess must be\r\nsacrificed to the interests of Germany, and the Emperor William, who,\r\nwhen a young man, had for similar reasons been required by his father to\r\nrenounce the hand of the lady to whom he had been devotedly attached,\r\nagreed with him. Now, after the Emperor's death the project was revived;\r\nthe Emperor Frederick wavered between his feelings as a father and his\r\nduty as a king. Bismarck suspected that the strong interest which the\r\nEmpress displayed in the project was due, not only to maternal\r\naffection, but also to the desire, which in her would be natural enough,\r\nto bring over the German Empire to the side of England in the Eastern\r\nQuestion, so that England might have a stronger support in her perennial\r\nconflict with Russia. The matter, therefore, appeared to him as a\r\nconflict between the true interests of Germany and those old Court\r\ninfluences which he so often had had to oppose, by which the family\r\nrelationships of the reigning sovereign were made to divert his\r\nattention from the single interests of his own country. He made it a\r\nquestion of confidence; he threatened to resign, as he so often did\r\nunder similar circumstances; he let it be known through the Press what\r\nwas the cause, and, in his opinion, the true interpretation, of the\r\nconflict which influenced the Court. In order to support his view, he\r\ncalled in the help of the Grand Duke of Baden, who, as the Emperor's\r\nbrother-in-law, and one of the most experienced of the reigning Princes,\r\nwas the proper person to interfere in a matter which concerned both the\r\nprivate and the public life of the sovereign. The struggle, which\r\nthreatened to become serious, was, however, allayed by the visit of the\r\nQueen of England to Germany. She, acting in German affairs with that\r\nstrict regard to constitutional principle and that dislike of Court\r\nintrigue that she had always observed in dealings with her own\r\nMinisters, gave her support to Bismarck. The marriage did not take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nFrederick's reign lasted but ninety days, and his son ruled in his\r\nplace. The new Emperor belonged to the generation which had grown up\r\nsince the war; he could not remember the old days of conflict; like all\r\nof his generation, from his earliest years he had been accustomed to\r\nlook on Bismarck with gratitude and admiration. In him, warm personal\r\nfriendship was added to the general feeling of public regard; he had\r\nhimself learnt from Bismarck's own lips the principles of policy and the\r\nlessons of history. It might well seem that he would continue to lean\r\nfor support on the old statesman. So he himself believed, but careful\r\nobservers who saw his power of will and his restless activity foretold\r\nthat he would not allow to Bismarck that complete freedom of action and\r\nalmost absolute power which he had obtained during the later years of\r\nthe old Emperor. They foretold also that Bismarck would not be content\r\nwith a position of less power, and there were many ready to watch for\r\nand foment the differences which must arise.\r\n\r\nIn the first months of the new reign, some of Bismarck's old enemies\r\nattempted to undermine his influence by spreading reports of his\r\ndifferences with the Emperor Frederick, and Professor Geffken even went\r\nso far as to publish from the manuscript some of the most confidential\r\nportions of the Emperor's diary in order to shew that but for him\r\nBismarck would not have created the new Empire. The attempt failed, for,\r\nrightly read, the passages which were to injure Bismarck's reputation\r\nonly served to shew how much greater than men thought had been the\r\ndifficulties with which he had had to contend and the wisdom with which\r\nhe had dealt with them.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning there were differences of opinion; the old and\r\nthe new did not think or feel alike. Bismarck looked with disapproval on\r\nthe constant journeys of the Emperor; he feared that he was compromising\r\nhis dignity. Moltke and others of the older generation retired from the\r\nposts they filled; Bismarck, with growing misgivings, stayed on. His\r\npromises to his old master, his love of power, his distrust of the\r\ncapacity of others, all made it hard for him to withdraw when he still\r\nmight have done so with dignity. We cannot doubt that his presence was\r\nirksome to his master; his influence and authority were too great;\r\nbefore them, even the majesty of the Throne was dimmed; the Minister was\r\na greater man than the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nIf we are to understand what happened we must remember how exceptional\r\nwas the position which Bismarck now occupied. He had repeatedly defied\r\nthe power of Parliament and shewn that he was superior to the Reichstag;\r\nthere were none among his colleagues who could approach him in age or\r\nexperience; the Prussian Ministers were as much his nominees as were the\r\nofficials of the Empire. He himself was Chancellor, Minister-President,\r\nForeign Minister, and Minister of Trade; his son was at the head of the\r\nForeign Office and was used for the more important diplomatic missions;\r\nhis cousin was Minister, of the Interior; in the management of the most\r\ncritical affairs, he depended upon the assistance of his own family and\r\nsecretaries. He had twice been able against the will of his colleagues\r\nto reverse the whole policy of the State. The Government was in his\r\nhands and men had learnt to look to him rather than to the Emperor. Was\r\nit to be expected that a young man, ambitious, full of spirit and\r\nself-confidence, who had learnt from Bismarck himself a high regard for\r\nhis monarchical duties, would acquiesce in this system? Nay, more; was\r\nit right that he should?\r\n\r\nIt was a fitting conclusion to his career that the man who had restored\r\nthe monarchical character of the Prussian State should himself shew that\r\nbefore the will of the King he, as every other subject, must bow.\r\n\r\nBismarck had spent the winter of 1889 at Friedrichsruh. When he returned\r\nto Berlin at the end of January, he found that his influence and\r\nauthority had been undermined; not only was the Emperor influenced by\r\nother advisers, but even the Ministry shewed an independence to which he\r\nwas not accustomed. The chief causes of difference arose regarding the\r\nprolongation of the law against the Socialists. This expired in 1890,\r\nand it was proposed to bring in a bill making it permanent. Bismarck\r\nwished even more than this to intensify the stringency of its provisions.\r\nApparently the Emperor did not believe that this was necessary. He hoped\r\nthat it would be possible to remove the disaffection of the working men\r\nby remedial measures, and, in order to discuss these, he summoned a\r\nEuropean Congress which would meet in Berlin.\r\n\r\nHere, then, there was a fundamental difference of opinion between the\r\nKing of Prussia and his Minister; the result was that Bismarck did not\r\nconsider himself able to defend the Socialist law before the Reichstag,\r\nfor he could not any longer give full expression to his own views; the\r\nParliament was left without direction from the Government, and\r\neventually a coalition between the extreme Conservatives, the Radicals,\r\nand the Socialists rejected the bill altogether. A bitterly contested\r\ngeneral election followed in which the name and the new policy of the\r\nEmperor were freely used, and it resulted in a majority opposed to the\r\nparties who were accustomed to support Bismarck. These events made it\r\nobvious that on matters of internal policy a permanent agreement between\r\nthe Emperor and the Chancellor was impossible. It seems that Bismarck\r\ntherefore offered to resign his post as Minister President, maintaining\r\nonly the general control of foreign affairs. But this proposition did\r\nnot meet with the approval of the Emperor. There were, however, other\r\ngrounds of difference connected even with foreign affairs; the Emperor\r\nwas drawing closer to England and thereby separating from Russia.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of March, matters had come to a crisis. The actual cause\r\nfor the final difference was an important matter of constitutional\r\nprinciple. Bismarck found that the Emperor had on several occasions\r\ndiscussed questions of administration with some of his colleagues\r\nwithout informing him; moreover, important projects of law had been\r\ndevised without his knowledge. He therefore drew the attention of the\r\nEmperor to the principle of the German and Prussian Constitutions. By\r\nthe German Constitution, as we have seen, the Chancellor was responsible\r\nfor all acts of the Ministers and Secretaries of State, who held office\r\nas his deputies and subordinates. He therefore claimed that he could\r\nrequire to be consulted on every matter of any importance which\r\nconcerned any of these departments. The same right as regards Prussian\r\naffairs had been explicitly secured to the Minister-President by a\r\nCabinet order of 1852, which was passed in order to give to the\r\nPresident that complete control which was necessary if he was to be\r\nresponsible for the whole policy of the Government. The Emperor answered\r\nby a command that he should draw up a new order reversing this decree.\r\nThis Bismarck refused to do; the Emperor repeated his instructions. It\r\nwas a fundamental point on which no compromise was possible; the\r\nEmperor proposed to take away from the Chancellor that supreme position\r\nhe had so long enjoyed; to recall into his own hands that immediate\r\ncontrol over all departments which in old days the Kings of Prussia had\r\nexercised and, as Bismarck said, to be his own Prime Minister. In this\r\ndegradation of his position Bismarck would not acquiesce; he had no\r\nalternative but to resign.\r\n\r\nThe final separation between these two men, each so self-willed and\r\nconfident in his own strength, was not to be completed by ceremonious\r\ndiscussions on constitutional forms. It was during an audience at the\r\ncastle, that the Emperor had explained his views, Bismarck his\r\nobjections; the Emperor insisted that his will must be carried out, if\r\nnot by Bismarck, then by another. \"Then I am to understand, your\r\nMajesty,\" said Bismarck, speaking in English; \"that I am in your way?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" was the answer. This was enough; he took his leave and returned\r\nhome to draw up the formal document in which he tendered his\r\nresignation. This, which was to be the conclusion of his public life,\r\nhad to be composed with care; he did not intend to be hurried; but the\r\nEmperor was impatient, and his impatience was increased when he was\r\ninformed that Windthorst, the leader of the Centre, had called on\r\nBismarck at his residence. He feared lest there was some intrigue, and\r\nthat Bismarck proposed to secure his position by an alliance with the\r\nParliamentary opposition. He sent an urgent verbal message requiring the\r\nresignation immediately, a command with which Bismarck was not likely\r\nto comply. Early next morning, the Emperor drove round himself to his\r\nhouse, and Bismarck was summoned from his bed to meet the angry\r\nsovereign. The Emperor asked what had taken place at the interview with\r\nWindthorst, and stated that Ministers were not to enter on political\r\ndiscussions with Parliamentary leaders without his permission. Bismarck\r\ndenied that there had been any political discussion, and answered that\r\nhe could not allow any supervision over the guests he chose to receive\r\nin his private house.\r\n\r\n\"Not if I order it as your sovereign?\" asked the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\"No. The commands of my King cease in my wife's drawing-room,\" answered\r\nBismarck. The Emperor had forgotten that Bismarck was a gentleman before\r\nhe was a Minister, and that a Prussian nobleman could not be treated\r\nlike a Russian _boyar_.[14]\r\n\r\nNo reconciliation or accommodation was now possible. The Emperor did all\r\nhe could to make it appear that the resignation was voluntary and\r\nfriendly. He conferred on the retiring Chancellor the highest honours:\r\nhe raised him to the rank of Field Marshal and created him Duke of\r\nLauenburg, and publicly stated his intention of presenting him with a\r\ncopy of his own portrait. As a soldier, Bismarck obediently accepted the\r\nmilitary honour; the new title he requested to be allowed not to use; he\r\nhad never been asked whether he desired it.\r\n\r\n No outward honours could recompense him for the affront he had\r\nreceived. What profited it him that the Princes and people of Germany\r\njoined in unanimous expression of affection and esteem, that he could\r\nscarcely set foot outside his house for the enthusiastic crowd who\r\ncheered and followed him through the streets of Berlin? For twenty-four\r\nyears he had been Prussian Minister and now he was told he was in the\r\nway. His successor was already in office; he was himself driven in haste\r\nfrom the house which so long had been his home. A final visit to the\r\nPrinces of the Royal House, a last audience with the Emperor, a hasty\r\nleave-taking from his friends and colleagues, and then the last\r\nfarewell, when in the early morning he drove to Charlottenburg and alone\r\nwent down into the mausoleum where his old master slept, to lay a rose\r\nupon his tomb.\r\n\r\nThe rest he had so often longed for had come, but it was too late. Forty\r\nyears he had passed in public life and he could not now take up again\r\nthe interests and occupations of his youth. Agriculture had no more\r\ncharms for him; he was too infirm for sport; he could not, like his\r\nfather, pass his old age in the busy indolence of a country gentleman's\r\nlife, nor could he, as some statesmen have done, soothe his declining\r\nyears by harmless and amiable literary dilettanteism. His religion was\r\nnot of that complexion that he could find in contemplation, and in\r\npreparation for another life, consolation for the trials of this one. At\r\nseventy-five years of age, his intellect was as vigorous and his energy\r\nas unexhausted as they had been twenty years before; his health was\r\nimproved, for he had found in Dr. Schweninger a physician who was not\r\nonly able to treat his complaints, but could also compel his patient to\r\nobey his orders. He still felt within himself full power to continue his\r\npublic work, and now he was relegated to impotence and obscurity.\r\nWhether in Varzin or Friedrichsruh, his eyes were always fixed on\r\nBerlin. He saw the State which he had made, and which he loved as a\r\nfather, subjected to the experiment of young and inexperienced control.\r\nHe saw overthrown that carefully planned system by which the peace of\r\nEurope was made to depend upon the prosperity of Germany. Changes were\r\nmade in the working of that Constitution which it seemed presumption for\r\nanyone but him to touch. His policy was deserted, his old enemies were\r\ntaken into favour. Can we wonder that he could not restrain his\r\nimpatience? He felt like a man who sees his heir ruling in his own house\r\nduring his lifetime, cutting down his woods and dismissing his old\r\nservants, or as if he saw a careless and clumsy rider mounted on his\r\nfavourite horse.\r\n\r\nFrom all parts of Germany deputations from towns and newspaper writers\r\ncame to visit him. He received them with his customary courtesy, and\r\nspoke with his usual frankness. He did not disguise his chagrin; he had,\r\nhe said, not been treated with the consideration which he deserved. He\r\nhad never been accustomed to hide his feelings or to disguise his\r\nopinions. Nothing that his successors did seemed to him good. They made\r\na treaty with England for the arrangement of conflicting questions in\r\nAfrica; men looked to Bismarck to hear what he would say before they\r\nformed their opinion; \"I would never have signed the treaty,\" he\r\ndeclared. He quickly drifted into formal opposition to the Government;\r\nhe even made arrangements with one of the Hamburg papers that it should\r\nrepresent his opinions. He seemed, to have forgotten his own principle\r\nthat, in foreign affairs at least, an opposition to the policy of the\r\nGovernment should not be permitted. He claimed a privilege which as\r\nMinister he would never have allowed to another. He defied the\r\nGovernment. \"They shall not silence me,\" he said. It seemed as though he\r\nwas determined to undo the work of his life. Under the pretext that he\r\nwas attacking the policy of the Ministers, he was undermining the\r\nloyalty of the people, for few could doubt that it was the Emperor at\r\nwhom the criticisms were aimed.\r\n\r\nIn his isolation and retirement, the old uncompromising spirit of his\r\nancestors once more awoke in him. He had been loyal to the Crown--who\r\nmore so?--but his loyalty had limits. His long service had been one of\r\npersonal and voluntary affection; he was not a valet, that his service\r\ncould be handed on from generation to generation among the assets of the\r\nCrown. \"After all,\" he would ask, \"who are these Hohenzollerns? My\r\nfamily is as good as theirs. We have been here longer than they have.\"\r\nLike his ancestors who stood out against the rule of the Great Elector,\r\nhe was putting personal feeling above public duty. Even if the action of\r\nthe new Government was not always wise, he himself had made Germany\r\nstrong enough to support for a few years a weak Ministry.\r\n\r\nMore than this, he was attempting to destroy the confidence of the\r\npeople in the moral justice and necessity of the measures by which he\r\nhad founded the Empire. They had always been taught that in 1870 their\r\ncountry had been the object of a treacherous and unprovoked attack.\r\nBismarck, who was always living over again the great scenes in which he\r\nhad been the leading actor, boasted that but for him there would never\r\nhave been a war with France. He referred to the alteration in the Ems\r\ntelegram, which we have already narrated, and the Government was forced\r\nto publish the original documents. The conclusions drawn from these\r\ndisclosures and others which followed were exaggerated, but the naïve\r\nand simple belief of the people was irretrievably destroyed. Where they\r\nhad been taught to see the will of God, they found only the machinations\r\nof the Minister. In a country where patriotism had already taken the\r\nplace of religion, the last illusion had been dispelled; almost the last\r\nbarrier was broken down which stood between the nation and moral\r\nscepticism.\r\n\r\nBismarck's criticism was very embarrassing to the Government; by\r\ninjuring the reputation of the Ministry he impaired the influence of the\r\nnation. It was difficult to keep silence and ignore the attack, but the\r\nattempts at defence were awkward and unwise. General Caprivi attempted\r\nto defend the treaty with England by reading out confidential minutes,\r\naddressed by Bismarck to the Secretary of the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, in which he had written that the friendship of England and the\r\nsupport of Lord Salisbury were more important than Zanzibar or the whole\r\nof Africa. He addressed a circular despatch to Prussian envoys to inform\r\nthem that the utterances of Prince Bismarck were without any actual\r\nimportance, as he was now only a private man. This only made matters\r\nworse; for the substance of the despatch quickly became known (another\r\ninstance of the lax control over important State documents which we so\r\noften notice in dealing with German affairs), and only increased the\r\nbitterness of Bismarck, which was shared by his friends and supporters.\r\n\r\nFor more than two years the miserable quarrel continued; Bismarck was\r\nnow the public and avowed enemy of the Court and the Ministry. Moltke\r\ndied, and he alone of the great men of the country was absent from the\r\nfuneral ceremony, but in his very absence he overshadowed all who were\r\nthere. His public popularity only increased. In 1892, he travelled\r\nacross Germany to visit Vienna for his son's wedding. His journey was a\r\ntriumphal progress, and the welcome was warmest in the States of the\r\nSouth, in Saxony and Bavaria. The German Government, however, found it\r\nnecessary to instruct their ambassador not to be present at the wedding\r\nand to take no notice of the Prince; he was not even granted an audience\r\nby the Austrian Emperor. It was held necessary also to publish the\r\ncircular to which I have already referred, and thereby officially to\r\nrecognise the enmity.\r\n\r\nThe scandal of the quarrel became a grave injury to the Government of\r\nthe country. A serious illness of Bismarck caused apprehension that he\r\nmight die while still unreconciled. The Emperor took the opportunity,\r\nand by a kindly message opened the way to an apparent reconciliation.\r\nThen a change of Ministry took place: General Caprivi was made the\r\nscapegoat for the failures of the new administration, and retired into\r\nprivate life, too loyal even to attempt to justify or defend the acts\r\nfor which he had been made responsible. The new Chancellor, Prince\r\nHohenlohe, was a friend and former colleague of Bismarck, and had in old\r\ndays been leader of the National party in Bavaria. When Bismarck's\r\neightieth birthday was celebrated, the Emperor was present, and once\r\nmore Bismarck went to Berlin to visit his sovereign. We may be allowed\r\nto believe that the reconciliation was not deep. We know that he did not\r\ncease to contrast the new marks of Royal favour with the kindly courtesy\r\nof his old master, who had known so well how to allow the King to be\r\nforgotten in the friend.\r\n\r\nAs the years went on, he became ever more lonely. His wife was dead, and\r\nhis brother. Solitude, the curse of greatness, had fallen on him. He had\r\nno friends, for we cannot call by that name the men, so inferior to\r\nhimself, by whom he was surrounded--men who did not scruple to betray\r\nhis confidence and make a market of his infirmities. With difficulty\r\ncould he bring himself even to systematic work on the memoirs he\r\nproposed to leave. Old age set its mark on him: his beard had become\r\nwhite; he could no longer, as in former days, ride and walk through the\r\nwoods near his house. His interest in public affairs never flagged, and\r\nespecially he watched with unceasing vigilance every move in the\r\ndiplomatic world; his mind and spirit were still unbroken when a sudden\r\nreturn of his old malady overtook him, and on the last day of July,\r\n1898, he died at Friedrichsruh.\r\n\r\nHe lies buried, not among his ancestors and kinsfolk near the old house\r\nat Schoenhausen, nor in the Imperial city where his work had been done;\r\nbut in a solitary tomb at Friedrichsruh to which, with scanty state and\r\nhasty ceremony, his body had been borne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There seems no authority for the statement that the\r\nBismarcks had sprung from a noble Bohemian family.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is to this visit that a well-known anecdote refers;\r\nhaving landed at Hull one Sunday morning, he was walking along the\r\nstreets whistling, when a chance acquaintance of the voyage asked him to\r\ndesist.

In carrying out this plan, the myths, with\r\nwhich the history of all lands begins, will not be overlooked, though\r\nthese will be carefully distinguished from the actual history, so far as\r\nthe labors of the accepted historical authorities have resulted in\r\ndefinite conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the different volumes have been planned to cover\r\nconnecting and, as far as possible, consecutive epochs or periods, so\r\nthat the set when completed will present in a comprehensive narrative\r\nthe chief events in the great STORY OF THE NATIONS; but it is, of\r\ncourse, not always practicable to issue the several volumes in their\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\n_For list of volumes see next page_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE NATIONS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGREECE.
