REVELL COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been honored by Mrs. Bishop with an invitation to preface her\r\nbook on Korea with a few introductory remarks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bishop is too well-known as a traveler and a writer to require\r\nany introduction to the reading public, but I am glad to be afforded\r\nan opportunity of indorsing the conclusions she has arrived at after\r\na long and intimate study of a people whose isolation during many\r\ncenturies renders a description of their character, institutions and\r\npeculiarities, especially interesting at the present stage of their\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThose who, like myself, have known Korea from its first opening to\r\nforeign intercourse will thoroughly appreciate the closeness of Mrs.\r\nBishop’s observation, the accuracy of her facts, and the correctness of\r\nher inferences. The facilities enjoyed by her have been exceptional.\r\nShe has been honored by the confidence and friendship of the King and\r\nthe late Queen in a degree that has never before been accorded to any\r\nforeign traveler, and has had access to valuable sources of information\r\nplaced at her disposal by the foreign community of Seoul, official,\r\nmissionary, and mercantile; while her presence in the country during\r\nand subsequent to the war between China and Japan, of which Korea was,\r\nin the first instance, the stage, has furnished her the opportunity of\r\nrecording with accuracy and impartiality many details of an episode in\r\nfar Eastern history which have hitherto been clouded by misstatement\r\nand exaggeration. The hardships and difficulties encountered by Mrs.\r\nBishop during her journeys into the interior of Korea have been lightly\r\ntouched upon by herself; but those who know how great they were,\r\nadmire the courage, patience and endurance that enabled her to overcome\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident to all who know anything of Korea that a condition\r\nof tutelage, in some form or another, is now absolutely necessary to\r\nher existence as a nation. The nominal independence won for her by\r\nthe force of Japanese arms is a privilege she is not fitted to enjoy\r\nwhile she continues to labor under the burden of an administration\r\nthat is hopelessly and superlatively corrupt. The _role_ of mentor\r\nand guide exercised by China, with that lofty indifference to local\r\ninterests that characterizes her treatment of all her tributaries, was\r\nundertaken by Japan after the expulsion of the Chinese armies from\r\nKorea. The efforts of the Japanese to reform some of the most glaring\r\nabuses, though somewhat roughly applied, were undoubtedly earnest and\r\ngenuine; but, as Mrs. Bishop has shown, experience was wanting, and\r\none of the Japanese Agents did incalculable harm to his country’s\r\ncause by falling a victim to the spirit of intrigue which seems almost\r\ninseparable from the diplomacy of Orientals. Force of circumstances\r\ncompelled Russia to take up the task begun by Japan, the King having\r\nappealed in his desperation to the Russian Representative for rescue\r\nfrom a terrorism which might well have cowed a stronger and a braver\r\nman. The most partial of critics will admit that the powerful influence\r\nwhich the presence of the King in the house of their Representative\r\nmight have enabled the Russian Government to exert has been exercised\r\nthrough their Minister with almost disappointing moderation.\r\nNevertheless, through the instrumentality of Mr. M’Leavy Brown, LL.D.,\r\nhead of the Korean Customs and Financial Adviser to the Government,\r\nan Englishman whose great ability as an organizer and administrator\r\nis recognized by all residents in the farther East, the finances of\r\nthe country have been placed in a condition of equilibrium that has\r\nnever before existed; while numerous other reforms have been carried\r\nout by Mr. Brown and others with the cordial support and co-operation\r\nof the Russian Minister, irrespective of the nationality of the agent\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, still remains to be done; and the only hope of advance\r\nin the direction of progress--initiated, it is only fair to remember,\r\nby Japan, and continued under Russian auspices--is to maintain an iron\r\ngrip, which the Russian Agents, so far, have been more careful than\r\ntheir Japanese predecessors to conceal beneath a velvet glove. The\r\ncondition of Korean settlers in Russian territory described by Mrs.\r\nBishop shows how capable these people are of improving their condition\r\nunder wise and paternal rule; and, setting all political considerations\r\naside, there can be no doubt that the prosperity of the people and\r\ntheir general comfort and happiness would be immensely advanced under\r\nan extension of this patronage by one or other civilized Power. Without\r\nsome form of patronage or control, call it by what name we will, a\r\nlapse into the old groove of oppression, extortion, and its concomitant\r\nmiseries, is inevitable.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bishop’s remarks on missionary work in China and Korea, based,\r\nas they are, on personal and sympathetic observation, will be found\r\nof great value to those who are anxious to arrive at a correct\r\nappreciation of Christian enterprise in these remote regions.\r\nDescriptions of missionaries and their doings are too often marred\r\nby exaggerations of success on the one hand, which are, perhaps,\r\nthe natural outcome of enthusiasm, and harsh and frequently unjust\r\ncriticisms on the other, commonly indulged in by those who base\r\ntheir conclusions upon observation of the most superficial kind.\r\nSpeaking from my own experience, I have no hesitation in saying that\r\ncloser inquiry would dispel many of the illusions about the futility\r\nof missionary work that are, unfortunately, too common; and that\r\nmissionaries would, as a rule, welcome sympathetic inquiry into\r\ntheir methods of work, which most of them will frankly admit to be\r\ncapable of improvement. But, while courting friendly criticism, they\r\nmay reasonably object to be judged by those who have never taken the\r\ntrouble to study their system, or to interest themselves in the objects\r\nthey have in view. In Mrs. Bishop they have an advocate whose testimony\r\nmay be commended to the attention of all who are disposed to regard\r\nmissionary labor as, at the best, useless or unnecessary. In Korea,\r\nat all events, to go no farther, it is to missionaries that we are\r\nassuredly indebted for almost all we know about the country; it is they\r\nwho have awakened in the people the desire for material progress and\r\nenlightenment that has now happily taken root, and it is to them that\r\nwe may confidently look for assistance in its farther development.\r\nThe unacknowledged, but none the less complete, religious toleration\r\nthat now exists throughout the country affords them facilities which\r\nare being energetically used with great promise of future success. I\r\nam tempted to call attention to another point in connection with this\r\nmuch-abused class of workers that is, I think, often lost sight of,\r\nnamely, their utility as explorers and pioneers of commerce. They are\r\nalways ready--at least such has been my invariable experience--to place\r\nthe stores of their local knowledge at the disposal of any one, whether\r\nmerchant, sportsman, or traveler, who applies to them for information,\r\nand to lend him cheerful assistance in the pursuit of his objects. I\r\nventure to think that much valuable information as to channels for the\r\ndevelopment of trade could be obtained by Chambers of Commerce if they\r\nwere to address specific inquiries to missionaries in remote regions.\r\nManufacturers are more indebted to missionaries than perhaps they\r\nrealize for the introduction of their goods and wares, and the creation\r\nof a demand for them, in places to which such would never otherwise\r\nhave found their way.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that Mrs. Bishop’s visit to Korea was so opportunely\r\ntimed. At the present rate of progress much that came under her\r\nobservation will, before long, be “improved” out of existence; and\r\nthough no one can regret the disappearance of many institutions and\r\ncustoms that have nothing but their antiquity to recommend them, she\r\nhas done valuable service in placing on record so graphic a description\r\nof experiences that future travelers will probably look for in vain.\r\n\r\n  WALTER C. HILLIER.\r\n\r\n _October, 1897._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor’s Prefatory Note.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy four visits to Korea, between January, 1894, and March, 1897, formed\r\npart of a plan of study of the leading characteristics of the Mongolian\r\nraces. My first journey produced the impression that Korea is the most\r\nuninteresting country I ever traveled in, but during and since the war\r\nits political perturbations, rapid changes, and possible destinies,\r\nhave given me an intense interest in it; while Korean character and\r\nindustry, as I saw both under Russian rule in Siberia, have enlightened\r\nme as to the better possibilities which may await the nation in the\r\nfuture. Korea takes a similarly strong grip on all who reside in it\r\nsufficiently long to overcome the feeling of distaste which at first it\r\nundoubtedly inspires.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult country to write upon, from the lack of books of\r\nreference by means of which one may investigate what one hopes are\r\nfacts, the two best books on the country having become obsolete within\r\nthe last few years in so far as its political condition and social\r\norder are concerned. The traveler must laboriously disinter each fact\r\nfor himself, usually through the medium of an interpreter; and as\r\nfive or six versions of each are given by apparently equally reliable\r\nauthorities, frequently the “teachers” of the foreigners, the only\r\ncourse is to hazard a bold guess as to which of them has the best\r\nchance of being accurate.\r\n\r\nAccuracy has been my first aim, and my many foreign friends in Korea\r\nknow how industriously I have labored to attain it. It is by these,\r\nwho know the extreme difficulty of the task, that I shall be the most\r\nleniently criticised wherever, in spite of carefulness, I have fallen\r\ninto mistakes.\r\n\r\nCircumstances prevented me from putting my traveling experiences, as\r\non former occasions, into letters. I took careful notes, which were\r\ncorrected from time to time by the more prolonged observations of\r\nresidents, and as I became better acquainted with the country; but,\r\nwith regard to my journey up the South Branch of the Han, as I am\r\nthe first traveler who has reported on the region, I have to rely on\r\nmy observation and inquiries alone, and there is the same lack of\r\nrecorded notes on most of the country on the Upper Tai-döng. My notes\r\nfurnish the travel chapters, as well as those on Seoul, Manchuria, and\r\nPrimorsk; and the sketches in contemporary Korean history are based\r\npartly on official documents, and are partly derived from sources not\r\nusually accessible.\r\n\r\nI owe very much to the kindly interest which my friends in Korea took\r\nin my work, and to the encouragement which they gave me when I was\r\ndisheartened by the difficulties of the subject and my own lack of\r\nskill. I gratefully acknowledge the invaluable help given me by Sir\r\nWalter C. Hillier, K.C.M.G., H.B.M.’s Consul-General in Korea, and Mr.\r\nJ. M’Leavy Brown, LL.D., Chief Commissioner of Korean Customs; also\r\nthe aid generously bestowed by Mr. Waeber, the Russian Minister, and\r\nthe Rev. G. Heber Jones, the Rev. James Gale, and other missionaries.\r\nI am also greatly indebted to a learned and careful volume on _Korean\r\nGovernment_, by Mr. W. H. Wilkinson, H.B.M.’s Acting Vice-Consul\r\nat Chemulpo, as well as to the _Korean Repository_ and the _Seoul\r\nIndependent_, for information which has enabled me to correct some of\r\nmy notes on Korean customs.\r\n\r\nVarious repetitions occur, for the reason that it appears to me\r\nimpossible to give sufficient emphasis to certain facts without them;\r\nand several descriptions are loaded with details, the result of an\r\nattempt to fix on paper customs and ceremonies destined shortly to\r\ndisappear. The illustrations, with the exceptions of three, are\r\nreproductions of my own photographs. The sketch map, in so far as my\r\nfirst journey is concerned, is reduced from one kindly drawn for me\r\nby Mr. Waeber. The transliteration of Chinese proper names was kindly\r\nundertaken by a well-known Chinese scholar, but unfortunately the\r\nactual Chinese characters were not in all cases forthcoming. In justice\r\nto the kind friends who have so generously aided me, I am anxious to\r\nclaim and accept the fullest measure of personal responsibility for the\r\nopinions expressed, which, whether right or wrong, are wholly my own.\r\n\r\nI am painfully conscious of the demerits of this work, but believing\r\nthat, on the whole, it reflects fairly faithfully the regions of which\r\nit treats, I venture to present it to the public; and to ask for it\r\nthe same kindly and lenient criticism with which my records of travel\r\nin the East and elsewhere have hitherto been received, and that it may\r\nbe accepted as an honest attempt to make a contribution to the sum of\r\nthe knowledge of Korea and its people, and to describe things as I saw\r\nthem, not only in the interior but in the troubled political atmosphere\r\nof the capital.\r\n\r\n  ISABELLA L.

It was curious\r\nthat not one of these educated, and, in some cases, intelligent people\r\ncame within 2,000 miles of its actual latitude and longitude!\r\n\r\nIn truth, there is something about this peninsula which has repelled\r\ninvestigation, and until lately, when the establishment of a monthly\r\nperiodical, carefully edited, _The Korean Repository_, has stimulated\r\nresearch, the one authority of which all writers, with and without\r\nacknowledgment, have availed themselves, is the Introduction to Père\r\nDallet’s _Histoire de l’Église de Korée_, a valuable treatise, many\r\nparts of which, however, are now obsolete.\r\n\r\nIf in this volume I present facts so elementary as to provoke the\r\nscornful comment, “Every schoolboy knows that,” I venture to remind\r\nmy critics that the larger number of possible readers were educated\r\nwhen Korea was little more than “a geographical expression,” and\r\nhad not the advantages of the modern schoolboy, whose “up-to-date”\r\ngeographical text-books have been written since the treaties of 1883\r\nopened the Hermit Nation to the world; and I will ask the minority to\r\nbe patient with what may be to them “twice-told tales” for the sake of\r\nthe majority, specially in this introduction, which is intended to give\r\nsomething of lucidity to the chapters which follow.\r\n\r\nThe first notice of Korea is by Khordadbeh, an Arab geographer of the\r\nninth century, A.D., in his _Book of Roads and Provinces_, quoted by\r\nBaron Richofen in his work on China, p. 575. Legends of the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of the peninsula are too mythical to be noticed here, but\r\nit is certain that it was inhabited when Kit-ze or Ki-ja, who will be\r\nreferred to later, introduced the elements of Chinese civilization\r\nin the twelfth century B.C. Naturally that conquest and subsequent\r\nimmigrations from Manchuria have left some traces on the Koreans, but\r\nthey are strikingly dissimilar from both their nearest neighbors,\r\nthe Chinese and the Japanese, and there is a remarkable variety\r\nof physiognomy among them, all the more noticeable because of the\r\nuniformity of costume. The difficulty of identifying people which\r\nbesets and worries the stranger in Japan and China does not exist in\r\nKorea. It is true that the obliquity of the Mongolian eye is always\r\npresent, as well as a trace of bronze in the skin, but the complexion\r\nvaries from a swarthy olive to a very light brunette.\r\n\r\nThere are straight and aquiline noses, as well as broad and snub noses\r\nwith distended nostrils; and though the hair is dark, much of it is so\r\ndistinctly a russet brown as to require the frequent application of\r\nlampblack and oil to bring it to a fashionable black, while in texture\r\nit varies from wiriness to silkiness. Some men have full moustaches and\r\nlarge goatees, on the faces of others a few carefully tended hairs, as\r\nin China, do duty for both, while many have full, strong beards. The\r\nmouth is either the wide, full-lipped, gaping cavity constantly seen\r\namong the lower orders, or a small though full feature, or thin-lipped\r\nand refined, as is seen continually among patricians.\r\n\r\nThe eyes, though dark, vary from dark brown to hazel; the cheek bones\r\nare high; the brow, so far as fashion allows it to be seen, is\r\nfrequently lofty and intellectual; and the ears are small and well set\r\non. The usual expression is cheerful, with a dash of puzzlement. The\r\nphysiognomy indicates, in its best aspect, quick intelligence, rather\r\nthan force or strength of will. The Koreans are certainly a handsome\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe physique is good. The average height of the men is five feet four\r\nand a half[1] inches, that of the women cannot be ascertained, and is\r\n_dis_proportionately less, while their figureless figures, the faults\r\nof which are exaggerated by the ugliest dress on earth, are squat\r\nand broad. The hands and feet of both sexes and all classes are very\r\nsmall, white, and exquisitely formed, and the tapering, almond-shaped\r\nfinger-nails are carefully attended to. The men are very strong, and\r\nas porters carry heavy weights, a load of 100 pounds being regarded as\r\na moderate one. They walk remarkably well, whether it be the studied\r\nswing of the patrician or the short, firm stride of the plebeian when\r\non business. The families are large and healthy. If the Government\r\nestimate of the number of houses is correct, the population, taking a\r\nfair average, is from twelve to thirteen millions, females being in the\r\nminority.\r\n\r\nMentally the Koreans are liberally endowed, specially with that\r\ngift known in Scotland as “gleg at the uptak.” The foreign teachers\r\nbear willing testimony to their mental adroitness and quickness of\r\nperception, and their talent for the rapid acquisition of languages,\r\nwhich they speak more fluently and with a far better accent than either\r\nthe Chinese or Japanese. They have the Oriental vices of suspicion,\r\ncunning, and untruthfulness, and trust between man and man is unknown.\r\nWomen are secluded, and occupy a very inferior position.\r\n\r\nThe geography of Korea, or Ch’ao Hsien (“Morning Calm,” or “Fresh\r\nMorning”), is simple. It is a definite peninsula to the northeast of\r\nChina, measuring roughly 600 miles from north to south and 135 from\r\neast to west. The coast line is about 1,740 miles. It lies between 34°\r\n17′ N. to 43° N. latitude and 124° 38′ E. to 130° 33′ E. longitude, and\r\nhas an estimated area of upwards of 80,000 square miles, being somewhat\r\nsmaller than Great Britain. Bounded on the north and west by the\r\nTu-men and Am-nok, or Yalu, rivers, which divide it from the Russian\r\nand Chinese empires, and by the Yellow Sea, its eastern and southern\r\nlimit is the Sea of Japan, a “silver streak,” which has not been its\r\nsalvation. Its northern frontier is only conterminous with that of\r\nRussia for 11 miles.\r\n\r\nBoth boundary rivers rise in Paik-tu San, the “White-Headed Mountain,”\r\nfrom which runs southwards a great mountain range, throwing off\r\nnumerous lateral spurs, itself a rugged spine which divides the\r\nkingdom into two parts, the eastern division being a comparatively\r\nnarrow strip between the range and the Sea of Japan, difficult of\r\naccess, but extremely fertile; while the western section is composed\r\nof rugged hills and innumerable rich valleys and slopes, well watered\r\nand admirably suited for agriculture. Craters of volcanoes, long since\r\npassed into repose, lava beds, and other signs of volcanic action, are\r\nconstantly met with.\r\n\r\nThe lakes are few and very small, and not many of the streams are\r\nnavigable for more than a few miles from the sea, the exceptions\r\nbeing the noble Am-nok, the Tai-döng, the Nak-tong, the Mok-po, and\r\nthe Han, which last, rising in Kang-wön Do, 30 miles from the Sea of\r\nJapan, after cutting the country nearly in half, falls into the sea at\r\nChemulpo on the west coast, and, in spite of many and dangerous rapids,\r\nis a valuable highway for commerce for over 170 miles.\r\n\r\nOwing to the configuration of the peninsula there are few good harbors,\r\nbut those which exist are open all the winter. The finest are Fusan\r\nand Wön-san, on Broughton Bay. Chemulpo, which, as the port of Seoul,\r\ntakes the first place, can hardly be called a harbor at all, the “outer\r\nharbor,” where large vessels and ships of war lie, being nothing better\r\nthan a roadstead, and the “inner harbor,” close to the town, in the\r\nfierce tideway of the estuary of the Han, is only available for five\r\nor six vessels of small tonnage at a time. The east coast is steep and\r\nrocky, the water is deep, and the tide rises and falls from 1 to 2 feet\r\nonly. On the southwest and west coasts the tide rises and falls from 26\r\nto 38 feet!\r\n\r\nOff the latter coasts there is a remarkable archipelago. Some of the\r\nislands are bold masses of arid rock, the resort of seafowl; others\r\nare arable and inhabited, while the actual coast fringes off into\r\ninnumerable islets, some of which are immersed by the spring tides. In\r\nthe channels scoured among these by the tremendous rush of the tide,\r\nnavigation is ofttimes dangerous. Great mud-banks, specially near the\r\nmouths of the rivers, render parts of the coast-line dubious.\r\n\r\nKorea is decidedly a mountainous country, and has few plains deserving\r\nthe name. In the north there are mountain groups with definite centres,\r\nthe most remarkable being Paik-tu San, which attains an altitude\r\nof over 8,000 feet, and is regarded as sacred. Farther south these\r\nsettle into a definite range, following the coast-line at a moderate\r\ndistance, and throwing out so many ranges and spurs to the west as to\r\nbreak up northern and central Korea into a congeries of corrugated and\r\nprecipitous hills, either denuded or covered with _chapparal_, and\r\nnarrow, steep-sided valleys, each furnished with a stony stream. The\r\ngreat axial range, which includes the “Diamond Mountain,” a region\r\ncontaining exquisite mountain and sylvan scenery, falls away as it\r\ndescends towards the southern coast, disintegrating in places into\r\nsmall and often infertile plains.\r\n\r\nThe geological formation is fairly simple. Mesozoic rocks occur in\r\nHwang-hai Do, but granite and metamorphic rocks largely predominate.\r\nNortheast of Seoul are great fields of lava, and lava and volcanic\r\nrocks are of common occurrence in the north.\r\n\r\nThe climate is undoubtedly one of the finest and healthiest in the\r\nworld. Foreigners are not afflicted by any climatic maladies, and\r\nEuropean children can be safely brought up in every part of the\r\npeninsula. July, August, and sometimes the first half of September,\r\nare hot and rainy, but the heat is so tempered by sea breezes that\r\nexercise is always possible. For nine months of the year the skies are\r\ngenerally bright, and a Korean winter is absolutely superb, with its\r\nstill atmosphere, its bright, blue, unclouded sky, its extreme dryness\r\nwithout asperity, and its crisp, frosty nights. From the middle of\r\nSeptember till the end of June, there are neither extremes of heat nor\r\ncold to guard against.\r\n\r\nThe summer mean temperature at Seoul is about 75° Fahrenheit, that of\r\nthe winter about 33°; the average rainfall 36.03 inches in the year,\r\nand the average of the rainy season 21.86 inches.[2] July is the\r\nwettest month, and December the driest. The result of the abundant\r\nrainfall, distributed fairly through the necessitous months of the\r\nyear, is that irrigation is necessary only for the rice crop.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of Korea is considerable, and includes tigers and leopards\r\nin great numbers, bears, antelopes, at least seven species of deer,\r\nfoxes, beavers, otters, badgers, tiger-cats, pigs, several species of\r\nmarten, a sable (not of much value, however), and striped squirrels.\r\nAmong birds there are black eagles, found even near Seoul, harriers,\r\nperegrines (largely used for hawking), pheasants, swans, geese,\r\nspectacled and common teal, mallards, mandarin ducks, turkey buzzards\r\n(very shy), white and pink ibis, sparrow-hawks, kestrels, imperial\r\ncranes, egrets, herons, curlews, night-jars, redshanks, buntings,\r\nmagpies (common and blue), orioles, wood larks, thrushes, redstarts,\r\ncrows, pigeons, doves, rooks, warblers, wagtails, cuckoos, halcyon\r\nand bright blue kingfishers, jays, snipes, nut-hatches, gray shrikes,\r\npheasants, hawks, and kites. But until more careful observations have\r\nbeen made it is impossible to say which of the smaller birds actually\r\nbreed in Korea, and which make it only a halting-place in their annual\r\nmigrations.\r\n\r\nThe denudation of the hills in the neighborhood of Seoul, the coasts,\r\nthe treaty ports, and the main roads, is impressive, and helps to give\r\na very unfavorable idea of the country. It is to the dead alone that\r\nthe preservation of anything deserving the name of timber in much of\r\nsouthern Korea is owing. But in the mountains of the northern and\r\neastern provinces, and specially among those which enclose the sources\r\nof the Tu-men, the Am-nok, the Tai-döng, and the Han, there are very\r\nconsiderable forests, on which up to this time the woodcutter has made\r\nlittle apparent impression, though a good deal of timber is annually\r\nrafted down these rivers.\r\n\r\nAmong the indigenous trees are the _Abies excelsa_, _Abies\r\nmicrosperma_, _Pinus sinensis_, _Pinus pinea_, three species of\r\noak, the lime, ash, birch, five species of maple, the _Acanthopanax\r\nricinifolia_, _Rhus semipinnata_, _Elæagnus_, juniper, mountain\r\nash, hazel, _Thuja Orientalis_ (?), willow, _Sophora Japonica_\r\n(?), hornbeam, plum, peach, _Euonymus alatus_, etc. The flora is\r\nextensive and interesting, but, with the exception of the azalea and\r\nrhododendron, it lacks brilliancy of color. There are several varieties\r\nof showy clematis, and the _mille-fleur_ rose smothers even large\r\ntrees, but the climber _par excellence_ of Korea is the _Ampelopsis\r\nVeitchii_. The economic plants are few, and, with the exception of the\r\n_Panax quinquefolia_ (ginseng), the wild roots of which are worth $15\r\nper ounce, are of no commercial value.\r\n\r\nThe mineral wealth of Korea is a vexed question. Probably between\r\nthe view of the country as an El Dorado and the scepticism as to the\r\nexistence of underground treasure at all, the mean lies. Gold is\r\nlittle used for personal ornaments or in the arts, yet the Korean\r\ndeclares that the dust of his country is gold; and the unquestionable\r\nauthority of a Customs’ report states that gold dust to the amount\r\nof $1,360,279 was exported in 1896, and that it is probable that\r\nthe quantity which left the country undeclared was at least as much\r\nagain. Silver and galena are found, copper is fairly plentiful, and\r\nthe country is rich in undeveloped iron and coal mines, the coal being\r\nof excellent quality. The gold-bearing quartz has never been touched,\r\nbut an American Company, having obtained a concession, has introduced\r\nmachinery, and has gone to work in the province of Phyöng-an.\r\n\r\nThe manufactures are unimportant. The best productions are paper of\r\nseveral qualities made from the _Brousonettia Papyrifera_, among which\r\nis an oiled paper, like vellum in appearance, and so tough that a man\r\ncan be raised from the ground on a sheet of it, lifted at the four\r\ncorners, fine grass mats, and split bamboo blinds.\r\n\r\nThe arts are _nil_.\r\n\r\nKorea, or Ch’ao Hsien, has been ruled by kings of the present dynasty\r\nsince 1392. The monarchy is hereditary, and though some modifications\r\nin a constitutional direction were made during the recent period of\r\nJapanese ascendency, the sovereign is still practically absolute,\r\nhis edicts, as in China, constituting law. The suzerainty of China,\r\nrecognized since very remote days, was personally renounced by the\r\nking at the altar of the Spirits of the Land in January, 1895, and\r\nthe complete independence of Korea was acknowledged by China in the\r\ntreaty of peace signed at Shimonoseki in May of the same year. There\r\nis a Council of State composed of a chancellor, five councillors, six\r\nministers, and a chief secretary. The decree of September, 1896, which\r\nconstitutes this body, announces the king’s absolutism in plain terms\r\nin the preamble.\r\n\r\nThere are nine ministers--the Prime Minister, Minister of the Royal\r\nHousehold, of Finance, of Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, War, Justice,\r\nAgriculture, and Education, but the royal will (or whim) overrides\r\ntheir individual or collective decisions.\r\n\r\nThe Korean army consists of 4,800 men in Seoul, drilled by Russians,\r\nand 1,200 in the provinces; the navy, of two small merchant steamers.\r\n\r\nKorea is divided into 13 provinces and 360 magisterial districts.\r\n\r\nThe revenue, which is amply sufficient for all legitimate expenses, is\r\nderived from Customs’ duties, under the able and honest management of\r\nofficers lent by the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs: a land tax of\r\n$6 on every fertile _kyel_ (a fertile _kyel_ being estimated at about\r\n6¹⁄₃ acres), and $5 on every mountain _kyel_; a household tax of 60\r\ncents per house, houses in the capital enjoying immunity; and a heavy\r\nexcise duty of $16 per _cattie_ on manufactured ginseng.\r\n\r\nUp to 1876 Korea successfully preserved her isolation, and repelled\r\nwith violence any attempt to encroach upon it. In that year Japan\r\nforced a treaty upon her, and in 1882 China followed with “Trade and\r\nFrontier Regulations.” The United States negotiated a treaty in 1882,\r\nGreat Britain and Germany in 1884, Russia and Italy in 1886, and\r\nAustria in 1892, in all which, though under Chinese suzerainty, Korea\r\nwas treated with as an independent state. By these treaties, Seoul and\r\nthe ports of Chemulpo (Jenchuan), Fusan, and Wön-san (Gen-san) were\r\nopened to foreign commerce, and this year (1897) Mok-po and Chinnam-po\r\nhave been added to the list.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaties were signed, a swarm of foreign representatives\r\nsettled down upon the capital, where three of them are housed in\r\nhandsome and conspicuous foreign buildings. The British Minister at\r\nPeking is accredited also to the Korean Court, and Britain has a\r\nresident Consul-General. Japan, Russia, and America are represented\r\nby Ministers, France by a Chargé d’Affaires, and Germany by a Consul.\r\nChina, which has been tardy in entering upon diplomatic relations with\r\nKorea since the war, placed her subjects under the protection of the\r\nBritish Consul-General.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, the coinage of Korea consisted of debased copper\r\n_cash_, 500 to the dollar, a great check on business transactions; but\r\na new fractional coinage, of which the unit is a 20-cent piece, has\r\nbeen put into circulation, along with 5-cent nickel, 5-_cash_ copper,\r\nand 1-_cash_ brass pieces. The fine Japanese _yen_ or dollar is now\r\ncurrent everywhere. The _Dai Ichi Gingo_ and Fifty-eighth Banks of\r\nJapan afford banking facilities in Seoul and the open ports.\r\n\r\nIn the treaty ports of Fusan, Wön-san, and Chemulpo, there were in\r\nJanuary, 1897, 11,318 foreign residents and 266 foreign business firms.\r\nThe Japanese residents numbered 10,711, and their firms 230. The great\r\nmajority of the American and French residents are missionaries, and\r\nthe most conspicuous objects in Seoul are the Roman Cathedral and the\r\nAmerican Methodist Episcopal Church. The number of British subjects\r\nin Korea in January, 1897, was 65, and an agency of a British firm in\r\nNagasaki has recently been opened at Chemulpo. The approximate number\r\nof Chinese in Korea at the same time was 2,500, divided chiefly between\r\nSeoul and Chemulpo. There is a newly-instituted postal system for the\r\ninterior, with postage stamps of four denominations, and a telegraph\r\nsystem, Seoul being now in communication with all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe roads are infamous, and even the main roads are rarely more than\r\nrough bridle tracks. Goods are carried everywhere on the backs of men,\r\nbulls, and ponies, but a railroad from Chemulpo to Seoul, constructed\r\nby an American concessionaire, is actually to be opened shortly.\r\n\r\nThe language of Korea is mixed. The educated classes introduce Chinese\r\nas much as possible into their conversation, and all the literature\r\nof any account is in that language, but it is of an archaic form, the\r\nChinese of 1,000 years ago, and differs completely in pronunciation\r\nfrom Chinese as now spoken in China. _En-mun_, the Korean script,\r\nis utterly despised by the educated, whose sole education is in the\r\nChinese classics. Korean has the distinction of being the only language\r\nof Eastern Asia which possesses an alphabet. Only women, children,\r\nand the uneducated used the _En-mun_ till January, 1895, when a new\r\ndeparture was made by the official Gazette, which for several hundred\r\nyears had been written in Chinese, appearing in a mixture of Chinese\r\ncharacters and _En-mun_, a resemblance to the Japanese mode of writing,\r\nin which the Chinese characters which play the chief part are connected\r\nby _kana_ syllables.\r\n\r\nA further innovation was that the King’s oath of Independence and\r\nReform was promulgated in Chinese, pure _En-mun_, and the mixed script,\r\nand now the latter is regularly employed as the language of ordinances,\r\nofficial documents, and the Gazette; royal rescripts, as a rule, and\r\ndespatches to the foreign representatives still adhering to the old\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThis recognition of the Korean language by means of the official use\r\nof the mixed, and in some cases of the pure script, the abolition\r\nof the Chinese literary examinations as the test of the fitness of\r\ncandidates for office, the use of the “vulgar” script exclusively in\r\nthe _Independent_, the new Korean newspaper, the prominence given to\r\nKorean by the large body of foreign missionaries, and the slow creation\r\nof scientific text-books and a literature in _En-mun_, are tending not\r\nonly to strengthen Korean national feeling, but to bring the “masses,”\r\nwho can mostly read their own script, into contact with Western science\r\nand forms of thought.\r\n\r\nThere is no national religion. Confucianism is the official cult, and\r\nthe teachings of Confucius are the rule of Korean morality. Buddhism,\r\nonce powerful, but “disestablished” three centuries ago, is to be met\r\nwith chiefly in mountainous districts, and far from the main roads.\r\nSpirit worship, a species of _shamanism_, prevails all over the\r\nkingdom, and holds the uneducated masses and the women of all classes\r\nin complete bondage.\r\n\r\nChristian missions, chiefly carried on by Americans, are beginning to\r\nproduce both direct and indirect effects.\r\n\r\nTen years before the opening[3] of Korea to foreigners, the Korean\r\nking, in writing to his suzerain, the Emperor of China, said, “The\r\neducated men observe and practice the teachings of Confucius and Wen\r\nWang,” and this fact is the key to anything like a correct estimate\r\nof Korea. Chinese influence in government, law, education, etiquette,\r\nsocial relations, and morals is predominant. In all these respects\r\nKorea is but a feeble reflection of her powerful neighbor; and though\r\nsince the war the Koreans have ceased to look to China for assistance,\r\ntheir sympathies are with her, and they turn to her for noble\r\nideals, cherished traditions, and moral teachings. Their literature,\r\nsuperstitions, system of education, ancestral worship, culture, and\r\nmodes of thinking are Chinese. Society is organized on Confucian\r\nmodels, and the rights of parents over children, and of elder over\r\nyounger brothers, are as fully recognized as in China.\r\n\r\nIt is into this archaic condition of things, this unspeakable\r\ngrooviness, this irredeemable, unreformed Orientalism, this parody\r\nof China without the robustness of race which helps to hold China\r\ntogether, that the ferment of the Western leaven has fallen, and this\r\nfeeblest of independent kingdoms, rudely shaken out of her sleep of\r\ncenturies, half frightened and wholly dazed, finds herself confronted\r\nwith an array of powerful, ambitious, aggressive, and not always\r\noverscrupulous powers, bent, it may be, on overreaching her and each\r\nother, forcing her into new paths, ringing with rude hands the knell\r\nof time-honored custom, clamoring for concessions, and bewildering her\r\nwith reforms, suggestions, and panaceas, of which she sees neither the\r\nmeaning nor the necessity.\r\n\r\nAnd so “The old order changeth, giving place to new,” and many\r\nindications of the transition will be found in the later of the\r\nfollowing pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The following are the measurements of 1,060 men taken at Seoul in\r\nJanuary, 1897, by Mr. A.

The Island of Tsushima, where the _Higo Maru_ calls,\r\nwas, however, my last glimpse of Japan; and its reddening maples and\r\nblossoming plums, its temple-crowned heights, its stately flights of\r\nstone stairs leading to Shinto shrines in the woods, the blue-green\r\nmasses of its pines, and the golden plumage of its bamboos, emphasized\r\nthe effect produced by the brown, bare hills of Fusan, pleasant enough\r\nin summer, but grim and forbidding on a sunless February day. The\r\nIsland of the Interrupted Shadow, Chŏl-yong-To, (Deer Island), high and\r\ngrassy, on which the Japanese have established a coaling station and a\r\nquarantine hospital, shelters Fusan harbor.\r\n\r\nIt is not Korea but Japan which meets one on anchoring. The lighters\r\nare Japanese. An official of the _Nippon Yusen Kaisha_ (Japan Mail\r\nSteamship Co.), to which the _Higo Maru_ belongs, comes off with\r\norders. The tide-waiter, however, is English--one of the English\r\n_employés_ of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs, lent to Korea,\r\ngreatly to her advantage, for the management of her customs’ revenue.\r\nThe foreign settlement of Fusan is dominated by a steep bluff\r\nwith a Buddhist temple on the top, concealed by a number of fine\r\ncryptomeria, planted during the Japanese occupation in 1592. It is\r\na fairly good-looking Japanese town, somewhat packed between the\r\nhills and the sea, with wide streets of Japanese shops and various\r\nAnglo-Japanese buildings, among which the Consulate and a Bank are\r\nthe most important. It has substantial retaining and sea walls, and\r\ndraining, lighting, and roadmaking have been carried out at the expense\r\nof the municipality. Since the war, waterworks have been constructed\r\nby a rate of 100 _cash_ levied on each house, and it is hoped that the\r\npresent abundant supply of pure water will make an end of the frequent\r\nepidemics of cholera. Above the town, the new Japanese military\r\ncemetery, filling rapidly, is the prominent object.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the creation of a demand for foreign goods is not\r\nthirteen years old, it is amazing to find how the Koreans have taken\r\nto them, and that the foreign trade of Fusan has developed so rapidly\r\nthat, while in 1885 the value of exports and imports combined only\r\namounted to £77,850, in 1892 it had reached £346,608. Unbleached\r\nshirtings, lawns, muslins, cambrics, and Turkey reds for children’s\r\nwear have all captivated Korean fancy; but the conservatism of wadded\r\ncotton garments in winter does not yield to foreign woollens, of which\r\nthe importation is literally _nil_. The most amazing stride is in the\r\nimportation of American kerosene oil, which has reached 71,000 gallons\r\nin a quarter; and which, by displacing the fish-oil lamp and the dismal\r\nrushlight in the paper lantern, is revolutionizing evening life in\r\nKorea. Matches, too, have “caught on” wonderfully, and evidently have\r\n“come to stay.” Hides, beans, dried fish, _bêche de mer_, rice, and\r\nwhale’s flesh are among the principal exports. It was not till 1883\r\nthat Fusan was officially opened to general foreign trade, and its\r\nrise has been most remarkable. In that year its foreign population was\r\n1,500; in 1897 it was 5,564.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of 1885 the Japan Mail Steamship Co. ran only one\r\nsteamer, calling at Fusan, to Wladivostok every five weeks, and a small\r\nboat to Chemulpo, calling at Fusan, once a month. Now not a day passes\r\nwithout steamers, large or small, arriving at the port, and in addition\r\nto the fine vessels of the _Nippon Yusen Kaisha_, running frequently\r\nbetween Kobe and Wladivostok, Shanghai and Wladivostok, Kobe and\r\nTientsin, and between Kobe Chefoo, and Newchang, all calling at Fusan,\r\nthree other lines, including one from Osaka direct, and a Russian mail\r\nline running between Shanghai and Wladivostok, make Fusan a port of\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nIt appears that about one-third of the goods imported is carried inland\r\non the backs of men and horses. The taxes levied and the delays at\r\nthe barriers on both the overland and river routes are intolerable\r\nto traders, a hateful custom prevailing under which each station is\r\ncontrolled by some petty official, who, for a certain sum paid to the\r\nGovernment in Seoul, obtains permission to levy taxes on all goods.[4]\r\nThe Nak-Tong River, the mouth of which is 7 miles from Fusan, is\r\nnavigable for steamers drawing 5 feet of water as far as Miriang, 50\r\nmiles up, and for junks drawing 4 feet as far as Sa-mun, 100 miles\r\nfarther, from which point their cargoes, transhipped into light\r\ndraught boats, can ascend to Sang-chin, 170 miles from the coast. With\r\nthis available waterway, and a hazy prospect that the much disputed\r\nSeoul-Fusan railway may become an accomplished fact, Fusan bids fair\r\nto become an important centre of commerce, as the Kyöng-sang Province,\r\nsaid to be the most populous of the eight (now for administrative\r\npurposes thirteen), is also said to be the most prosperous and\r\nfruitful, with the possible exception of Chul-la.\r\n\r\nBarren as the neighboring hills look, they are probably rich in\r\nminerals. Gold is found in several places within a radius of 50 miles,\r\ncopper quite near, and there are coal fields within 100 miles.\r\n\r\nTo all intents and purposes the settlement of Fusan is Japanese. In\r\naddition to the Japanese population of 5,508, there is a floating\r\npopulation of 8,000 Japanese fishermen. A Japanese Consul-General\r\nlives in a fine European house. Banking facilities are furnished by\r\nthe Dai Ichi Gingo of Tokio, and the post and telegraph services are\r\nalso Japanese. Japanese too is the cleanliness of the settlement,\r\nand the introduction of industries unknown to Korea, such as rice\r\nhusking and cleaning by machinery, whale-fishing, _sake_-making, and\r\nthe preparation of shark’s fins, _bêche de mer_, and fish manure,\r\nthe latter an unsavory fertilizer, of which enormous quantities are\r\nexported to Japan.\r\n\r\nBut the reader asks impatiently, “Where are the Koreans? I don’t want\r\nto read about the Japanese!” Nor do I want to write about them, but\r\nfacts are stubborn, and they are the outstanding Fusan fact.\r\n\r\nAs seen from the deck of the steamer, a narrow up and down path keeping\r\nat some height above the sea skirts the hillside for 3 miles from\r\nFusan, passing by a small Chinese settlement with official buildings,\r\nuninhabited when I last saw them, and terminating in the walled town\r\nof Fusan proper, with a fort of very great antiquity outside it,\r\nmodernized by the Japanese after the engineering notions of three\r\ncenturies ago.\r\n\r\nSeated on the rocks along the shore were white objects resembling\r\npelicans or penguins, but as white objects with the gait of men moved\r\nin endless procession to and fro between old and new Fusan, I assumed\r\nthat the seated objects were of the same species. The Korean makes\r\nupon one the impression of novelty, and while resembling neither the\r\nChinese nor the Japanese, he is much better-looking than either,\r\nand his physique is far finer than that of the latter. Though his\r\naverage height is only 5 feet 4¹⁄₂ inches, his white dress, which\r\nis voluminous, makes him look taller, and his high-crowned hat,\r\nwithout which he is never seen, taller still. The men were in winter\r\ndress--white cotton sleeved robes, huge trousers, and socks; all\r\nwadded. On their heads were black silk wadded caps with pendant sides\r\nedged with black fur, and on the top of these, rather high-crowned,\r\nsomewhat broad-brimmed hats of black “crinoline” or horsehair gauze,\r\ntied under the chin with crinoline ribbon. The general effect was\r\ngrotesque. There were a few children on the path, bundles of gay\r\nclothing, but no women.\r\n\r\nI was accompanied to old Fusan by a charming English “Una,” who,\r\nspeaking Korean almost like a native, moved serenely through the\r\nmarket-day crowds, welcomed by all. A miserable place I thought it, and\r\nlater experience showed that it was neither more nor less miserable\r\nthan the general run of Korean towns. Its narrow dirty streets consist\r\nof low hovels built of mud-smeared wattle without windows, straw\r\nroofs, and deep eaves, a black smoke-hole in every wall 2 feet from\r\nthe ground, and outside most are irregular ditches containing solid\r\nand liquid refuse. Mangy dogs and blear-eyed children, half or wholly\r\nnaked, and scaly with dirt, roll in the deep dust or slime, or pant and\r\nblink in the sun, apparently unaffected by the stenches which abound.\r\nBut market-day hid much that is repulsive. Along the whole length of\r\nthe narrow, dusty, crooked street, the wares were laid out on mats on\r\nthe ground, a man or an old woman, bundled up in dirty white cotton,\r\nguarding each. And the sound of bargaining rose high, and much breath\r\nwas spent on beating down prices, which did not amount originally to\r\nthe tenth part of a farthing. The goods gave an impression of poor\r\nbuyers and small trade. Short lengths of coarse white cotton, skeins\r\nof cotton, straw shoes, wooden combs, tobacco pipes and pouches,\r\ndried fish and seaweed, cord for girdles, paper rough and smooth, and\r\nbarley-sugar nearly black, were the contents of the mats. I am sure\r\nthat the most valuable stock-in-trade there was not worth more than\r\nthree dollars. Each vendor had a small heap of _cash_ beside him, an\r\nuncouth bronze coin with a square hole in the centre, of which at that\r\ntime 3,200 _nominally_ went to the dollar, and which greatly trammelled\r\nand crippled Korean trade.\r\n\r\nA market is held in Fusan and in many other places every fifth day.\r\nOn these the country people rely for all which they do not produce,\r\nas well as for the sale or barter of their productions. Practically\r\nthere are no shops in the villages and small towns, their needs\r\nbeing supplied on stated days by travelling pedlars who form a very\r\ninfluential guild.\r\n\r\nTurning away from the bustle of the main street into a narrow,\r\ndirty alley, and then into a native compound, I found the three\r\nAustralian ladies who were the objects of my visit to this decayed and\r\nmiserable town. Except that the compound was clean, it was in no way\r\ndistinguishable from any other, being surrounded by mud hovels. In one\r\nof these, exposed to the full force of the southern sun, these ladies\r\nwere living. The mud walls were concealed with paper, and photographs\r\nand other European knickknacks conferred a look of refinement. But\r\nnot only were the rooms so low that one of the ladies could not stand\r\nupright in them, but privacy was impossible, invasions of Korean women\r\nand children succeeding each other from morning to night, so that\r\neven dressing was a spectacle for the curious. Friends urged these\r\nladies not to take this step of living in a Korean town 3 miles from\r\nEuropeans. It was represented that it was not safe, and that their\r\nhealth would suffer from the heat and fetid odors of the crowded\r\nneighborhood, etc. In truth it was not a “conventional thing” to do.\r\n\r\nOn my first visit I found them well and happy. Small children were\r\nclinging to their skirts, and a certain number of women had been\r\ninduced to become cleanly in their persons and habits. All the\r\nneighbors were friendly, and rude remarks in the streets had altogether\r\nceased. Many of the women resorted to them for medical help, and the\r\nsimple aid they gave brought them much good-will. This friendly and\r\ncivilizing influence was the result of a year of living under very\r\ndetestable circumstances. If they had dwelt in grand houses 2¹⁄₂ miles\r\noff upon the hill, it is safe to say that the result would have been\r\n_nil_. Without any fuss or blowing of trumpets, they quietly helped to\r\nsolve one of the great problems as to “Missionary Methods,” though why\r\nit should be a “problem” I fail to see. In the East at least, every\r\nreligious teacher who has led the people has lived among them, knowing\r\nif not sharing their daily lives, and has been easily accessible at all\r\ntimes. It is not easy to imagine a Buddha or One greater than Buddha\r\nonly reached by favor of, and possibly by feeing, a gate-keeper or\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nOn visiting them a year later I found them still well and happy. The\r\nexcitement among the Koreans consequent on the Tong-hak rebellion and\r\nthe war had left them unmolested. A Japanese regiment had encamped\r\nclose to them, and, by permission, had drawn water from the well in\r\ntheir compound, and had shown them nothing but courtesy. Having in\r\ntwo years gained general confidence and good-will, they built a small\r\nbungalow just above the old native house, which has been turned into a\r\nvery primitive orphanage.\r\n\r\nThe people were friendly and kind from the first. Those who were the\r\nearliest friends of the ladies are their staunchest friends now, and\r\nthey knew them and their aims so well when they moved into their new\r\nhouse that it made no difference at all. Some go there to see the\r\nladies, others to see the furniture or hear the organ, and a few to\r\ninquire about the “Jesus doctrine.” The “mission work” now consists of\r\ndaily meetings for worship, classes for applicants for baptism, classes\r\nat night for those women who may not come out in the daytime, a Sunday\r\nschool with an attendance of eighty, visiting among the people, and\r\ngiving instruction in the country and surrounding villages. About forty\r\nadults have professed Christianity, and regularly attend Christian\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nI mention these facts not for the purpose of glorifying these ladies,\r\nwho are simply doing their duty, but because they fall in with a theory\r\nof my own as to methods of mission work.\r\n\r\nThere is a very small Roman Catholic mission-house, seldom tenanted,\r\nbetween the two Fusans. In the province of Kyöng-sang in which they\r\nare, there are Roman missions which claim 2,000 converts, and to\r\npromulgate Christianity in thirty towns and villages. There are\r\ntwo foreign priests, who spend most of the year in teaching in the\r\nprovincial villages, living in Korean huts, in Korean fashion, on\r\nKorean food.\r\n\r\nA coarse ocean with a distinct line of demarcation between the blue\r\nwater of the Sea of Japan and the discoloration of the Yellow Sea,\r\nharsh, grim, rocky, brown islands, mostly uninhabited--two monotonously\r\ndisagreeable days, more islands, muddier water, an estuary and junks,\r\nand on the third afternoon from Fusan the _Higo Maru_ anchored in the\r\nroadstead of Chemulpo, the seaport of Seoul. This cannot pretend to\r\nbe a harbor, indeed most of the roadstead, such as it is, is a slimy\r\nmud flat for much of the day, the tide rising and falling 36 feet.\r\nThe anchorage, a narrow channel in the shallows, can accommodate five\r\nvessels of moderate size. Yet though the mud was _en évidence_, and\r\nthe low hill behind the town was dull brown, and a drizzling rain was\r\nfalling, I liked the look of Chemulpo better than I expected, and after\r\nbecoming acquainted with it in various seasons and circumstances,\r\nI came to regard it with very friendly feelings. As seen from the\r\nroadstead, it is a collection of mean houses, mostly of wood, painted\r\nwhite, built along the edge of the sea and straggling up a verdureless\r\nhill, the whole extending for more than a mile from a low point on\r\nwhich are a few trees, crowned by the English Vice-Consulate, a\r\ncomfortless and unworthy building, to a hill on which are a large\r\ndecorative Japanese tea-house, a garden, and a Shinto shrine. Salient\r\nfeatures there are none, unless the house of a German merchant, an\r\nEnglish church, the humble buildings of Bishop Corfe’s mission on the\r\nhill, the large Japanese Consulate, and some new municipal buildings on\r\na slope, may be considered such. As at Fusan, an English tide-waiter\r\nboarded the ship, and a foreign harbormaster berthed her, while a\r\nJapanese clerk gave the captain his orders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARBOR OF CHEMULPO.]\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkinson, the acting British Vice-Consul, came off for me,\r\nand entertained me then and on two subsequent occasions with great\r\nhospitality, but as the Vice-Consulate had at that time no guest-room,\r\nI slept at a Chinese inn, known as “Steward’s,” kept by Itai, an honest\r\nand helpful man who does all he can to make his guests comfortable, and\r\npartially succeeds. This inn is at the corner of the main street of\r\nthe Chinese quarter, in a very lively position, as it also looks down\r\nthe main street of the Japanese settlement. The Chinese settlement is\r\nsolid, with a handsome _yamen_ and guild hall, and rows of thriving\r\nand substantial shops. Busy and noisy with the continual letting off\r\nof crackers and beating of drums and gongs, the Chinese were obviously\r\nfar ahead of the Japanese in trade. They had nearly a monopoly of the\r\nforeign “custom”; their large “houses” in Chemulpo had branches in\r\nSeoul, and if there were any foreign requirement which they could not\r\nmeet, they procured the article from Shanghai without loss of time.\r\nThe haulage of freight to Seoul was in their hands, and the market\r\ngardening, and much besides. Late into the night they were at work,\r\nand they used the roadway for drying hides and storing kerosene tins\r\nand packing cases. Scarcely did the noise of night cease when the din\r\nof morning began. To these hard-working and money-making people rest\r\nseemed a superfluity.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese settlement is far more populous, extensive, and\r\npretentious. Their Consulate is imposing enough for a legation. They\r\nhave several streets of small shops, which supply the needs chiefly\r\nof people of their own nationality, for foreigners patronize Ah Wong\r\nand Itai, and the Koreans, who hate the Japanese with a hatred three\r\ncenturies old, also deal chiefly with the Chinese. But though the\r\nJapanese were outstripped in trade by the Chinese, their position in\r\nKorea, even before the war, was an influential one. They gave “postal\r\nfacilities” between the treaty ports and Seoul and carried the foreign\r\nmails, and they established branches of the First National Bank[5]\r\nin the capital and treaty ports, with which the resident foreigners\r\nhave for years transacted their business, and in which they have full\r\nconfidence. I lost no time in opening an account with this Bank in\r\nChemulpo, receiving an English check-book and pass-book, and on all\r\noccasions courtesy and all needed help. Partly owing to the fact that\r\nEnglish cottons for Korea are made in bales too big for the Lilliputian\r\nKorean pony, involving reduction to more manageable dimensions on being\r\nlanded, and partly to causes which obtain elsewhere, the Japanese\r\nare so successfully pushing their cottons in Korea, that while they\r\nconstituted only 3 per cent. of the imports in 1887, they had risen\r\nto something like 40 per cent. in 1894.[6] There is a rapidly growing\r\ndemand for yarn to be woven on native looms. The Japanese are well\r\nto the front with steam and sailing tonnage. Of 198 steamers entered\r\ninwards in 1893, 132 were Japanese; and out of 325 sailing vessels,\r\n232 were Japanese. It is on record that an English merchantman was\r\nonce seen in Chemulpo roads, but actually the British mercantile flag,\r\nunless on a chartered steamer, is not known in Korean waters. Nor was\r\nthere in 1894 an English merchant in the Korean treaty ports, or an\r\nEnglish house of business, large or small, in Korea.\r\n\r\nJust then rice was in the ascendant. Japan by means of pressure\r\nhad induced the Korean Government to consent to suspend the decree\r\nforbidding its export, and on a certain date the sluices were to be\r\nopened. Stacks of rice bags covered the beach, rice in bulk being\r\nmeasured into bags was piled on mats in the roadways, ponies and\r\ncoolies rice-laden filed in strings down the streets, while in the\r\nroadstead a number of Japanese steamers and junks awaited the taking\r\noff the embargo at midnight on 6th March. A regular rice babel\r\nprevailed in the town and on the beach, and much disaffection prevailed\r\namong the Koreans at the rise in the price of their staple article of\r\ndiet. Japanese agents scoured the whole country for rice, and every\r\n_cattie_ of it which could be spared from consumption was bought in\r\npreparation for the war of which no one in Korea dreamed at that time.\r\nThe rice bustle gave Chemulpo an appearance of a thriving trade which\r\nit is not wont to have except in the Chinese settlement. Its foreign\r\npopulation in 1897 was 4,357.\r\n\r\nThe reader may wonder where the Koreans are at Chemulpo, and in truth\r\nI had almost forgotten them, for they are of little account. The\r\nincreasing native town lies outside the Japanese settlement on the\r\nSeoul road, clustering round the base of the hill on which the English\r\nchurch stands, and scrambling up it, mud hovels planting themselves\r\non every ledge, attained by filthy alleys, swarming with quiet dirty\r\nchildren, who look on the high-road to emulate the _do-lessness_ of\r\ntheir fathers. Korean, too, is the official _yamen_ at the top of the\r\nhill, and Korean its methods of punishment, its brutal flagellations\r\nby _yamen_ runners, its beating of criminals to death, their howls of\r\nanguish penetrating the rooms of the adjacent English mission, and\r\nKorean too are the bribery and corruption which make it and nearly\r\nevery _yamen_ sinks of iniquity. The gate with its double curved roofs\r\nand drum chamber over the gateway remind the stranger that though the\r\ncapital and energy of Chemulpo are foreign, the government is native.\r\nNot Korean is the abode of mercy on the other side of the road from the\r\n_yamen_, the hospital connected with Bishop Corfe’s mission, where in\r\na small Korean building the sick are received, tended, and generally\r\ncured by Dr. Landis, who himself lives as a Korean in rooms 8 feet by\r\n6, studying, writing, eating, without chair or table, and accessible\r\nat all times to all comers. The 6,700 inhabitants of the Korean town,\r\nor rather the male half of them, are always on the move. The narrow\r\nroads are always full of them, sauntering along in their dress hats,\r\nnot apparently doing anything. It is old Fusan over again, except\r\nthat there are permanent shops, with stocks-in-trade worth from one\r\nto twenty dollars; and as an hour is easily spent over a transaction\r\ninvolving a few _cash_, there is an appearance of business kept up.\r\nIn the settlement the Koreans work as porters and carry preposterous\r\nweights on their wooden packsaddles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATE OF OLD FUSAN]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] According to Mr. Hunt, the Commissioner of Customs at Fusan, in\r\nthe Kyöng-sang province alone there are 17 such stations. Fusan is\r\nhedged round by a cordon of them within a ten-mile radius, and on the\r\nNak-tong, which is the waterway to the provincial capital, there are\r\nfour in a distance of 25 miles.\r\n\r\n[5] Now the _Dai Ichi Gingo_.\r\n\r\n[6] For latest trade statistics see appendix B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE CAPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nChemulpo, being on the island-studded estuary of the Han, which is\r\nnavigable for the 56 miles up to Ma-pu, the river port of Seoul, it\r\neventually occurred to some persons more enterprising than their\r\nneighbors to establish steam communication between the two. Manifold\r\nare the disasters which have attended this simple undertaking. Nearly\r\nevery passenger who has entrusted himself to the river has a tale to\r\ntell of the boat being deposited on a sandbank, and of futile endeavors\r\nto get off, of fretting and fuming, usually ending in hailing a passing\r\n_sampan_ and getting up to Ma-pu many hours behind time, tired, hungry,\r\nand disgusted. For the steam launches are only half powered for their\r\nwork, the tides are strong, the river shallows often, and its sandbanks\r\nshift almost from tide to tide. Hence this natural highway is not\r\nmuch patronized by people who respect themselves, and all sorts of\r\narrangements are made for getting up to the capital by “road.” There\r\nis, properly speaking, no road, but the word serves. Mr. Gardner, the\r\nBritish acting Consul-General in Seoul, kindly arranged to escort me\r\nthe 25 miles, and I went up in seven hours in a chair with six bearers,\r\njolly fellows, who joked and laughed and raced the Consul’s pony.\r\nTraffic has worn for itself a track, often indefinite, but usually\r\nstraggling over and sterilizing a width enough for three or four\r\nhighways, and often making a new departure to avoid deep mud holes.\r\nThe mud is nearly bottomless. Bullock-carts owned by Chinese attempt\r\nthe transit of goods, and two or three embedded in the mud till the\r\nspring showed with what success. Near Ma-pu all traffic has to cross\r\na small plain of deep sand. Pack bulls, noble animals, and men are the\r\ncarriers of goods. The redoubtable Korean pony was not to be seen. Foot\r\npassengers in dress hats and wadded white garments were fairly numerous.\r\n\r\nThe track lies through rolling country, well cultivated. There are\r\nonly two or three villages on the road, but there are many, surrounded\r\nby fruit trees, in the folds of the adjacent low hills; stunted pines\r\n(_Pinus sinensis_) abound, and often indicate places of burial. The\r\nhillsides are much taken up with graves. There are wooden sign or\r\ndistant posts, with grotesque human faces upon them, chiefly that of\r\nChang Sun, a traitor, whose misdemeanors were committed 1,000 years\r\nago. The general aspect of the country is bare and monotonous. Except\r\nfor the orchards and the spindly pines, there is no wood. There is\r\nno beauty of form, nor any of those signs of exclusiveness, such as\r\ngates or walls, which give something of dignity to a landscape. These\r\nwere my first impressions. But I came to see on later journeys that\r\neven on that road there can be a beauty and fascination in the scenery\r\nwhen glorified and idealized by the unrivalled atmosphere of a Korean\r\nwinter, which it is a delight even to recall, and that the situation of\r\nSeoul for a sort of weird picturesqueness compares favorably with that\r\nof almost any other capital, but its orientalism, a marked feature of\r\nwhich was its specially self-asserting dirt, is being fast improved off\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the low pass known as the Gap, there is a view of the hills in the\r\nneighborhood of Seoul, and before reaching the Han these, glorified and\r\nexaggerated by an effect of atmosphere, took on something of grandeur.\r\nCrossing the Han in a scow to which my chair accommodated itself more\r\nreadily than Mr. Gardner’s pony, and encountering ferry boats full of\r\npack bulls bearing the night soil of the city to the country, we landed\r\non the rough, steep, filthy, miry river bank, and were at once in\r\nthe foul, narrow, slimy, rough street of Ma-pu, a twisted alley full\r\nof mean shops for the sale of native commodities, of bulls carrying\r\nmountains of brushwood which nearly filled up the roadway; and with a\r\ncrowd, masculine solely, which swayed and loafed, and did nothing in\r\nparticular. Some quiet agricultural country, and some fine trees, a\r\nresemblance to the land of the Bakhtiari Lurs, in the fact of one man\r\nworking a spade or shovel, while three others helped him to turn up the\r\nsoil by an arrangement of ropes, then two chairs with bearers in blue\r\nuniforms, carrying Mrs. and Miss Gardner, accompanied by Bishop Corfe,\r\nMr. M’Leavy Brown, the Chief Commissioner of Korean Customs, and Mr.\r\nFox, the Assistant Consul, then the hovels and alleys became thick,\r\nand we were in extra-mural Seoul. A lofty wall, pierced by a deep\r\ndouble-roofed gateway, was passed, and ten minutes more of miserable\r\nalleys brought us to a breezy hill, crowned by the staring red brick\r\nbuildings of the English Legation and Consular offices.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Legation has taken another and a higher, and its loftly\r\ntower and fine façade are the most conspicuous objects in the city,\r\nwhile a third is covered with buildings, some Korean and tasteful, but\r\nothers in a painful style of architecture, a combination of the factory\r\nwith the meeting-house, belonging to the American Methodist Episcopal\r\nMission, the American Presbyterians occupying a humbler position below.\r\nA hill on the other side of the town is dedicated to Japan, and so in\r\nevery part of the city the foreigner, shut out till 1883, is making his\r\npresence felt, and is undermining that which is Korean in the Korean\r\ncapital by the slow process of contact.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable indications of the change which is stealing\r\nover the Hermit City is that a nearly finished Roman Catholic\r\nCathedral, of very large size, with a clergy-house and orphanages,\r\noccupies one of the most prominent positions in Seoul. The King’s\r\nfather, the Tai-Won-Kun, still actively engaged in politics, is the man\r\nwho, thirty years ago, persecuted the Roman Christians so cruelly and\r\npersistently as to raise up for Korea a “noble army of martyrs.”\r\n\r\nI know Seoul by day and night, its palaces and its slums, its\r\nunspeakable meanness and faded splendors, its purposeless crowds, its\r\nmediæval processions, which for barbaric splendor cannot be matched\r\non earth, the filth of its crowded alleys, and its pitiful attempt to\r\nretain its manners, customs, and identity as the capital of an ancient\r\nmonarchy in face of the host of disintegrating influences which are at\r\nwork, but it is not at first that one “takes it in.” I had known it for\r\na year before I appreciated it, or fully realized that it is entitled\r\nto be regarded as one of the great capitals of the world, with its\r\nsupposed population of a quarter of a million, and that few capitals\r\nare more beautifully situated.[7] One hundred and twenty feet above the\r\nsea, in Lat. 37° 34′ N. and Long. 127° 6′ E., mountain-girdled, for the\r\ndefinite peaks and abrupt elevation of its hills give them the grandeur\r\nof mountains, though their highest summit, San-kak-San, has only an\r\naltitude of 2,627 feet, few cities can boast, as Seoul can, that tigers\r\nand leopards are shot within their walls! Arid and forbidding these\r\nmountains look at times, their ridges broken up into black crags and\r\npinnacles, ofttimes rising from among distorted pines, but there are\r\nevenings of purple glory, when every forbidding peak gleams like an\r\namethyst with a pink translucency, and the shadows are cobalt and the\r\nsky is green and gold. Fair are the surroundings too in early spring,\r\nwhen a delicate green mist veils the hills, and their sides are flushed\r\nwith the heliotrope azalea, and flame of plum, and blush of cherry, and\r\ntremulousness of peach blossom appear in unexpected quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE MILITARY CEMETERY, CHEMULPO.]\r\n\r\nLooking down on this great city, which has the aspect of a lotus pond\r\nin November, or an expanse of overripe mushrooms, the eye naturally\r\nfollows the course of the wall, which is discerned in most outlandish\r\nplaces, climbing Nam-San in one direction, and going clear over the\r\ncrest of Puk-han in another, enclosing a piece of forest here, and\r\na vacant plain there, descending into ravines, disappearing and\r\nreappearing when least expected. This wall, which contrives to look\r\nnearly as solid as the hillsides which it climbs, is from 25 to 40\r\nfeet in height, and 14 miles in circumference (according to Mr. Fox of\r\nH.B.M.’s Consular Service), battlemented along its entire length, and\r\npierced by eight gateways, solid arches or tunnels of stone, surmounted\r\nby lofty gate houses with one, two, or three curved tiled roofs. These\r\nare closed from sunset to sunrise by massive wooden gates, heavily\r\nbossed and strengthened with iron, bearing, following Chinese fashion,\r\nhigh-sounding names, such as the “Gate of Bright Amiability,” the “Gate\r\nof High Ceremony,” the “Gate of Elevated Humanity.”\r\n\r\nThe wall consists of a bank of earth faced with masonry, or of solid\r\nmasonry alone, and is on the whole in tolerable repair. It is on the\r\nside nearest the river, and onwards in the direction of the Peking\r\nPass, that extra-mural Seoul has expanded. One gate is the Gate of the\r\nDead, only a royal corpse being permitted to be carried out by any\r\nother. By another gate criminals passed out to be beheaded, and outside\r\nanother their heads were exposed for some days after execution, hanging\r\nfrom camp-kettle stands. The north gate, high on Puk-han, is kept\r\nclosed, only to be opened in case the King is compelled to escape to\r\none of the so-called fortresses on that mountain.\r\n\r\nOutside the wall is charming country, broken into hills and wooded\r\nvalleys, with knolls sacrificed to stately royal tombs, with their\r\nenvironment of fine trees, and villages in romantic positions among\r\norchards and garden cultivation. Few Eastern cities have prettier walks\r\nand rides in their immediate neighborhood, or greater possibilities of\r\nrapid escape into sylvan solitudes, and I must add that no city has\r\nenvirons so safe, and that ladies without a European escort can ride,\r\nas I have done, in every direction outside the walls without meeting\r\nwith the slightest annoyance.\r\n\r\nI shrink from describing intra-mural Seoul.[8] I thought it the foulest\r\ncity on earth till I saw Peking, and its smells the most odious, till\r\nI encountered those of Shao-shing! For a great city and a capital\r\nits meanness is indescribable. Etiquette forbids the erection of\r\ntwo-storied houses, consequently an estimated quarter of a million\r\npeople are living on “the ground,” chiefly in labyrinthine alleys, many\r\nof them not wide enough for two loaded bulls to pass, indeed barely\r\nwide enough for one man to pass a loaded bull, and further narrowed by\r\na series of vile holes or green, slimy ditches, which receive the solid\r\nand liquid refuse of the houses, their foul and fetid margins being\r\nthe favorite resort of half-naked children, begrimed with dirt, and\r\nof big, mangy, blear-eyed dogs, which wallow in the slime or blink in\r\nthe sun. There too the itinerant vendor of “small wares,” and candies\r\ndyed flaring colors with aniline dyes, establishes himself, puts a\r\nfew planks across the ditch, and his goods, worth perhaps a dollar,\r\nthereon. But even Seoul has its “spring cleaning,” and I encountered on\r\nthe sand plain of the Han, on the ferry, and on the road from Ma-pu to\r\nSeoul, innumerable bulls carrying panniers laden with the contents of\r\nthe city ditches.\r\n\r\nThe houses abutting on these ditches are generally hovels with deep\r\neaves and thatched roofs, presenting nothing to the street but a mud\r\nwall, with occasionally a small paper window just under the roof,\r\nindicating the men’s quarters, and invariably, at a height varying\r\nfrom 2 to 3 feet above the ditch, a blackened smoke-hole, the vent\r\nfor the smoke and heated air, which have done their duty in warming\r\nthe floor of the house. All day long bulls laden with brushwood to\r\na great height are entering the city, and at six o’clock this pine\r\nbrush, preparing to do the cooking and warming for the population,\r\nfills every lane in Seoul with aromatic smoke, which hangs over it with\r\nremarkable punctuality. Even the superior houses, which have curved and\r\ntiled roofs, present nothing better to the street than this debased\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe shops partake of the general meanness. Shops with a stock-in-trade\r\nwhich may be worth six dollars abound. It is easy to walk in Seoul\r\nwithout molestation, but any one standing to look at anything attracts\r\na great crowd, so that it is as well that there is nothing to look\r\nat. The shops have literally not a noteworthy feature. Their one\r\ncharacteristic is that they have none! The best shops are near the\r\nGreat Bell, beside which formerly stood a stone with an inscription\r\ncalling on all Koreans to put intruding foreigners to death. So small\r\nare they that all goods are within reach of the hand. In one of the\r\nthree broad streets, there are double rows of removable booths, in\r\nwhich now and then a small box of Korean _niello_ work, iron inlaid\r\nwith silver, may be picked up. In these and others the principal\r\ncommodities are white cottons, straw shoes, bamboo hats, coarse\r\npottery, candlesticks, with draught screens, combs, glass beads,\r\npipes, tobacco-pouches, spittoons, horn-rimmed goggles, much worn\r\nby officials, paper of many kinds, wooden pillow-ends, decorated\r\npillowcases, fans, ink-cases, huge wooden saddles with green leather\r\nflaps bossed with silver, laundry sticks, dried persimmons, loathsome\r\ncandies dyed magenta, scarlet, and green, masses of dried seaweed and\r\nfungi, and ill-chosen collections of the most trumpery of foreign\r\ntrash, such as sixpenny kerosene lamps, hand mirrors, tinsel vases,\r\netc., the genius of bad taste presiding over all.\r\n\r\nPlain brass dinner sets and other brass articles are made, and\r\nsome mother-of-pearl inlaying in black lacquer from old designs is\r\noccasionally to be purchased, and embroideries in silk and gold thread,\r\nbut the designs are ugly, and the coloring atrocious. Foreigners\r\nhave bestowed the name Cabinet Street on a street near the English\r\nLegation, given up to the making of bureaus and marriage chests. These,\r\nthough not massive, look so, and are really handsome, some being of\r\nsolid chestnut wood, others veneered with maple or peach, and bossed,\r\nstrapped, and hinged with brass, besides being ornamented with great\r\nbrass hasps and brass padlocks 6 inches long. These, besides being\r\nthoroughly Korean, are distinctly decorative. There are few buyers,\r\nexcept in the early morning, and shopping does not seem a pastime,\r\npartly because none but the poorest class of women can go out on foot\r\nby daylight.\r\n\r\nIn the booths are to be seen tobacco pipes, pipestems, and bowls,\r\ncoarse glazed pottery, rice bowls, Japanese lucifer matches, aniline\r\ndyes, tobacco-pouches, purses, flint and tinder pouches, rolls of oiled\r\npaper, tassels, silk cord, nuts of the edible pine, rice, millet,\r\nmaize, peas, beans, string shoes, old crinoline hats, bamboo and reed\r\nhats in endless variety, and coarse native cotton, very narrow.\r\n\r\nIn this great human hive, the ordinary sightseer finds his vocation\r\ngone. The inhabitants constitute the “sight” of Seoul. The great bronze\r\nbell, said to be the third largest in the world, is one of the few\r\n“sights” usually seen by strangers. It hangs in a bell tower in the\r\ncentre of the city, and bears the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n “Sye Cho the Great, 12^{th} year Man cha [year of the cycle] and moon,\r\n the 4^{th} year of the great Ming Emperor Hsüan-hua [A.D. 1468], the\r\n head of the bureau of Royal despatches, Sye Ko chyeng, bearing the\r\n title Sa Ka Chyeng, had this pavilion erected and this bell hung.”\r\n\r\nThis bell, whose dull heavy boom is heard in all parts of Seoul, has\r\nopened and closed the gates for five centuries.\r\n\r\nThe grand triple gateway of the Royal Palace with its double roof, the\r\nold audience hall in the Mulberry Gardens, and the decorative roofs\r\nof the gate towers, are all seen in an hour. There remains the Marble\r\nPagoda, seven centuries old, so completely hidden away in the back-yard\r\nof a house in one of the foulest and narrowest alleys of the city,\r\nthat many people never see it at all. As I was intent on photographing\r\nsome of the reliefs upon it, I visited it five times, and each time\r\nwith fresh admiration; but so _wedged_ in is it, that one can only get\r\nany kind of view of it by climbing on the top of a wall. Every part is\r\ncarved, and the flat parts richly so, some of the tablets representing\r\nHindu divinities, while others seem to portray the various stages\r\nof the soul’s progress towards Nirvana. The designs are undoubtedly\r\nIndian, modified by Chinese artists, and this thing of beauty stands on\r\nthe site of a Buddhist monastery. It is a thirteen-storied pagoda, but\r\nthree stories were taken off in the Japanese invasion three centuries\r\nago, and placed on the ground uninjured. So they remained, but on\r\nmy last visit children had defaced the exquisite carving, and were\r\noffering portions for sale. Not far off is another relic of antiquity,\r\na decorated and inscribed tablet standing on the back of a granite\r\nturtle of prodigious size. Outside the west gate, on a plain near the\r\nPeking Pass, was a roofed and highly decorated arch of that form known\r\nas the _pailow_, and close by it a sort of palace hall, in which every\r\nnew sovereign of Korea waited for the coming of a special envoy from\r\nPeking, whom he joined at the _pailow_, accompanying him to the palace,\r\nwhere he received from him his investiture as sovereign.\r\n\r\nOn the slope of Nam-San the white wooden buildings, simple and\r\nunpretentious, of the Japanese Legation are situated, and below them a\r\nJapanese colony of nearly 5,000 persons, equipped with tea-houses, a\r\ntheatre, and the various arrangements essential to Japanese well-being.\r\nThere, in acute contrast to everything Korean, are to be seen streets\r\nof shops and houses where cleanliness, daintiness, and thrift reign\r\nsupreme, and unveiled women, and men in girdled dressing-gowns and\r\nclogs, move about as freely as in Japan. There also are to be seen\r\nminute soldiers or military police, and smart be-sworded officers,\r\nwho change guard at due intervals; nor are such precautions needless,\r\nfor the heredity of hate is strong in Korea, and on two occasions the\r\nmembers of this Legation have had to fight their way down to the sea.\r\nThe Legation was occupied at the time of my first visit by Mr. Otori,\r\nan elderly man with pendulous white whiskers, who went much into the\r\nlittle society which Seoul boasts, talked nothings, and gave no promise\r\nof the rough vigor which he showed a few months later. There also are\r\nthe Japanese bank and post office, both admirably managed.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese colony was in 1894 nearly as large, and differed in no\r\nrespect from such a colony anywhere else. The foreigners depend for\r\nmany things on the Chinese shops, and as the Koreans like the Chinese,\r\nthey do some trade with them also. The imposing element connected with\r\nChina was the _yamen_ of Yuan, the Minister Resident and representative\r\nof Korea’s Suzerain, by many people regarded as “the power behind the\r\nthrone,” who is reported to have gone more than once unbidden into\r\nthe King’s presence, and to have reproached him with his conduct of\r\naffairs. Great courtyards and lofty gates on which are painted the\r\nusual guardian gods, and a brick dragon screen, seclude the palace in\r\nwhich Yuan lived with his guards and large retinue; and the number\r\nof big, supercilious men, dressed in rich brocades and satins, who\r\nhung about both this Palace and the Consulate, impressed the Koreans\r\nwith the power and stateliness within. The Americans were very severe\r\non Yuan, but so far as I could learn his chief fault was that he let\r\nthings alone, and neglected to use his unquestionably great power in\r\nfavor of reform and common honesty--but he was a Chinese mandarin!\r\nHe possessed the power of life and death over Chinamen, and his\r\npunishments were often to our thinking barbarous, but the Chinese\r\nfeared him so much that they treated the Koreans fairly well, which is\r\nmore than can be said of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nOne of the “sights” of Seoul is the stream or drain or watercourse, a\r\nwide, walled, open conduit, along which a dark-colored festering stream\r\nslowly drags its malodorous length, among manure and refuse heaps which\r\ncover up most of what was once its shingly bed. There, tired of crowds\r\nmasculine solely, one may be refreshed by the sight of women of the\r\npoorest class, some ladling into pails the compound which passes for\r\nwater, and others washing clothes in the fetid pools which pass for\r\na stream. All wear one costume, which is peculiar to the capital, a\r\ngreen silk coat--a man’s coat with the “neck” put over the head and\r\nclutched below the eyes, and long wide sleeves falling from the ears.\r\nIt is as well that the Korean woman is concealed, for she is not a\r\nhouri. Washing is her manifest destiny so long as her lord wears white.\r\nShe washes in this foul river, in the pond of the Mulberry Palace, in\r\nevery wet ditch, and outside the walls in the few streams which exist.\r\nClothes are partially unpicked, boiled with ley three times, rolled\r\ninto hard bundles, and pounded with heavy sticks on stones. After being\r\ndried they are beaten with wooden sticks on cylinders, till they attain\r\na polish resembling dull satin. The women are slaves to the laundry,\r\nand the only sound which breaks the stillness of a Seoul night is the\r\nregular beat of their laundry sticks.\r\n\r\nFrom the beautiful hill Nam-San, from the Lone Tree Hill, and from\r\na hill above the old Mulberry Palace, Seoul is best seen, with its\r\nmountainous surroundings, here and there dark with pines, but mostly\r\nnaked, falling down upon the city in black arid corrugations. These\r\nmountains enclose a valley about 5 miles long by 3 broad, into which\r\n200,000 people are crammed and wedged. The city is a sea of low brown\r\nroofs, mostly of thatch, and all but monotonous, no trees and no\r\nopen spaces. Rising out of this brown sea there are the curved double\r\nroofs of the gates, and the gray granite walls of the royal palaces,\r\nand within them the sweeping roofs of various audience halls. Cutting\r\nthe city across by running from the east to the west gate is one broad\r\nstreet, another striking off from this runs to the south gate, and a\r\nthird 60 yards wide runs from the great central artery to the palace.\r\nThis is the only one which is kept clear of encumbrance at all times,\r\nthe others being occupied by double rows of booths, leaving only a\r\nnarrow space for traffic on either side. When I first looked down on\r\nSeoul early in March, one street along its whole length appeared to be\r\nstill encumbered with the drift of the previous winter’s snow. It was\r\nonly by the aid of a glass that I discovered that this is the great\r\npromenade, and that the snowdrift was just the garments of the Koreans,\r\nwhitened by ceaseless labor with the laundry sticks. In these three\r\nbroad streets the moving crowd of men in white robes and black dress\r\nhats seldom flags. They seem destitute of any object. Many of them are\r\nof the _yang-ban_ or noble class, to whom a rigid etiquette forbids any\r\nbut official or tutorial occupation, and many of whom exist by hanging\r\non to their more fortunate relatives. Young men of the middle class\r\nimitate their nonchalance and swinging gait.\r\n\r\nThere, too, are to be seen officials, superbly dressed, mounted on\r\nvery fat but handsome ponies, with profuse manes and tails, the riders\r\nsitting uneasily on the tops of saddles with showy caparisonings a\r\nfoot high, holding on to the saddle bow, two retainers leading the\r\nsteed, and two more holding the rider in his place; or officials in\r\npalanquins, with bearers at a run, amid large retinues. In the more\r\nplebeian streets nothing is to be seen but bulls carrying pine brush,\r\nstrings of ponies loaded with salt or country produce, water-carriers\r\nwith pails slung on a yoke, splashing their contents, and coolies\r\ncarrying burdens on wooden pack saddles.\r\n\r\nBut in the narrower alleys, of which there are hundreds, further\r\nnarrowed by the low deep eaves, and the vile ditches outside the\r\nhouses, only two men can pass each other, and the noble red bull with\r\nhis load of brushwood is rarely seen. Between these miles of mud walls,\r\ndeep eaves, green slimy ditches, and blackened smoke-holes, few besides\r\nthe male inhabitants and burden bearers are seen to move. They are the\r\nparadise of mangy dogs. Every house has a dog and a square hole through\r\nwhich he can just creep. He yelps furiously at a stranger, and runs\r\naway at the shaking of an umbrella. He was the sole scavenger of Seoul,\r\nand a very inefficient one. He is neither the friend nor companion of\r\nman. He is ignorant of Korean and every other spoken language. His bark\r\nat night announces peril from thieves. He is almost wild. When young he\r\nis killed and eaten in spring.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the women of the lower classes, who wash clothes and\r\ndraw water in the daytime. Many of these were domestic slaves, and\r\nall are of the lowest class. Korean women are very rigidly secluded,\r\nperhaps more absolutely so than the women of any other nation. In the\r\ncapital a very curious arrangement prevailed. About eight o’clock the\r\ngreat bell tolled a signal for men to retire into their houses, and\r\nfor women to come out and amuse themselves, and visit their friends.\r\nThe rule which clears the streets of men occasionally lapses, and then\r\nsome incident occurs which causes it to be rigorously reënforced. So\r\nit was at the time of my arrival, and the pitch dark streets presented\r\nthe singular spectacle of being tenanted solely by bodies of women with\r\nservants carrying lanterns. From its operation were exempted blind men,\r\nofficials, foreigners’ servants, and persons carrying prescriptions to\r\nthe druggists. These were often forged for the purpose of escape from\r\ndurance vile, and a few people got long staffs and personated blind\r\nmen. At twelve the bell again boomed, women retired, and men were at\r\nliberty to go abroad. A lady of high position told me that she had\r\nnever seen the streets of Seoul by daylight.\r\n\r\nThe nocturnal silence is very impressive. There is no human hum, throb,\r\nor gurgle. The darkness too is absolute, as there are few if any\r\nlighted windows to the streets. Upon a silence which may be felt, the\r\ndeep, penetrating boom of the great bell breaks with a sound which is\r\nalmost ominous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURTLE STONE]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] By a careful census taken in February, 1897, the intra-mural\r\npopulation of Seoul was 144,636 souls, and the extra-mural 75,189,\r\ntotal 219,815, males predominating to the extent of 11,079.\r\n\r\n[8] _Nous avons changé tout cela._ As will be seen from a chapter near\r\nthe end of the book, the Chief Commissioner of Customs, energetically\r\nseconded by the Governor of Seoul, has worked surprising improvements\r\nand sanitary changes which, if carried out perseveringly, will redeem\r\nthe capital from the charges which travellers have brought against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE KUR-DONG\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving England letters from Korea had warned me of the\r\ndifficulty of travelling in the interior, of getting a trustworthy\r\nservant, and above all, a trustworthy interpreter. Weeks passed\r\nby, and though Bishop Corfe and others exerted themselves on my\r\nbehalf, these essential requisites were not forthcoming, for to find\r\na reliable English-speaking Korean is well-nigh impossible. There\r\nare English-speaking Koreans who have learned English, some in the\r\nGovernment School, and others in the Methodist Episcopal School, and\r\nmany of these I interviewed. The English of all was infirm, and they\r\nwere all limp and timid, a set of poor creatures. Some of them seemed\r\nvery anxious to go with me, and were partially engaged, and the next\r\nday came, looking uneasy, and balancing themselves on the edge of their\r\nchairs, told me that their mothers said they must not go because there\r\nwere tigers, or that three months was too long a journey, or that they\r\ncould not go so far from their families, etc. At last a young man came\r\nwho really spoke passable English, but on entering the room with a\r\nfamiliar nod, he threw himself down in an easy-chair, swinging his leg\r\nover the arm! He asked many questions about the journey, said it was\r\nvery long to be away from Seoul, and that he should require one horse\r\nfor his baggage and another for himself. I remarked that, in order to\r\nget through the difficulties of the journey, it would be necessary\r\nto limit the baggage as much as possible. He said he could not go\r\nwith fewer than nine suits of clothes! I remarked that a foreigner\r\nwould only take two, and that I should reduce myself to two. “Yes,”\r\nhe replied, “but foreigners are so dirty in their habits.” This from\r\na Korean! So once more I had to settle down, and accept the kindly\r\nhospitality of my friends, trusting that something would “turn up.”\r\n\r\nBy this delay I came in for the _Kur-dong_,[9] one of the most\r\nremarkable spectacles I ever saw, and it had the added interest of\r\nbeing seen in its splendor for probably the last time, as circumstances\r\nwhich have since occurred, and the necessity for economy, must put an\r\nend to much of the scenic display. The occasion was a visit of the King\r\nin state to sacrifice in one of the ancestral temples of his dynasty,\r\nmembers of which have occupied the Korean throne for five centuries.\r\nLiving secluded in his palace, guarded by 1,000 men, his subjects\r\nforbidden to pronounce his name, which indeed is seldom known, in\r\ntotal ignorance of any other aspect of his kingdom and capital than\r\nthat furnished by the two streets through which he passes to offer\r\nsacrifice, the days on which he performs this pious act offer to his\r\nsubjects their sole opportunities of gazing on his august countenance.\r\nAs the Queen’s procession passed by on the day of the Duke of York’s\r\nmarriage, I heard a workingman say, “It’s we as pays, and we likes to\r\nget the valey for our money.” The Korean pays in another and heavier\r\nsense, and as in tens of thousands he crowds in reverential silence the\r\nroute of the _Kur-dong_, he is probably glad that the one brilliant\r\nspectacle of the year should be as splendid as possible.\r\n\r\nThe monotony of Seoul is something remarkable. Brown mountains “picked\r\nout” in black, brown mud walls, brown roofs, brown roadways, whether\r\nmud or dust, while humanity is in black and white. Always the same\r\nbundled-up women clutching their green coats under their eyes, always\r\nthe same surge of _yang-bans_ and their familiars swinging along South\r\nStreet, the same strings of squealing ponies “spoiling for a fight,”\r\nthe same processions of majestic red bulls under towering loads of\r\nbrushwood, the same coolies in dirty white, forever carrying burdens,\r\nthe same joyless dirty children getting through life on the gutters’\r\nedge, and the same brownish dogs, feebly wrangling over offal. On such\r\nmonotony and colorlessness, the _Kur-dong_ bursts like the sun. Alas\r\nfor this mean but fascinating capital, that the most recent steps\r\ntowards civilization should involve the abolition of its one spectacle!\r\n\r\nBy six in the morning of the looked-for day we were on our way from\r\nthe English Legation to a position near the Great Bell, all the male\r\npopulation of the alleys taking the same direction, along with children\r\nin colors, and some of the poorer class of women with gay handkerchiefs\r\nfolded Roman fashion on their hair. For the first time I saw the grand\r\nproportions of the road called by foreigners South Street. The double\r\nrows of booths had been removed the night before, and along the side\r\nof the street, at intervals of 20 yards, torches 10 feet high were let\r\ninto the ground to light the King on his return from sacrificing. It is\r\nonly by its imposing width that this great street lends itself to such\r\na display, for the houses are low and mean, and on one side at least\r\nare only superior hovels. In place of the booths the subjects were\r\nmassed twelve deep, the regularity of the front row being preserved\r\nby a number of _yamen_ runners, who brought down their wooden paddles\r\nwith an unmerciful whack on any one breaking the line. The singular\r\nmonotony of baggy white coats and black crinoline hats was relieved by\r\nboy bridegrooms in yellow hats and rose-pink coats, by the green silk\r\ncoats of women, and the green, pink, heliotrope and Turkey red dresses\r\nof children. The crowd had a quietly pleased but very limp look. There\r\nwas no jollity or excitement, no flags or popular demonstrations, and\r\nscarcely a hum from a concourse which must have numbered at least\r\n150,000, half the city, together with numbers from the country who had\r\nwalked three and four days to see the spectacle. Squalid and mean is\r\nordinary Korean life, and the King is a myth for most of the year. No\r\nwonder that the people turn out to see as splendid a spectacle as the\r\nworld has to show, its splendor centring round their usually secluded\r\nsovereign. It is to the glory of a dynasty which has occupied the\r\nKorean throne for five centuries as well as in honor of the present\r\noccupant.\r\n\r\nThe hour of leaving the palace had been announced as 6 A.M., but\r\nthough it was 7.30 before the boom of a heavy gun announced that the\r\nprocession was in motion, the interest never flagged the whole time.\r\nHundreds of coolies sprinkled red earth for the width of a foot along\r\nthe middle of the streets, for hypothetically the King must not pass\r\nover soil which has been trodden by the feet of his subjects. Squadrons\r\nof cavalry, with coolies leading their shabby ponies, took up positions\r\nalong the route, and in a great mass in front of us. The troopers sat\r\non the ground smoking, till a very _distrait_ bugle-call sent them to\r\ntheir saddles. The ponies bit, kicked, and squealed, and the grotesque\r\nand often ineffectual attempts of the men to mount them provoked the\r\nlaughter of the crowd, as one trooper after another, with one foot in\r\nthe stirrup and the other on the ground, hopped round at the pleasure\r\nof his steed. After all, with the help of their coolies, were mounted,\r\nwhacks secretly administered by men in the crowd nearly unhorsed many\r\nof them, but they clung with both hands to their saddle bows and\r\neventually formed into a ragged line.\r\n\r\nAmong the very curious sights were poles carried at measured distances\r\nsupporting rectangular frames resembling small umbrella stands, filled\r\nwith feathered arrows, and messengers dashing along as if they had been\r\nshot and were escaping from another shaft, for from the backs of their\r\ncollars protruded arrows which had apparently entered obliquely. Either\r\non the back or breast or both of the superb dresses of officials were\r\nsatin squares embroidered in unique designs, representing birds and\r\nbeasts, storks indicating civil, and tigers military, rank, while the\r\nnumber of birds or animals on the lozenge denoted the wearer’s exact\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThough there were long stretches of silence, scarcely broken by the hum\r\nof a multitude, there were noisy interludes, novel in their nature,\r\nproduced by men, sometimes fifteen in a row, who carried poles with a\r\nnumber of steel rings loosely strung upon them, which they tossed into\r\nthe air and allowed to fall against each other with a metallic clink,\r\nloud and strident. Likewise the trains of servants in attendance on\r\nmandarins emitted peculiar cries, sounding _G_ in unison, then raising\r\ntheir note and singing _C_ three times, afterwards, with a falling\r\ncadence, singing _G_ again.\r\n\r\nBut of the noises which passed for music, the most curious as to method\r\nwas that made by the drummers, who marched irregularly in open order\r\nin lines extending across the broad roadway. These carried bowl-shaped\r\nkettledrums slung horizontally, and bass drum sticks mainly hidden\r\nby their voluminous sleeves. In time with the marching, the right\r\nhand stick rose above the drummer’s head, then the left stick in like\r\nmanner, but both fell again nearly to the drum without emitting a\r\nsound! The next act of the performance consisted in lifting both sticks\r\nabove the head together and again bringing them down silently. Finally\r\nthe sticks were crossed, and during two marching steps rose feebly, and\r\nas feebly fell on the ends of the drum, producing a muffled sound, and\r\nthis programme was repeated during the duration of the march.\r\n\r\nSoldiers in rusty black belted frocks, wide trousers, bandaged into\r\npadded socks, and straw shoes, stacked arms in a side street. Closed\r\nblack and colored chairs went past at a trot. Palace attendants in\r\nhundreds in brown glazed cotton sleeved cloaks, blue under robes tied\r\nbelow the knee with bunches of red ribbon, and stiff black hats, with\r\nheavy fan-shaped plumes of peacock’s feathers, rode ragged ponies on\r\ngay saddles of great height, without bridles, the animals being led by\r\ncoolies. High officials passed in numbers in chairs or on pony back,\r\neach with from twenty to thirty gay attendants running beside him,\r\nand a row of bannermen extending across the broad street behind him,\r\neach man with a silk banner bearing the cognomen of his lord. These\r\nofficials were superbly dressed, and made a splendid show. They wore\r\nblack, high-crowned hats, with long crimson tassels behind, and heavy,\r\nblack ostrich plumes falling over the brim in front, mazarine blue silk\r\nrobes, split up to the waist behind, with orange silk under robes and\r\nmost voluminous crimson trousers, loosely tied above the ankles with\r\nknots of sky blue ribbon, while streamers of ribbon fell from throats\r\nand girdles, and the hats were secured by throat lashes of large amber\r\nbeads. Each carried over his shoulder a yellow silk banneret with his\r\nstyle in Chinese characters in crimson upon it, and in the same hand\r\nhis baton of office, with a profusion of streamers of rich ribbons\r\ndepending from it. The sleeves were orange in the upper part and\r\ncrimson in the lower, and very full.\r\n\r\nThe overfed and self-willed ponies, chiefly roan and gray, are very\r\nhandsome, and showily caparisoned, the heads covered with blue, red,\r\nand yellow balls, and surmounted with great crimson silk pompous,\r\nthe bridles a couple of crimson silk scarves, the saddles a sort\r\nof leather-covered padded pack saddle 12 inches above the animal’s\r\nback, with wide, deep flaps of bright green silver-bossed leather\r\nhanging down on either side, the cruppers folded white silk, and the\r\nbreastplate shields of gold embroidery. The gorgeous rider, lifted by\r\nhis servants upon this elevation, stands erect in his stirrups with\r\nhis feet not halfway down his pony’s sides, his left hand clutching\r\nrather than holding an arch placed for this purpose at the bow of the\r\nsaddle. These officials made no attempt to hold their own bridles,\r\ntheir ponies were led by servants, retainers supported them by the feet\r\non either side, and as their mounts showed their resentment of the pace\r\nand circumstances by twistings and strugglings with their grooms, the\r\nfaces of the riders expressed “a fearful joy,” if “joy” it was.\r\n\r\nWaves of color and Korean grandeur rolled by, official processions,\r\npalace attendants, bannermen, with large silk banners trailing on\r\nthe stiff breeze, each flagstaff crested with a tuft of pheasant’s\r\nfeathers, the King’s chief cook, with an enormous retinue, more palace\r\nservants, smoking long pipes, drummers, fifers, couriers at a gallop,\r\nwith arrows stuck into the necks of their coats, holding on to their\r\nsaddles and rope bridles, mixed up with dishevelled ponies with ragged\r\npack saddles, carrying cushions, lacquer boxes, eatables, cooking\r\nutensils, and smoking apparatus, led caparisoned ponies, bowmen,\r\nsoldiers straggling loosely, armed with matchlock guns, till several\r\nthousand persons had passed. Yet this was not the procession, though it\r\nmight well have served for one.\r\n\r\nAt 7.30, while this “march past” was still going on, a gun was fired,\r\nand the great bell, which was very close to us, boomed heavily, and a\r\nfanfaronade of trumpets and the shrill scream of fifes announced that\r\nLi Hsi had at last left the palace. The cavalry opposite us prepared\r\nto receive His Majesty by _turning tail_, a manœuvre not accomplished\r\nwithout much squealing and fighting. There was a general stir among\r\nthe spectators, men with arrows in their coats galloped frantically,\r\nthere was an onslaught on the “Derby dog,” and an attack by men, armed\r\nwith the long wooden paddles which are used for beating criminals, on\r\ninoffensive portions of the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there were 5,000 servants and officials connected with\r\nthe palace, and there were nominally 6,000 soldiers in Seoul, and\r\nthe greater part of these took part in the many splendid processions\r\nwhich went to form the Royal procession. It would be impossible for\r\na stranger to give in detail the component parts of such a show,\r\nthe like of which has no existence elsewhere on earth, passing for\r\nmore than an hour in the bright sunshine, in detachments, in compact\r\nmasses, at a stately walk or a rapid run, in the full splendor of a\r\nbarbaric mediævalism, or to say what dignitaries flashed by in the\r\nkaleidoscopic blaze of color.\r\n\r\nThe procession of the King was led by the “general of the vanguard,”\r\nsuperbly dressed, supported by retainers on his led pony, and followed\r\nby crowds of dignitaries, each with his train, soldiers, men carrying\r\naloft frames of arrows, reaching nearly across the road, and huge flags\r\nof silk brocade surmounted by plumes of pheasant’s feathers, servants\r\nin rows of a hundred in the most delicate shades of blue, green, or\r\nmauve silk gauze over white, halberdiers, grandees, each with a retinue\r\nof bannermen, rows of royal bannermen carrying yellow and blue silk\r\nflags emblazoned, cavalry men in imitation gold helmets and mediæval\r\narmor, and tiger-hunters wearing coarse black felt hats with conical\r\ncrowns and dark blue coats, trailing long guns. With scarcely a pause\r\nfollowed the President of the Foreign Office, high above the crowd on a\r\nmonocycle, a black wheel supporting on two uprights a black platform,\r\ncarrying a black chair decorated with a leopard skin, the occupant of\r\nwhich was carried by eight men at a height of 8 feet from the ground.\r\nMore soldiers, bannermen, and drummers, and then came the chief of the\r\neunuchs, grandly dressed, with an immense retinue, and a large number\r\nof his subordinates, most of whom up to that time, by their position\r\nin the palace and their capacity for intrigue, had exercised a very\r\nbaneful influence on Korean affairs.\r\n\r\nThe procession became more quaint and motley still. Palace attendants\r\nappeared in the brilliant garments of the Korean middle ages; cavalry\r\nin antique armor were jumbled up with cavalry in loose cotton frocks\r\nand baggy trousers, supposed to be dressed and armed in European\r\nfashion, but I failed to detect the flattery of imitation. There were\r\ncavalry in black Tyrolese hats with pink ribbon round them, black\r\ncotton sacks loosely girdled by leather belts with brass clasps never\r\ncleaned, white wadded stockings, and hempen shoes. Some had leather\r\nsaddles, others rode on pack saddles, with the great pad which should\r\ngo underneath on the top; some held on to their saddles, others to\r\ntheir rope bridles, the ponies of some were led by coolies in dirty\r\nwhite clothes; the officers were all held on their saddles, many tucked\r\ntheir old-fashioned swords under their arms, lest carrying them in\r\nregulation fashion should make their animals kick; the feet of some\r\nnearly touched the ground, and those of others hung only halfway down\r\ntheir ponies’ sides; ponies squealed, neighed, reared, and jibbed, but\r\nsomehow or other these singular horsemen managed to form ragged lines.\r\n\r\nThen came foot soldiers with rusty muskets and innumerable standards,\r\ngenerals, court dignitaries, statesmen, some with crimson hats with\r\nheavy black plumes, others with high peaked crinoline hats with\r\nprojecting wings, others with lofty mitres covered with tinsel gleaming\r\nlike gold, each with a splendid train. Mediæval costumes blazing\r\nwith color flashed past, there were more soldiers, and this time\r\nthey carried Snider rifles, two Gatling guns were dragged by _yamen_\r\nrunners, who frantically spanked all and sundry with their paddles,\r\ndrummers beat their drums unmercifully, fifes shrieked, there were more\r\ndignitaries with fairylike retinues in blue and green silk gauze, the\r\nKing’s personal attendants in crowds followed in yellow, with bamboo\r\nhats trimmed with rosettes, standard-bearers came next, bearing the\r\nRoyal standard, a winged tiger rampant on a yellow ground, more flags\r\nand troops, and then the curious insignia of Korean Royalty, including\r\na monstrous red silk umbrella, and a singular frame of stones. More\r\ngrandees, more soldiers, more musical instruments, and then come the\r\nRoyal chairs, the first, which was canopied with red silk, being\r\nempty, the theory being that this was the more likely to receive an\r\nassassin’s blow. A huge trident was carried in front of it. After this,\r\nborne high aloft by forty bearers clothed in red, in a superb chair\r\nof red lacquer, richly tasselled and canopied, and with wings to keep\r\noff the sun, came the King, whose pale, languid face never changed\r\nits expression as he passed with all the dignity and splendor of his\r\nkingdom through the silent crowd.\r\n\r\nMore grandees, servants, soldiers, standard-bearers, arrow-men,\r\nofficials, cavalry, and led horses formed the procession of the Crown\r\nPrince, who was also carried in a red palanquin, and looked paler\r\nand more impassive than his father. The supply of officials seemed\r\ninexhaustible, for behind him came a quarter of a mile of grandees in\r\nsplendid costumes, with hats decorated with red velvet and peacock’s\r\nfeathers, and throat lashes of great amber beads, with all their\r\nsplendid trains, footmen in armor bossed with large nails, drummers,\r\nmen carrying arrow frames and insignia on poles, then the “general of\r\nthe rear guard” in a gleaming helmet and a splendid blue, crimson,\r\nand gold uniform, propped up by retainers on his handsome pony, more\r\nsoldiers armed with old matchlock guns, lastly men bearing arrow frames\r\nand standards, and with them the barbaric and bizarre splendor of the\r\n_Kur-dong_ was over, and the white crowd once more overflowed the mean\r\nstreet. Quite late in the evening the Royal pageant returned by the\r\nlight of stationary torches, with lanterns of blue and crimson silk\r\nundulating from the heads of pikes and bayonets.\r\n\r\nThis truly splendid display was estimated to cost $25,000--a heavy\r\nburden on the small resources of the kingdom. It is only thus\r\nsurrounded that the King ever appears in public, and the splendor\r\naccentuates the squalor of the daily life of the masses of the\r\npeople in the foul alleys which make up most of the city. It must be\r\nremembered that the people taking part in the pageant are not men\r\nhired and dressed up by a _costumier_, but that they are actual Court\r\nofficials and noblemen in the dress of to-day, and that the weapons\r\ncarried by the soldiers are those with which they are supposed to repel\r\nattack or put down rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] If an apology be necessary for the following minute description of\r\nthis unique ceremonial, I offer it on the ground that it was probably\r\nthe last of its kind, and that full details of it have not been given\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSEOUL, THE KOREAN MECCA\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther difficulties and delays, while they pushed my journey into the\r\ninterior into the hot weather, gave me the advantage of learning a\r\nlittle about the people and the country before starting. In one sense\r\nSeoul is Korea. Take a mean alley in it with its mud-walled hovels,\r\ndeep-eaved brown roofs, and malodorous ditches with their foulness and\r\ngreen slime, and it may serve as an example of the street of every\r\nvillage and provincial town. In country places there are few industrial\r\nspecialties. A Seoul shop of “assorted notions” represents the shop\r\nof every country town. The white clothing and the crinoline dress hat\r\nare the same everywhere as in Seoul. Whatever of national life there\r\nis exists only in the capital. Strong as is the drift towards London\r\nin our own agricultural districts, it is stronger in Korea towards\r\nSeoul. Seoul is not only the seat of government, but it is the centre\r\nof official life, of all official employment, and of the literary\r\nexaminations which were the only avenues to employment. It is always\r\nhoped that something may be “picked up” in Seoul. Hence there is a\r\nconstant permanent or temporary gravitation towards it, and the larger\r\nproportion of the youths who swing and lounge on sunny afternoons\r\nalong the broad streets, aping the gait of _yang-bans_, are aspirants\r\nfor official position. Gusts of popular feeling which pass for public\r\nopinion in a land where no such thing exists are known only in Seoul.\r\nIt is in the capital that the Korean feels the first stress of his\r\nunsought and altogether undesired contact with Western civilization,\r\nand resembles nothing so much as a man awaking from a profound sleep,\r\nrubbing his eyes half-dazed and looking dreamily about him, not quite\r\nsure where he is.\r\n\r\nSeoul is also the commercial centre of a country whose ideas of\r\ncommerce are limited to huckstering transactions. All business is\r\ndone there. All country shops are supplied with goods from Seoul. All\r\nproduce not shipped from the treaty ports converges on Seoul. It is the\r\ncentre of the great trading guilds, which exercise a practical monopoly\r\nin certain sorts of goods, as well as of the guild of porters by whom\r\nthe traffic of the country is carried on. The heart of every Korean is\r\nin Seoul. Officials have town houses in the capital, and trust their\r\nbusiness to subordinates for much of the year. Landed proprietors\r\ndraw their rents and “squeeze” the people on their estates, but are\r\nabsentees living in the capital. Every man who can pay for food and\r\nlodging on the road trudges to the capital once or twice a year, and\r\npeople who live in it, of whatever degree, can hardly be bribed to\r\nleave it even for a few weeks. To the Korean it is the place in which\r\nalone life is worth living.\r\n\r\nYet it has no objects of art, very few antiquities, no public gardens,\r\nno displays except the rare one of the _Kur-dong_, and no theatres.\r\nIt lacks every charm possessed by other cities. Antique, it has no\r\nruins, no libraries, no literature, and lastly an indifference to\r\nreligion without a parallel has left it without temples, while certain\r\nsuperstitions which still retain their hold have left it without a tomb!\r\n\r\nLeaving out the temple of Confucius and the homage officially rendered\r\nto his tablet in Korea as in China, there are no official temples\r\nin Seoul, nor might a priest enter its gates under pain of death,\r\nconsequently the emphasis which noble religious buildings give even\r\nto the meanest city in China or Japan is lacking. There is a small\r\ntemple to the God of War outside the south gate, with some very curious\r\nfrescoes, but I seldom saw any worshippers there. The absence of\r\ntemples is a feature of the other Korean cities. Buddhism, which for\r\n1,000 years before the founding of the present dynasty was the popular\r\ncult, has been “disestablished” and practically proscribed since the\r\nsixteenth century, and Koreans account for the severe enactments\r\nagainst priests by saying that in the Japanese invasion three centuries\r\nago Japanese disguised themselves as Buddhist priests and gained\r\nadmission to cities, putting their garrisons to the sword. Be that true\r\nor false, Buddhism in Korea to be found must be sought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUTTER SHOP, SEOUL.]\r\n\r\nAs there are no temples, so there are no other signs of religion, and\r\nthe hasty observer would be warranted in putting down the Koreans as\r\na people without a religion. Ancestral worship, and a propitiation of\r\ndæmons or spirits, the result of a timid and superstitious dread of the\r\nforces of Nature, are to the Korean in place of a religion. Both, I am\r\ninclined to believe, are the result of fear, the worship of ancestors\r\nbeing dictated far less by filial piety than by the dread that\r\nancestral spirits may do harm to their descendants. This cult prevails\r\nfrom the King to the coolie. It inspires the costly splendors of the\r\n_Kur-dong_, as well as the spread of ancestral food in the humblest\r\nhovel on New Year’s Eve.\r\n\r\nThe graves within an area of ten miles from the city wall are among the\r\nremarkable features of this singular capital. The dead have a monopoly\r\nof the fine hill slopes and southern aspects. A man who when alive is\r\ncontent with a mud hovel in a dingy alley, when dead must repose on a\r\nbreezy hill slope with dignified and carefully tended surroundings. The\r\nlittle fine timber which exists in the denuded neighborhood of Seoul is\r\nowed to the Royal and wealthy dead. The amount of good land occupied by\r\nthe dead is incredible. The grave of a member of the Royal family on\r\na hill creates a solitude for a considerable distance around. In the\r\ncase of rich and great men as well as of princes, the grave is a lofty\r\ngrassy mound, often encircled by a massive stone railing, with the hill\r\nterraced in front and excavated in a horseshoe shape behind. A stone\r\naltar and stone lanterns are placed in front, and the foot of the\r\nhill, as at the “Princess’s Tomb,” is often occupied by a temple-like\r\nbuilding containing tablets with the name and rank of the dead. The\r\nRoyal tombs are approached by stately avenues of gigantic stone\r\nfigures, possibly a harmless survival of the practice of offering human\r\nand other sacrifices at a burial. These figures represent a priest,\r\na warrior in armor, a servant, a pony, and a sheep (?). The poorer\r\ndead occupy hillsides in numbers, resting under grass mounds on small\r\nplatforms of grass always neatly kept. The lucky place for interment is\r\nin all cases chosen by the geomancer. Behind rich men’s graves pines\r\nare usually planted in a crescent. The dead population of the hillsides\r\nround Seoul is simply enormous.\r\n\r\nFunerals usually go out near dusk with a great display of colored\r\nlanterns, but I was fortunate enough to see an artisan’s corpse carried\r\nout by daylight. First came four drums and a sort of fife perpetrating\r\na lively tune as an accompaniment to a lively song. These were followed\r\nby a hearse, if it may be called so, a domed and gaudily painted\r\nconstruction with a garland of artificial flowers in the centre of the\r\ndome, a white Korean coat thrown across the roof, and four flagstaffs\r\nwith gay flags at the four corners, bamboo poles, flower-wreathed,\r\nforming a platform on which the hearse was borne by eight men in peaked\r\nyellow hats garlanded with blue and pink flowers. Bouquets of the\r\nsame were disposed carelessly on the front and sides of the hearse,\r\nthe latter being covered with shield-shaped flags of gaudily colored\r\nmuslin. The chief mourner followed, completely clothed in sackcloth,\r\nwearing an umbrella-shaped hat over 4 feet in diameter, and holding\r\na sackcloth screen before his face by two bamboo handles. Men in\r\nflower-wreathed hats surrounded him, some of them walking backwards\r\nand singing. He looked fittingly grave, but it is a common custom for\r\nthose who attend the chief mourner to try to make him laugh by comic\r\nantics and jocular remarks. There are “burial clubs” in Seoul to which\r\n100,000 _cash_ are contributed (then worth about thirty-three dollars,\r\nsilver). The first man to die receives 30,000 _cash_, the second\r\n33,000, and the third 37,000. This man had belonged to one of these,\r\nwhich accounts for an artisan having such a handsome funeral.\r\n\r\nMourners dress in straw-colored hempen cloth, and all wear the enormous\r\nhats mentioned before, which so nearly conceal the face that the\r\ncarrying of the grass-cloth screen is almost a work of supererogation.\r\nA mourner may not enter the palace grounds, and as mourning for a\r\nfather lasts for three years, a courtier thus bereaved is for that time\r\nwithdrawn from Court.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious customs mainly of Chinese origin connected with death\r\nare the dressing the dying person in his best clothes when death is\r\nvery close at hand. The very poor are buried coffinless in a wrapping\r\nof straw, and are carried by two men on a bier, the nature of the\r\nburden being concealed by hoops covered with paper.\r\n\r\nWhen Buddhist priests and temples were prohibited in the walled towns\r\nthree centuries ago, anything like a national faith disappeared\r\nfrom Korea, and it is only through ancestral worship and a form\r\nof “Shamanism” practiced by the lower and middle classes that\r\nany recognition of the unseen survives, and that is in its most\r\nsuperstitious and rudimentary form. Protestant Christian missionaries,\r\npreceded in 1784 by those of the Roman Catholic Church, entered Korea\r\nin 1884, almost as soon as the country was opened by treaty, and\r\nagents of the American Methodist Episcopal and Northern Presbyterian\r\nChurches took up their abode in Seoul. They have been followed by\r\nrepresentatives of several of the divisions among Protestants--Southern\r\nPresbyterians, Canadian Presbyterians, Australian Presbyterians, and\r\nBaptists--and in 1890 the first English mission to Korea was founded\r\nunder Bishop Corfe. A Roman Catholic Church and a very large Roman\r\nCatholic Cathedral with a spire occupy two of the most prominent\r\nsites in Seoul. One of the best sites is covered with the buildings\r\nbelonging to the Methodist Episcopal Mission, schools for girls and\r\nboys, a printing press, a Union Church, and hospitals for men and\r\nwomen, with which dispensaries are connected. The girls’ school\r\nconnected with this mission is one of the most admirable in its\r\norganization and results that I have seen. The Presbyterians occupy\r\na lowlier position, but have the same class of agencies at work, and\r\nlately the King handed over to them a large hospital in the city, known\r\nas the “Government Hospital.”\r\n\r\nBishop Corfe’s mission occupies two modest sites in modest fashion, all\r\nits buildings being strictly Korean. On one side of Seoul, at Nak-tong,\r\nit has the Community House, where the bishop, clergy, doctor, and\r\nprinter live and have their private chapel, also the Mission press,\r\nand a very efficient hospital for men, admirably nursed by the Sisters\r\nof St. Peter’s Kilburn. On the slope of the British Legation Hill\r\nare the English Church of the Advent, a beautiful Korean building,\r\nthe Community House of the Sisters of St. Peter, and the Women’s\r\nHospital buildings, embracing a dispensary, a new hospital (the Dora\r\nBird Memorial) of eighteen beds, with a room for a private patient,\r\nbesides an old hospital, to be used only for infectious diseases. These\r\nare under the charge of a lady physician, and are also nursed by the\r\nSisters of St. Peter, who in both hospitals do admirable work in a\r\nbright and loving spirit which is beyond all praise.\r\n\r\nThere are about 75 Protestant and 34 Roman missionaries in Korea,\r\nmostly in Seoul. The language has the reputation of being very\r\ndifficult, and few of this large number have acquired facility in the\r\nuse of it. The idea of a nation destitute of a religion, and gladly\r\naccepting one brought by the foreigner, must be dropped. The religion\r\nthe Korean would accept is one which would show him how to get money\r\nwithout working for it. The indifference is extreme, the religious\r\nfaculty is absent, there are no religious ideas to appeal to, and the\r\nmoral teachings of Confucius have little influence with any class.\r\nThe Korean has got on so well without a religion, in his own opinion,\r\nthat he does not want to be troubled with one, specially a religion\r\nof restraint and sacrifice which has no worldly good to offer. After\r\nnearly twelve years of work, the number of baptized native Protestant\r\nChristians in 1897 was 777.[10] The Roman Catholics claim 28,802, and\r\nthat the average rate of increase is 1,000 a year.[11] Their priests\r\nlive mostly in the wretched hovels of the people, amidst their foul\r\nsurroundings, and share their unpalatable food and sordid lives.\r\nDoubtless, mission work in Korea will not differ greatly from such work\r\nelsewhere among the older civilizations. Barriers of indifference,\r\nsuperstition, and inertness exist, and whatever progress is made will\r\nprobably be chiefly through medical missions, showing Christianity in\r\naction, and native agency, and through such schools as I have already\r\nalluded to, which leave every feature of Korean custom, dress, and\r\nmanner of living untouched, while Christian instruction and training\r\nare the first objects, and where the gentle, loving, ennobling\r\ninfluence of the teacher is felt during every hour of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] In 1897 the influence of Christianity was much stronger than in\r\n1895, and the prospects of its spread much more encouraging.\r\n\r\n[11] For statistics of Missions in February, 1897, see Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SAILING OF THE SAMPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a point when the difficulties in the way of my projected journey had\r\ncome to be regarded as insurmountable, owing to the impossibility of\r\ngetting an interpreter, and I had begun to say “_if_ I go” instead of\r\n“_when_ I go,” Mr. Miller, a young missionary, offered his services, on\r\ncondition that he might take his servant to supplement his imperfect\r\nknowledge of Korean. Bishop Corfe provided me with a Chinese servant,\r\nWong, a fine, big, cheery fellow, with inexhaustible good-nature and\r\ncontentment, never a cloud of annoyance on his face, always making the\r\nbest of everything, ready to help every one, true, honest, plucky,\r\npassionately fond of flowers, faithful, manly, always well and hungry,\r\nand with a passable knowledge of English! He was a Chefoo _sampan_-man\r\nwhen Bishop Corfe picked him up, and nothing could make him into a\r\nregular servant, but he suited me admirably, and I was grieved indeed\r\nwhen I had to part with him.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty about money which then beset every traveller in the\r\ninterior cost a good deal of anxious planning. The Japanese _yen_ and\r\nits subdivisions were only current in Seoul and the treaty ports,\r\nthere were no bankers or money-changers anywhere, and the only coin\r\naccepted was the _cash_, of which at that time 3,200 nominally went\r\nto the dollar. This coin is strung in hundreds on straw strings, and\r\nthe counting of it, and the carrying of it, and the being without it\r\nare all a nuisance. It takes six men or one pony to carry 100 _yen_ in\r\n_cash_, £10! Travellers, through their Consuls, can obtain from the\r\nForeign Office a letter to officials throughout the country called\r\na _kwan-ja_, entitling the bearer to their good offices, and\r\nespecially to food, transport, and money. But as it usually happens\r\nthat a magistrate advancing money to a foreigner is not repaid by the\r\nGovernment, however accurately the sum has been paid in Seoul, the\r\narrangement is a very odious one to officials, and I promised our\r\nConsul that I would not make use of it for money. Consequently, the\r\nboat which I engaged for the earlier part of the journey was ballasted\r\nwith _cash_, and I took a bag of silver _yen_, and trusted to my usual\r\ngood fortune, which in this case did not altogether fail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH MAP OF CENTRAL KOREA\r\n\r\n  The Edinburgh Geographical Institute      John Bartholomew & Co.\r\n\r\nFleming H. Revell Company.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUTHOR’S SAMPAN, HAN RIVER.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this uncouth and heavy burden, I took a saddle, a\r\ntrestle-bed with bedding and mosquito net, muslin curtains, a folding\r\nchair, two changes of clothing, Korean string shoes, and a “regulation”\r\nwaterproof cloak. Besides, I took green tea, curry powder, and 20 lbs.\r\nof flour. I discarded all superfluities, such as flasks, collapsing\r\ncups, hand mirrors, teapots, sandwich tins, lamps, and tinned soups,\r\nmeats, bouillon, and fruits. The kitchen equipment consisted of a\r\nJapanese brazier for charcoal, a shallow Japanese pan and frying-pan,\r\nand a small kettle, with charcoal tongs, the whole costing under two\r\ndollars! The “table equipment” was limited: a small mug, two plates\r\nand a soup plate, all in enamelled iron, and a knife, fork, and\r\nspoon, which folded up, a knife, fork, and spoon of common make being\r\nreserved for the “kitchen.” Tables, trays, tablecloths, and sheets\r\nwere from thenceforth unknown luxuries. I mention my outfit, because\r\nI know it to be a sufficient one, and that every pound of superfluous\r\nweight adds to the difficulty of getting transport in Korea and in\r\nmany other countries. Besides, I was encumbered for the first time\r\nwith a tripod camera weighing 16 lbs., and a hand camera weighing 4\r\nlbs., with the apparatus belonging to them, and had to reduce other\r\nthings accordingly. On the whole, it is best to trust to the food of\r\nthe country. Korea produces eggs, and in some regions chickens. The\r\nchestnuts are good, and though the flour, which can be got in a few\r\nplaces, is gritty, and the rice is a bad color, both are eatable, and\r\nthe foreigner, always an object of suspicion, is less so when he buys\r\nand eats native viands, and does not carry about with him a number of\r\n(to Koreans) outlandish-looking utensils and commodities.\r\n\r\nRegarding much of the region which I purposed to visit no information\r\ncould be obtained, either from Europeans or Korean officials, and the\r\nbest map, a reduction of a Japanese map by Sir E. Satow, turned out\r\nto be astray. Mr. Warner, of Bishop Corfe’s Mission, had ascended the\r\nnorth branch of the Han, but it is still doubtful whether any European\r\nhas been up the south and much larger branch which I explored on this\r\njourney. It was certain only that the country was mountainous, and that\r\nthe rapids were numerous and severe. It had also been said earnestly,\r\nand with an appearance of knowledge, by several people that it would be\r\nimpossible for a lady to travel in the interior; and certainly much of\r\nwhat I heard, supposing it to be fact, was sufficiently deterring, but\r\nfrom many similar statements in other countries I knew that a deduction\r\nof at least fifty per cent. must be made!\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of April, 1894, when the environs of Seoul were seen\r\nthrough a mist of green, and plum and peach blossom was in the\r\nascendant, and the heliotrope azalea was just beginning to tint the\r\nhillsides, and the air was warm and muggy, I left the kind friends who\r\nhad done much to make my visit to Seoul interesting and agreeable, and\r\nwent on ponyback through the south gate, passing the temple of the God\r\nof War, and over a pine-clothed ridge of Nam-San to Han Kang, four\r\nmiles from Seoul, a little shipping village, where my boat lay, to\r\navoid a rapid which lies between it and Ma-pu. Up to Ma-pu, 56 miles\r\nfrom Chemulpo, there is a very considerable tidal rise and fall which\r\nceases at the rapid.\r\n\r\nA limp, silent crowd of men and boys denoted the whereabouts of the\r\nboat, from which Mr. Miller’s servant, Che-on-i, emerging with the\r\nbroad smile with which Orientals announce bad news, informed us that\r\nthe boat was too small! There were very few to be got, and I had not\r\nseen this one, Mr. Wyers, the Legation constable, having engaged her\r\nfor me; and I went “on board” at once, with much curiosity, as she was\r\nto be my home for an indefinite number of weeks. And small she truly\r\nwas, only 28 feet over all, by 4 feet 10 inches at her widest part,\r\nand with her whole cargo, animate and inanimate, on board she only\r\ndrew 3 inches of water. The roof which was put on at my request was a\r\nmarvel. A slight framework of a ridge pole and some sticks precariously\r\ntied together supported some mats of pheasant grass, with the long\r\nblades hanging down outside and over the gunwale, which was only 12\r\ninches high. These mats were tied together over the ridge pole, and let\r\nin a streak of daylight all the way along. At its highest part this\r\nroof was only 4 feet 6 inches. It was just possible to sit under it\r\nwithout stooping. By putting forked sticks under what by courtesy were\r\ncalled the rafters, they could be lifted a foot from the gunwale to\r\nlet in light and air. Two or three times in a strong breeze this roof\r\ncollapsed and fell about our heads!\r\n\r\nIn the fore part of the boat, 7 feet long, one boatman paddled or\r\npoled, and in the hinder part, 4 feet long, the other poled or worked\r\nan oar. But the fore part was also our kitchen and poultry yard and\r\nthe boatmen’s kitchen. There also were kept faggots, driftwood,\r\nand miscellaneous stores, with the food and water in unappetizing\r\nproximity. There, too, Wong and Che-on-i spent their day; and there\r\nthey all cooked, ate, and washed clothes; and there at night the\r\nboatmen curled themselves up and slept in a space 4 feet × 4. The rest\r\nof the _sampan_ divided itself naturally by the thwarts. My part, the\r\ncentre, was originally 8 feet × 4 feet 10 inches, but encroachments by\r\nno means gradual constituted it a “free coup” for sacks, rice-bags,\r\nclothing, and baskets, till it was reduced to a bare 6 feet, into\r\nwhich space my bed, chair, saddle, and luggage were packed for five\r\nweeks. In the hinder division, 7 feet × 4 feet 4 inches, Mr. Miller\r\nlived and studied, and he, Wong, and Che-on-i slept. It was scarcely\r\npossible for six people and their gear to be more closely packed. Mr.\r\nMiller, though not an experienced traveller, cheerfully made the best\r\nof everything then and afterwards, and preserved the serenity of his\r\ntemper under all circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe _sampan’s_ crew of two consisted of Kim, her owner, a tall wiry,\r\npicturesque, aristocratic-looking old man, and his “hired man,” who was\r\nnever heard to speak except on two occasions, when, being very drunk,\r\nhe developed a remarkable loquacity. On the whole, they were well\r\nbehaved and quiet. I saw them in close proximity every hour of the day\r\nand was never annoyed by anything they did. Kim was paid $30 per month\r\nfor the boat, and his laziness was wonderful. To dawdle along, to start\r\nlate and tie up early, to crawl when he tracked, and to pole or paddle\r\nwith the least expenditure of labor, was his policy. To pole for an\r\nhour, then tie up and take a smoke, to spend half a day now and then on\r\nbuying rice, to work on my sensibilities by feigning exhaustion, and\r\nto adopt every dodge of the lazy man, was his practice. The contract\r\nstipulated for three men, and he only took one, making some evasive\r\nexcuse. But I have said the worst I can say when I write that they\r\nnever made more than 10 miles in a day, and often not more than 7, and\r\nthat when they came to severe rapids they always wanted to go back.[12]\r\n\r\nMr. Wyers busied himself in putting a mat on the floor and stowing\r\nthings as neatly as possible, and when curtains had been put up,\r\nthe quarters, though “cribbed, cabined, and confined,” looked quite\r\ntolerable. The same limp, silent crowd looked on till we left Han Kang\r\nat midday. In a few hours things shook into shape, and after all the\r\ndiscomforts were not great, possibly the greatest being that the smoke\r\nand the smell of the boatmen’s malodorous food blew through the boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] I took very careful notes on the Han, but as minute details would\r\nbe uninteresting to the general reader, and would involve a good deal\r\nof apparent repetition, I shall give only the most salient features\r\nof a journey which, if it has ever been made, has certainly not been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nON THE RIVER OF GOLDEN SAND\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the five weeks which I spent on the Han, though the routine\r\nof daily life varied little, there was no monotony. The country and\r\nthe people were new, and we mixed freely, almost too freely, with the\r\nlatter; the scenery varied hourly, and after the first few days became\r\nnot only beautiful, but in places magnificent, and full of surprises;\r\nthe spring was in its early beauty, and the trees in their first\r\nvividness of green, red, and gold; the flowers and flowering shrubs\r\nwere in their glory, the crops at their most attractive stage, birds\r\nsang in the thickets, rich fragrant odors were wafted off on the water,\r\nred cattle, though rarely, fed knee-deep in abounding grass, and the\r\nwaters of the Han, nearly at their lowest, were clear as crystal, and\r\ntheir broken sparkle flashed back the sunbeams which passed through a\r\nsky as blue as that of Tibet. There was a prosperous look about the\r\ncountry too, and its security was indicated by the frequent occurrence\r\nof solitary farms, with high secluding fences, standing under the deep\r\nshade of fine walnut and persimmon trees.\r\n\r\nUnlike the bare, arid, denuded hillsides between Chemulpo and Seoul,\r\nthe slopes along much of the route are wooded, and in many cases\r\nforested both with coniferæ and deciduous trees, among which there are\r\noccasionally picturesque clumps of umbrella pines. The _Pinus Sinensis_\r\nand the _Abies Microsperma_ abound, and there are two species of oak\r\nand three of maple, a _Platanus_, juniper, ash, mountain ash, birch,\r\nhazel, _Sophora Japonica_, _Euonymus alatus_, _Thuja Orientalis_, and\r\nmany others. The heliotrope, pink, and scarlet azaleas were in all\r\ntheir beauty, flushing the hillsides, and white and sulphur-yellow\r\nclematis, actinidia, and a creeping _Euonymus_ were abundant. Of the\r\nwealth of flowering shrubs, mostly white blossomed, I had never seen\r\none before either in garden or greenhouse, except the familiar syringa\r\nand spirea. The beautiful _Ampelopsis Veitchiana_ was in its freshest\r\nspring green and tender red, concealing tree trunks, depending from\r\nbranches, and draping every cliff and rock with its exquisite foliage;\r\nand roses, red and white, of a free-growing, climbing variety, having\r\npossession even of tall trees, hung their fragrant festoons over the\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nIt was all very charming, though a little wanting in life. True, there\r\nwere butterflies and dragon-flies innumerable, and brilliant green\r\nand brown snakes in numbers, and at first the Han was cheery with\r\nmallard and mandarin-duck, geese and common teal. In the rice fields\r\nthe imperial crane, the egret, and the pink ibis with the deep flush\r\nof spring on his plumage, were not uncommon, and peregrines, kestrels,\r\nfalcons, and buzzards were occasionally seen. But the song-birds\r\nwere few. The forlorn note of the night-jar was heard, and the loud,\r\ncheerful call of the gorgeous ringed pheasant to his dowdy mate; but\r\nthe trilling, warbling, and cooing which are the charm of an English\r\ncopsewood in springtime are altogether absent, the chatter of the blue\r\nmagpie and the noisy flight of the warbler being poor substitutes for\r\nthat entrancing concert. Of beast life, undomesticated, there were no\r\ntraces, and the domestic animals are few. Sheep do not thrive on the\r\nsour natural grasses of Korea, and if goats are kept I never saw any.\r\nA small black pig not much larger than a pug is universal, and there\r\nare bulls and ponies about the better class of farms. There are big\r\nbuff dogs, but these are kept only to a limited extent on the Han, in\r\nthe idea that they attract the nocturnal visits of tigers. The dogs are\r\nnoisy and voluble, and rush towards a stranger as if bent on attack;\r\nbut it is mere bravado--they are despicable cowards, and run away\r\nhowling at the shaking of a stick.\r\n\r\nLeopards, antelopes, and several species of deer are found among the\r\nmountains bordering the Han, but the beast by preëminence there,\r\nas throughout Korea, is the tiger. At first I was very incredulous\r\nregarding his existence and depredations. It was impossible to believe\r\nthat peaceful agricultural valleys surrounded by hills, thinly clothed\r\nwith dwarf oak scrub, could be ravaged by him, that dogs, pigs, and\r\ncattle are continually carried off by him, and that human beings\r\nvisiting each other at night or belated on the roads are his frequent\r\nprey. But the constant repetition of tiger stories, the terror of the\r\nvillagers, the refusal of _mapu_ and coolies to travel after dark, the\r\ncertainty that in several places the loss of life had been recent,\r\nand that even in the trim settlement of Wön-san a boy and child\r\nhad been seized the day before I arrived and had been eaten on the\r\nhillside above the town, have made me a believer. Possibly some of the\r\ndepredations attributed to tigers may be really the work of leopards,\r\nwhich undoubtedly abound, and have been shot even within the walls of\r\nSeoul. High up the Han, in a very lovely lake-like stretch, there is a\r\nvillage recently deserted because of the persistency with which tigers\r\nhad carried off its inhabitants. The Korean tiger, judging from its\r\nskin, in which the long hair grows out of a thick coat of fine fur,\r\nresembles the Manchurian tiger. I have heard of one which measured\r\n13 feet 4 inches, but never saw a skin more than 11 feet 8 inches in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe tiger-hunters form what may be called a brigade or corps, and may\r\nbe called on for military service. They were conspicuous objects in\r\nthe _Kur-dong_, with their long matchlock guns, loose blue uniforms,\r\nand conical-crowned, broad-brimmed hats. The tiger appears on the\r\nRoyal standard, and tigers’ skins are the insignia of high office, the\r\nleopard skins, indicating lower rank. The Chinese give a very high\r\nprice for tigers’ bones as a medicine, considering them a specific for\r\nstrength and courage. Tiger-hunting as a business seems confined to\r\nthe northern provinces. On the Han, and specially along its northern\r\naffluents, are found three if not four species of deer, and the horns,\r\nin the velvet, of the large deer (_Cervus Manchuricus_), which fetch\r\nfrom forty to sixty dollars a pair, are the prize most wanted by the\r\nhunters. Pheasants are literally without number and are very tame;\r\nI constantly saw them feeding among the crops within a few yards of\r\nthe peasants at their work. They are usually brought down by falcons,\r\nwhich, when well trained, command as high a price as nine dollars. To\r\nobtain them three small birds are placed in a cylinder of loosely woven\r\nbamboo, mounted horizontally on a pole. On the peregrine alighting\r\non this, a man who has been concealed throws a net over the whole.\r\nThe bird is kept in a tight sleeve for three days. Then he is daily\r\nliberated in a room, and trained to follow a piece of meat pulled over\r\nthe floor by a string. At the end of a week he is taken out on his\r\nmaster’s wrist, and slipped when game is seen. He is not trained to\r\nreturn. The master rushes upon him and secures him before he has time\r\nto devour the bird. A man told me that he sometimes got between twenty\r\nand thirty pheasants a day, but had to walk or run 100 _li_ to do it.\r\nThe season was nearly over, yet I bought fine pheasants on the Han for\r\nthreepence and fourpence each. They were cheaper than chickens.\r\n\r\nThe Han itself, rising in the Diamond Mountain of Kong-wön Do, and\r\nformed by a number of nearly parallel affluents, next to the border\r\nriver Am-nok, is _the_ river of Korea, which it cuts nearly across,\r\nits eastern extremity being within 25 miles of the Sea of Japan and\r\nits western at Chemulpo. I ascended it to within 40 miles of the Sea\r\nof Japan, and estimate the length of its navigable waters for small\r\nflat-bottomed craft at about 170 miles. A clear bright stream with a\r\nbottom of white sand, golden gravel or rock, chiefly limestone, with an\r\naverage width of 250 yards well sustained to the head of navigation,\r\nnarrowed at times by walls of rock or divided by grassy islands in its\r\nlower course, full of pebbly shallows, over which it ripples gaily,\r\nits upper waters abounding in rocky rapids, many of them severe and\r\ndangerous, its most marked features, to my thinking, are its absence\r\nof affluents after it emerges from the Diamond Mountain, and its\r\nsingular alternations of shallow with very deep water. It was a common\r\noccurrence to have to drag my boat, drawing only 3 inches, through\r\nwater too shallow to float her, and at the top of the ripple to come\r\nupon a broad, still, lake-like, deep, green expanse, 20 feet deep,\r\ncontinuing for a mile or two.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the forks there are 46 rapids, many of them very severe,\r\nbefore reaching Yöng-Chhun, which for practical purposes may be\r\nregarded as the limit of navigable water.\r\n\r\nThese are a most serious obstacle in the way of navigation, but as\r\nthere is usually a deep water channel in the middle, sailing junks of\r\n25 tons, taking advantage of strong, favorable winds, get up as far\r\nas Tan-Yang. Beyond, boats not twice the size of my _sampan_ must be\r\nused, which are only poled and dragged, and as they must keep near the\r\nshore, among rocks and furious water, their progress is very slow,\r\nnot more than 7 miles a day. Nevertheless, the Han, with all its\r\ndifficulties and obstructions, is the great artery of communication for\r\nmuch of Kong-wön-Do and Kyöng-Kivi Do, and for the northeast portion\r\nof Chung-Chöng Do; down it all the excess produce of this great region\r\ngoes to Seoul, and nearly all merchandise, salt, and foreign goods\r\ncome up it from the sea-board, to pass into the hands of the _posang_,\r\nor merchant pedlars, at various points, and through them to reach the\r\nmarket-places of the interior. During the first ten days from Han Kang\r\nthere were 75 junks a day on an average bound up and down stream.\r\nThere is a very large floating population on the Han. There is not a\r\nbridge along its whole length, but communication is kept up by 47 free\r\nferries, provided by Government.\r\n\r\nNot having been able to learn anything about the route or any of its\r\nfeatures, I was much surprised to find a very large population, not\r\nonly along the river, but in the parallel valleys, many of them of\r\ngreat length and extreme fertility, in its neighborhood. It was only\r\nnecessary to climb a ridge or hill to see numbers of these, given up\r\nto rice culture, and thickly sprinkled with farming villages. Along\r\nthe river banks only, between Han Kang and Yöng-Chhun, there are 176\r\nvillages. Much of the soil is rich alluvium, from 5 to 11 feet deep,\r\nand most prolific, bearing two heavy crops a year (not rice lands) with\r\nlittle or no manure. There is on the whole an air of greater ease and\r\nprosperity about the Han valley than about any other region that I have\r\nseen in Korea.[13]\r\n\r\nThe people are of fine physique and generally robust appearance. Some\r\nof them had evidently attained great age. There were a few sore eyes\r\nand some mild skin diseases, both produced by dirt, but there were no\r\nsickly-looking people; infants abounded.\r\n\r\nExcept for a monastery and temple, both Buddhist, not far from\r\nSeoul, and the Confucian temples at the magistracies, there were no\r\nsigns of any other cult than that of dæmons. There were two shrines\r\ncontaining _mirioks_, in both cases water-worn boulders chafed into\r\nsome resemblance to humanity; spirit shrines on heights; and under\r\nlarge trees heaps of stones sacred to dæmons; tall posts, with the tops\r\nrudely cut into something suggestive of distorted human faces, painted\r\nblack and blue, with straw ropes with dependent straw tassels, like\r\nthose denoting Shinto shrines in Japan, stretched across the road to\r\nprevent the ingress of malignant spirits, and trees with many streamers\r\nof rag, as well as worn-out straw shoes hanging in their branches, as\r\nofferings to these beings.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings do not vary much, except that the roofs of the better\r\nclass are tiled. In villages where there is a resident _yang-ban_\r\nor squire-noble, his house is usually pretentious, and covers a\r\nconsiderable area, but yields in stateliness to the family tomb, always\r\non a hill slope, a great grass mound on a grass platform backed by\r\nhorseshoe-shaped grass banks, and usually by a number of fine pines.\r\nIn front of the mound is invariably a stone altar on two stone drums,\r\nstone posts which support the canopy used when sacrifices are offered\r\nto the spirit of the deceased, and stone lanterns. A few of the grander\r\ntombs are approached by a short avenue of stone figures of warriors,\r\nhorses, servants, and sheep.[14]\r\n\r\nThe peasant’s houses do not differ from those of the poorer classes in\r\nSeoul. The walls are of mud, and the floors, also of mud, are warmed\r\nby a number of flues, the most economical of all methods of heating,\r\nas the quantity of dried leaves and weeds that a boy of ten can carry\r\nkeeps two rooms above 70° for twelve hours. Every house is screened\r\nby a fence 6 feet high of bamboo or plaited reeds, and is usually\r\nsurrounded by fruit trees. In one room are _ang-pak_, great earthenware\r\njars big enough to contain a man, in which rice, millet, barley, and\r\nwater are kept. That is frequently in small houses the women’s room.\r\nThe men’s room has little in it but the mat on the floor, pillows\r\nof solid wood, and large red and green hat-cases ranging from the\r\nrafters, in which the crinoline dress hats are stowed away. Latticed\r\nand paper-covered doors and windows denote a position above that of the\r\npoorest. A pig-stye, much more substantial than the house, is always\r\nalongside of it.\r\n\r\nThe villages from about 50 _li_ up the Han from Seoul may all be\r\ndescribed as “farming villages.” Lower down they export large\r\nquantities of firewood and charcoal for the daily needs of a capital\r\nwhich has left itself without a stick available for fuel in its\r\nimmediate neighborhood. No special industries exist. The peasants make\r\ntheir rude wooden ploughs and spades shod with iron, and two villages\r\nwithin 40 _li_ of Seoul supply them with their _ang-paks_ and culinary\r\nutensils of the same coarse ware, which stands fire and serves instead\r\nof iron pots. Such iron utensils as are used are imported from Seoul\r\nalong with salt, and foreign piece goods for dress clothes, and are\r\npaid for with rice, grain, and tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe people are peasant farmers in the strictest sense, most of them\r\nholding their lands from the _yang-bans_ at their pleasure. The\r\nproprietor has the right to turn them out after harvest, but it does\r\nnot seem to be very oppressively exercised. He provides the seed, and\r\nthey pay him half the yield. Some men buy land and obtain title-deeds.\r\nIn 1894 they paid in taxes on one day’s ploughing, so much for\r\nbarley, beans, rice, and cotton, the sum varying; but a new system\r\nof collecting tax on the assessed value of the land has come into\r\noperation, which renders “squeezing” on the part of the tax collector\r\nfar more difficult. Money is scarcely current, business transactions\r\nare by barter, or the peasant pays with his labor. His chief outlay\r\nis on foreign piece cottons for his best clothes. These are 30 _cash_\r\nper measure of 20 inches, dearer at Yöng-Wol, the reputed head of\r\nnavigation, than at Seoul.\r\n\r\nThe population of the Han valley is not poor, if by poverty is to be\r\nunderstood scarcity of the necessaries of life. The people have enough\r\nfor themselves and for all and sundry who, according to Korean custom,\r\nmay claim their hospitality. Probably they are all in debt; it is very\r\nrare indeed to find a Korean who has not this millstone round his\r\nneck, and they are destitute of money or possessions other than those\r\nthey absolutely require. They appear lazy. I then thought them so, but\r\nthey live under a _régime_ under which they have no security for the\r\ngains of labor, and for a man to be reported to be “making money,”\r\nor attaining even the luxury of a brass dinner service, would be\r\nsimply to lay himself open to the rapacious attentions of the nearest\r\nmandarin and his myrmidons, or to a demand for a loan from an adjacent\r\n_yang-ban_. Nevertheless, the homesteads of the Han valley have a look\r\nof substantial comfort.\r\n\r\nCertainly the meals of the _men_ are taken in far greater tidiness than\r\nis usual among laborers. The women, as is the fashion with women, eat\r\n“anyhow,” and gobble up their lords’ leavings. All meals for men are\r\nserved on small, circular, dark wooden tables, a few inches high, one\r\nfor each person. Rice is the staple of diet, and is served in a great\r\nbowl, but besides this, there are seldom fewer than five or six glazed\r\nearthenware vessels containing savory, or rather tasty, condiments.[15]\r\nChop-sticks and small flattish spoons of horn or base metal are used\r\nfor eating.\r\n\r\nIn the villages, as distinguished from the hamlets, on the Han there\r\nare schools, but they are not open to the public. Families club\r\ntogether and engage a teacher, but the pupils are only of the scholarly\r\nclass, and only Chinese learning in Wenli is taught, this being the\r\nstepping-stone to official position, the object of the ambition of\r\nevery Korean. _En-mun_ is despised, and is not used as a written\r\nlanguage by the educated class. I observed, however, that a great many\r\nmen of the lower orders on the river were able to read their own script.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two small Buddhist establishments not far from\r\nSeoul, priests are non-existent on the Han, nor is there any Christian\r\npropaganda, Protestant or Roman, at work, though Roman missionaries\r\nwere formerly stationed at two points near the forks. Dæmon-worship\r\nprevails throughout the whole region.\r\n\r\nThe river is frozen for from three to four months in the winter, and\r\ntends to inundate the lower lands for two months in the summer. The\r\nbridle tracks which skirt it and diverge from it are infamous. The\r\nvalley has no mails, and of course no newspapers. The Tong-haks\r\n(rebels, or armed reformers) were strong in a region immediately to the\r\nsouth of the great bend, which showed some dissatisfaction with things\r\nas they were, and a desire for reform in some minds.\r\n\r\nSo far as I could learn, the region is not rich in ordinary minerals.\r\nI could hear nothing of “the burning earth,” though the geological\r\nformation renders its existence probable. Copper and iron are worked\r\nnot far from the north branch to a limited extent. But the Han is the\r\n“River of Golden Sand,” and though the height of the gold season is\r\nafter the summer rains, the _auri sacra fames_ even then attracted\r\ngangs of men to the river banks, and gold in the mountains was a\r\nsubject on which the Koreans were always voluble.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the people was friendly. I never saw a trace of actual\r\nhostility, though on the higher waters of the south branch it was very\r\ndoubtful whether they had seen a European before. Their curiosity was\r\nnaturally enormous, and whenever the boat tied up for a day it showed\r\nitself by crowds sitting on the bank as close to it as they could get,\r\nstaring apathetically. They were frequently timid, and snatched up\r\ntheir fowls and hid them when we came in sight, but a little friendly\r\nexplanation of our honesty of purpose, and above all, the sight of a\r\nfew strings of _cash_, usually set everything straight. A foreigner is\r\nabsolutely safe. During the ofttimes tedious process of hauling up the\r\nrapids, when Mr. Miller and the servants were tugging at the ropes, I\r\nconstantly strolled for two or three hours by myself along the river\r\nbank, and whether the path led through solitary places or through\r\nvillages, I never met with anything more disagreeable than curiosity\r\nshown in a very ill-bred fashion, and that was chiefly on the part of\r\nwomen. When the people understood that they would be paid it was not\r\ndifficult to procure the little they had to sell at fairly reasonable\r\nrates. They were disposed to be communicative, and showed very little\r\nsuspicion, far less indeed than in parts of Korea where foreigners are\r\ncommon. My Chinese servant was everywhere an object of most friendly\r\ncuriosity and a centre of pleasurable interest.\r\n\r\nThe mercury during April and May ranged from 42° to 72°, and the\r\nbarometer showed remarkable steadiness. There were two heavy rainfalls,\r\nbut the weather on the whole was superb, and the atmosphere clear and\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOREAN PEASANTS AT DINNER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] I am inclined to think that Europeans habitually underestimate the\r\npopulation. The average I obtained is 8 to a house, taking 70 houses\r\nat random, and this estimate is borne out by General Greathouse, for\r\nsome years in Korean Government service, and Mr. Moffett, a resident\r\nand traveller in Korea for seven years, both of whom have given some\r\nattention to the subject. It must be understood that a Korean household\r\nrarely, if ever, consists of a man, wife and children only; there are\r\nparents and relationly hangers-on, to say nothing of possible servants.\r\n\r\n[14] Such figures where they occur are always spoken of by foreigners\r\nas sheep, but I doubt whether this animal appears at any but royal\r\ntombs, where it is probably represented as offered in sacrifice by the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n[15] These remarks apply to every part of Korea which I afterwards saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nVIEWS AFLOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hours sufficed for settling in our very narrow quarters, and by\r\nthe end of the second day we had shaken down into an orderly routine.\r\nBy dint of much driving Kim was induced to start about seven, at\r\nwhich hour I had my flour and water stirabout. The halts for smoking,\r\ncooking, and eating were many, and about five o’clock he used to\r\nsimulate exhaustion, a deception to which his lean form and thin face\r\nwith its straight straggling white hair lent themselves effectively.\r\nThen followed the daily wrangle about the place to tie up, Kim\r\nnaturally desiring a village and the proximity of junks, with much\r\nnocturnal smoking and gossip, while my wish was for solitude, quiet,\r\nand a pebbly river bottom, and with Mr. Miller’s aid I usually carried\r\nmy point. Between Kim’s laziness and the frequent occurrence of rapids,\r\n10 miles came to be considered a good day’s journey! The same rapids\r\nmade any settled plan of occupation impossible, yet on the early stages\r\nof the journey, when there were long quiet stretches of water between\r\nthem, it was pleasant to elevate the roof and have a quiet morning’s\r\nwork till dinner at twelve.\r\n\r\nThis, it must be confessed, was a precarious meal. Chickens for curry\r\nwere not always attainable, and were often so small as to suggest the\r\negg shell, and the river fish which were sometimes got by pouncing\r\non a boy fisherman were very minute and bony. Chestnuts often eked\r\nout a very scanty meal. Wong used to hunt along the river banks for\r\nwild onions and carrots, after the stock of the cultivated roots was\r\nexhausted, and he made paste of flour and water, rolled it with a\r\nbamboo on the top of a box, cut it into biscuits with the lid of\r\na tin, and baked them in the frying-pan. Rice fritters too he made\r\nmorning, noon, and night. Afternoon tea of Burrough’s and Wellcome’s\r\n“tabloids” was never omitted, and after tying up came supper, an\r\nimpoverished repetition of dinner, the whole a wholesome regimen,\r\ninvariably eaten with appetite.\r\n\r\nVisiting villages and small towns, only to find the first a collection\r\nof mud hovels, and the last mud hovels with the addition of ruinous\r\nofficial buildings and a forlorn Confucian temple, climbing to ridges\r\nbordering the Han to get a view of fertile and populous valleys,\r\nconversing with and interrogating the people through Mr. Miller and his\r\nservant, taking geographical notes, temperatures, altitudes, barometric\r\nreadings, and measurements of the river (nearly all unfortunately lost\r\nin a rapid on the downward journey), collecting and drying plants,\r\nphotographing, and developing negatives under difficulties, all the\r\nblankets and waterproofs in the boat being requisitioned for the\r\ncreation of a “dark room”--all these occupations made up busy and\r\ninteresting days.\r\n\r\nThe first two days were spent in turning the flank of the range on\r\nwhich is the so-called fortress of Nam Han, with its priest soldiers,\r\none of the four which are supposed to guard Seoul and offer refuge\r\nin times of trouble. On the right bank there are many villages of\r\nfarmers, woodcutters, and charcoal burners, and on the left an expanse\r\nof cultivated sandy soil between the mountains and the river, there a\r\nbroad rapid stream rippling brightly over white sand or golden gravel.\r\nAfter passing the Yang-kun magistracy, a large village with a long\r\nstreet, where a whole fleet of _sampans_ was loading with country\r\nproduce for the capital, and a number of junks were unloading salt, the\r\nHan makes a sharp bend to the south, and after a long rapid expands\r\ninto a very broad stream. The valley broadens also, and becomes flat,\r\nthe hills, absolutely denuded even of scrub, are low, and recede from\r\nthe river; their serrated black ridges of rock, and their deeply\r\nscored, corrugated, flushed sides, which spring had scarcely tinged\r\nwith green, are forbidding, and though the valley was green with young\r\nwheat, that is quite the most monotonous and uninteresting part of the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAfter circumventing the fine fortress summit of Nam Han, the river\r\nenters the mountains. From that time up to the head of possible\r\nnavigation, the scenery in its variety, beauty, and unexpectedness\r\nexhausts the vocabulary of admiration.\r\n\r\nA short distance above Han Kang is the Buddhist temple, of Ryeng-an\r\nSa, dedicated to the Dragon, one of the two Buddhist sanctuaries on\r\nthe long course of the Han. On the left bank a low stone wall encloses\r\na spot on which a female dragon alighted from heaven in the days of\r\nthe last dynasty, and where still, in times of flood or drought,\r\nsacrifices are offered and libations poured out to “Heaven.” The\r\nonly other temple is that of Pyök-chol on the right bank of the Han,\r\nabove Yö Ju, four days from Seoul. A steep wooded promontory projects\r\ninto the still, deep, green water, crowned with two brick and stone\r\npagodas. In a wooded dell at the back there are some picturesque and\r\nelaborately carved and painted temples and monastic buildings, and a\r\nfine bell five centuries old, surmounted by an entanglement of dragons,\r\nwhich, with some medallions on the sides, are of very bold design\r\nand successful workmanship, and the whole is said to have been cast\r\nin Chung-Chöng Do before the Japanese stole the arts and artists! A\r\npavilion for the temple dramas was occupied for the afternoon by a\r\nlarge picnic of women and children from Yö Ju. In one of the monastic\r\ncourts there is a marble pagoda with some finely executed bas-reliefs\r\non its sides, claiming a not distant kinship with those of the “marble\r\npagoda” in Seoul. The establishment consisted of an abbot, nineteen\r\nmonks, and four novices. The abbot was the most refined, intellectual,\r\nand aristocratic-looking man that I saw in Korea, with an innate\r\ncourtesy and refinement of manner rare anywhere. He carried the weight\r\nof seventy years with much grace and dignity, and made us cordially\r\nwelcome. This was the last we saw of Buddhism till we reached the\r\nDiamond Mountain six weeks later.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Tomak-na-dali, where we tied up, they make the great\r\npurple-black jars and pots which are in universal use. Their method\r\nis primitive. They had no objection to be watched, and were quite\r\ncommunicative. The potters pursue their trade in open sheds, digging\r\nup the clay close by. The stock-in-trade is a pit in which an uncouth\r\npotter’s wheel revolves, the base of which is turned by the feet of\r\na man who sits on the edge of the hole. A wooden spatula, a mason’s\r\nwooden trowel, a curved stick, and a piece of rough rag are the tools,\r\nefficient for the purpose. Fifty _li_ higher up, a few _li_ from the\r\nriver, are beds of kaolin used in the Government pottery and for the\r\nfiner kinds of porcelain.\r\n\r\nFor two days the Han was about 400 yards wide, with a very tortuous\r\ncourse, abounding in rapids, shallows, and green islands, with great\r\nexpanses of pure white sand on its left bank, and frequent villages of\r\nwoodcutters and charcoal burners on both. On the 16th we reached the\r\nforks at the village of Ma-chai. There the north branch, which was to\r\nbe afterwards traversed, comes down, and the south branch, in every way\r\nmore important, arrives from the southward. Between the two there is a\r\npretty wooded island then pink with azalea blossom. Beyond is a fine\r\nstretch of alluvium, nearly 6 feet deep, bearing rich crops of barley\r\nand wheat, but entirely unprotected from the desolations of the river\r\nin its annual rise, which engulfs every year acres of this prolific\r\nsoil. Ten years ago the Han, altering its course, brought down from the\r\ntop of a steep bank at some distance a huge concrete double coffin 9\r\nfeet long and 16 inches thick! The great alluvial expanse was make over\r\nto the Buddhists by the King, who receives annually a fixed amount of\r\nthe produce.\r\n\r\nBetween Kim’s laziness and plausibility, and the rapids, which though\r\nnot severe were frequent, and the food hunt, which was a necessity,\r\nour progress was slow, and it was not till the 19th of April that we\r\nreached Yö Ju, the first town of any importance and the birthplace of\r\nthe late Queen. It is memorable to me as being the first place where\r\nthe crowd was obstreperous and obnoxious, though not hostile. It is\r\nhumiliating to be a “show” and to get nothing by it! I went out on a\r\nrock in the river in the hope of using the prismatic compass in peace,\r\nand was nearly pushed into the water, and when I went up into the gate\r\ntower a stamping, curious crowd, climbing on everything that afforded a\r\npoint of vantage, shook the old fabric so severely that the delicately\r\nbalanced needle never came to rest. The crowd was dirty, the streets\r\nwere foul and decayed, and worst of all was the magistrate’s _yamen_,\r\nto which we had occasion to go, and where I found that a _kwan-ja_ was\r\npowerless to obtain even common civility.\r\n\r\nThe _yamen_, though finely situated and enclosing in its grounds\r\na large and much decorated pavilion for Royal use, but used as a\r\nchildren’s playground, was in a state of wreck. The woodwork was\r\ncrumbling, beams and rafters were falling down, lacquer and paint were\r\nscaling off, torn paper fluttered from the lattice windows, plaster\r\nhung from the grimy walls, the once handsome gate tower was on its\r\nlast legs, in the courtyard some flagstones had subsided, others were\r\nexalted, and audacious ragweed and shepherd’s purse grew in their\r\ncrevices. Poverty, neglect, and melancholy reigned supreme. Within\r\nthe gates were plenty of those persons who suck the lifeblood of\r\nKorea. There were soldiers in Tyrolese hats and coarse cotton uniforms\r\nin which blue predominated, _yamen_ runners in abundance, writers,\r\nofficers of _in_justice, messengers pretending to have business on\r\nhand, and many small rooms, in which were many more men sitting on the\r\nfloor smoking long pipes, with writing materials beside them.\r\n\r\nOne attendant, by no means polite, took my _kwan-ja_ to the magistrate,\r\nand very roughly led the way to two small rooms, in the inner one\r\nof which the official was seated on the floor, surrounded by a few\r\nelderly men. We were directed to stand at the opening between the two\r\nrooms, and behind us pressed as many of the crowd as could get in. I\r\nbowed low. No notice was taken. An attendant handed the magistrate\r\na pipe, so long that it would have been impossible for him to light\r\nit for himself, and he smoked. Mr. Miller hoped that he was in good\r\nhealth. No reply, and the eyes were never raised. Mr. Miller explained\r\nthe object of the visit, which was to get a little information about\r\nthe neighborhood. There was only a very curt reply, and as the great\r\nman turned to one of his subordinates and began to talk to him, and\r\nrude remarks were circulating, we took leave with the usual Korean\r\nphrases of politeness, which were not reciprocated.\r\n\r\nWe were told that there are many “high _yang-bans_” in Yö Ju, and it\r\nseemed natural that the magistrate of a town of only 700 houses should\r\nnot be a man of high rank. The story goes that when he came they used\r\n“low talk” to him and ordered him about as their inferior. So he lives\r\nchiefly in Seoul, and the man who sat in sordid state amidst the ruins\r\nof the spacious and elaborately decorated _yamen_ does his work and\r\ndivides the spoils, and the _yang-bans_ are left to whatever their\r\ndevices may be. But this is not an isolated case. Nearly all the river\r\nmagistrates are mainly absentees, and spend their time, salaries,\r\nand squeezings in the capital. I had similar interviews with three\r\nother magistrates. I asked nothing except change in _cash_ for three\r\n_yen_, and on each occasion was told that the treasury was empty. My\r\n_kwan-ja_, a pompous document from the Foreign Office, was of this use\r\nonly, it procured me a chicken at a high price in a town where the\r\npeople were unwilling to sell!\r\n\r\nAt Yö Ju I saw for the only time either in Korea or China the interior\r\nof an ancestral temple. It is a lofty building, with a curved tile\r\nroof and blackwood ceiling, approached by a roofed gateway. Opposite\r\nthe entrance is an ebony stool, on which are a brass bowl and incense\r\nburner. Above this is a large altar, supporting two candlesticks with\r\ncandles, and above that again an ebony stand on which rests a polished\r\nblack marble tablet inscribed with the name of the deceased. Behind\r\nthat, in a recess in the wall, with elaborate fretwork doors, is his\r\nlife-sized portrait in Chinese style. The floor is covered with plain\r\nmatting. In the tablet the third soul of the deceased is supposed to\r\ndwell. Food is placed before it three times daily for three years in\r\nthe case of a parent, and there the relations, after the expiration of\r\nthat period, meet at stated seasons every year and offer sacrifice and\r\n“worship.”\r\n\r\nAt the large and prosperous-looking village of Chön-yaing the people\r\ntold us that a “circus” was about to perform and impelled us towards\r\nit; but finding that it was in the courtyard of a large tiled-roof\r\nmansion, in good repair and of much pretension, we were retiring, when\r\nwe were cordially invited to enter, and I was laid hold of (literally)\r\nby the serving-women and dragged through the women’s court and into\r\nthe women’s apartments. I was surrounded by fully forty women, old and\r\nyoung, wives, concubines, servants, all in gala dress and much adorned.\r\nThe principal wife, a very young girl wearing some Indian jewellery,\r\nwas very pretty and had an exquisite complexion, but one and all were\r\ndestitute of manners. They investigated my clothing, pulled me about,\r\ntook off my hat and tried it on, untwisted my hair and absorbed my\r\nhairpins, pulled off my gloves and tried them on with shrieks of\r\nlaughter, and then, but not till they had exhausted all the amusement\r\nwhich could be got out of me, they bethought themselves of entertaining\r\nme by taking me through their apartments, crowding upon me to such an\r\nextent as they did so that I was nearly carried off my feet. They took\r\nme through fourteen communicating rooms, with fine parquet floors,\r\nmostly spoiled by being covered in whole or in part with Brussels\r\ntapestry carpets of “loud” and vulgar patterns in hideous aniline dyes.\r\nGreat mirrors in tawdry gilt frames glared from the tender coloring\r\nof the walls, and French clocks asserted their expensive vulgarity in\r\nevery room.\r\n\r\nIn the outer court a rope was stretched for the rope-dancers, and\r\nkettledrums and reed-pipes gave promise of such music as Koreans\r\nlove. I was escorted across two other courts surrounded by verandas\r\nsupported on dressed stone, and with iron railings instead of wood,\r\nto an elevated reception room, where a foreign table and some tawdry\r\nvelvet-covered chairs clashed with the tastefulness of the walls and\r\nthe fine mats bordered with the Greek fret on the floor. French clocks,\r\nall keeping different time, were much _en évidence_. The host, a youth\r\nof eighteen, eldest son of the governor of one of the most important\r\ngovernorships in Korea, welcomed us, and seemed anxious to receive us\r\ncourteously. Wine, soup, eggs, and _kimchi_, an elaborate sort of “sour\r\nkraut,” were produced, and had to be partaken of, our host meanwhile\r\nsmoking an expensive foreign cigar, which gave him an opportunity for\r\nthe ostentatious display of a showy diamond ring. He was dressed in\r\nsea-green silk, and wore a hat of very fine quality.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to see the inside of my camera and to be photographed, for\r\nwhich purpose we retired to the back of the house to avoid the enormous\r\ncrowd which had collected, and which was becoming every moment more\r\nimpolite and disorderly. I made him exchange the foreign cigar, vulgar\r\nin a Korean’s mouth, for the national long pipe. At this juncture some\r\nfriends came up, hangers-on, who were feasting with him to celebrate\r\nhis having obtained a good place in a recent examination, and made a\r\nrudely-worded request for our immediate departure. It was obvious that,\r\nafter their unmannerly curiosity had been satisfied, our presence,\r\nand the courteous treatment extended to us, spoilt their amusement.\r\nThe ringleader spoke roughly to our host, who turned his back on us\r\nand retired meekly to his own apartments, although he is a son of an\r\nofficial of the highest rank, and a near relative of the late Queen.\r\nWe could only make a somewhat ignominious exit, having been truly\r\n“played out.”\r\n\r\nThis rage for French clocks, German mirrors, foreign cigars, chairs\r\nupholstered in velvet, and a general foreign tawdriness is spreading\r\nrapidly among the young “swells” who have money to spend, vulgarizing\r\nKorean simplicity, and setting the example to those below them of an\r\nextravagant and purely selfish expenditure. The house, with its many\r\ncourtyards, was new and handsome, and money glared from every point. I\r\nwas glad to return to the simplicity of my boat, hoping that with the\r\n“plain living, high thinking” might be combined!\r\n\r\nBeyond the mountains east of Yö Ju, the Han passes through a noble\r\nstretch of rich alluvium, bearing superb, and fairly clean crops, and\r\nbordered by low, serrated, denuded, and much corrugated ranges, faintly\r\ntinged with green. On this gently rolling plain are many towns and\r\nvillages, among the larger of which are Won Ju, Chung Ju, Chöng-phyöng,\r\nand Tan-Yang, all on or near the river, by which they conveniently\r\nexport their surplus produce, chiefly beans, tobacco, and rice, and\r\nreceive in return their supplies of salt and foreign goods. Even at\r\nthat season of low water the traffic was considerable.\r\n\r\nHigher up, the scenery changes. Lofty limestone bluffs, often caverned,\r\nrise abruptly from the river, and wall in the fertile and populous\r\nvalleys which descend upon it, giving place higher up to grand\r\nbasaltic formation, range behind range, terraces of columnar basalt\r\noccasionally appearing. It was a lovely season, warm days, cold nights,\r\nbrilliant sunshine, great white masses of sunlit clouds on a sky of\r\nheavenly blue, distances idealized in a blue veil which was not a mist,\r\nflowers at their freshest, every bird that has a note or a cry vocal,\r\nbutterflies and red and blue dragon-flies hovering over the grass and\r\nwater, fish leaping, all nature awake and jubilant. And every rift and\r\nbluff had its own beauty of blossoming scarlet azaleas, or syringas,\r\ncontorted or stately pines, and _Ampelopsis Veitchiana_ rose-pink in\r\nits early leafage. There was a note of gladness in the air.\r\n\r\nEight days above Seoul, on the left bank of the river, there is a\r\nruinous pagoda built of large blocks of hewn stone, standing solitary\r\nin the centre of a level plain formed by a bend of the Han. The people,\r\non being asked about it, said, “When Korea was surveyed so long ago\r\nthat nobody knows when, this was the centre of it.” They call it the\r\n“Halfway Place.” After that the only suggestions of antiquity are some\r\nstone foundations, and a few stone tombs among the trees, which, from\r\ntheir shape, may denote the sites of monasteries.\r\n\r\nNear that pagoda were a number of men very drunk, and there were few\r\ndays on which the habit of drinking to excess was not more or less\r\nprominent. The junkmen celebrated the evening’s rest by hard drinking,\r\nand the crowd which nightly assembled on the shore when we tied up\r\nwas usually enlivened by the noisy antics of one or more intoxicated\r\nmen. From my observation on the Han journey and afterwards, I should\r\nsay that drunkenness is an outstanding feature in Korea. And it\r\nis not disreputable. If a man drinks rice wine till he loses his\r\nreason, no one regards him as a beast. A great dignitary even may\r\nroll on the floor drunk at the end of a meal, at which he has eaten\r\nto repletion, without losing caste, and on becoming sober receives\r\nthe congratulations of inferiors on being rich enough to afford such\r\na luxury. Along with the taste for French clocks and German gilding,\r\na love of foreign liquors is becoming somewhat fashionable among the\r\nyoung _yang-bans_, and willing caterers are found who produce potato\r\nspirit rich in fusel oil as “old Cognac,” and a very effervescent\r\nchampagne at a shilling a bottle!\r\n\r\nThe fermented liquors of Korea are probably not unwholesome, but the\r\nliking for them is an acquired taste with Europeans. They vary from a\r\nsmooth white drink resembling buttermilk in appearance, and very mild,\r\nto a water-white spirit of strong smell and fiery taste. Between these\r\ncomes the ordinary rice wine, slightly yellowish, akin to Japanese\r\n_sake_ and Chinese _samshu_, with a faint, sickly smell and flavor.\r\nThey all taste more or less strongly of smoke, oil, and alcohol, and\r\nthe fusel oil remains even in the best. They are manufactured from\r\nrice, millet, and barley. The wine-seller projects a cylindrical basket\r\non a long pole from his roof, resembling the “bush” formerly used in\r\nEngland for a similar purpose. Probably one reason that the Koreans\r\nare a drunken people is that they scarcely use tea at all even in the\r\ncities, and the luxury of “cold water” is unknown to them. The peasants\r\ndrink hot rice water with their meals, honey water as a luxury, and\r\non festive occasions an infusion of orange peel or ginger. The drying\r\nof orange peel is quite a business with Korean housewives. There were\r\nquantities of it hanging from the eaves of all the cottages.\r\n\r\nUp to a short distance above this pagoda, the rapids for which the\r\nHan is famous, though they made our progress slow, had not suggested\r\nserious difficulty, far less risk, but for the remaining fortnight they\r\nwere tortuous rocky channels, through which the river, compressed in\r\nwidth, rushes with great violence and tremendous noise and clatter, or\r\nthey are successive broken ledges of rock, with a chaos of flurry and\r\nfoam, varied by deep pools, presenting formidable, and at some seasons\r\ninsuperable, obstacles to navigation. To all appearance they are far\r\nmore dangerous than the celebrated rapids of the Yangtze, and the\r\nremains of timber rafts and junks attest their destructive properties.\r\nThey occur at shorter and shorter intervals as the higher waters are\r\nreached, till eventually the Han becomes an unbroken rapid or cataract.\r\n\r\nKim, though paid handsomely, was far too stingy to pay for any help\r\n_en route_, his ropes were manifestly bought in “the cheapest market,”\r\nand though Wong, my powerful _sampan_-man, worked with both strength\r\nand skill, and Mr. Miller and his servant toiled at the tow ropes, and\r\nin great exigencies I gave a haul myself, we sometimes made only 7\r\nmiles a day, and ofttimes took two hours to ascend a few yards, two\r\npoling with might and main in the boat, and three tugging with all\r\ntheir strength on shore. Often the ropes snapped, when the boat went\r\nspinning and flying to the foot of the rapid, sometimes with injury to\r\nherself and her contents, sometimes escaping. After a few of such risks\r\nI habitually landed, either on a boatman’s back or wading in waterproof\r\nWellingtons, which caused great wonderment in the lookers on. The worst\r\nrapids were always in the most beautiful places, and the strolls and\r\nclimbs of three or four hours along the river banks, through fields\r\nwith bounteous crops, through odorous Spanish chestnut groves, through\r\nthickets with their fascinating bewilderments of roses, clematis, and\r\nhoneysuckle, and past farmhouses with their privacy of bamboo screens,\r\nand deep shade of blossoming fruit trees, were very delightful.\r\n\r\nIn ten days from Seoul we reach Chöng-phyöng, a town of some\r\npretensions, where in connection with the _yamen_ is a temple pavilion\r\nwith a high white chair, facing a table with candlesticks upon it,\r\nfloor, table, and chair deep in dust, though the building is used\r\nregularly for offering prayers and sacrifices for the King. Dust is\r\nnot noteworthy in Korea, but the paintings in this temple are. On the\r\nend walls are vivid groups of six noblemen wearing fine horsehair\r\npalace hats with wings, each man holding a piece of folded paper in his\r\nhand, and listening intently as he bends forward towards the chair.\r\nThe conception and technique of these paintings are admirable, and the\r\nsunset scenes on the back wall, though inferior in execution, are the\r\nwork of a true artist.\r\n\r\nClose by is a Royal pavilion hanging over the edge of a high bluff\r\nabove the Han, surrounded by superb elms, some of their trunks from 20\r\nto 23 feet in circumference. The view of the fertile valley and of the\r\nmountains beyond is very fine, and the decorative woodwork, painted\r\nin Korean style, has been very handsome; but the phrase “has been”\r\ndescribes most things Korean, and official squalor and neglect could\r\nscarcely go farther.\r\n\r\nAt Chöng-phyöng and elsewhere the common people, in spite of their\r\noverpowering curiosity, were not rude, and usually retired to a\r\nrespectful distance to watch us eat; but from the class of scholars\r\nwho hang on round all _yamens_ we met with a good deal of underbred\r\nimpertinence, some of the men going so far as to raise the curtain of\r\nmy compartment and introduce their heads and shoulders beneath it,\r\nbrow-beating the boatmen when they politely asked them to desist. On\r\nthe other hand, men of the non-cultured class showed us various small\r\nattentions, sometimes helping with a haul at the ropes at a rapid, only\r\nasking in return that their wives might see me, a request with which I\r\nalways gladly complied. At Chöng-phyöng, so great was female curiosity\r\nthat a number of women waded waist deep after the boat to peer under\r\nthe mats of the roof, and one of them, scrambling out to a rock for\r\na final stare, overbalanced herself and fell into deep water. At one\r\npoint, in the very early morning, some women presented themselves\r\nat the boat, having walked several _li_ with a present of eggs, the\r\npayment for which was to be a sight of me and my poor equipments, they\r\nhaving heard that there was a boat with a foreign woman on board. The\r\nold cambric curtains brought from Persia, with a red pattern on a white\r\nground, always attracted them greatly, and the small Japanese cooking\r\nutensils.\r\n\r\nIn thirteen days from Seoul we reached Tan-Yang, a magistracy prettily\r\nsituated on the left bank of the Han, with a picturesque Confucian\r\ntemple on the hill above; and a day later entered upon mountainous\r\ncountry of extreme beauty. The paucity of tributaries is very marked.\r\nUp to that point, except the north branch, there are but two--one\r\nwhich joins the Han at the village of Hu-nan Chang, on the right bank,\r\nand is navigable for 60 _li_, as far as the important town of Wan Ju;\r\nand another, which enters 2 _li_ above the picturesquely-situated\r\nvillage of So-il, on the left bank. Above Tan-Yang the river forms\r\nlong and violent rapids, alternating with broad stretches of blue,\r\nquiet water from 10 to 20 feet deep, rolling majestically, making sharp\r\nand extraordinary bends among lofty limestone precipices. Villages\r\non natural terraces occur constantly, the lower terrace planted with\r\nmulberry or weeping willows. Hemp is cultivated in great quantities,\r\nand is used for sackcloth for mourners’ wear, bags, and rope. In my\r\nwalks along the river I had several opportunities of seeing the curious\r\nmethod of separating the fibre, rude and primitive, but effectual.\r\nAt the bottom of a stone paved pit large stones are placed, which\r\nare heated from a rough oven at the side. The hemp is pressed down\r\nin bundles upon these, and stakes are driven in among them. Piles of\r\ncoarse Korean grass are placed over the hemp, and earth over all, well\r\nbeaten down. The stakes are then pulled up and water is poured into\r\nthe holes left by them. This, falling on the heated stones, produces a\r\ndense steam, and in twenty-four hours the hemp fibre is so completely\r\ndisintegrated as to be easily separated.\r\n\r\nA grand gorge, 3 miles long, with lofty cliffs of much caverned\r\nlimestone, varied by rock needles draped with _Ampelopsis_ and\r\nclematis, and giving foothold to azaleas, spirea, syringa, pear,\r\nhawthorn, climbing roses, wistaria, cyclamen, lycopodium, yellow\r\nvetches, many _Labiatæ_, and much else, contains but one village,\r\npiled step above step in a deep wooded fold of the hills, on which\r\nmillet culture is carried to a great height, on slopes too steep to be\r\nploughed by oxen. This gorge opens out on slopes of rich soil, some of\r\nwhich is still uncultivated. The hamlets are small, and grow much hemp,\r\nand each has its hemp pit. They also grow _Urtica Nivea_, from the\r\nbleached fibre of which their grass-cloth summer clothes are made. All\r\nthese are surrounded with mulberry groves.\r\n\r\nThe large village of Cham-su-ki, at the head of two severe rapids, in\r\nascending which our ropes snapped three times, offers a good example\r\nof the popular belief in spirits. It is approached under a tasselled\r\nstraw rope, one end of which is wound round a fine tree with a stone\r\naltar below it. On another rope were suspended a few small bags\r\ncontaining offerings of food. If a person dies of the pestilence or\r\nby the roadside, or a woman dies in childbirth, the spirit invariably\r\ntakes up its abode in a tree. To such spirits offerings are made on the\r\nstone altar of cake, wine, and pork, but where the tree is the domicile\r\nof the spirit of a man who has been killed by a tiger, dog’s flesh\r\nis offered instead of pork. The Cham-su-ki tree is a fine well-grown\r\nelm. Gnarled trees, of which we saw several on hilltops and sides,\r\nare occupied by the spirits of persons who have died before reaching\r\na cycle, _i.e._ sixty years of age. A steep cliff above Cham-su-ki is\r\nalso denoted as the abode of dæmons by a straw rope and a stone altar.\r\n\r\nWe had some very cold and windy days near the end of April, the mercury\r\nfalling to 34°, and one night of tempestuous rain. It would be absurd\r\nto write of sufferings, but at that temperature in an open boat, with\r\nthe roof lifting and flapping and threatening to take its departure, it\r\nwas impossible to sleep. Afterwards the weather was again splendid.\r\n\r\nAbrupt turns, long rapids full of jagged rocks, long stretches of deep,\r\nstill water, abounding in fish, narrow gorges walled in by terraces of\r\nbasalt, lateral ravines disclosing fine snow-streaked peaks, succeeded\r\neach other, the shores becoming less and less peopled, while the\r\nparallel valleys abounded in fairly well-to-do villages. Just below\r\na long and dangerous rapid we stopped to dine, and though the place\r\nseemed quite solitary, a crowd soon gathered, and sat on the adjacent\r\nstones talking noisily, trying to get into the boat, lifting the mats,\r\ndiscussing whether it were polite to watch people at dinner, some\r\ntaking one side and some another, those who were half tipsy taking the\r\naffirmative. Some said that they had got news from several miles below\r\nthat this great sight was coming up the river, and it was a shame to\r\ndeprive them of it by keeping the curtains down. After a good deal\r\nof obstreperousness, mainly the result of wine, a man overbalanced\r\nhimself and fell into the river, which raised a laugh, and then they\r\nfollowed us good-naturedly up the rapid, one man helping to track, and\r\nasking as his reward that his wife might see me, on which I exhibited\r\nmyself on the bow of the boat.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Pang-wha San, built, contrary to Korean practice,\r\non a height of 800 feet, there is a stone platform, on which was\r\nnightly lighted one of that chain of beacon-fires terminating at\r\nNam-San in Seoul, which assured the King that his kingdom was at\r\npeace.[16] Another village, Ha-chin, was impressive from the frightful\r\nugliness of its women. After leaving Tan-Yang the curiosity increased.\r\nPeople walked great distances to see us, saying they had never seen\r\nforeigners, and bringing eggs to pay for the sight, which I paid for,\r\ntelling the people that we had nothing to show; but extravagant rumors\r\nof what was to be seen in the boat had preceded us, and as the people\r\nassembled at daylight and generally waited patiently, I always yielded\r\nto their wishes, raised the thatch, and made the most of the red and\r\nwhite curtains. In one place I gave them some tea to drink. They had\r\nnever seen it, and thought it was medicine, and on tasting it said, “It\r\nmust be very good for indigestion!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] The telegraph has now superseded this picturesque arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nNATURAL BEAUTY--THE RAPIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn superb weather, and in the full glory of spring, we continued the\r\nexploration of the Han above Tan-Yang, encountering innumerable rapids,\r\nsome of them very severe and horrible to look upon. The river valley,\r\ncontinually narrowing into gorges, rarely admits of hamlets, and the\r\npopulation is relegated to lateral and parallel valleys. On the 30th\r\nof April we tugged and poled the boat up seven long and severe rapids,\r\nwith deep still stretches of water between them. The flora increased in\r\nvariety, and the shapes of the mountains became very definite. Among\r\nother trees there were a large branching _Acanthopanax ricinifolia_,\r\ntwo species of euonymus, mistletoe on the walnut and mulberry, the\r\n_Rhus semi-alata_ and _Rhus vernicifera_, pines, firs, the _Abies\r\nmicrosperma_, the _Actinidia pueraria_, _Elæagnus_, Spanish chestnuts\r\nin great groves, alders, birches, maples, elms, limes, and a tree\r\ninfrequently seen which I believe to be a _Zelkawa_. Among the flowers,\r\nthere were marigolds, buttercups, scentless white and purple violets,\r\nyellow violas, white aconite, lady’s slipper, hawkweed, camomile,\r\nred and white dandelions, guelder roses, wygelias, mountain peonies,\r\nmartagon and tiger lilies, gentians, pink spirea, yellow day lilies,\r\nwhite honeysuckle, the _Iris Rossii_, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe day after leaving Tan-Yang we entered on the most beautiful part\r\nof the river. Great limestone cliffs swing open at times to reveal\r\nglorious glimpses, through fantastic gorges, of peaks and ranges,\r\npartly forest-covered, fading in the far distance into the delicious\r\nblue veil of dreamland; the river, occasionally compressed by its\r\ncolossal walls, vents its fury in flurry and foam, or expands into\r\nbroad reaches 20 and even 30 feet in depth, where pure emerald water\r\nlaps gently upon crags festooned with roses and honeysuckle, or in\r\nfairy bays on pebbly beaches and white sand. The air was full of\r\ngladness. The loud call of the fearless ringed pheasant was heard\r\neverywhere, bees hummed and butterflies and dragon-flies flashed\r\nthrough the fragrant air. What mattered it that our ropes broke three\r\ntimes, that we stuck on a rock in a rapid and hung there for an hour in\r\na deafening din and a lather of foam, and that we “beat the record” in\r\nonly making 5 miles in twelve hours!\r\n\r\nThe limestone cliffs are much caverned, and near the village of To-tam,\r\nwhere they fall back considerably from the river, we explored one\r\ncave worthy of notice, with a fine entrance arch 43 feet in height,\r\nadmitting into a vault considerably higher, with a roof of stalagmites.\r\nWe ascended this cavern for 315 feet, and then had to return for lack\r\nof light. Near the mouth a natural shaft and rock-ladder give access to\r\na fine upper gallery 12 feet high, only 60 feet of which we were able\r\nto investigate. Just above To-tam there is another limestone freak on\r\nthe river bank, a natural bridge or arch, 127 feet in height and 30\r\nfeet wide, below which a fair green lawn slopes up to a height above.\r\nThe bridge is admirably buttressed, and draped with roses, honeysuckle,\r\nand clematis, and various fantastic specimens of coniferæ grow out of\r\nits rifts.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the Han culminates at To-tam in the finest river view\r\nI had then ever seen, a broad stretch, with a deep bay and lofty\r\nlimestone cliffs, between which, on a green slope, the picturesque,\r\ndeep-eaved, brown-roofed houses of the village are built. The gray\r\ncliff is crowned with a goodly group of umbrella pines, in Korea called\r\n“Parasol Pines,” because they resemble in shape those carried before\r\nthe King. Guarding the entrance of the bay are three picturesque jagged\r\npyramidal rocks much covered with the _Ampelopsis Veitchiana_, and of\r\ncourse sacred to dæmon-worship. These sentinels are from 40 to 83 feet\r\nhigh. To the southwest the Han, dark and deep, rolls out of sight round\r\na pine-clad bluff, among the magnificent ranges of the Sol-rak-San\r\nmountains--masses of partially pine-clothed peaks and pinnacles of\r\nnaked rock. To the northeast the river makes an abrupt bend below\r\nsuperb limestone cliffs, and disappears at the foot of Sölmi-San, a\r\ntriplet of lofty peaks. To-tam on its park-like slopes embraces this\r\nview, and were it not for the rapids and their delays and risks, might\r\nbe a delightful summer resort from Seoul.\r\n\r\nThere is fertility as well as grandeur, for the ridge behind the\r\nvillage, abrupt on the riverside, falls gently down on the other to\r\na broad, well-watered level valley, cultivated for rice with extreme\r\nneatness and care, and which, after gladdening the eye with its\r\nproductiveness for several miles, winds out of view among the mountains.\r\n\r\nThere, and in most parts of the Han valley, I was much surprised with\r\nthe neatness of the cultivation. It was not what the reports of other\r\ntravellers had led me to expect, and it gives me the impression that\r\nthe river passes through one of the most productive and prosperous\r\nportions of Korea. The crops of wheat and barley were usually superb,\r\nand remarkably free from weeds--in fact, the cleanliness would do\r\ncredit to “high farming” in the Lothians. It was no uncommon thing\r\nto find from 12 to 18 stalks as the product of one grain. At the\r\nend of April the barley was in ear, and beginning to change color,\r\nand the wheat was 6 inches high. As a general rule the stones were\r\ncarefully picked off the land and were used for retaining walls\r\nfor the rice terraces, or piled in heaps. Steep hillsides were\r\nbeing cleared of scrub and stones for cotton planting, and in many\r\ninstances the cultivation is carried to a height of 1,000 feet, the\r\ncultivators always, however, living in the holes. All the parallel\r\nvalleys are neatly and carefully cultivated. The favorable climate,\r\nwith its abundant, but not superabundant, rainfall, renders irrigation\r\nneedless, except in the case of rice. Every valley has its streamlet,\r\nand is barred across by dykes of mud from its head down to the Han,\r\nrice, with tobacco, beans, hemp, and cotton, being the great articles\r\nof export. On the whole, I was very agreeably surprised with the\r\nagriculture of the Han valley, and doubt not that it is capable of\r\nenormous development if the earnings of industry were secure. The\r\nsoil is most prolific, heavy crops being raised without the aid of\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving beautiful To-tam, the rapids become more and more\r\nfrequent and exasperating, and when Kim sank down, playing upon my\r\nfeelings by well-simulated exhaustion, I feared it would soon become\r\nreal. The ropes broke frequently, and the constant scraping and bumping\r\nover rocks increased the leakiness of the boat so much, that in a\r\nlovely reach, where crystal water rippled on the white sand, I pitched\r\nmy tent, and unloaded and beached the craft for repairs. In one strong\r\ndeep rapid that day the rope parted, and the boat swirled down the\r\nsurges, striking rocks as she spun down with such effect as to spoil a\r\nnumber of photographic negatives and soak my bedding.\r\n\r\nAt the beautifully situated village of Pa-ka Mi, a post bore the\r\nfollowing inscription in large characters--“If any servant of a\r\n_yang-ban_ passing through Pa-ka Mi is polite and behaves well, all\r\nright, but if he behaves badly he will be beaten,” an assertion of\r\nindependence as refreshing as it is rare!\r\n\r\nFor among the curses of Korea is the existence of this privileged class\r\nof _yang-bans_ or nobles, who must not work for their own living,\r\nthough it is no disgrace to be supported by their relations, and who\r\noften live on the clandestine industry of their wives in sewing and\r\nlaundry work. A _yang-ban_ carries nothing for himself, not even his\r\npipe. _Yang-ban_ students do not even carry their books from their\r\nstudies to the classroom. Custom insist that when a member of this\r\nclass travels he shall take with him as many attendants as he can\r\nmuster. He is supported on his led horse, and supreme helplessness\r\nis the conventional requirement. His servants brow-beat and bully the\r\npeople and take their fowls and eggs without payment, which explains\r\nthe meaning of the notice at Pa-ka Mi.[17]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the people, _i.e._ the vast mass of the\r\nunprivileged, on whose shoulders rests the burden of taxation, are\r\nhard pressed by the _yang-bans_, who not only use their labor without\r\npaying for it, but make merciless exactions under the name of loans.\r\nAs soon as it is rumored or known that a merchant or peasant has laid\r\nup a certain amount of _cash_, a _yang-ban_ or official seeks a loan.\r\nPractically it is a levy, for if it is refused the man is either thrown\r\ninto prison on a false charge and whipped every morning until he or\r\nhis relations pay the sum demanded, or he is seized and practically\r\nimprisoned on low diet in the _yang-ban’s_ house until the money is\r\nforthcoming. It is the best of the nobles who disguise their exactions\r\nunder the name of loans, but the lender never sees principal or\r\ninterest. It is a very common thing for a noble, when he buys a house\r\nor field, to dispense with paying for it, and no mandarin will enforce\r\npayment. At Paik-kui Mi, where I paid off my boatmen, the _yang-ban’s_\r\nservants were impressing all the boats for the purpose of taking\r\nroofing tiles to Seoul without payment. Kim begged me to give him some\r\ntrifle to take down the river, with a few _cash_ as payment, and a line\r\nto say that the boat was in my employment, service with a foreigner\r\nbeing a protection from such an exaction.\r\n\r\nThere were two days more of most severe toil, in which it was scarcely\r\npossible to make any progress. The rapids were frightful, and when we\r\nreached a very bad one below the town of Yöng-chhun, Kim, after making\r\nseveral abortive efforts, not, I think, in good faith, to ascend it,\r\ncollapsed, and said he could not get up any higher. At another season\r\nboats of light draught can ascend to Yang-wöl, 20 _li_ farther. We\r\nhad performed a great feat in getting up to Yöng-chhun in early May.\r\nThere were no boats on the higher waters, and for much of the distance\r\nmy _sampan_ could hardly be said to be afloat. At Yöng-chhun we were\r\nwithin 40 miles of the Sea of Japan.\r\n\r\nWind and heavy rain which raised the river forbade all locomotion\r\nuntil the following evening, when we crossed the Han and reached the\r\nYöng-chhun ferry by a pretty road through a village and a wood, most\r\nattractive country, with many novelties in its flora. At the ferry a\r\nstill expanse of the Han is over 10 feet deep, but the roar of another\r\nrapid is heard immediately above. A double avenue of noble elms with\r\nfine turf underneath them leads to the town, a magistracy of 1,500\r\npeople, a quiet market-place without shops, situated in a rich farming\r\nbasin of alluvial soil, covered in May with heavy crops of barley and\r\nwheat, among which were fields hillocked for melons.\r\n\r\nThe magistracy buildings are large and rambling, with what has been\r\na fine entrance gate, with a drum and other instruments of aural\r\ntorture for making the deafening din with which the _yamen_ is closed\r\nand opened at sunrise and sunset. There are many stone tablets (not\r\nspontaneously erected) to worthy officials, a large enclosure in which\r\nsacrifices are offered to “Heaven” (probably to the Spirits of the\r\nLand), a Confucian temple, and a king’s pavilion, all very squalid and\r\nruinous.\r\n\r\nA crowd not altogether polite followed us to the _yamen_, where I\r\nhoped that some information regarding an overland route to the Diamond\r\nMountain might be obtained. On entering the _yamen_ precincts the\r\nunderling officials were most insolent, and it was only after enduring\r\ntheir unpleasant behavior for some time that we were conducted to a\r\nsqualid inner room, where a deputy-mandarin sat on the floor with\r\na smoking apparatus beside him, a man with a scornful and sinister\r\nphysiognomy, who took not the slightest notice of us, and when he\r\ndeigned to speak gave curt replies through an underling, while we stood\r\noutside the entrance, withstanding with difficulty the pressure of the\r\ncrowd, which had surged in after us, private interviews being rare in\r\nthe East. This was my last visit to a Korean _yamen_.\r\n\r\nAs we walked back to the town, the crowd followed us closely, led by\r\nsome “swells” of the literary class. One young man came up behind me\r\nand kicked me on the ankle, stepping back and then coming forward and\r\nrepeating the offense. He was about to give me a third kick, when\r\nMr. Miller turned round and very quietly, without anger, dealt him a\r\nscientific blow on the chest, which sent him off the road upon his back\r\ninto a barley field. There was a roar of laughter from the crowd, and\r\nthe young bully’s companions begged Mr. Miller not to punish him any\r\nmore. The crowd dispersed, the bullies, cowards like all their species,\r\nfell far behind, and we had a pleasant walk back to the ferry, where,\r\nalthough we had to wait a long time in the ferryboat, there was no\r\nassemblage, and the ferryman and passengers were very civil. Mr. Miller\r\nregretted the necessity for inflicting punishment. It was Lynch law no\r\ndoubt, but it was summary justice, and the perfect coolness with which\r\nit was administered would no doubt leave a salutary impression. The\r\nferryman told us that a tiger had carried off a pig from Yöng-chhun the\r\nprevious night, and said that the walk to our boat through the wood\r\nwithout lanterns was very unsafe. Our boatmen had become alarmed and\r\nwere hunting for us with torches. The circumstances were eerie, and I\r\nwas glad to see the lights.\r\n\r\nFerries are free. The Government provides the broad, strong boats\r\nwhich are used for ferrying cattle as well as people, and the villages\r\nprovide the ferrymen with food. Passengers who are not poor usually\r\ngive a small _douceur_.\r\n\r\nA gale of wind with torrents of rain set in that night, and the rain\r\ncontinued till the next afternoon, giving me an opportunity of seeing\r\nmore of the detail of the magnificent cliffs of laminated limestone,\r\nwhich occur frequently, and are the most striking geological features\r\nof the Han valley, continually presenting the appearance of the leaves\r\nof a colossal book. Above the Yöng-chhun rapid, on a steep and almost\r\ninaccessible declivity, buttressed by these cliffs, are the remains\r\nof a very ancient fortress, the outer wall of which, enclosing the\r\nsummit of the hill, is 2,500 feet in circumference, 25 feet high on the\r\noutside, from 1 to 12 feet on the inside, and from 9 to 12 feet thick.\r\nIt is so arranged that its two gates, which open on nearly direct\r\ndescents of 20 feet, and are approached by very narrow pathways, could\r\nonly admit one man at a time. It was obviously incapable of reduction\r\nby any force but starvation. No mortar is used in the walls, which\r\nare very efficiently built of small slabs of stone never more than 6\r\ninches thick. The people have no traditions of its construction, but\r\nMr. Miller, who is familiar with the fortresses of Nam-San and Puk-han,\r\nthinks that it is of a much earlier date than either. One of the signal\r\nfire stations is visible from this point on the river.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of May we began the descent of the Han. The worn-out ropes\r\nwere used for the cooking fire, the poles were stowed away, and paddles\r\ntook their place. The heavy rains had raised the river a foot, and\r\nchanged its bright waters into a turbid flood, down which we often\r\ndescended in two minutes distances which had taken two laborious hours\r\non the upward journey, flying down the centre of the stream instead of\r\ncrawling up the sides. Many small disasters occurred. Several times the\r\nboat was nearly swamped by heavy surges, or shivered by striking sunken\r\nrocks; or, losing steerage way, spun round and round, progressing\r\ndownwards with many gyrations, usually stern foremost, amidst billows\r\nand foam, but Kim, who was at his best on such occasions, usually\r\ncontrived to bring her to shore, bow on, at the foot of the rapid.\r\nOn one occasion, however, in a long rapid, in which the surges were\r\nhigh and strong, by some mismanagement, regarding which the boatmen\r\nquarrelled for an hour afterwards, the _sampan_ shipped such heavy seas\r\nfrom both sides as nearly to swamp her. I was all but washed off my\r\ncamp-bed, which was on a level with the gunwale; a number of sheets\r\nof geographical notes were washed away, some instruments belonging to\r\nthe R.G.S. were drowned in their box, more than forty photographic\r\nnegatives were destroyed, and clothing, bedding, and flour were all\r\nsoaked! The rapids were in fact most exciting, and their risks throw\r\nthose of the Fu and the Yangtze from Cheng-tu to Ichang quite into the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a delay of half a day at Tan-Yang, owing to a futile\r\nattempt to get _cash_ for silver, and another half-day spent in\r\nbeaching and repairing the boat, which had been badly bumped on a rock,\r\nwe did the distance from Nang-chhön to Ma-chai on the forks in four and\r\na half days, or less than a third of the time taken by the laborious\r\nascent.\r\n\r\nThe penniless situation became so serious that one day before reaching\r\nMa-chai I had to decide on returning to Seoul for _cash_! The\r\ntreasuries were said to be empty; no one believed in silver or knew\r\nanything about it, and supplies could not be obtained. Fortunately\r\nwe arrived at the market-place of Ma-Kyo, a village of 1,850 people,\r\non the market-day, and the pedlars gladly exchanged _cash_ for 35\r\nsilver _yen_ at the rate of 3,000, and would willingly have changed\r\n70. It took six men to carry the coin to the boat, which was once\r\nmore substantially ballasted. Ma-Kyo is the river port of Che-chön,\r\nand has an unusually flourishing aspect, boasting of many good houses\r\nwith tiled roofs. It exports rice, beans, and grain from the very rich\r\nagricultural country on both sides of the river, and imports foreign\r\ncottons, Korean sackcloth, and salt. Cotton in 20 _cash_ the measure of\r\n20 inches dearer at Ma-Kyo than in Seoul, and at Nang-chhön 70 _cash_\r\ndearer.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the forks at Ma-chai, the boatmen, who were tired of\r\nthe trip, wanted to go back, but eventually they were induced to fulfil\r\ntheir contract, and we entered the north branch of the Han on a cool,\r\nglorious afternoon, following on a night and morning of wind and rain.\r\nThis north branch also rises in the Keum-kang San or Diamond Mountain\r\nin the province of Kong-wön, and after a turbulent course of about\r\n98 miles unites with the southern and larger branch of the Han about\r\ntwo days’ journey from Seoul. For a considerable distance the country\r\nwhich it drains is populous and well cultivated, and the hills of its\r\nhigher reaches provide much of the timber which is used in Seoul, as\r\nwell as a large proportion of the firewood and charcoal. The timber is\r\nmade up into very peculiar rafts, which come down at high water, but\r\neven then are frequently demolished in the rapids. The river widens out\r\nabove Ma-chai, and for a considerable distance has an average breadth\r\nof 440 yards, but as a rule it is shallow, and its bottom dangerously\r\nrocky, and it has incessant rapids full of jagged rocks, some of which\r\nare very dangerous, and so “ugly” that as I went up them I was truly\r\nglad that I had not to descend them. Many a long, hard tug and broken\r\nhawser we had, but succeeded in hauling the _sampan_ 7 miles above the\r\nlimit of low water navigation, which is the same distance from the\r\ntermination of boat traffic at high water. I estimate the distance\r\nfrom Ma-chai to Ut-Kiri, where further progress was stopped by an\r\ninsurmountable rapid, at 76 miles, which took nine days, though Kim and\r\nhis man, anxious to go home, worked much harder than on our earlier\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days there are villages every quarter of a mile,\r\nand lateral and parallel valleys, then rich in clean crops of barley\r\nand wheat. The river villages are surrounded by groves of Spanish\r\nchestnut, mulberry, cherry, persimmons, and weeping willows. There are\r\ndeep crateriform cavities, now full of trees and abundant vegetation.\r\nThe hills are covered with oak scrub, affording cover for tigers,\r\nwhich appear to abound. The characteristics of the villages and the\r\nagriculture hardly vary from those on the south branch, except that the\r\npotato is more extensively grown. The absence of provincial and local\r\npeculiarities is a feature of Korea. An alley in Seoul may serve for a\r\nvillage street anywhere else.\r\n\r\nGold in small quantities is found along the river, and rumor says that\r\nUr-röp-so, a conical hill near the dangerous rapid of Chum-yöl, is\r\nrich in it, but that the district official prohibits digging. Higher\r\nup a number of men were washing for gold. Their apparatus consists of\r\na wooden sieve or gridiron, on which the supposed auriferous earth\r\nis placed above a deep wooden tray, and rocked under water till the\r\nheavier stuff passes through, to be again rocked in search of the\r\nglittering particles. The results are placed on the river bank in\r\npieces of broken pottery, each watched by a man. The earth is obtained\r\nby removing the heavy shingle of the river bank and digging up the\r\nsand to a depth of about 2 feet, when rock is reached. From 60 to 100\r\ntrays are equal to a bushel and a half, and the yield of this quantity\r\naverages half a thimbleful of gold in a state of fine subdivision.\r\nThese gold-washers seldom make more than 16s. per month, and only about\r\n50s. when working in the best goldfields.\r\n\r\nGold ornaments are rarely seen in Korea, gold is scarcely if at all\r\nused in the arts (if arts there are), and gold coins do not exist.\r\nNevertheless, as is shown by the Customs Reports, the quantity of gold\r\ndust exported, chiefly to Japan, is very far from being despicable,\r\nalthough the reefs which presumably contain the metal, of which the\r\nwashings are the proof, have not yet been touched. The fees paid by\r\nthe miners to the Government vary with the locality. Gold-digging\r\nwithout Government authorization is prohibited by law under most severe\r\npenalties. Among the richest goldfields in Korea are Phyöng Kang,\r\nnot far from the Han, and Keum-San in Phyöng-an Do, not far from the\r\nTai-döng. The larger washings collect as elsewhere the scum of the\r\ncountry, and riots often occur among the miners. I know not on which\r\nsubject the Korean is the more voluble, tigers or gold. He is proud\r\nof Korea as a gold-producing country, and speaks as if its dust were\r\ngolden sand!\r\n\r\nThe groves of Spanish chestnuts with which the North Han is fringed\r\ngave off an overpowering odor. Their fruit is an important article of\r\ndiet. Usually the arable land below the villages is little more than a\r\nterrace, but on the hillsides above the grain rippled in long yellow\r\nwaves in the breeze, and the hills constantly swing apart and reveal\r\nterraced valleys and brown orchard embowered hamlets; or slightly\r\nreceding, expose stretches of white sand or heaps of fantastic boulders.\r\n\r\nAfter two days of severe work we reached the beautifully situated town\r\nof Ka-phyöng, which straggles along the valley of a small tributary\r\nof the Han on slopes backed by high mountains which, following the\r\nusual Korean custom, are without names. The bright green of the wheat\r\nfields, varied by the darker green of clumps of conifers and chestnuts,\r\narranged as if by a landscape gardener, and the lines of trees along\r\nthe river bank were enchanting, but Ka-phyöng does not bear close\r\ninspection. The telegraph wire from Seoul to Wön-san crosses the\r\nriver at Sin-gang Kam, and there is actually a telegraph station at\r\nChun-chön, the most important town of that region, at which messages\r\nare received and sent about once a month!\r\n\r\nChun-chön is four miles from the Han on its left bank. It is fortified,\r\nand has nominally a garrison of 300 men. Having a population of 3,000,\r\nand being in the centre of a fine agricultural district, it is a place\r\nof some trade, as trade is understood in Korea. Just below it the Han,\r\nafter running for some distance below a lofty quartz ridge, makes an\r\nabrupt turn and penetrates it, the walls of the passage having the\r\nregularity of a railway cutting, while the bed of the stream is of pure\r\nwhite quartz.\r\n\r\nBeyond this singular gateway the river valley opens out, and the\r\nspectacle, rare in Korea, of cattle is to be seen. Indeed, I only once\r\nsaw cattle feeding elsewhere. The grass is coarse and sour, and hand\r\nfeeding is customary. It was most pleasant to be awoke in the dewy\r\nmorning by bellowing of cattle, shouts and laughter of boys and yelping\r\nof dogs, as bulls old and young were driven to the river bank to be\r\ntethered in the flowery grass. The frolicsome bull calves, which are\r\nbrought up in the Korean home, and are attended to by the children, who\r\nare their natural playmates, develop under such treatment into that\r\nmaturity of mingled gentleness and stateliness which is characteristic\r\nof the Korean bull,--the one grand thing remaining to Korea. When full\r\ngrown a bull can carry from 350 to 500 lbs. They are fed on boiled\r\nbeans, cut millet stalks, and cut pea haulm, and the water in which\r\nthe beans are boiled. They are led by a rope passed round the horns\r\nfrom a bamboo ring in the nose. The prevailing color is a warm red, and\r\nthe huge animal in build much resembles the shorthorn. The Korean cow,\r\nwhich is to be seen carrying loads in Northern Korea, is a worthy dam\r\nof such a splendid progeny.\r\n\r\nThe scenery, though always pretty, becomes monotonous after a few\r\ndays, and monotonous too were the adventures in the rapids, which were\r\ninnumerable, and the ceaseless toiling, dragging, and tugging they\r\ninvolved. Reaching Won-chön, a post station on the road to Wön-san,\r\nwe halted and engaged horses for a land journey, at a very high rate,\r\nbut they and their _mapu_ or grooms turned out well, and as Wong\r\nsententiously remarked, “If you pay well, you will be served well.” The\r\nagreement, which I caused to be put into writing, and which I made use\r\nof in other journeys, with much mutual satisfaction, was duly signed,\r\nand we continued the boat journey.\r\n\r\nAfter spending half a day at the prefectural town of Nang-chhön,\r\nwhere I am glad to record that the officials were very courteous, we\r\nascended the Han to a point above the wild hamlet of Ut-Kiri, on a\r\nsevere rapid full of jagged rocks. Ut-Kiri is above the head of low\r\nwater navigation, but in two summer months during the rains small boats\r\ncan reach Ku-mu-nio, “the last village,” 20 _li_ higher. It was a wild\r\ntermination of the long boat journey. An abrupt turn of the river,\r\nand its monotonous prettiness is left behind, and there is a superb\r\nmountain view of saddleback ridges and lofty gray peaks surrounding\r\na dark expanse of water, with a margin of gray boulders and needles\r\nof gray rock draped with the _Ampelopsis_, a yellow clematis, and a\r\nwhite honeysuckle. It was somewhat sad not to be able to penetrate the\r\ngrim austerity to the northward, but the rapids were so severe and the\r\nwater ofttimes so shallow that it was impossible to drag the _sampan_\r\nfarther, though at that time she only drew 2 inches of water. From\r\nMa-chai on the forks she had been poled and dragged up forty rapids,\r\nmaking eighty-six on the whole journey.\r\n\r\nFrom the thinly peopled solitudes of these upper waters we descended\r\nrapidly, though not without some severe bumps, to the populous river\r\nbanks, where villages are half hidden among orchards and chestnut and\r\nmulberry groves, and the crops are heavy, and that abundance of the\r\nnecessaries of life which in Korea passes for prosperity is the rule.\r\n\r\nTa-rai, a neat, prosperous place of 240 people, among orchards, and\r\nhillsides terraced and bearing superb crops, is an example of the\r\nriverine villages. Its houses are built step above step along the sides\r\nof a ravine, down which a perennial stream flows, affording water power\r\nfor an automatic rice hulling machine. For exports and imports the\r\nHan at high water is a cheap and convenient highway. The hill slopes\r\nabove the village, with their rich soil, afford space for agricultural\r\nexpansion for years to come. And not to dwell altogether on the\r\nmaterial, there is a shrine of much repute on a fork-like slope near\r\nthe river. It contains a group of _mirioks_, in this case stones worn\r\nby the action of water into the semblance of human beings. The central\r\nfigure, larger than life, may even to a dull imagination represent a\r\nperson carrying an infant, and its eyes, nose, and mouth are touched\r\nin with China ink. It is surrounded by Phallic symbols and _mirioks_,\r\nwhich may be supposed to represent children, and women make prayers\r\nand offerings in this shrine in the hope of obtaining a much coveted\r\nincrease in their families, for male children are still regarded as a\r\nblessing in Korea, and “happy is the man that hath his quiver full of\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nKa-phyöng again, a small prefectural town of 400 houses 1¹⁄₂ miles\r\nfrom the river, is a good specimen of the small towns of the Han\r\nvalley, with a ruinous _yamen_, of course, with its non-producing mob\r\nof hangers-on. It is on the verge of an alluvial plain, rolling up to\r\npicturesque hills, gashed by valleys, abounding in hamlets surrounded\r\nby chestnut groves and careful cultivation. The slopes above Ka-phyöng\r\nbreak up into knolls richly wooded with conifers and hard-wood trees,\r\nfringing off into clumps and groups which would not do discredit to the\r\nslopes of Windsor. The people of a large district bring their produce\r\ninto the town, and barter it for goods in the market. The telegraph\r\nwire to Wön-san crosses the affluent on which Ka-phyöng is built, and\r\nis carried along a bridle path which for some _li_ runs along the\r\nriver bank. Junks loaded 10 feet above their gunwales, as well as 4\r\nfeet outside of them with firewood, and large rafts were waiting for\r\nthe water to rise. Boats were being built and great quantities of the\r\nstrong rope used for towing and other purposes, which is made from a\r\n“creeper” which grows profusely in Central Korea, were awaiting water\r\ncarriage. Yet Ka-phyöng, like other small Korean towns, has no life or\r\ngo. Its “merchants” are but pedlars, its commercial ideas do not rise\r\nabove those of the huckster, and though poverty, as we understand it,\r\nis unknown, prosperity as we understand it is absent. There are no\r\nspecial industries in any of the riverine towns, and if they were all\r\nto disappear in some catastrophe it would not cause a ripple on the\r\nsurface of the general commercial apathy of the country.\r\n\r\nSimilar remarks apply to the prefectural town of Nang-chhön, where we\r\nagain wasted some hours, while Kim’s rice was first bargained for and\r\nthen cleaned. At that point there is a fine deep stretch of the river\r\n230 yards broad abounding in fish. From Nang-chhön we dropped down the\r\nHan to a deep and pretty bay on which the small village of Paik-kui Mi\r\nis situated, where we halted for Sunday, our last day in the _sampan_,\r\nwhich had been a not altogether comfortless home for five weeks and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] Class privileges are now abolished, on paper at least, but their\r\ntradition carries weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nKOREAN MARRIAGE CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nPaik-kui Mi was not without a certain degree of life on that Sunday.\r\nA _yang-ban’s_ steward impressed boats for the gratuitous carriage\r\nof tiles to Seoul, which caused a little feeble excitement among the\r\njunkmen. There was a sick person, and a _mu-tang_ or female exorcist\r\nwas engaged during the whole day in the attempt to expel the malevolent\r\ndæmon which was afflicting him, the process being accompanied by the\r\nconstant beating of a drum and the loud vibrating sound of large\r\ncymbals. Lastly, there was a marriage, and this deserves more than a\r\npassing notice, marriage, burial, and exorcism, with their ceremonials,\r\nbeing the outstanding features of Korea.[18]\r\n\r\nThe Korean is nobody until he is married. He is a being of no account,\r\na “hobbledehoy.” The wedding-day is the entrance on respectability and\r\nmanhood, and marks a leap upwards on the social ladder. The youth,\r\nwith long abundant hair divided in the middle and plaited at the back,\r\nwearing a short, girdled coat, and looking as if he had no place in\r\nthe world though he may be quite grown up, and who is always taken\r\nby strangers for a girl, is transformed by the formal reciprocal\r\nsalutations which constitute the binding ceremony of marriage. He has\r\nreceived the tonsure, and the long hair surrounding it is drawn into\r\nthe now celebrated “topknot.” He is invested with the _mangan_, a\r\ncrownless skullcap or fillet of horsehair, without which, thereafter,\r\nhe is never seen. He wears a black hat and a long full coat, and\r\nhis awkward gait is metamorphosed into a dignified swing. His boy\r\ncompanions have become his inferiors. His name takes the equivalent of\r\n“Mr.” after it; honorifics must be used in addressing him--in short,\r\nfrom being a “nobody” he becomes a “somebody.”\r\n\r\nA girl by marrying fulfils her “manifest destiny.” Spinsterhood\r\nin Korea is relegated to the Buddhist nunneries, where it has no\r\nreputation for sanctity. Absolutely secluded in the inner court of\r\nher father’s house from the age of seven, a girl passes about the\r\nage of seventeen to the absolute seclusion of the inner rooms of her\r\nfather-in-law’s house. The old ties are broken, and her husband’s home\r\nis thenceforth her prison. It is “custom.” It is only to our thinking\r\nthat the custom covers a felt hardship. It is needless to add that the\r\nyoung couples do not choose each other. The marriage is arranged by the\r\nfathers, and is consented to as a matter of course. A man gains the\r\nreputation of being a neglectful father who allows his son to reach\r\nthe age of twenty unmarried. Seventeen or eighteen is the usual age at\r\nwhich a man marries. A girl may go through the marriage ceremony as a\r\nmere child if her parents think an “eligible” may slip through their\r\nfingers, but she is not obliged to assume the duties of wifehood till\r\nshe is sixteen. On the other hand, boys of ten and twelve years of age\r\nare constantly married when their parents for any reason wish to see\r\nthe affair settled and a desirable connection presents itself, and the\r\nyellow hats and pink and blue coats and attempted dignity of these boy\r\nbridegrooms are among the sights of the cities.\r\n\r\nA go-between is generally employed for the preliminary arrangements.\r\nNo money is given to the bride’s father by the bridegroom, nor does\r\nthe daughter receive a dowry, but she is supplied with a large\r\n_trousseau_, which is packed in handsome marriage chests with brass\r\nclamps and decorations. There is no betrothal ceremony, and after the\r\narrangement has been made the marriage may be delayed for weeks or\r\neven months. When it is thought desirable that it should take place,\r\nbut not until the evening before, the bridegroom’s father sends a sort\r\nof marriage-contract to the bride’s father, who receives it without\r\nreplying, and two pieces of silk are sent to the bride, out of which\r\nher outer garments must be made for the marriage day.\r\n\r\nA number of men carrying gay silk lanterns bear this present to the\r\nbride, and on the way are met by a party of men from her father’s\r\nhouse bearing torches, and a fight ensues, which is often more than a\r\nmake-believe one, for serious blows are exchanged, and on both sides\r\nsome are hurt. Death has occasionally been known to follow on the\r\nwounds received. If the bridegroom’s party is worsted in the _melée_\r\nit is a sign that he will have bad luck; if the bride’s, that she\r\nwill have misfortunes. The night before the marriage the parents of\r\nthe bride and groom sacrifice in their respective houses before the\r\nancestral tablets, and acquaint the ancestors with the event which is\r\nto occur on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe auspicious day having been decided on by the sorcerer, about an\r\nhour before noon, the bridegroom on horseback, and in Court dress,\r\nleaves his father’s house, and on that occasion only a plebeian can\r\npass a _yang-ban_ on the road without dismounting. Two men walk before\r\nhim, one carrying a white umbrella, and the other, who is dressed in\r\nred cloth, a goose, which is the emblem of conjugal fidelity. He is\r\nalso attended by several men carrying unlighted red silk lanterns, by\r\nvarious servants, by a married brother, if he has one, or by his father\r\nif he has not. On reaching his destination he takes the goose from the\r\nhands of the man in red, goes into the house, and lays it upon a table.\r\n_Apropos_ of this emblem it must be observed that conjugal fidelity is\r\nonly required from the wife, and is a feminine virtue only.\r\n\r\nTwo women who are hired to officiate on such occasions lead the\r\nbride on to the veranda, or an estrade, and place her opposite the\r\nbridegroom, who stands facing her, but at some little distance from\r\nher. The wedding guests fill the courtyard. This is the man’s first\r\nview of his future wife. She may have seen him through a chink in the\r\nlattice or a hole in the wall. A queer object she is to our thinking.\r\nHer face is covered with white powder, patched with spots of red,\r\nand her eyelids are glued together by an adhesive compound. At the\r\ninstigation of her attendants she bows twice to her lord, and he bows\r\nfour times to her. It is this public reciprocal “salutation” which\r\nalone constitutes a valid marriage. After it, if he repudiates her, he\r\ncannot take another wife. The permanence of the marriage tie is fully\r\nrecognized in Korea, though a man can form as many illicit connections\r\nas he chooses. A cup of wine is then given to the bridegroom, who\r\ndrinks a little, after which it is handed to the bride, who merely\r\ntastes it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards within the house a table with a dainty dinner is set before\r\nthe husband, who eats sparingly. The bride retires to the women’s\r\nrooms, and the groom rejoices with his friends in the men’s apartments.\r\nThere is no simultaneous banquet. Each guest on arriving is supplied\r\nwith a table of food. Such a table, in the case of people of means,\r\ncosts from five to six _yen_ (from 10s. to 12s.), and a very cheap\r\nwedding costs seventy-five _yen_, so that several daughters are a\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the husband returns to his father’s house, and\r\nafter a time the bride, bundled up in a mass of wedding clothes, and\r\nwith her eyelids still sealed, attended by the two women mentioned\r\nbefore, some hired girls, and men with lanterns, goes thither also,\r\nin a rigidly closed chair, in the gay decorations of which red\r\npredominates. There she is received by her father and mother-in-law,\r\nto whom she bows four times, remaining speechless. She is then carried\r\nback to the house of her own parents, her eyelids are unsealed, and\r\nthe powder is washed from her face. At five her husband arrives, but\r\nreturns to his father’s house on the following morning, this process\r\nof going and returning being repeated for three days, after which the\r\nbride is carried in a plain chair to her future home, under the roof\r\nof her parents-in-law, where she is allotted a room or rooms in the\r\nseclusion of the women’s apartments.\r\n\r\nThe name bestowed on her by her parents soon after her birth is\r\ndropped, and she is known thereafter only as “the wife of so and so,”\r\nor “the mother of so and so.” Her husband addresses her by the word\r\n_yabu_, signifying “Look here,” which is significant of her relations\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nSilence is regarded as a wife’s first duty. During the whole of the\r\nmarriage day the bride must be as mute as a statue. If she says a\r\nword or even makes a sign she becomes an object of ridicule, and her\r\nsilence must remain unbroken even in her own room, though her husband\r\nmay attempt to break it by taunts, jeers, or coaxing, for the female\r\nservants are all on the _qui vive_ for such a breach of etiquette as\r\nspeech, hanging about the doors and chinks to catch up and gossip even\r\na single utterance, which would cause her to lose caste for ever in her\r\ncircle. This custom of silence is observed with the greatest rigidity\r\nin the higher classes. It may be a week or several months before the\r\nhusband knows the sound of his wife’s voice, and even after that\r\nfor a length of time she only opens her mouth for necessary speech.\r\nWith the father-in-law the law of silence is even more rigid. The\r\ndaughter-in-law often passes years without raising her eyes to his, or\r\naddressing a word to him.\r\n\r\nThe wife has recognized duties to her husband, but he has few, if any,\r\nto her. It is correct for a man to treat his wife with external marks\r\nof respect, but he would be an object for scorn and ridicule if he\r\nshowed her affection or treated her as a companion. Among the upper\r\nclasses a bridegroom, after passing three or four days with his wife,\r\nleaves her for a considerable time to show his indifference. To act\r\notherwise would be “bad form.” My impression is that the community\r\nof interests and occupations which poverty gives, and the embargo\r\nwhich it lays on other connections, in Korea as in some other Oriental\r\ncountries, produces happier marriages among the lower orders than\r\namong the higher. Korean women have always borne the yoke. They accept\r\ninferiority as their natural lot; they do not look for affection in\r\nmarriage, and probably the idea of breaking custom never occurs to\r\nthem. Usually they submit quietly to the rule of the _belle-mère_, and\r\nthose who are insubordinate and provoke scenes of anger and scandal\r\nare reduced to order by a severe beating, when they are women of the\r\npeople. But in the noble class custom forbids a husband to strike\r\nhis wife, and as his only remedy is a divorce, and remarriage is\r\ndifficult, he usually resigns himself to his fate. But if, in addition\r\nto tormenting him and destroying the peace of his house, the wife is\r\nunfaithful, he can take her to a mandarin, who, after giving her a\r\nsevere beating, may bestow her on a satellite.\r\n\r\nThe seclusion of girls in the parental home is carried on after\r\nmarriage, and in the case of women of the upper and middle classes is\r\nas complete as is possible. They never go out by daylight except in\r\ncompletely closed chairs. At night, attended by a woman and a servant\r\nwith a lantern, and with a mantle over her head, a wife may stir\r\nabroad and visit her female friends, but never without her husband’s\r\npermission, who requires, or may require, proof that the visit has\r\nbeen actually paid. Shopping is done by servants, or goods are\r\nbrought to the veranda, the vendors discreetly retiring. Time, which\r\namong the leisured classes hangs heavily on the hands, is spent in\r\nspasmodic cooking, sewing, embroidering, reading very light literature\r\nin _En-mun_, and in the never-failing resources of gossip and the\r\ninterminable discussion of babies. If a wife is very dull indeed,\r\nshe can, with her husband’s permission, send for actors, or rather\r\nposturing reciters, to the compound, and look at them through the\r\nchinks of the bamboo blinds. Through these also many Korean ladies have\r\nseen the splendors of the _Kur-dong_.\r\n\r\nWhen the Korean wife becomes a mother her position is improved. Girls,\r\nas being unable to support their parents in old age or to perform the\r\nancestral rites, are not prized as boys are, yet they are neither\r\nsuperfluous nor unwelcome as in some Eastern countries. The birth of a\r\ngirl is not made an occasion for rejoicing, but that of the firstborn\r\nson is, and after the name has been bestowed on him, the mother is\r\nknown as “the mother of so and so.” The first step alone of the first\r\nboy is an occasion for family jubilation. Korean babies have no\r\ncradles, and are put to sleep by being tapped lightly on the stomach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KOREAN LADY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] The notes on marriage customs which follow were given me by\r\nEnglish-speaking Koreans and were taken down at the time. They apply\r\nchiefly to the middle class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE KOREAN PONY--KOREAN ROADS AND INNS\r\n\r\n\r\nA gray and murky morning darkening into drizzle, which thickened into\r\na day’s pouring rain, was an inauspicious beginning of a long land\r\njourney, but the crawling up the north Han had become monotonous and\r\nchange and action were desirable. Being an experienced muleteer, I\r\nhad arranged the loads for each pony so equitably as to obviate the\r\nusual quarrel among the _mapu_ or grooms at starting! The men were not\r\nregular _mapu_, and were going chiefly to see the Diamond Mountain. One\r\nwas well educated and gentlemanly, and the bystanders jeered at them\r\nfor “loading like scholars.” They were a family party, and there were\r\nno disputes.\r\n\r\nMy first experience of the redoubtable Korean pony was not reassuring.\r\nThe men had never seen a foreign saddle and were half an hour in\r\ngetting it “fixed.” Though a pony’s saddle, it was far too large for\r\nthe creature’s minute body, the girths were half a yard and the crupper\r\nnearly a foot too long. The animal bit, squealed, struck with his fore\r\nand hind feet, and performed the singular feat of bending his back into\r\nsuch an inward curve that his small body came quite near the ground.\r\nThe men were afraid of him, and it was only in the brief intervals\r\nof fighting that they dared to make a dash at the buckles. It was\r\n“tight-lacing” that he objected to.\r\n\r\nThe Korean pony is among the most salient features of Korea. The breed\r\nis peculiar to it. The animals used for burdens are all stallions,\r\nfrom 10 to 12 hands high, well formed, and singularly strong, carrying\r\nfrom 160 to 200 lbs. 30 miles a day, week after week, on sorry food.\r\nThey are most desperate fighters, squealing and trumpeting on all\r\noccasions, attacking every pony they meet on the road, never becoming\r\nreconciled to each other even on a long journey, and in their fury\r\nignoring their loads, which are often smashed to pieces. Their savagery\r\nmakes it necessary to have a _mapu_ for every pony, instead of, as in\r\nPersia, one to five. At the inn stables they are not only chained down\r\nto the troughs by chains short enough to prevent them from raising\r\ntheir heads, but are partially slung at night to the heavy beams of the\r\nroof. Even under these restricted circumstances their cordial hatred\r\nfinds vent in hyena-like yells, abortive snaps, and attempts to swing\r\ntheir hind legs round. They are never allowed to lie down, and very\r\nrarely to drink water, and then only when freely salted. Their nostrils\r\nare all slit in an attempt to improve upon Nature and give them better\r\nwind. They are fed three times a day on brown slush as hot as they can\r\ndrink it, composed of beans, chopped millet stalks, rice husks, and\r\nbran, with the water in which they have been boiled. The _mapu_ are\r\nrough to them, but I never saw them either ill-used or petted. Dearly\r\nas I love horses, I was not able on two journeys to make a friend of\r\nmine. On this journey I rode a handsome chestnut, only 10 hands high.\r\nHe walked 4 miles an hour, and in a month of travelling, for much of\r\nit over infamous mountain roads, never stumbled, but he resented every\r\nattempt at friendliness both with teeth and heels. They are worth from\r\n50s. upwards, and cost little to keep.\r\n\r\nTheir attendants, the _mapu_, who are by no means always their owners,\r\nor even part owners, are very anxious about them and take very great\r\ncare of them, seeing to what passes as their comfort before their own.\r\nThe pack saddle is removed at once on halting, the animals are well\r\nrubbed, and afterwards thick straw mats are bound round their bodies.\r\nGreat care is given to the cooking of their food. I know not whether\r\nthe partial slinging of them to the crossbeams is to relieve their legs\r\nor to make fighting more difficult. On many a night I have been kept\r\nawake by the screams of some fractious animal, kicking and biting his\r\nneighbors as well as he was able, till there was a general plunging and\r\nsquealing, which lasted till blows and execrations restored some degree\r\nof order.\r\n\r\nAfter I mounted my steed, he trudged along very steadily, unless any of\r\nhis fellows came near him, when, with an evil glare in his eyes and a\r\nhyena-like yell, he rushed upon them teeth and hoof, entirely oblivious\r\nof bit and rider.\r\n\r\nA torrent of rain fell, and the day’s journey consisted in splashing\r\nthrough deep mud, fording swollen streams, because the bridges which\r\ncrossed them were rotten, getting wet to the skin, and getting\r\npartially dry by sitting on the hot floor of a hovel called an inn\r\nat the noonday halt, along with a steaming crowd of all sorts and\r\nconditions of men in clean and dirty white clothes.\r\n\r\nThe road by which we travelled is the main one from Seoul to the\r\neastern treaty port of Wön-san. It passes through rice valleys with\r\nabundant irrigation, and along the sides of bare hills. Goods and\r\ntravellers were not to be looked for in such weather, but there were\r\na few strings of coolies loaded with tobacco, and a few more taking\r\ndried fish and dried seaweed, the latter a great article of diet, from\r\nWön-san to the capital. _Pangas_, or water pestles for hulling rice,\r\nunder rude thatched sheds, were numerous. These work automatically,\r\nand their solemn thud has a tone of mystery. The machine consists of\r\na heavy log centred on a pivot, with a box at one end and a pestle at\r\nthe other. Water from a stream with some feet of fall is led into the\r\nbox, which when full tips over its contents and bears down one end of\r\nthe log, when the sudden rise, acting on the pestle at the other end,\r\nbrings it down with a heavy thud on the rice in the hollowed stone,\r\nwhich serves as a mortar. Where this simple machine does not exist the\r\nwork is performed by women.\r\n\r\nDenuded hillsides gave place to wooded valleys with torrents much\r\nresembling parts of Japan, the rain fell in sheets, and quite in the\r\nearly afternoon, on reaching the hamlet of Sar-pang Kori, the _mapu_\r\ndeclined to proceed farther, and there I had my first experience of a\r\nKorean inn. Many weeks on that and subsequent journeys showed me that\r\nthis abominable shelter, as I then thought it, may be taken as a fair\r\naverage specimen, and many a hearty meal and good sound sleep may be\r\nenjoyed under such apparently unpropitious circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere are regular and irregular inns in Korea. The irregular inn\r\ndiffers in nothing from the ordinary hovel of the village roadway,\r\nunless it can boast of a yard with troughs, and can provide\r\nentertainment for beast as well as for man. The regular inn of the\r\ntowns and large villages consists chiefly of a filthy courtyard full\r\nof holes and heaps, entered from the road by a tumble-down gateway. A\r\ngaunt black pig or two tethered by the ears, big yellow dogs routing in\r\nthe garbage, and fowls, boys, bulls, ponies, _mapu_, hangers-on, and\r\ntravellers’ loads make up a busy scene.\r\n\r\nOn one or two sides are ramshackle sheds, with rude, hollowed trunks in\r\nfront, out of which the ponies suck the hot brown slush which sustains\r\ntheir strength and pugnacity. On the other is the furnace-shed with the\r\noats where the slush is cooked, the same fire usually heating the flues\r\nof the _kang_ floor of the common room, while smaller fires in the same\r\nshed cook for the guests. Low lattice doors filled in with torn and\r\ndirty paper give access to a room the mud floor of which is concealed\r\nby reed mats, usually dilapidated, sprinkled with wooden blocks which\r\nserve as pillows. Farming gear and hat boxes often find a place on the\r\nlow heavy crossbeams. Into this room are crowded _mapu_, travellers,\r\nand servants, the low _residuum_ of Korean travel, for officials and\r\n_yang-bans_ receive the hospitalities of the nearest magistracy, and\r\nthe peasants open their houses to anybody with whom they have a passing\r\nacquaintance. There is in all inns of pretensions, however, another\r\nroom, known as “the clean room,” 8 feet by 6, which, if it existed, I\r\nobtained, and if not I had a room in the women’s quarters at the back,\r\nremarkable only for its heat and vermin, and the amount of _ang-paks_,\r\nbundles of dirty clothes, beans rotting for soy, and other plenishings\r\nwhich it contained, and which reduced its habitable portion to a\r\nminimum. At night a ragged lantern in the yard and a glim of oil in the\r\nroom made groping for one’s effects possible.\r\n\r\nThe room was always overheated from the ponies’ fire. From 80° to 85°\r\nwas the usual temperature, but it was frequently over 92°, and I spent\r\none terrible night sitting at my door because it was 105° within. In\r\nthis furnace, which heats the floor and the spine comfortably, the\r\nKorean wayfarer revels.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at an inn, the master or servant rushes at the mud, or\r\nsometimes matted, floor with a whisk, raising a great dust, which he\r\nsweeps into a corner. The disgusted traveller soon perceives that\r\nthe heap is animate as well as inanimate, and the groans, sighs,\r\nscratchings, and restlessness from the public room show the extent of\r\nthe insect pest. But I never suffered from vermin in a Korean inn, nor\r\nis it necessary. After the landlord had disturbed the dust, Wong put\r\ndown either two heavy sheets of oiled paper or a large sheet of cotton\r\ndressed with boiled linseed oil on the floor, and on these arranged my\r\ncamp-bed, chair, and baggage. This arrangement (and I write from twenty\r\nmonths’ experience in Korea and China) is a perfect preventative.\r\n\r\nIn most inns rice, eggs, vegetables, and a few Korean dainties, such\r\nas soup, vermicelli, dried seaweed, and a paste made of flour, sugar,\r\nand oil, can be procured, but tea never, and the position of the well,\r\nwhich frequently receives the soakage of the courtyard, precludes a\r\ncareful traveller from drinking aught but boiled water. At the proper\r\nseasons chickens can be purchased for about 4d. each, and pheasants\r\nfor less. Dog meat is for sale frequently in the spring, and pork\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\nThe charges at Korean inns are ridiculously low. Nothing is charged for\r\nthe room with its glim and hot floor, but as I took nothing for “the\r\ngood of the house,” I paid 100 _cash_ per night, and the same for my\r\nroom at the midday halt, which gave complete satisfaction. Travellers\r\nwho eat three meals a day spend, including the trifling gratuities,\r\nfrom 200 to 300 _cash_ per diem. Millet takes the place of rice in the\r\nnorthern inns.\r\n\r\nThe Korean inn is not noisy unless wine is flowing freely, and even\r\nthen the noise subsides early. The fighting of the ponies, and the\r\nshouts and execrations with which the _mapu_ pacify them, are the chief\r\ndisturbances till daylight comes and the wayfarers move on. Travelling\r\nafter dark is contrary to Korean custom.\r\n\r\nFrom this slight sketch, the shadows of which will bear frequent and\r\nmuch intensifying, it will be seen that Korean travelling has a very\r\nseamy side, that it is entirely unsuited to the “globe trotter,” and\r\nthat even the specialist may do well to count the cost before embarking\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nTo me the curse of the Korean inn is the ill-bred and unmanageable\r\ncuriosity of the people, specially of the women. A European woman had\r\nnot been seen on any part of the journey, and I suffered accordingly.\r\nSar-pang Kori may serve as a specimen.\r\n\r\nMy quarters were opposite to the ponies, on the other side of the foul\r\nand crowded courtyard. There were two rooms, with a space under the\r\nroof as large as either between them, on which the dripping baggage\r\nwas deposited, and Wong established himself with his cooking stove and\r\nutensils, though there was nothing to cook except two eggs obtained\r\nwith difficulty, and a little rice left over from the boat stores. My\r\nroom had three paper doors. The unwalled space at once filled up with\r\na crowd of men, women, and children. All the paper was torn off the\r\ndoors, and a crowd of dirty Mongolian faces took its place. I hung up\r\ncambric curtains, but long sticks were produced and my curtains were\r\npoked into the middle of the room. The crowd broke in the doors, and\r\nfilled the small space not occupied by myself and my gear. The women\r\nand children sat on my bed in heaps, examined my clothing, took out my\r\nhairpins and pulled down my hair, took off my slippers, drew my sleeves\r\nup to the elbow and pinched my arms to see if they were of the same\r\nflesh and blood as their own; they investigated my few possessions\r\nminutely, trying on my hat and gloves, and after being turned out by\r\nWong three times, returned in fuller force, accompanied by unmarried\r\nyouths, the only good-looking “girls” ever seen in Korea, with abundant\r\nhair divided in the middle, and hanging in long plaits down their\r\nbacks. The pushing and crushing, the odious familiarity, the babel of\r\nvoices, and the odors of dirty clothing in a temperature of 80°, were\r\nintolerable. Wong cleared the room a fourth time, and suggested that\r\nwhen they forced their way in again, they should find me sitting on\r\nthe bed cleaning my revolver, a suggestion I accepted. He had hardly\r\nretired when they broke in again, but there was an immediate stampede,\r\nand for the remainder of the evening I was free from annoyance. Similar\r\ndisplays of aggressive and intolerable curiosity occurred three times\r\ndaily, and it was hard to be always amiable under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Koreans travel enormously, considering that they seldom make\r\npilgrimages. The pedlars, who solely supply the markets, are always\r\non the move, and thousands travel for other reasons, such as the\r\ngatherings at ancestral tablets, restlessness, _ennui_, _ku-kyöng_ or\r\nsightseeing, visits to tombs, place-hunting, literary examinations,\r\nplace-keeping and attempting to deprive others of place, litigation,\r\nand business. The fear of tigers and dæmons prevents people from\r\njourneying by night, which is as well, as the bearers of official\r\npassports have the right to demand an escort of torchbearers from each\r\nvillage. If necessity compels nocturnal travel, the wayfarers associate\r\nthemselves in bands, swinging lanterns, waving torches, yelling, and\r\nbeating gongs. The dread of the tiger is so universal as to warrant the\r\nChinese proverbial saying, “The Korean hunts the tiger one half of the\r\nyear, and the tiger hunts the Korean the other half.” As I have before\r\nremarked, the mandarins and _yang-bans_, with their trains, quarter\r\nthemselves on the magistracies, and eat the fat of the land. Should\r\nthey be compelled to have recourse to the discomforts of an inn and\r\nthe food of a village, they appropriate the best of everything without\r\npaying for it. Hence the visit of a foreigner armed with a _kwan-ja_ is\r\nsuch an object of dread, that on this land journey I never let it be\r\nknown that I had one, and on my second journey discarded it altogether,\r\ntrusting in both to the reputation for scrupulous honesty which I at\r\nonce established with my men to overcome the repugnance which the\r\ninnkeepers felt to receiving me.\r\n\r\nThe roads along which the traveller rides or trudges, at a pace, in\r\neither case, of 3 miles an hour, are simply infamous. There are few\r\nmade roads, and those which exist are deep in dust in summer and in mud\r\nin winter, where they are not polished tracks over irregular surfaces\r\nand ledges of rock. In most cases they are merely paths worn by the\r\npassage of animals and men into some degree of legibility. Many of the\r\nstreams are unbridged, and most of the bridges, the roadways of which\r\nare only of twigs and sod, are carried away by the rains of early\r\nJuly, and are not restored till the middle of October. In some regions\r\ntraffic has to betake itself to fords or ferries when it reaches a\r\nstream, with their necessary risks and detentions. Even on the “Six\r\nGreat Roads” which centre in the capital, the bridges are apt to be\r\nin such a rotten condition that a _mapu_ usually goes over in advance\r\nof his horses to ascertain if they will bear their weight. Among the\r\nmountains, roads are frequently nothing else than boulder-strewn\r\ntorrent beds, and on the best, that between Seoul and Chemulpo, during\r\nthe winter, there are tracts on which the mud is from one to three\r\nfeet deep. These infamous bridle tracks, of which I have had extensive\r\nexperience, are one of the great hindrances to the development of Korea.\r\n\r\nAmong the worst of these is that part of the main road from Seoul to\r\nWön-san which we followed from Sar-pang Kori for two days to Sang-nang\r\nDang, where we branched off for the region known as Keum-Kang San,\r\nor the Diamond Mountain. The earlier part of this route was through\r\nwooded valleys, where lilies of the valley carpeted the ground, and\r\nover the very pretty pass of Chyu-pha (1,300 feet), on the top of which\r\nis a large spirit shrine, containing some coarsely painted pictures of\r\nmen who look like Chinese generals, the usual offerings of old shoes,\r\nrags, and infinitesimal portions of rice, and a tablet inscribed, “I,\r\nthe spirit Söng-an-chi, dwell in this place.” There, as at the various\r\ntrees hung with rags, and the heaps of stones on the tops of passes,\r\nthe _mapu_ bowed and expectorated, as is customary at the abodes of\r\ndæmons.\r\n\r\nMore than once we passed not far from houses outside of which the\r\n_mu-tang_ or sorceress, with much feasting, beating of drums, and\r\nclashing of cymbals, was exercising the dæmon which had caused the\r\nsickness of some person within. Portions of the expensive feast\r\nprepared on these occasions are offered to the evil spirit, and after\r\nthe exorcism part of the food so offered is given to the patient, in\r\nthe belief that it is a curative medicine, often seriously aggravating\r\nthe disease, as when a patient suffering from typhoid fever or\r\ndysentery is stuffed with pork or _kimshi_! Recently a case came under\r\nthe notice of Dr. Jaisohn (_So Chai pil_) in Seoul, in which a man,\r\nsuffering from the latter malady, died immediately after eating raw\r\nturnips, given him by the _mu-tang_ after being offered to the dæmons\r\nat the usual feast at the ceremony of exorcism.\r\n\r\nThere is much wet rice along the route, as well as dry rice, with a\r\ndouble line of beans between every two rows, and in the rice revel and\r\ncroak large frogs of extreme beauty, vivid green with black velvet\r\nspots, the under side of the legs and bodies being cardinal red. These\r\nappeared to be the prey of the graceful white and pink ibis, the latter\r\nin the intensified flush of his spring coloring.\r\n\r\nA descent from a second pass leads to the Keum-San Kang, a largish\r\nriver in a rich agricultural region, and to the village of Pan-pyöng,\r\nwhere they were making in the rudest fashion the great cast-iron pots\r\nused for boiling horse food, from iron obtained and smelted 33 _li_\r\nfarther north.\r\n\r\nOn two successive days there were tremendous thunderstorms, the\r\nsecond succeeded, just as we were at the head of a wild glen, by a\r\nbrief tornado, which nearly blew over the ponies, and snapped trees\r\nof some size as though they had been matchwood. Then came a profound\r\ncalm. The clouds lay banked in pink illuminated masses on a sky of\r\ntender green, cleft by gray mountain peaks. Mountain torrents boomed,\r\ncrashed, sparkled, and foamed, the silent woods rejoiced the eye by\r\nthe vividness of their greenery and their masses of white and yellow\r\nblossom, and sweet heavy odors enriched the evening air. On that and\r\nseveral other occasions, I recognized that Korea has its own special\r\nbeauties, which fix themselves in the memory; but they must be sought\r\nfor in spring and autumn, and off the beaten track. Dirty and squalid\r\nas the villages are, at a little distance their deep-eaved brown roofs,\r\nmassed among orchards, on gentle slopes, or on the banks of sparkling\r\nstreams, add color and life to the scenery, and men in their queer\r\nwhite clothes and dress hats, with their firm tread, and bundled-up\r\nwomen, with a shoggling walk and long staffs, brought round with a\r\nsemicircular swing at every step, are adjuncts which one would not\r\nwillingly dispense with.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the Paik-yang Kang, a broad, full river, an affluent of\r\nthe northern Han, with singularly abrupt turns and perpendicular cliffs\r\nof a formation resembling that of the Palisades on the Hudson River, we\r\ncrossed one of the great lava fields described by Consul Carles.[19]\r\n\r\nThis, which we crossed in a northeasterly direction, is a rough oval\r\nabout 40 miles by 30, a tableland, in fact, surrounded by a deep chasm\r\nwhere the torrents which encircle it meet the mountains. Its plateaux\r\nare from 60 to 100 feet above these streams, which are all affluents\r\nof the Han, and are supported on palisades of basalt, exhibiting the\r\nprismatic columnar formation in a very striking manner. In some places\r\nthe lava, which is often covered either with conglomerate or a stiffish\r\nclay, is very near the surface, and large blocks of it lie along\r\nthe streams. It is a most fertile tract, and could support a large\r\npopulation, but not being suited for rice, is very little cultivated,\r\nand grows chiefly oats, millet, and beans, which are not affected by\r\nthe strong winds.\r\n\r\nThere are two Dolmens, not far from the Paik-yang Kang. In one the\r\nupper stone is from 7 to 10 feet long, by 7 feet wide, and 17 inches\r\ndeep, resting on three stones 4 feet 2 inches high. The other is\r\nsomewhat smaller. The openings of both face due north.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Paik-yang Kang, there 162 yards wide and 16 feet\r\ndeep, by a ferryboat of remarkably ingenious construction, rendered\r\nnecessary by the fact that the long bridge over the broad stream was\r\nin ruins, and that the appropriation for its reconstruction had been\r\ndiverted by the local officials to their own enrichment, we entered\r\nthe spurs or ribs of the great mountain chain which, running north and\r\nsouth, divides Korea into two very unequal longitudinal portions at the\r\nvillage of Tong-ku.\r\n\r\nThe scenery became very varied and pretty. Forests clothed many of\r\nthe hills with a fair blossoming undergrowth untouched by the fuel\r\ngatherers’ remorseless hook; torrents flashed in foam through dark,\r\ndense leafage, or bubbled and gurgled out of sight; the little patches\r\nof cultivation were boulder-strewn; there were few inhabitants, and the\r\ntracks called roads were little better than the stony beds of streams.\r\nAs they became less and less obvious, and the valleys more solitary,\r\nour tergiversations were more frequent and prolonged, the _mapu_ drove\r\nthe ponies as fast as they could walk, the fords were many and deep,\r\nand two of the party were unhorsed in them, still we hurried on faster\r\nand faster. Not a word was spoken, but I knew that the men had _tiger\r\non the brain_!\r\n\r\nBlundering through the twilight, it was dark when we reached the lower\r\nvillage of Ma-ri Kei, where we were to halt for the night, two miles\r\nfrom the Pass of Tan-pa-Ryöng, which was to be crossed the next day.\r\nThere the villagers could not or would not take us in. They said they\r\nhad neither rice nor beans, which may have been true so late in the\r\nspring. However, it is, or then was, Korean law that if a village could\r\nnot entertain travellers it must convoy them to the next halting-place.\r\n\r\nThe _mapu_ were frantic. They yelled and stormed and banged at the\r\nhovels, and succeeded in turning out four sleepy peasants, who were\r\nreinforced by four more a little farther on; but the torches were too\r\nshort, and after sputtering and flaring, went out one by one, and the\r\nfresh ones lighted slowly. The _mapu_ lost their reason. They thrashed\r\nthe torchbearers with their heavy sticks; I lashed my _mapu_ with\r\nmy light whip for doing it; they yelled, they danced. Then things\r\nimproved. Gloriously glared the pine knots on the leaping crystal\r\ntorrents that we forded, reddening the white clothes of the men and\r\nthe stony track and the warm-tinted stems of the pines, and so with\r\nshouts and yells and waving torches we passed up the wooded glen in the\r\nfrosty night air, under a firmament of stars, to the mountain hamlet of\r\nupper Ma-ri Kei, consisting of five hovels, only three of which were\r\ninhabited.\r\n\r\nIt is a very forlorn place and very poor, and it was an hour before my\r\nparty of eight human beings and four ponies were established in its\r\nmiserable shelter, though even that was welcome after being eleven\r\nhours in the saddle.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] “Recent Journeys in Korea,” _Proceedings of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety_, May, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDIAMOND MOUNTAIN MONASTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day for the Pass of Tan-pa-Ryöng (1,320 feet above\r\nMa-ri Kei), the western barrier of the Keum-Kang San region. Mr.\r\nCampbell, of H.B.M.’s Consular Service, one of the few Europeans\r\nwho has crossed it, in his charming narrative mentions that it is\r\nimpassable for laden animals, and engaged porters for the ascent, but\r\nthough the track is nothing better than a torrent bed abounding in\r\ngreat boulders, angular and shelving rocks, and slippery corrugations\r\nof entangled tree roots, I rode over the worst part, and my ponies made\r\nnothing of carrying the baggage up the rock-ladders. The mountain-side\r\nis covered with luxuriant and odorous vegetation, specially oak,\r\nchestnut, hawthorn, varieties of maple, pale pink azalea, and yellow\r\nclematis, interspersed with a few distorted pines, primulas and lilies\r\nof the valley covering the mossy ground.\r\n\r\nFrom the spirit shrine on the summit a lovely panorama unfolds itself,\r\nbillows of hilly woodland, gleams of water, wavy outlines of hills,\r\nbacked by a jagged mountain wall, attaining an altitude of over 6,000\r\nfeet in the loftiest pinnacle of the Keum-Kang San. A fair land of\r\npromise, truly! But this pass is a rubicon to him who seeks the Diamond\r\nMountain with the intention of immuring himself for life in one of its\r\nmany monasteries. For its name, Tan-pa, “crop-hair,” was bestowed on\r\nit early in the history of Korean Buddhism for a reason which remains.\r\nThere those who have chosen the cloister emphasize their abandonment of\r\nthe world by cutting off the “topknot” of married dignity, or the heavy\r\nbraid of bachelorhood.\r\n\r\nThe eastern descent of the Tan-pa-Ryöng is by a series of zigzags,\r\nthrough woods and a profusion of varied and magnificent ferns. A long\r\nday followed of ascents and descents, deep fords of turbulent streams,\r\nvalley villages with terrace cultivation of buckwheat, and glimpses of\r\ngray rock needles through pine and persimmon groves, and in the late\r\nafternoon, after struggling through a rough ford in which the water was\r\nhalfway up the sides of the ponies, we entered a gorge and struck a\r\nsmooth, broad, well-made road, the work of the monks, which traverses a\r\nfine forest of pines and firs above a booming torrent.\r\n\r\nTowards evening “The hills swung open to the light”; through the\r\nparting branches there were glimpses of granite walls and peaks\r\nreddening into glory; red stems, glowing in the slant sunbeams, lighted\r\nup the blue gloom of the coniferæ; there were glints of foam from the\r\nloud-tongued torrent below; the dew fell heavily, laden with aromatic\r\nodors of pines, and as the valley narrowed again and the blue shadows\r\nfell the picture was as fair as one could hope to see. The monks,\r\nthough road-makers, are not bridge-builders, and there were difficult\r\nfords to cross, through which the ponies were left to struggle by\r\nthemselves, the _mapu_ crossing on single logs. In the deep water I\r\ndiscovered that its temperature was almost icy. The worst ford is at\r\nthe point where the first view of Chang-an Sa, the Temple of Eternal\r\nRest, the oldest of the Keum-Kang San monasteries, is obtained, a\r\ngreat pile of temple buildings with deep curved roofs, in a glorious\r\nsituation, crowded upon a small grassy plateau in one of the narrowest\r\nparts of the gorge, where the mountains fall back a little and afford\r\nBuddhism a peaceful shelter, secluded from the outer world by snow for\r\nfour months of the year.\r\n\r\nCrossing the torrent and passing under a lofty _Hang-Sal-Mun_, or\r\n“red arrow gate,” significant in Korea of the patronage of royalty,\r\nwe were at once among the Chang-an Sa buildings, which consist of\r\ntemples large and small, a stage for religious dramas, bell and tablet\r\nhouses, stables for the ponies of wayfarers, cells, dormitories, and a\r\nrefectory for the abbot and monks, quarters for servants and neophytes,\r\nhuge kitchens, a large guest hall, and a nunnery. Besides these there\r\nare quarters devoted to the lame, halt, blind, infirm, and solitary; to\r\nwidows, orphans, and the destitute.\r\n\r\nThese guests, numbering 100, seemed well treated. Between monks,\r\nservants, and boys preparing for the priesthood there may be 100 more,\r\nand 20 nuns of all ages, from girlhood up to eighty-seven years. This\r\nlarge number of persons is supported by the rent and produce of Church\r\nlands outside the mountains, the contributions of pilgrims and guests,\r\nthe moneys collected by the monks, who all go on mendicant expeditions,\r\neven up to the gates of Seoul, which at that time it was death for any\r\npriest to enter, and benefactions from the late Queen, which had become\r\nincreasingly liberal.\r\n\r\nThe first impression of the plateau was that it was a wood-yard on\r\na large scale. Great logs and piles of planks were heaped under the\r\nstately pines and under a superb _Salisburia adiantifolia_, 17 feet\r\nin girth; 40 carpenters were sawing, planing, and hammering, and 40\r\nor 50 laborers were hauling in logs to the music of a wild chant, for\r\nmendicant effort had been resorted to energetically, with the result\r\nthat the great temple was undergoing repairs, almost amounting to a\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nOf the forty-five monasteries and monastic shrines which exist in\r\nthe Diamond Mountain, enhancing its picturesqueness and supplying it\r\nwith a religious and human interest, Chang-an Sa may be taken as a\r\nfair specimen of the three largest, as it is undoubtedly the oldest,\r\nassuming the correctness of a historical record quoted by Mr. Campbell,\r\nwhich gives the date of its restoration by two monks, Yul-sa and\r\nChin-h’yo, as A.D. 515, in the reign of Pöp-heung, a king of Silla,\r\nthen the most important of the kingdoms, afterwards amalgamated as\r\nKorea.\r\n\r\nThe large temple is a fine old building of the type adapted from\r\nChinese Buddhist architecture, oblong, with a heavy tiled roof 48 feet\r\nin height, with wings, deep eaves protecting masses of richly-colored\r\nwood-carving. The lofty reticulated roof is internally supported on\r\nan arrangement of heavy beams, elaborately carved and painted in rich\r\ncolors. The panels of the doors, which serve as windows, and let in a\r\n“dim religious light,” are bold fretwork, decorated in colors enriched\r\nwith gold.\r\n\r\nThe roofs of the actual shrines are supported on wooden pillars 3\r\nfeet in diameter, formed of single trees, and the panelled ceilings\r\nare embellished with intricate designs in colors and gold. In one\r\nSakyamuni’s image, with a distinctly Hindu cast of countenance, and\r\na look of ineffable abstraction, sits under a highly decorative\r\nreticulated wooden canopy, with an altar before it, on which are brass\r\nincense burners, books of prayer, and lists of those deceased persons\r\nfor whose souls masses have been duly paid for. Much rich brocade,\r\nsoiled and dusty, and many gonfalons, hang round this shrine.\r\n\r\nThe “Hall of the Four Sages” contains three Buddhas in different\r\nattitudes of abstraction or meditation, a picture, wonderfully worked\r\nin gold and silks in Chinese embroidery, of Buddha and his disciples,\r\nfor which the monks claim an antiquity of fourteen centuries, and\r\nsixteen Lohans, with their attendants. Along the side walls are a host\r\nof dæmons and animals. Another striking shrine is that dedicated to\r\nthe Lord of the Buddhistic Hell and his ten princes. The monks call\r\nit the “Temple of the Ten Judges.” This is a shrine of great resort,\r\nand is much blackened by the smoke of incense and candles, but the\r\ninfernal torments depicted in the pictures at the back of each judge\r\nare only too conspicuous. They are horrible beyond conception, and\r\nshow a diabolical genius in hellish art, akin to that which inspired\r\nthe creation of the groups in the Inferno of the temple of Kwan-yin at\r\nTing-hai on Chusan, familiar to some of my readers.\r\n\r\nBesides the ecclesiastical buildings and the common guest-room, there\r\nare Government buildings marked with the Korean national emblem, for\r\nthe use of officials who go up to Chang-an Sa for pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to find accommodation, but eventually a\r\nvery pleasing young priest of high rank gave up his cell to me.\r\nUnfortunately, it was next the guests’ kitchen, and the flues from the\r\nfires passing under it, I was baked in a temperature of 91°, although,\r\nin spite of warnings about tigers, the dangers from which are by no\r\nmeans imaginary, I kept both door and window open all night. The cell\r\nhad for its furniture a shrine of Gautama and an image of Kwan-yin on\r\na shelf, and a few books, which I learned were Buddhist classics, not\r\nvolumes, as in a cell which I occupied later, full of pictures by no\r\nmeans inculcating holiness. In the next room, equally hot, and without\r\na chink open for ventilation, thirty guests moaned and tossed all\r\nnight, a single candle dimly lighting a picture of Buddha and the dusty\r\nand hideous ornaments on the altar below.\r\n\r\nAt 9 P.M., midnight, and again at 4 A.M., which is the hour at which\r\nthe monks rise, bells were rung, cymbals and gongs were beaten, and the\r\npraises of Buddha were chanted in an unknown tongue. A feature at once\r\ncheerful and cheerless is the presence at Chang-an Sa of a number of\r\nbright, active, orphan boys from ten to thirteen years old, who are at\r\npresent servitors, but who will one day become priests.\r\n\r\nIt is an exercise of forbearance to abstain from writing much about the\r\nbeauties of Chang-an Sa as seen in two days of perfect heavenliness.\r\nIt is a calm retreat, that small, green, semicircular plateau which\r\nthe receding hills have left, walling in the back and sides with rocky\r\nprecipices half clothed with forest, while the bridgeless torrent in\r\nfront, raging and thundering among huge boulders of pink granite,\r\nsecludes it from all but the adventurous. Alike in the rose of sunrise,\r\nin the red and gold of sunset, or gleaming steely blue in the prosaic\r\nglare of midday, the great rock peak on the left bank, one of the\r\nhighest in the range, compels ceaseless admiration. The appearance of\r\nits huge vertical topmost ribs has been well compared to that of the\r\n“pipes of an organ,” this organ-pipe formation being common in the\r\nrange; seams and ledges halfway down give roothold to a few fantastic\r\nconifers and azaleas, and lower still all suggestion of form is lost\r\namong dense masses of magnificent forest.\r\n\r\nAs I proposed to take a somewhat different route from Yu-chöm Sa\r\n(the first temple on the eastern slope) from that traversed by my\r\npredecessors, the Hon. G. W. Curzon and Mr. Campbell, I left the ponies\r\nand baggage at Chang-an Sa, the _mapu_, who were bent on _ku-kyöng_,\r\naccompanying me for part of the distance, and took a five days’ journey\r\nin the glorious Keum-Kang San in unrivalled weather, in air which was\r\nelixir, crossing the range to Yu-chöm Sa by the An-mun-chai (Goose-Gate\r\nTerrace), 4,215 feet in altitude, and recrossing it by the Ki-cho,\r\n3,570 feet.\r\n\r\nTaking two coolies to carry essentials, and a _na-myö_ or mountain\r\nchair with two bearers, for the whole journey, all supplied by the\r\nmonks, I walked the first stage to the monasteries of P’yo-un Sa and\r\nChyang-yang Sa, the latter at an elevation of about 2,760 feet. From it\r\nthe view, which passes for the grandest in Korea, is obtained of the\r\n“Twelve Thousand Peaks.” There is assuredly no single view that I have\r\nseen in Japan or even in Western China which equals it for beauty and\r\ngrandeur. Across the grand gorge through which the Chang-an Sa torrent\r\nthunders, and above primæval tiger-haunted forests with their infinity\r\nof green, rises the central ridge of the Keum-Kang San, jagged all\r\nalong its summit, each yellow granite pinnacle being counted as a peak.\r\n\r\nOn that enchanting May evening, when odors of paradise, the fragrant\r\nbreath of a million flowering shrubs and trailers, of bursting buds,\r\nand unfolding ferns, rose into the cool dewy air, and the silence\r\ncould be felt, I was not inclined to enter a protest against Korean\r\nexaggeration on the ground that the number of peaks is probably\r\nnearer 1,200 than 12,000. Their yellow granite pinnacles, weathered\r\ninto silver gray, rose up cold, stern, and steely blue from the\r\nglorious forests which drape their lower heights--winter above and\r\nsummer below--then purpled into red as the sun sank, and gleamed above\r\nthe twilight, till each glowing summit died out as lamps which are\r\nextinguished one by one, and the whole took on the ashy hue of death.\r\n\r\nThe situation of P’yo-un Sa is romantic, on the right bank of the\r\ntorrent, and is approached by a bridge, and by passing under several\r\nroofed gateways. The monastery had been newly rebuilt, and is one mass\r\nof fretwork, carving, gilding, and color, the whole decoration being\r\nthe work of the monks.\r\n\r\nThe front of the “Temple of the Believing Mind” is a magnificent\r\npiece of bold wood-carving, the _motif_ being the peony. Every part\r\nof the building which is not stone or tile is carved, and decorated\r\nin blue, red, white, green, and gold. It may be barbaric, but it is\r\nbarbaric splendor. There too is a “Temple of Judgment,” with hideous\r\nrepresentations of the Buddhist hells, one scene being the opening of\r\nthe books in which the deeds of men’s mortal lives are written.\r\n\r\nThe fifty monks of P’yo-un Sa were very friendly, and not impecunious.\r\nOne gave up to me his oven-like cell, but repaid himself for the\r\nsacrifice by indulging in ceaseless staring. The wind bells of the\r\nestablishment and the big bell have a melody in their tones such as\r\nI have rarely heard, and when at 4 A.M. bells of all sizes and tones\r\nannounced that “prayer is better than sleep,” there was nothing about\r\nthe sounds to jar on the pure freshness of morning. The monks are well\r\ndressed and jolly, and have a well-to-do air which clashes with any\r\npretensions to asceticism. The rule of these monasteries is a strict\r\nvegetarianism which allows neither milk nor eggs, and in the whole\r\nregion there are neither fowls nor domestic animals. Not to wound the\r\nprejudices of my hosts, I lived on tea, rice, honey water, edible\r\npine nuts, and a most satisfying combination of pine nuts and honey.\r\nAfter a light breakfast on these delicacies, the sub-abbot, took me to\r\nsee his grandmother, a very bright pleasing woman of eighty, who came\r\nfrom Seoul thirteen years ago and built a house within the monastery\r\ngrounds, in order to die in its quiet blessedness. There I had to eat\r\na second ethereal meal, and the hospitable hostess forced on me a pot\r\nof exquisite honey and a bag of pine nuts. These, the product of the\r\n_Pinus pinea_, which grows profusely throughout the range, furnish an\r\nimportant and nutritious article of monkish diet, and are exported in\r\nquantities as a luxury. They are rich and very oily, and turn rancid\r\nsoon after being shelled. The honey is also locally produced. The\r\nbeehives, which usually stand two together in cavities in the rocks,\r\nare hollow logs with clay covers mounted on blocks of wood or stone.\r\nLeaving this friendly hostess and the seven nuns of the nunnery behind,\r\nthe sub-abbot showed me the direction in which to climb, for road there\r\nis none, and at parting presented me with a fan.\r\n\r\nA visit to the Keum-Kang San elevates a Korean into the distinguished\r\nposition of a traveller, and many a young resident of Seoul gains this\r\nfashionable reputation. It is not as containing shrines of pilgrimage,\r\nfor most Koreans despise Buddhism and its shaven mendicant priests,\r\nthat these mountains are famous in Korea, but for their picturesque\r\nbeauties, much celebrated in Korean poetry. The broad backbone of the\r\npeninsula which has trended near to the east coast from Puk-chöng\r\nsouthwards has degenerated into tameness, when suddenly Keum-Kang San,\r\nor the Diamond Mountain, with its elongated mass of serrated, jagged,\r\nand inaccessible peaks, and magnificent primæval forest, occupying an\r\narea of about 32 miles in length by 22 in breadth, starts off from\r\nit near the 39th parallel of latitude in the province of Kang-wön.\r\nBuddhism, which, as in Japan, possesses itself of the fairest spots in\r\nNature, fixed itself in this romantic seclusion as early as the sixth\r\ncentury A.D., and the venerable relics of the time when for 1,000\r\nyears it was the official as well as the popular cult of the country\r\nare chiefly to be found in the recesses of this mountain region, where\r\nthe same faith, though now discredited, disestablished, and despised,\r\nstill attracts a certain number of votaries, and a far larger number\r\nof visitors and so-called pilgrims, who resort to the shrines to\r\nindulge in _ku-kyöng_, a Korean term which covers pleasure-seeking,\r\nsightseeing, the indulgence of curiosity, and much else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DIAMOND MOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\nSo far as I have been able to learn, there are only two routes by\r\nwhich the Keum-Kang San can be penetrated, the one which, after\r\nfollowing the bed of a singularly rough torrent, crosses the watershed\r\nat An-mun-chai, and on or near which the principal monasteries and\r\nshrines are situated, and the Ki-cho, a lower and less interesting\r\npass. Both routes start from Chang-an Sa. The forty-two shrines are the\r\nheadquarters of about 400 monks and about 50 nuns, who add to their\r\nreligious exercises the weaving of cotton and hempen cloth. The lay\r\nservitors possibly number 1,000. The four great monasteries, two on the\r\neastern and two on the western slope, absorb more than 300 of the whole\r\nnumber. All except the high monastic officials beg through the country,\r\nalms-bowl in hand, the only distinctive features of their dress being\r\na very peculiar hat and the rosary. They chant the litanies of Buddha\r\nfrom house to house, and there are few who deny them food and lodging\r\nand a few _cash_ or a little rice.\r\n\r\nThe monasteries are presided over by what we should call “abbots,”\r\nsuperiors of the first or second class according to the importance\r\nof the establishment. These _Chong-söp_ and _Sön-tong_ are nominally\r\nelected annually, but actually continue in office for years, unless\r\ntheir conduct gives rise to dissatisfaction. Beyond the confirmation\r\nof the election of the _Chong-söp_ of those monasteries which possess\r\na “Red Arrow Gate” by the Board of Rites at Seoul, the disestablished\r\nChurch appears to be quite free from State interference. In the case of\r\nrestoring and rebuilding shrines, large sums are collected in Seoul\r\nand the southern provinces, though faith in Buddhism as a creed rarely\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nOn making inquiries through Mr. Miller as to the way in which the\r\nnumber of monks is kept up, I learned that the majority are either\r\norphans or children whose parents have given them to the monasteries\r\nat a very early age owing to poverty. These are more or less educated\r\nand trained by the monks. It must be supposed that among the number\r\nthere are a few who escape from the weariness and friction of secular\r\nlife into a region in which seclusion and devotion are possible. Of\r\nthis type was the pale and interesting young priest who gave up his\r\nroom to me at Chang-an Sa, and two who accompanied us to Yu-chöm\r\nSa, one of whom chanted _Na Mu Ami Tabu_ nearly the whole day as he\r\njourneyed, telling a bead on his rosary for each ten repetitions. Mr.\r\nMiller asked him what the words meant. “Just letters,” he replied;\r\n“they have no meaning, but if you say them many times you will get to\r\nheaven better.” Then he gave Mr. Miller the rosary, and taught him the\r\nmystic syllables, saying, “Now, you keep the beads, say the words, and\r\nyou will go to heaven.” Among the younger priests several seemed in\r\nearnest. Others make the monasteries (as is largely the case with the\r\ncelebrated shrines of Kwan-yin on the Chinese island of Pu-tu) a refuge\r\nfrom justice or creditors, some remain desiring peaceful indolence, and\r\nnot a few are vowed and tonsured who came simply to view the scenery of\r\nthe Keum-Kang San and were too much enchanted to leave it.\r\n\r\nAs to the moribund Buddhism which has found its most secluded retreat\r\nin these mountains, it is overlaid with dæmonolatry, and like that of\r\nChina is smothered under a host of semi-deified heroes. Of the lofty\r\naims and aspirations after righteousness which distinguish the great\r\nreforming sects of Japan, such as the Monto, it knows nothing.\r\n\r\nThe monks are grossly ignorant and superstitious. They know nearly\r\nnothing of the history and tenets of their own creed, or of the\r\npurport of their liturgies, which to most of them are just “letters,”\r\nthe ceaseless repetition of which constitutes “merit.” Though some\r\nof them know Chinese, and this knowledge means “education” in Korea,\r\nworship consists in the mumbling or loud intoning of Sanscrit or\r\nTibetan phrases, of the meaning of which they have no conception. My\r\nimpression of most of the monks was that their religious performances\r\nare absolutely without meaning to them, and that belief, except among\r\na few, does not exist. The Koreans universally attribute to them gross\r\nprofligacy, of the existence of which at one of the large monasteries\r\nit was impossible not to become aware, but between their romantic and\r\nvenerable surroundings, the order and quietness of their lives, their\r\nbenevolence to the old and destitute, who find a peaceful asylum with\r\nthem, and in the main their courtesy and hospitality, I am compelled\r\nto admit that they exercise a certain fascination, and that I prefer\r\nto remember their virtues rather than their faults. My sympathies\r\ngo out to them for their appreciation of the beautiful, and for the\r\nway in which religious art has assisted Nature by the exceeding\r\npicturesqueness of the positions and decoration of their shrines.\r\n\r\nThe route from Chang-an Sa to Yu-chöm Sa, about 11 miles, is mainly\r\nthe rough beds of two great mountain torrents. Along this, in romantic\r\npositions, are three large monasteries P’yo-un Sa, Ma-ha-ly-an Sa, and\r\nYu-chöm Sa, besides a number of smaller shrines, with from two to five\r\nattendants each, one especially, Po-tok-am sa, dedicated to Kwan-yin,\r\npicturesque beyond description--a fantastic temple built out from the\r\nface of a cliff, at a height of 100 feet, and supported below the\r\ncentre by a pillar, round which a blossoming white clematis, and an\r\n_Ampelopsis Veitchiana_, in the rose flush of its spring leafage, had\r\nentwined their lavish growth.\r\n\r\nNo quadruped can travel this route farther than Chang-an Sa. Coolies,\r\nvery lightly laden, and chair-bearers carrying a _na-myö_, two long\r\npoles with a slight seat in the middle, a noose of rope for the feet,\r\nand light uprights bound together with a wistaria rope to support the\r\nback, can be used, but the occupant of the chair has to walk much of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nThe torrent bed contracts above Chang-an Sa, opens out here and there,\r\nand above P’yo-un Sa narrows into a gash, only opening out again at\r\nthe foot of the An-mun-chai. Surely the beauty of that 11 miles is not\r\nmuch exceeded anywhere on earth. Colossal cliffs, upbearing mountains,\r\nforests, and gray gleaming peaks, rifted to give roothold to pines and\r\nmaples, ofttimes contracting till the blue heaven above is narrowed to\r\na strip, boulders of pink granite 40 and 50 feet high, pines on their\r\ncrests and ferns and lilies in their crevices, round which the clear\r\nwaters swirl, before sliding down over smooth surfaces of pink granite\r\nto rest awhile in deep pink pools where they take a more brilliant\r\nthan an emerald green with the flashing lustre of a diamond--rocks and\r\nledges over which the crystal stream dashes in drifts of foam, shelving\r\nrock surfaces on which the decorative Chinese characters, the laborious\r\nwork of pilgrims, afford the only foothold, slides, steeper still, made\r\npassable for determined climbers by holes, drilled by the monks, and\r\nfitted with pegs and rails, rocks with bas-reliefs, or small shrines\r\nof Buddha draped with flowering trailers, a cliff with a bas-relief of\r\nBuddha, 45 feet high on a pedestal 30 feet broad, rocks carved into\r\nlanterns and altars, whose harsh outlines are softened by mosses and\r\nlichens, and above, huge timber and fantastic peaks rising into\r\n\r\n  The summer heaven’s delicious blue.\r\n\r\nA description can be only a catalogue. The actuality was intoxicating,\r\na canyon on the grandest scale, with every element of beauty present.\r\n\r\nThis route cannot be traversed in European shoes. In Korean string\r\nfoot-gear, however, I never slipped once. There was much jumping from\r\nboulder to boulder, much winding round rocky projections, clinging to\r\ntheir irregularities with scarcely foothold, and one’s back to the\r\ntorrent far below, and much leaping over deep crevices and “walking\r\ntight-rope fashion” over rails. Wherever the traveller has to leave the\r\ndifficulties of the torrent bed he encounters those of slippery sloping\r\nrocks, which he has to traverse by hanging on to tree trunks.\r\n\r\nOur two priestly companions were most polite to me, giving me a hand\r\nat the dangerous places, and beguiling the way by legends, chiefly\r\nBuddhistic, concerning every fantastic and abnormal rock and pool, such\r\nas the Myo-kil Sang, the colossal figure of Buddha referred to before,\r\na pothole in the granite bed of the stream, the wash-basin of some\r\nmythical Bodhisattva, the Fire Dragon Pool, and the bathing-places of\r\ndragons in the fantastic Man-pok-Tong (Grotto of Myriad Cascades), and\r\nthe Lion Stone which repelled the advance of the Japanese invaders in\r\n1592.\r\n\r\nBeyond the third monastery the gorge becomes wider and less fantastic,\r\nthe forest thinner, allowing scattered glimpses of the sky, and finally\r\nsome long zigzags take the traveller up to the open grassy summit of\r\nthe An-mun-chai, on which plums, pears, cherries, blush azaleas, and\r\npink rhododendrons, which had long ceased blooming below, were in\r\ntheir first flush of beauty. To the west the difficult country of the\r\nprevious week’s journey, gray granite, deep valleys, and tiger-haunted\r\nforest faded into a veil of blue, and in the east, over diminishing\r\nforest-covered ranges, gleamed the blue Sea of Japan, more than 4,000\r\nfeet below.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern descent there are gigantic pines and firs, some of them\r\nruthlessly barked, and the long dependent streamers of the gray-green\r\n_Lycopodium Sieboldii_ with which they are festooned, give the forest a\r\nfunereal aspect. Of this the peculiar fringed hats are made which are\r\nworn on occasion by both monks and nuns. After many downward zigzags,\r\nthe track enters another rocky gorge with a fine torrent, in the bed\r\nof which are huge “potholes,” shown as the bathing-places of dragons,\r\nwhose habits must have been much cleanlier than those of the present\r\ninhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\nThe great monastery of Yu-chöm Sa, with its many curved roofs and\r\ngeneral look of newness and wealth, is approached by crossing a\r\nvery tolerable bridge. The road, which passes through a well-kept\r\nburial-ground, where the ashes of the pious and learned abbots of\r\nseveral centuries repose under more or less stately monuments, was much\r\nencumbered near the monastery by great pine logs newly hewn for its\r\nrestoration, which was being carried out on a very expensive scale.\r\n\r\nThe monks made a difficulty about receiving us, and it was not till\r\nafter some delay, and the production of my _kwan-ja_, that we were\r\nallotted rooms in the Government buildings for the two days of our\r\nhalt. After this small difficulty, they were unusually kind and\r\nfriendly, and one of the young priests, who came over the An-mun-chai\r\nwith us, offered Mr. Miller the use of his cell on Sunday, saying that\r\n“it would be a quieter place than the great room to study his belief”!\r\n\r\nI had hoped for rest and quiet on the following day, having had rather\r\na hard week, but these were unattainable. Besides 70 monks and 20\r\nnuns, there were nearly 200 lay servitors and carpenters, and all were\r\nbent upon _ku-kyöng_, the first European woman to visit the Keum-Kang\r\nSan being regarded as a great sight, and from early morning till late\r\nat night there was no rest. The _kang_ floor of my room being heated\r\nfrom the kitchen, it was too hot to exist with the paper front closed,\r\nand the crowds of monks, nuns, and servitors, finishing with the\r\ncarpenters, who crowded in whenever it was opened, and hung there hour\r\nafter hour, nearly suffocated me, the day being very warm. The abbot\r\nand several senior monks discussed with Mr. Miller the merits of rival\r\ncreeds, saying that the only difference between Buddhists and ourselves\r\nis that they don’t kill even the smallest insect, while we disregard\r\nwhat we call “animal life,” and that we don’t look upon monasticism and\r\nother forms of asceticism as means of salvation. They admitted that\r\namong their priests there are more who live in known sin than strivers\r\nafter righteousness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMBSTONES OF ABBOTS, YU-CHÖM SA.]\r\n\r\nThere are many bright busy boys about Yu-chöm Sa, most of whom had\r\nalready had their heads shaved. To one who had not, Che-on-i gave a\r\npiece of chicken, but he refused it because he was a Buddhist, on which\r\nan objectionable-looking old sneak of a priest told him that it was all\r\nright to eat it so long as no one saw him, but the boy persisted in his\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, being awakened by the boom of the great bell and the\r\ndisorderly and jarring clang of innumerable small ones, I went, at the\r\nrequest of the friendly young priest, our fellow-traveller, to see him\r\nperform the devotions, which are taken in turn by the monks.\r\n\r\nThe great bronze bell, an elaborate piece of casting of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, stands in a rude, wooden, clay-floored tower by itself. A\r\ndim paper lantern on a dusty rafter barely lighted up the white-robed\r\nfigure of the devotee, as he circled the bell, chanting in a most\r\nmusical voice a Sanscrit litany, of whose meaning he was ignorant,\r\nstriking the bosses of the bell with a knot of wood as he did so. Half\r\nan hour passed thus. Then taking a heavy mallet, and passing to another\r\nchant, he circled the bell with a greater and ever-increasing passion\r\nof devotion, beating its bosses heavily and rhythmically, faster and\r\nfaster, louder and louder, ending by producing a burst of frenzied\r\nsound, which left him for a moment exhausted. Then, seizing the\r\nswinging beam, the three full tones which end the worship, and which\r\nare produced by striking the bell on the rim, which is 8 inches thick,\r\nand on the middle, which is very thin, made the tower and the ground\r\nvibrate, and boomed up and down the valley with their unforgettable\r\nmusic. Of that young monk’s sincerity, I have not one doubt.\r\n\r\nHe led us to the great temple, a vast “chamber of imagery,” where a\r\nsolitary monk chanted before an altar in the light from a solitary\r\nlamp in an alabaster bowl, accompanying his chant by striking a small\r\nbell with a deer horn. The dim light left cavernous depths of shadow\r\nin the temple, from which eyes and teeth, weapons, and arms and legs\r\nof otherwise invisible gods and devils showed uncannily. Behind the\r\naltar is a rude and monstrous piece of wood-carving representing the\r\nupturned roots of a tree, among which fifty-three idols are sitting\r\nand standing. As well by daylight as in the dimness of midnight, there\r\nare an uncouthness and power about this gigantic representation which\r\nare very impressive. Below the carving are three frightful dragons,\r\non whose faces the artist has contrived to impress an expression of\r\ntorture and defeat.\r\n\r\nThe legend of the altar-piece runs thus. When fifty-three priests come\r\nto Korea from India to introduce Buddhism, they reached this place, and\r\nbeing weary, sat down by a well under a spreading tree. Presently three\r\ndragons came up from the well and began a combat with the Buddhists,\r\nin the course of which they called up a great wind which tore up the\r\ntree. Not to be out-manœuvred, each priest placed an image of Buddha\r\non a root of the tree, turning it into an altar. Finally, the priests\r\novercome the dragons, forced them into the well, and piled great rocks\r\non the top of it to keep them there, founded the monastery, and built\r\nthis temple over the dragons’ grave. On either side of this unique\r\naltar-piece is a bouquet of peonies 4 feet wide by 10 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe “private apartments” of this and the other monasteries consist of a\r\nliving room, and very small single cells, each with the shrine of its\r\noccupant, and all very clean. It must be remembered, however, that this\r\neasy, peaceful, luxurious life only lasts for a part of the year, and\r\nthat all but a few of the monks must make an annual tramp, wallet and\r\nbegging-bowl in hand, over rough, miry, or dusty Korean roads, put up\r\nwith vile and dirty accommodation, beg for their living from those who\r\nscorn their tonsure and their creed, and receive “low talk” from the\r\nlowest in the land.\r\n\r\nJust before we left, the old abbot invited us into his very charming\r\nsuite of rooms, and with graceful hospitality prepared a repast for\r\nus with his own hands--square cakes of rich oily pine nuts glued\r\ntogether with honey, thin cakes of “popped” rice and honey, sweet\r\ncake, Chinese sweetmeat, honey, and bowls of honey water with pine nuts\r\nfloating on its surface. The oil of these nuts certainly supplied the\r\nplace of animal food during my enforced abstinence from it, but rich\r\nvegetable oil and honey soon pall on the palate, and the abbot was\r\nconcerned that we did not do justice to our entertainment. The general\r\nculture produced by Buddhism at these monasteries, and the hospitality,\r\nconsideration, and gentleness of deportment, contrast very favorably\r\nwith the arrogance, superciliousness, insolence, and conceit which I\r\nhave seen elsewhere in Korea among the so-called followers of Confucius.\r\n\r\nWhen we departed all the monks and laborers bade us a courteous\r\nfarewell, some of the older priests accompanying us for a short\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAfter descending the slope by the well-made road which leads down\r\nto the large monastery of Sin-kyei Sa, at the northeast foot of the\r\nKeum-Kang San, we left it for a rough and difficult westerly track,\r\nwhich, after affording some bright gleams of the Sea of Japan, enters\r\ndense forest full of great boulders and magnificent specimens of the\r\n_Filix mas_ and _Osmumda regalis_. A severe climb up and down an\r\nirregular, broken staircase of rock took us over the Ki-cho Pass,\r\n3,700 feet in altitude, after which there is a tedious march of some\r\nhours along bare and unpicturesque mountain-sides before reaching the\r\nwell-made path which leads through pine woods to the beautiful plateau\r\nof Chang-an Sa. The young priest had kept our baggage carefully, but\r\nthe heat of his floor had melted the candles in the boxes and had\r\nturned candy into molasses, making havoc among photographic materials\r\nat the same time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nALONG THE COAST\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Chang-an Sa for Wön-san we retraced our route as far as\r\nKal-rön-gi, and afterwards crossed the Mak-pai Pass, from which there\r\nis a grand view of the Keum-Kang San. Much of a somewhat tedious day\r\nwas spent in crossing a rolling elevated plateau bordered by high\r\ndenuded hills, on which the potatoe flourishes at a height of 2,500\r\nfeet. The soil is very fertile, but not being suited to rice, is very\r\nlittle occupied. Crossing the Sai-kal-chai, 2,200 feet in altitude,\r\nthe infamous road descends on a beautiful alluvial valley, a rich\r\nfarming country, sprinkled with hamlets and surrounded by pretty hills\r\nwooded with scrub oak, which in the spring is very largely used for\r\nfertilizing rice fields. The branches are laid on the inundated surface\r\ntill the leaves rot off, and they are then removed for fuel. In this\r\ninnocent-looking valley the tiger scare was in full force. A tiger, the\r\npeople said, had carried off a woman the previous week, and a dog and\r\npig the previous night. It seemed incredible, yet there was a consensus\r\nof evidence. Tigers are occasionally trapped in that region by baiting\r\na pit with a dog or pig, and the ensnared animal is destroyed by poison\r\nor hunger to avoid injury to the skin, which, if it is that of a fine\r\nanimal, is very valuable.\r\n\r\nA man is not the least ashamed of saying that he has not nerve or pluck\r\nfor tiger-hunting, which in Korea is a dangerous game, for the hunters\r\nare stationed at the head of a gorge, usually behind brushwood, and\r\nsometimes behind rocks, the big game, tigers and leopards, being driven\r\nup towards them by large bodies of men. When one realizes that the\r\narms used are matchlocks lighted by slow matches from cords wound round\r\nthe arm, and that the charge consists of three imperfectly rounded\r\nballs the size of a pea, and that, owing to the thickness of the screen\r\nbehind which the hunters are posted, the game is only sighted when\r\nquite close upon them, one ceases to wonder at the reluctance of the\r\nvillage peasants to turn out in pursuit of a man-eater, even though the\r\nbones bring a very high price as Chinese medicine.\r\n\r\nWe put up at the only inn in the region. It had no “clean room,” but\r\nthe landlord’s wife gave up hers to me on condition that I would not\r\nkeep the door open for fear of a tiger. The temperature was 93°, and\r\nto secure a little ventilation and yet keep my promise, I tore the\r\npaper off the lattice-work of the door. Mr. Miller described his\r\ncircumstances thus. “I wanted to sleep in the yard, but the host would\r\nnot let me for fear of tigers, so I had to sleep in a room 8 feet by\r\n10” (with a hot floor), “with seven other men, a cat, and a bird. By\r\ntearing the paper off a window near my head I saved myself from death\r\nby suffocation, and could have had a good night’s rest had not the\r\nfour horses been crowded into two stalls in the kitchen. They found\r\ntheir quarters so close that they squealed, kicked, bit, and fought\r\nall night, and their drivers helped them to make night hideous by\r\ntheir yelling.” Nobody slept, and I had my full share of the unrest\r\nand disturbance, a bad preparation for an eleven hours’ ride on the\r\nnext day, which was fiercely hot, as were the remaining six days of the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe road from this lofty tiger-haunted valley to the sea level at\r\nChyung-Tai is for the most part through valleys very sparsely peopled.\r\nMuch forest land, however, was being cleared for the planting of\r\ncotton, and the peasant farmers are energetic enough to carry their\r\ncultivation to a height of 2,000 feet. [On nearly the whole of this\r\njourney I estimated that the land is capable of supporting double its\r\npresent population.] At Hoa-chung, a prettily situated market-place,\r\na student who had successfully passed the literary examination at\r\nthe Kwagga in Seoul, surrounded by a crowd in bright colored festive\r\nclothing, was celebrating his return by sacrificing at his father’s\r\ngrave. On the various roads there were many processions escorting\r\nvillage students home from the great competition in the Royal presence\r\nat the capital, the student in colored clothes, on a gaily-caparisoned\r\nhorse or ass, with music and flags in front of him, and friends, gaily\r\ndressed, walking beside him. On approaching his village he was met\r\nwith flags and music, the headman and villagers, even the women in gay\r\napparel, going out to welcome him. After this success he was entitled\r\nto erect a tall pole, with a painted dragon upon it, in front of his\r\nhouse. Success was, however, very costly, and often hung the millstone\r\nof debt round a man’s neck for the remainder of his life. After\r\n“passing” the student became eligible for official position, the sole\r\nobject of ambition to an “educated” Korean.\r\n\r\nAt Hoa-chung we turned eastwards, and took the main road to the coast,\r\nattaining an altitude (uncorrected) of 3,117 feet by continued ascents\r\nover rounded hills, which, when not absolutely bare except for coarse,\r\nunlovely grasses, only produced stunted hazel bush. After this an easy\r\nascent among absolutely denuded hills leads up to a spirit shrine of\r\nmore than usual importance, crowded with the customary worthless _ex\r\nvotos_, rags and old straw shoes. At that point the road makes an\r\naltogether unexpected and surprising plunge over the bare shoulders of\r\na bare hill into Paradise!\r\n\r\nThis pass of the “Ninety-nine Turns,” Tchyu-Chi-chang, deserves its\r\nname, the number of sharp zigzags not being exaggerated, as in the\r\ncase of the “Twelve Thousand Peaks.” It is so absolutely rocky, and\r\nso difficult in consequence, that it is more passable in snow than in\r\nsummer. Its abrupt turns lead down a forest-clothed mountain ridge\r\ninto a magnificent gorge, densely wooded with oak, Spanish chestnut,\r\nweeping lime, _Abies excelsa_, and magnolia, looped together with the\r\nwhite _mille-fleur_ rose. On the northern side rises Hoang-chyöng San,\r\na noble mountain and conspicuous landmark, much broken up into needles\r\nand precipices, and clothed nearly to its summit with forests, of which\r\nthe _Pinus sylvestris_ is the monarch. The descent of the pass takes\r\none hour and a half, the road coming down upon a torrent 50 feet wide,\r\nonly visible in glints of foam here and there, amid its smothering\r\novergrowth of blossoming magnolia, syringa, and roses.\r\n\r\nThe filthy, miserable hamlet of Chyung-Tai, composed of five hovels,\r\nall inns, was rather a comfortless close to a fatiguing day. These\r\nhouses are roofed, as in some other villages, with thick slabs of wood\r\nheaped on each other, kept on, so far as they are kept on, by big\r\nstones. The forest above on the mountains is a Royal reservation, made\r\nso by the first king of this dynasty, who built stone walls round the\r\nlarger trees.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to notice at Chyung-Tai, and in many other places, the\r\nextreme voracity of the Koreans. They eat not to satisfy hunger, but\r\nto enjoy the sensation of repletion. The training for this enjoyment\r\nbegins at a very early age, as I had several opportunities of\r\nobserving. A mother feeds her young child with rice, and when it can\r\neat no more in an upright position, lays it on its back on her lap and\r\nfeeds it again, tapping its stomach from time to time with a flat spoon\r\nto ascertain if further cramming is possible. “The child is father to\r\nthe man,” and the adult Korean shows that he has reached the desirable\r\nstage of repletion by eructations, splutterings, slapping his stomach,\r\nand groans of satisfaction, looking round with a satisfied air. A\r\nquart of rice, which when cooked is of great bulk, is a laborer’s\r\nmeal, but besides there are other dishes, which render its insipidity\r\npalatable. Among them are pounded capsicum, soy, various native sauces\r\nof abominable odors, _kimshi_, a species of sour kraut, seaweed, salt\r\nfish, and salted seaweed fried in batter. The very poor only take two\r\nmeals a day, but those who can afford it take three and four.\r\n\r\nIn this respect of voracity all classes are alike. The great merit of a\r\nmeal is not so much quality as quantity, and from infancy onwards one\r\nobject in life is to give the stomach as much capacity and elasticity\r\nas is possible, so that four pounds of rice daily may not incommode it.\r\nPeople in easy circumstances drink wine and eat great quantities of\r\nfruit, nuts, and confectionery in the intervals between meals, yet are\r\nas ready to tackle the next food as though they had been starving for a\r\nweek. In well-to-do houses beef and dog are served on large trenchers,\r\nand as each guest has his separate table, a host can show generosity\r\nto this or that special friend without helping others to more than is\r\nnecessary. I have seen Koreans eat more than three pounds of solid meat\r\nat one meal. Large as a “portion” is, it is not unusual to see a Korean\r\neat three and even four, and where people abstain from these excesses\r\nit may generally be assumed that they are too poor to indulge in them.\r\nIt is quite common to see from twenty to twenty-five peaches or small\r\nmelons disappear at a single sitting, and without being peeled. There\r\ncan be no doubt that the enormous consumption of red pepper, which is\r\nsupplied even to infants, helps this gluttonous style of eating. It is\r\nnot surprising that dyspepsia and kindred evils are very common among\r\nKoreans.\r\n\r\nThe Korean is omnivorous. Dog meat is in great request at certain\r\nseasons, and dogs are extensively bred for the table. Pork, beef,\r\nfish, raw, dried, and salted, the intestines of animals, all birds and\r\ngame, no part being rejected, are eaten--a baked fowl, with its head,\r\nclaws, and interior intact, being the equivalent of “the fatted calf.”\r\nCooking is not always essential. On the Han I saw men taking fish off\r\nthe hook, and after plunging them into a pot of red pepper sauce,\r\neating them at once with their bones. Wheat, barley, maize, millet, the\r\nIrish and sweet potato, oats, peas, beans, rice, radishes, turnips,\r\nherbs, and wild leaves and roots innumerable, seaweed, shrimps, pastry\r\nmade of flour, sugar, and oil, _kimshi_, on the making of which the\r\nwhole female population of the middle and lower classes is engaged in\r\nNovember, a homemade vermicelli of buckwheat flour and white of egg,\r\nlargely made up into a broth, soups, dried persimmons, sponge-cakes,\r\ncakes of the edible pine nut and honey, of flour, sugar, and sesamum\r\nseeds, onions, garlic, lily bulbs, chestnuts, and very much else are\r\neaten. Oil of sesamum is largely used in cooking, as well as vinegar,\r\nsoy, and other sauces of pungent and objectionable odors, the basis of\r\nmost of them being capsicums and fermented rotten beans!\r\n\r\nThe magistracy of Thong-chhön, where we halted the next day at noon,\r\nand where the curiosity of the people was absolutely _suffocating_,\r\nis a town sheltered from the sea, which is within 2 miles, by a high\r\nridge, and is situated prettily in a double fold of hills remarkable\r\nfor the artistic natural grouping of very grand pines.\r\n\r\nAt this point a spell of the most severe heat of the year set in, and\r\nthe remainder of the journey was accomplished in a temperature ranging\r\nfrom 89° to 100° in the shade, and seldom falling below 80° at night,\r\nphenomenal heat for the first days of June. Taking advantage of it, the\r\nwhole male population was in the fields rice planting. Rice valleys,\r\nreaching the unusual magnitude for Korea of from 3 to 7 miles in\r\nbreadth, and from 6 to 14 miles in length, sloping gently to the sea,\r\nwith innumerable villages on the slopes of the hills which surround\r\nthem, were numerous. Among them I saw, for the only time, reservoirs\r\nfor the storage of water for irrigation. The pink ibis and the spotted\r\ngreen frog were abundant everywhere. The country there has a look of\r\npassable prosperity, but the people are kept at a low level by official\r\nexactions.\r\n\r\nOn this coast of Kong-wön-Do are the P’al-kyöng or “Eight Views,” which\r\nare of much repute in Korea. We passed two of them. Su-chung Dai (The\r\nPlace Between the Waters) is a narrow strip of elevated white sand with\r\nthe long roll of the Pacific on the east, and the gentle plash of a\r\nlovely fresh-water lake on the west. This lake of Ma-cha Töng, the only\r\nbody of fresh water which I saw in Korea, about 6 miles in length by 2\r\nin breadth, has mountainous shores much broken by bays and inlets, at\r\nthe head of each of which is a village half hidden among trees in the\r\nfolds of the hills, while wooded conical islets break the mirror of the\r\nsurface. On the white barrier of sand there are some fine specimens\r\nof the red-stemmed _Pinus sylvestris_, with a carpet of dwarf crimson\r\nroses and pink lilies. Among the mountain forests are leopards, tigers,\r\nand deer, and the call of the pheasant and the cooing of the wild dove\r\nfloated sweetly from the lake shore. It was an idyll of peace and\r\nbeauty. The other of the “Eight Views” is rather a curiosity than a\r\nbeauty, miles of cream-colored sand blown up in wavy billows as high as\r\nthe plumy tops of thousands of fir trees which are helplessly embedded\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nDuring the long hot ride of eleven hours, visions of the evening halt\r\nat a peaceful village on the seashore filled my mind, and hope made the\r\ntoilsome climb over several promontories of black basalt tolerable,\r\neven though the descents were so steep that the _mapu_ held the ponies\r\nup by their tails! In the early twilight, when the fierce sun blaze was\r\nover, in the smoky redness of a heated evening atmosphere, when every\r\nrock was giving forth the heat it had absorbed in the day, across the\r\nstream which is at once the outlet of the lake and the boundary between\r\nthe provinces of Kang-wön and Ham-gyöng, appeared a large, straggling,\r\ngray-roofed village, above high-water mark, on a beach of white sand.\r\nSeveral fishing junks were lying in shelter at the mouth of the stream.\r\nWomen were beating clothes and drawing water, and children and dogs\r\nwere rolling over each other on the sand, all more or less idealized by\r\nbeing silhouetted in purple against the hot, lurid sky.\r\n\r\nAs the enchantment of distance faded and Ma-cha Töng revealed itself\r\nin plain prose, fading from purple into sober gray, the ideal of a\r\nromantic halt by the pure sea vanished. A long, crooked, tumble-down\r\nnarrow street, with narrower off-shoots, heaps of fish offal and\r\nrubbish, in which swine, mangy, blear-eyed dogs, and children, much\r\nafflicted with skin disease, were indiscriminately routing and rolling,\r\npools covered with a thick brown scum, a stream which had degenerated\r\ninto an open sewer, down which thick green slime flowed tardily,\r\na beach of white sand, the upper part of which was blackened with\r\nfish laid out to dry, frames for drying fish everywhere, men, women,\r\nchildren, all as dirty in person and clothing as it was possible to be,\r\nthronging the roadway as we approached, air laden with insupportable\r\nodors, and the vilest accommodation I ever had in Korea, have fixed\r\nthis night in my memory.\r\n\r\nThe inn, if inn it was, gave me a room 8 feet by 6, and 5 feet 2 inches\r\nhigh. _Ang-paks_, for it was the family granary, iron shoes of ploughs\r\nand spades, bundles of foul rags, seaweed, ears of millet hanging in\r\nbunches from the roof, pack saddles, and worse than all else, rotten\r\nbeans fermenting for soy, and malodorous half-salted fish, just left\r\nroom for my camp-bed. This den opened on a vile yard, partly dunghill\r\nand partly pigpen, in which is the well from which the women of the\r\nhouse, with sublime _sang-froid_, draw the drinking water! Outside is a\r\nswamp, which throughout the night gave off sickening odors. Every few\r\nminutes something was wanted from my room, and as there was not room\r\nfor two, I had every time to go out into the yard. Wong’s good-night\r\nwas, “I hope you won’t die.” When I entered, the mercury was 87°. After\r\nthat, cooking for man and beast and the _kang_ floor raised it to 107°,\r\nat which point it stood till morning, vivifying into revoltingly active\r\nlife myriads of cockroaches and vermin which revel in heat, not to\r\nspeak of rats, which ran over my bed, ate my candle, gnawed my straps,\r\nand would have left me without boots, had I not long before learned to\r\nhang them from the tripod of my camera. From nine years of travelling,\r\nsome of it very severe and comfortless, that night stands out as\r\nhideously memorable.\r\n\r\nThe _raison d’être_ of Ma-cha Töng, and the numerous coast villages\r\nwhich exist wherever a convenient shore and a protection for boats\r\noccur together, is the coast fishing. The fact that a floating\r\npopulation of over 8,000 Japanese fishermen make a living by fishing\r\non the coast near Fusan shows that there is a redundant harvest to be\r\nreaped. The Korean fisherman is credited with utter want of enterprise,\r\nand Mr. Oiesen, in the Customs’ report for Wön-san for 1891, accuses\r\nhim of “remaining content with such fish as will run into crudely\r\nand easily constructed traps, set out along the shore, which only\r\nrequire attention for an hour or so each day.” I must, however, say\r\nthat each village that I passed possessed from seven to twelve fishing\r\njunks, which were kept at sea. They are unseaworthy boats, and it is\r\nnot surprising that they hug the shore. I believe that the fishing\r\nindustry, with every other, is paralyzed by the complete insecurity of\r\nthe earnings of labor and by the exactions of officials, and that the\r\nKorean fisherman does not care to earn money of which he will surely be\r\ndeprived on any or no pretence, and that, along with the members of the\r\nindustrial classes generally, he seeks the protection of poverty.\r\n\r\nThe fish taken on this coast, when salted and dried, find their way\r\nby boat to Wön-san, and from thence over central Korea, but in winter\r\npedlars carry them directly inland from the fishing villages. Salterns\r\non the plan of those often seen in China occur frequently near the\r\nvillages. The operation of making salt from sea water is absolutely\r\nprimitive, and so rough and dirty that the whiteness of the coarse\r\nproduct which results is an astonishment. In spite of heavy losses and\r\nheavier “squeezings,” this industry, which is carried on from May to\r\nOctober, is a profitable one.\r\n\r\nThe road beyond that noisome halting-place traverses picturesque\r\ncountry for many miles, being cut out of the sides of noble cliffs,\r\nor crosses basaltic spurs by arrangements resembling rock ladders,\r\nkeeping perforce always close to the sea, now on dizzy precipices,\r\nthen descending to firm hard stretches of golden sand, or winding just\r\nabove high-water mark among colossal boulders which are completely\r\ncovered with the _Ampelopsis Veitchiana_, the creeper _par excellence_\r\nof Korea. The sea was green and violet near the shore and a vivid blue\r\nin the distance, and on its rippleless surface fishing boats with gray\r\nhulls and brown sails lay motionless, for the rush and swirl of tides,\r\nrising and falling as they do on the west coast from 25 to 38 feet, are\r\nunknown on the east coast, the variation between high and low water\r\nbeing within 18 inches.\r\n\r\nIt was the hottest day of the year, and it was fortunate that the\r\nprettily situated market-place of Syo-im had a new and clean inn, in\r\nwhich it was possible to prolong the noonday halt, and to get a good\r\ndinner of fresh and salt fish, vegetables, herbs, sauces, and rice, for\r\nthe sum of two cents gold. There also, being the market-day, Mr. Miller\r\nsucceeded in obtaining _cash_ for four silver _yen_ from the pedlars.\r\n\r\nAfter passing over a tedious sandy plain with a reserve of fine firs,\r\nunder which the countless dead of ages lie under great sand mounds held\r\ntogether by nets or branches of trees, we reached at sunset my ideal,\r\na clean, exquisitely situated village of nine houses, of which one was\r\nan inn where, contrary to the general rule, we were made cordially\r\nwelcome.[20] The nine families at Chin-pul possessed seven good-sized\r\nfishing boats.\r\n\r\nThat inn is of unusual construction. There is a broad mud platform of\r\nwhich fireplaces and utensils for cooking for man and beast occupy one\r\nhalf, and the other is matted for sleeping and eating. My room, which\r\nhad no window, but was clean and plastered, opened on this, and as\r\nthe mercury was at 111° until 3 A.M. owing to the heated floor, I sat\r\nat the door nearly all night, so the dawn and an early start, and the\r\ncoolness of the green and violet shades of the almost rippleless ocean,\r\nwhich laved its varied shore of bays, promontories, and lofty cliffs,\r\nwere very welcome.\r\n\r\nA valley opening on the sea which it took five hours to skirt and\r\ncross, covered with grain and newly planted rice, is literally fringed\r\nwith villages, which look comfortably prosperous in spite of exactions.\r\nA smaller valley contains about 3,000 acres of rice land only, and\r\non the slopes surrounding all these are rich lands, bearing heavy\r\ncrops of wheat, millet, barley, cotton, tobacco, castor oil, sesamum,\r\noats, turnips, peas, beans, and potatoes. The ponies are larger and\r\nbetter kept in that region, and the red bulls are of immense size.\r\nThe black pig, however, is as small and mean as ever. The crops were\r\nclean, and the rice dykes and irrigation channels well kept. Good and\r\nhonest government would create as happy and prosperous a people as the\r\ntraveller finds in Japan, the soil being very similar, while Korea has\r\na far better climate.\r\n\r\nDuring the land journey from Chang-an Sa to Wön-san I had better\r\nopportunities of seeing the agricultural methods of the Koreans than\r\nin the valleys of the Han. As compared with the exquisite neatness\r\nof the Japanese and the diligent thriftiness of the Chinese, Korean\r\nagriculture is to some extent wasteful and untidy. Weeds are not kept\r\ndown in the summer as they ought to be, stones are often left on the\r\nground, and there is a raggedness about the margins of fields and dykes\r\nand a dilapidation about stone walls which is unpleasing to the eye.\r\nThe paths through the fields are apt to be much worn and fringed with\r\nweeds, and the furrows are not so straight as they might be. Yet on the\r\nwhole the cultivation is much better and the majority of the crops far\r\ncleaner than I had been led to expect. Domestic animals are very few,\r\nand very little fertilizing material is applied to the ground except\r\nin the neighborhood of Seoul and other cities, a fact which makes its\r\nexceeding fertility very noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall is abundant but not excessive, and the desolating floods\r\nwhich afflict Korea’s opposite neighbor, Japan, are as unknown as\r\nearthquakes. Irrigation is only necessary for rice, which is the staple\r\nof Korea. Except on certain rice lands, two crops a year are raised\r\nthroughout central and southern Korea, the rice being planted in June,\r\nor rather transplanted from the nurseries in which it is sown in May,\r\nand is harvested early in October, when the ground is ploughed and\r\nbarley or rye is sown, which ripens in May or early June of the next\r\nyear, after which water is let in, the field is again ploughed while\r\nflooded, and the rice plants are set out in rows of “clumps,” two or\r\nfour or even six plants in a “clump.” Where only one crop is raised,\r\nthe rice field lies fallow from the end of October till the following\r\nMay. In wheat, barley, or rye fields the sowing is in October, and the\r\nharvest in May or June, after which beans, peas, and other vegetables\r\nare sown. Along the “great roads,” as the crops approach ripeness,\r\nelevated watch-sheds are erected in the fields as safeguards against\r\ndepredations. The crops, on the whole, are very fine, and would be\r\nimmense were it not for the paucity of fertilizing material.\r\n\r\nAgricultural implements are rude and few. A wooden ploughshare with a\r\nremovable iron shoe is used which turns the furrows the reverse way to\r\nours. A wooden spade, also shod with iron, is largely used for heavy\r\nwork. This, which excites the ridicule of foreigners as a gratuitous\r\nwaste of man power, is furnished with several ropes attached to the\r\nblade, each of which is jerked by a man while another man guides the\r\nblade into the ground by its long handle. The other implements are the\r\nsame sort of sharp-pointed sharp hoe which is in use in China, and\r\nwhich in the hands of the eastern peasant fills the place of shovel,\r\nhoe, and spade, a reaping hook, a short knife, a barrow, and a bamboo\r\nrake which is largely used in the denudation of the hills.\r\n\r\nGrain, peas, and beans are threshed out with flails as often as not in\r\nthe roadway of a village, while the grinding of flour and the hulling\r\nof rice are accomplished by the stone quern, and the stone or wooden\r\nmortar, with an iron pestle worked by hand or foot, the “_pang-a_,” or,\r\nas has been previously described, by a “_mul_,” or water “_pang-a_.”\r\nRice is threshed by beating the ears over a board, and all grain is\r\nwinnowed by being thrown up in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe pony is not used in agriculture. Ploughing is done by the powerful,\r\nnoble, tractable, Korean bull, a cane ring placed in his nostrils\r\nwhen young rendering him manageable even by a young child. He is four\r\nyears in attaining maturity, and is now worth from £3 to £4, his value\r\nhaving been enhanced by the late war and the prevalence of rinderpest\r\nin recent years. Milk is not an article of diet. In some districts\r\nox-sleds of very simple construction are used for bringing down fuel\r\nfrom the hills and produce from the fields, and at Seoul and a few\r\nother cities rude carts are to be seen; but ponies, men, and bulls are\r\nthe means of transport for produce and goods, the loads being adjusted\r\nevenly on wooden pack saddles, or in the case of small articles in\r\npanniers of plaited straw or netted rope. In the latter, ingeniously\r\nmade to open at the bottom and discharge their contents, manure is\r\ncarried to the fields. Both bulls and ponies are shod with iron. The\r\npony carries from 160 to 200 lbs. Sore backs are lamentably common.\r\n\r\nThe breed of pigs is very small. Pigs are always black and loathsome.\r\nTheir bristles stand up along their backs, and they are lean, active,\r\nand of specially revolting habits. The dogs are big, usually buff,\r\nlong-haired, and cowardly, and caricature the Scotch collie in their\r\naspect. The fowls are plebeian, and for wildness, activity, and powers\r\nof flight are unequalled in my experience. Ducks are not very common,\r\nand geese are kept chiefly as guards, and for presentation at weddings\r\nas emblems of fidelity. The few sheep bred in Korea are reserved for\r\nRoyal sacrifices. I have occasionally seen mutton on tables in Seoul,\r\nbut it has been imported from Chefoo. The villages which make their\r\nliving altogether by agriculture are usually off the high roads, those\r\nwhich the hasty traveller passes through depending as much on the\r\nentertaining of wayfarers as on the cultivation of the land. In these,\r\nnearly every house has a covered shelf in front at which food can be\r\nobtained, but lodging is not provided, and the villages which can\r\nfeed and lodge beasts as well as men are few. The fact that the large\r\nfarming villages are off the road gives an incorrect notion of the\r\npopulation of Korea.\r\n\r\nOn the slope of a hillside above a pleasant valley lies the town of\r\nAn-byöng, once, judging from the extent of its decaying walls and\r\nfortifications, and the height of its canopied but ruinous gate towers,\r\na large city. The _yamen_ and other Government buildings are well kept,\r\nand being in good repair, are in striking contrast to those previously\r\nseen on the route. The “main street” is, however, nothing but a dirty\r\nalley. The town has a diminishing population, and though it makes some\r\npaper from the _Brousonettia Papyrifera_, and has several schools,\r\nand exchanges rice and beans for foreign cottons at Wön-san, it has a\r\nsingularly decaying look, and is altogether unworthy of its position as\r\nbeing one of the chief places in the province of Ham-gyöng. Outside of\r\nit the road crosses a remarkably broad river bed by a bridge 720 feet\r\nlong, so dilapidated that the ponies put their feet through its rotten\r\nsods several times.\r\n\r\nFrom An-byöng to Ta-ri-mak, a short distance from Nam-San on the\r\nmain road from Seoul to Wön-san, is a long and tedious ride through\r\nthinly peopled country and pine woods full of graves. We spent two\r\nnights there at a very noisy and disagreeable inn, in which privacy\r\nwas unattainable and the vermin were appalling. There the host was\r\nspecially unwilling to take in foreigners, on the ground that we\r\nshould not pay, a suspicion which irritated our friendly _mapu_,\r\nwho vociferated at the top of their voices that we paid “even for\r\nthe smallest things we got.” The swinging season was at hand, each\r\namusement having its definite date for beginning and ending, and in\r\nevery village swings were being erected on tall straight poles. Wong\r\ncould never resist the temptation of taking a swing, which always\r\namused the people.\r\n\r\nAt this inn there were some musical performers who made both night and\r\nday wearisome to me, but gave great pleasure to others. I have not\r\npreviously mentioned my sufferings on the Han from the sounds produced\r\nby itinerant musicians, and by the _mu-tang_ or sorceress and her\r\ncoadjutors; but, as has been forcibly brought out in a paper on Korean\r\nmusic by Mr. Hulbert in the _Korean Repository_,[21] the sounds are\r\npeculiar and unpleasing, because we neither know nor feel what they\r\nare intended to express, and we bring to Korean music not the Korean\r\ntemperament and training but the Western, which demands “time” as an\r\nessential. It may be added that the Koreans, like their neighbors the\r\nJapanese, love our music as little as we love theirs, and for the same\r\nreason, that the ideas we express by it are unfamiliar to them.\r\n\r\nOne reason of the afflictive and discordant sounds is that the gamut\r\nof Korea differs from the musical scale of European countries, with\r\nthe result that whenever music seems to be trembling on the verge\r\nof a harmony, a discord assails the ear. The musical instruments\r\nare many, but they are not carefully finished. Among instruments of\r\npercussion are drums, cymbals, gongs, and a species of castanet.\r\nFor wind instruments there are unkeyed bugles, flutes, and long and\r\nshort trumpets; and the stringed instruments are a large guitar, a\r\ntwenty-five stringed guitar, a mandolin, and a five-stringed violin.\r\nThe discord produced by a concert of several of these instruments is\r\nheard in perfection at the opening and closing of the gates of cities.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of Korean vocal music, the first being the\r\n_Si-jo_ or “classical” style, _andante tremuloso_, and “punctuated with\r\ndrums,” the drum accompaniment consisting mainly of a drum beat from\r\ntime to time as an indication to the vocalist that she has quavered\r\nlong enough upon one note. The _Si-jo_ is a slow process, and is said\r\nby the Koreans to require such long and patient practise that only the\r\ndancing girls can excel in it, as they alone have leisure to cultivate\r\nit. One branch of it deals with convivial songs, of one of which I\r\ngive a translation from the gifted pen of the Rev. H. B. Hulbert of\r\nSeoul.[22]\r\n\r\nThe Korean, prisoned during the winter in his small, dark, dirty, and\r\nmalodorous rooms, with neither a glowing fireside nor brilliant lamp\r\nto mitigate the gloom, welcomes spring with lively excitement, and\r\ndemands music and song as its natural accompaniment--song that shall\r\nexpress the emancipation, breathing space, and unalloyed physical\r\npleasure which have no counterpart in our English feelings. Thus a\r\nclassical song runs:--\r\n\r\n  The willow catkin bears the vernal blush of summer’s dawn\r\n                When winter’s night is done;\r\n  The oriole, who preens herself aloft on swaying bough,\r\n                Is summer’s harbinger;\r\n  The butterfly, with noiseless _ful-ful_ of her pulsing wing,\r\n                Marks off the summer hour.\r\n  Quick, boy, thy zither! Do its strings accord? ’Tis well.\r\n                Strike up! _I must have song._\r\n\r\nThe second style of Korean vocal music is the _Ha Ch’i_ or popular. The\r\nmost conspicuous song in this class is the _A-ra-rüng_, of 782 verses.\r\nIt is said that the _A-ra-rüng_ holds to the Korean in music the same\r\nplace that rice does in his food--all else being a mere appendage. The\r\ntune, but with the trills and quavers, of which there are one or two to\r\neach note, left out, is given here, though Mr. Hulbert, to whom I am\r\ngreatly indebted, calls it “a very weak attempt to score it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A-ra-rüng a-ra-rüng a-ra-ri-o--- a-ra-rüng\r\n\r\nöl--sa pai ddi-ö-ra. Mun-gyung sai-chai pak-tala-n.\r\n\r\nmu---hong-do-kai pang-maing-i ta na-kan-da.]\r\n\r\nThe chorus of _A-ra-rüng_ is invariable, but the verses which are sung\r\nin connection with it take a wide range through the fields of lyrics,\r\nepics, and didactics.\r\n\r\nThere is a third style, which is between the classical and the popular,\r\nbut which hardly deserves mention.\r\n\r\nTo my thinking, the melancholy which seems the _motif_ of most Oriental\r\nmusic becomes an extreme plaintiveness in that of Korea, partly due\r\nprobably to the unlimited quavering on one note. While what may be\r\ncalled concerted music is torture to a Western ear, solos on the\r\nflute ofttimes combine a singular sweetness with their mournfulness\r\nand suggest “Far-off Melodies.” Love songs are popular, and there is\r\na tender grace about some of them, as well as an occasional glint\r\nof humor, as indicated by the last line of the third stanza of one\r\ntranslated by Mr. Gale.[23] The allusions to Nature generally show\r\na quick and sympathetic insight into her beauties, and occasional\r\nstanzas, of which the one cited is among several translated by Mr.\r\nHulbert, have a delicacy of touch not unworthy of an Elizabethan\r\npoet.[24] The _Korean Repository_ is doing a good work in making Korean\r\npoetry accessible to English readers.\r\n\r\nThere was not, however, any flute music at Ta-ri-mak. There were\r\nclassical songs, with a direful drum accompaniment, and a wearisome\r\nrepetition of the _A-ra-rüng_, continuing all day and late into the hot\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nA few pedlars passed by, selling tobacco, necessaries, and children’s\r\ntoys, the latter rudely made, and only attractive in a country in which\r\nartistic feeling appears dead. There are shops in Seoul, Phyöng-yang,\r\nand other cities devoted to the sale of such toys, painted in staring\r\ncolors, and illustrative chiefly of adult life. There are also monkeys,\r\npuppies, and tigers on wheels, all for boys, and soldiers in European\r\nuniforms have appeared during the recent military craze, and boys are\r\nvery early taught to look forward to official life by representations\r\nof mandarins’ chairs, red-tasselled umbrellas, and fringed hats. Girls\r\nbeing of comparatively small account, toys specially suited to them are\r\nnot many.\r\n\r\nJapanese lucifer matches, which, when of the cheap sort, seem only\r\nslightly inflammable, as I have several times used a whole box without\r\nigniting one, were in the stock of the pedlars, and are making rapid\r\nheadway in the towns, but even so near Wön-san as Ta-ri-mak is, the\r\npeople were still using flint and steel to light chips of wood dipped\r\nin sulphur, though the cheap and smoky kerosene lamp has displaced the\r\ntall, upright candlestick and the old-fashioned dish lamps there and in\r\nvery many other country places.\r\n\r\nFrom the high-road from Seoul to Wön-san we diverged at Nam-San to\r\nvisit the large monastery of Sök-wang Sa, famous as being the place\r\nwhere, in the palmy days of Korean Buddhism, Atai-jo, the first king of\r\nthe present dynasty, was educated and lived. The monastery itself, with\r\nits temples, was erected by this king to mark the spot where, 504 years\r\nago, he received that supernatural message to rule in virtue of which\r\nhis descendant occupies the Korean throne to-day. In this singularly\r\nbeautiful spot Atai-jo’s early years were spent in religious exercises,\r\nstudy, and preparation, and many of the superb trees which adorn the\r\ngrand mountain clefts in which Sök-wang Sa is situated are said to\r\nhave been planted by his hands. His regalia and robes of state are\r\npreserved in a building by themselves, which no one is allowed to enter\r\nexcept the duly appointed attendant. A bridle track alongside of a\r\nclear mountain stream leads through very pretty and prosperous-looking\r\ncountry, and over wooded foothills for some miles to the base of a\r\nfine mountain range. We passed for a length of time through rich and\r\nheavily-timbered monastic property, then the beautiful valley narrowed,\r\nand by a “Red Arrow Gate” we entered on a smooth broad road, on which\r\nthe sun glinted here and there through the heavy foliage of an avenue\r\nof noble pines, a gap now and then giving entrancing glimpses of the\r\ndeep delicious blue of the summer sky, of a grand gorge dark with\r\npines, firs, and the exotic _Cleyera Japonica_ and zelkawa, brightened\r\nby the tender green of maples and other deciduous trees, and by flashes\r\nof foam from a torrent booming among great moss-covered boulders.\r\n\r\nThen came bridges with decorative roofs, abbots’ tombstones under\r\ncarved and painted canopies, inscribed stone tablets, glorious views\r\nof a peaked, forest-clothed mountain barring the gorge, and as the\r\npines of the avenue fell into groups at its close, and magnificent\r\nzelkawas, from whose spreading branches white roses hung in graceful\r\nfestoons, overarched the road, a long irregular line of temples and\r\nmonastic buildings appeared, clinging in singular picturesqueness to\r\nthe sides of the ravine, which there ascends somewhat rapidly towards\r\nthe mountain, which closes it.\r\n\r\nAn abbot, framed in the doorway of a quaint building, and looking like\r\na picture of a portly, jolly, mediæval friar, welcomed us, and he and\r\nhis monks regaled us with honey water in the large guest hall, but\r\nsimultaneously produced a visitors’ book and asked us how much we were\r\ngoing to pay, the sum being duly recorded. The grasping ways of these\r\nmonks, who fleeced the _mapu_ so badly as to make them say they “had\r\nfallen among thieves,” contrast with the friendly hospitality of their\r\nbrethren of the Diamond Mountain, and can only be accounted for by the\r\ncontaminating influences of a treaty port, from which they are distant\r\nonly a long day’s journey!\r\n\r\n“See the sights first and then pay,” they said, the glorious views and\r\nthe quaint picturesqueness of the monastic buildings clustering on the\r\ncrags above the cataracts being the sight _par excellence_. It was\r\nrefreshing to turn from the contemplation of the sensual, acquisitive,\r\ngreedy faces of most of the monks to Nature at her freshest and\r\nfairest, on one of the loveliest days of early June.\r\n\r\nThe interiors of the temples are shabby and dirty, the paint is scaling\r\noff the roofs, and the floors and even the altars were hidden under\r\nlayers of herbs drying for kitchen use. Besides the tablet to the\r\nfirst king of the present dynasty in a handsome tablet-house, the\r\nnoteworthy “sight” to be seen is a small temple dedicated to the “Five\r\nHundred Disciples.” Sök-wang Sa is not a holy place, and the artist who\r\ncaricatured the devout and ascetic followers of the ascetic Sakymuni\r\nhas bequeathed a legacy of unhallowed suggestion to its inmates!\r\n\r\nThe “Five Hundred” are stone images not a foot in height, arranged\r\nround the dusty temple in several tiers, each one with a silk cap\r\non, worn with more or less of a jaunty air on one side of the head\r\nor falling over the brow. The variety of features and expression is\r\nwonderful; all Eastern nationalities are represented, and there are not\r\ntwo faces or attitudes alike. The whole display shows genius, though\r\nnot of a high order.\r\n\r\nAmong the infinite variety, one figure has deeply set eyes, an aquiline\r\nnose, and thin lips; another a pug nose, squinting eyes, and a broad\r\ngrinning mouth; one is Mongolian, another Caucasian, and another\r\napproximates to the Negro type. Here is a stout, jolly fellow, with a\r\nleer and a broad grin suggestive of casks of porter and the archaic\r\nLondon drayman; there is an idiot with drooping head, receding brow\r\nand chin, and a vacant stare; here again is a dark stage villain, with\r\nred cheeks and a cap drawn low over his forehead; then Mr. Pecksniff\r\nconfronts one with an air of sanctimoniousness obviously difficult to\r\nretain; Falstaff outdoes his legendary jollity; and priests and monks\r\nof all nations leer at the beholders from under their jaunty caps. It\r\nis an exhibition of unsanctified genius. Nearly all the figures look\r\nworse for drink, and fatuous smiles, drunken leers, and farcical grins\r\nare the rule, the effect of all being aggravated by the varied and\r\nabsurd arrangements of the caps. The grotesqueness is indescribable,\r\nand altogether “unedifying.”\r\n\r\nIt was a great change to get on the broad main road to Wön-san, and to\r\nsee telegraph poles once more. There was plenty of goods and passenger\r\ntraffic across the fine plain covered with rice and grain, margined by\r\nbluffs, and dotted with what have obviously once been islands, near\r\nwhich Wön-san is situated.\r\n\r\nWhere the road is broad, a high heap of hardened mud runs along the\r\ncentre, with hardened mud corrugations on either side; where narrow, it\r\nis merely the top of a rice dyke. The bridges are specially infamous;\r\nin fact, they were so rotten that the _mapu_ would not trust their\r\nponies upon them, and we forded all the streams. Yet this road, which\r\nI found equally bad at the three points at which I touched it, is one\r\nof the leading thoroughfares by which goods pass from the east to the\r\nwest coast and _vice versa_,--tobacco, copper, salt fish, seaweed,\r\ngalena, and hides from the east, and foreign shirtings, watches, and\r\nmiscellaneous native and foreign articles from the west.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the sun was but poorly indicated by a shade temperature\r\nof 84°, and it was in his full noontide fierceness that we reached\r\nthe huddle of foul and narrow alleys and irregular rows of thatched\r\nshops along the high-road which make up the busy and growing Korean\r\ntown of Wön-san, which, with an estimated population of 15,000 people,\r\nlies along a strip of beach below a pine-clothed bluff and ranges of\r\nmountains, then green to their summits, but which I saw in December\r\nof the same year in the majesty of the snow which covers them from\r\nNovember to May. The smells were fearful, the dirt abominable, and the\r\nquantity of wretched dogs and of pieces of bleeding meat blackening\r\nin the sun perfectly sickening. This aspect of meat, produced by the\r\nmode of killing it, has made foreigners entirely dependent on the\r\nJapanese butchers in Seoul and elsewhere. The Koreans cut the throat\r\nof the animal and insert a peg in the opening. Then the butcher takes\r\na hatchet and beats the animal on the rump until it dies. The process\r\ntakes about an hour, and the beast suffers agonies of terror and\r\npain before it loses consciousness. Very little blood is lost during\r\nthe operation; the beef is full of it, and its heavier weight in\r\nconsequence is to the advantage of the vendor.\r\n\r\nThen came a level stretch of about a mile, much planted with potatoes,\r\nglimpses of American Protestant mission-houses in conspicuous and\r\neligible positions (eligible, that is, for everything but mission\r\nwork), and the uneven Korean road glided imperceptibly into a broad\r\ngravel road, fringed on both sides with neat wooden houses standing in\r\ngardens, which gradually thickened into the neatest, trimmest, and most\r\nattractive town in all Korea, the Japanese settlement of the treaty\r\nport of Wön-san, opened to Japanese trade in 1880 and to foreign trade\r\ngenerally in 1883.\r\n\r\nBroad and well-kept streets, neat wharves, trim and fairly\r\nsubstantial houses, showing the interior dollishness and daintiness\r\ncharacteristic of Japan, a large and very prominent Japanese Consulate\r\nin Anglo-Japanese style, the offices of the “N.Y.K.,” the Japan Mail\r\nSteamship Company (an abbreviation as familiar to residents in the\r\nFar East as “P. & O.”), a Japanese Bank of solid reputation, Customs’\r\nbuildings, of which a neat reading-room forms a part, neat Japanese\r\nshops where European articles can be bought at moderate prices, a large\r\nschoolhouse, with a teacher in European dress, and active manikins and\r\nhobbling but graceful women, neither veiled nor muffled up, are the\r\nfeatures of this pleasant Japanese colony, which is so fortunate as to\r\nhave no history, its progress, though not rapid, having been placid\r\nand peaceful, not marred by friction either with Koreans or foreigners\r\nof other nationalities; and even the recent war, though it led to the\r\nremoval of the Chinese consul and his countrymen, an insignificant\r\nfraction of the population, had left no special traces, except that the\r\nenormous wages paid to transport coolies by the Japanese had enabled\r\nthem to gamble with _yen_ instead of _cash_!\r\n\r\nI was most hospitably received by Mr. and Mrs. Gale of the American\r\nPresbyterian Mission. Mr. Gale’s work was the important one of the\r\npreparation of a dictionary of the Korean language in Korean, Chinese,\r\nand English, which was published in 1897.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve days which I spent at Wön-san I made a junk excursion\r\nin Yung-hing or Broughton Bay, in the southwest corner of which the\r\nport is situated. It is a superb bay, with an area of fully 40 square\r\nmiles, a depth of from 6 to 12 fathoms, with good holding ground, never\r\nfreezes in winter, is sheltered by promontories and mountains from the\r\nwinds of every quarter, and its entrance is protected by islands. To\r\nEnglish readers it is probable that the sole interest of this fine\r\nbay lies in the fact that its northern arm, Port Lazareff, which was\r\nthe object of my cruise, is the harbor which Russia is credited with\r\ndesiring to gain possession of for the terminus of her Trans-Siberian\r\nRailway. Whether this be so or no, or whether Port Shestakoff, on the\r\nsame coast, but 60 miles farther north, is more defensible and better\r\nadapted for a naval as well as a terminal port, the time has gone by\r\nfor grudging to Russia an outlet on the Pacific, and I for one should\r\nprefer it on the coast of eastern Korea than on the northern shore of\r\nthe Yellow Sea.\r\n\r\nThe head of Port Lazareff is about 16 miles from Wön-san, and is formed\r\nby the swampy outlets of the river Dun-gan, among the many branches of\r\nwhich lie inhabited, low-lying islands. There are rude but extensive\r\nsalt works at the shallows in which this noble inlet terminates, after\r\nreceiving several streams besides the Dun-gan. Port Lazareff has, in\r\naddition, abundant supplies of water from natural springs. The high\r\nhills which surround the bay are grassy to their summits, but there\r\nis very little wood, and the villages are small and far between. Game\r\nis singularly abundant. Pheasants are nearly as plentiful as sparrows\r\nare with us, the wary turkey bustard abounds, there are snipe in the\r\nlate summer, and pigeons, plover, and water-hen are common. In spring\r\nand autumn wild fowl innumerable crowd the waters of every stream and\r\ninlet, swans, teal, geese, and ducks darkening the air, which they rend\r\nwith their clamor as the sportsman invades their haunts.\r\n\r\nA Korean junk does not impress one by its seaworthiness, and it is not\r\nsurprising that the junkmen hug the shore and seek shelter whenever\r\na good sailing breeze comes on. She is built without nails, iron, or\r\npreservative paint, and looks rather like a temporary and fortuitous\r\naggregation of beams and planks than a deliberate construction. Two\r\ntall, heavy masts fixed by wedges among the timbers at the bottom of\r\nthe boat require frequent attention, as they are always swaying and\r\nthreatening to come down. The sails are of matting, with a number of\r\nbamboos running transversely, with a cord attached to each, united into\r\none sheet, by means of which tacking is effected, or rather might be.\r\nPractically, navigation consists in running before a light breeze, and\r\ndropping the mass of mats and bamboos on the confusion below whenever\r\nit freshens, varying the process by an easy pull at the sweeps, one\r\nat the stern and two working on pins in transverse beams amidships,\r\nwhich project 3 feet on each side. The junk is fitted with a rudder of\r\nenormous size, which from its position acts as a keel board. The price\r\nis from 60 to 80 dollars. This singular craft sails well before the\r\nwind, but under other circumstances is apt to become unmanageable.\r\n\r\nWön-san has telegraphic communication with Seoul, and chiefly through\r\nthe enterprise of the N.Y.K., it is connected by most comfortable\r\nsteamers with Korean ports and with Wladivostok, Kobe, and Nagasaki,\r\nHong-Kong, Shanghai, Chefoo, Newchwang, and Tientsin. Steamers of a\r\nRussian line call there at intervals during the summer season. There\r\nare no Western merchants or Western residents except the missionaries\r\nand the Customs staff, and foreign trade is chiefly in the hands of the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nAbout 60 _li_ from Wön-san are some large grass-covered mounds,\r\nof which the Koreans do not care to speak, as they regard them as\r\nassociated with an ancient Korean custom, now looked upon as barbarous.\r\nDuring the last dynasty, and more than five centuries ago, it was\r\ncustomary, when people from age and infirmity became burdensome to\r\ntheir relations, to incarcerate them in the stone cells which these\r\nmounds contain, with a little food and water, and leave them there to\r\ndie. In similar mounds, elsewhere in Korea, bowls and jars of coarse\r\npottery have been found, as well as a few specimens of gray _celadon_.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing sensational about Wön-san.[25] It has no “booms” in\r\ntrade or land, but “keeps the even tenor of its way.” It is to me far\r\nthe most attractive of the treaty ports. Its trim Japanese settlement,\r\nfrom which green hills rise abruptly, backed by fine mountain forms,\r\ndignified by snow for seven months of the year, and above all, the\r\nexquisite caves to the northwest, where the sea murmurs in cool\r\ngrottos, and beats the pure white sand into ripples at the feet of\r\ncliffs hidden by flowers, ferns, and grass, and its air of dreamy\r\nrepose--“a land where it is always afternoon”--point to its future as\r\nthat of a salubrious and popular sanitarium.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] A _kwan-ja_, being an official passport, lays a traveller open to\r\nthe suspicion that, like officials, he will take the best of everything\r\nhe can get without paying for it, and this dread, added to a natural\r\ndistrust of foreigners, led to more or less unwillingness to receive us\r\nin many places, the _mapu_ having to console the people by asseverating\r\nthat I paid the full price for all I got, and that even when I tore a\r\nsheet of paper from the window I paid for it!\r\n\r\n[21] February, 1896.\r\n\r\n[22] I\r\n\r\n  ’Twas years ago that Kim and I\r\n  Struck hands and swore, however dry\r\n  The lip might be or sad the heart,\r\n  The merry wine should have no part\r\n  In mitigating sorrow’s blow\r\n  Or quenching thirst. ’Twas long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n  And now I’ve reached the flood-tide mark\r\n  Of life; the ebb begins, and dark\r\n  The future lowers.

One day it was said that the Tong-haks had\r\ngained great successes and had taken Gatling guns from the Royal\r\narmy, another that they had been crushed and their mysterious and\r\nubiquitous leader beheaded, while the latest rumor before my departure\r\nwas that they were marching in great force on Fusan. Judging from the\r\nproclamation which they circulated, and which, while stating that they\r\nrose against corrupt officials and traitorous advisers, professed\r\nunswerving loyalty to the throne, it seemed credible that, if there\r\nwere a throb of patriotism anywhere in Korea, it was in the breasts of\r\nthese peasants. Their risings appeared to be free from excesses and\r\nuseless bloodshed, and they confined themselves to the attempt to carry\r\nout their programme of reform. Some foreign sympathy was bestowed upon\r\nthem, because it was thought that the iniquities of misrule could go no\r\nfurther, and that the time was ripe for an armed protest on a larger\r\nscale than the ordinary peasant risings against intolerable exactions.\r\n\r\nBut at the very moment when these matters were being discussed in\r\nWön-san with not more than a languid interest, a formidable menace\r\nto the established order of things was taking shape, destined in a\r\nfew days to cast the Tong-haks into the shade, and concentrate the\r\nattention of the world on this insignificant peninsula.\r\n\r\nLeaving Wön-san by steamer on 17th June, and arriving at Fusan on the\r\n19th, I was not surprised to find a Japanese gunboat in the harbor, and\r\nthat 220 Japanese soldiers had been landed from the _Higo Maru_ that\r\nmorning and were quartered in the Buddhist temples on the hill, and\r\nthat the rebels had cut the telegraph wires between Fusan and Seoul.\r\n\r\nAmong the few Europeans at Fusan there was no uneasiness. The Japanese,\r\nwith their large mercantile colony there, have considerable interests\r\nto safeguard, and nothing seemed more natural than the course they\r\ntook. A rumor that Japanese troops had been landed at Chemulpo was\r\nquite disregarded.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Chemulpo, however, early on the morning of the 21st,\r\na very exciting state of matters revealed itself. A large fleet,\r\nsix Japanese ships of war, the American flag ship, two French, one\r\nRussian, and two Chinese, were lying in the outer harbor. The limited\r\naccommodation of the inner harbor was taxed to its utmost capacity.\r\nJapanese transports were landing troops, horses, and war material in\r\nsteam launches, junks were discharging rice and other stores for the\r\ncommissariat department, coolies were stacking it on the beach, and\r\nthe movement by sea and land was ceaseless. Visitors from the shore,\r\nexcited and agitated, brought a budget of astounding rumors, but\r\nconfessed to being mainly in the dark.\r\n\r\nOn landing, I found the deadly dull port transformed: the streets\r\nresounded to the tread of Japanese troops in heavy marching order,\r\ntrains of mat and forage carts blocked the road. Every house in the\r\nmain street of the Japanese settlement was turned into a barrack and\r\ncrowded with troops, rifles and accoutrements gleamed in the balconies,\r\ncrowds of Koreans, limp and dazed, lounged in the streets or sat on\r\nthe knolls, gazing vacantly at the transformation of their port into a\r\nforeign camp. Only two hours had passed since the first of the troops\r\nlanded, and when I visited the camp with a young Russian officer there\r\nwere 1,200 men under canvas in well-ventilated bell tents, holding 20\r\neach, with matted floors and drainage trenches, and dinner was being\r\nserved in lacquer boxes. Stables had been run up, and the cavalry\r\nand mountain guns were in the centre. The horses of the mountain\r\nbattery train, serviceable animals, fourteen hands high, were in\r\nexcellent condition, and were equipped with pack saddles of the latest\r\nIndian pattern. They were removing shot and shell for Seoul from the\r\nJapanese Consulate with 200 men and 100 horses, and it was done almost\r\nsoundlessly. The camp, with its neat streets, was orderly, trim, and\r\nquiet. In the town sentries challenged passers-by. Every man looked\r\nas if he knew his duty and meant to do it. There was no swagger. The\r\nmanikins, well armed and serviceably dressed, were obviously in Korea\r\nfor a purpose which they meant to accomplish.\r\n\r\nWhat that purpose was, was well concealed under color of giving\r\nefficient protection to Japanese subjects in Korea, who were said to be\r\nimperilled by the successes of the Tong-haks.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion in southern Korea was exciting much alarm in the capital.\r\nSuch movements, though on a smaller scale, are annual spring events in\r\nthe peninsula, when in one or other of the provinces the peasantry,\r\ndriven to exasperation by official extortions, rise, and, with more or\r\nless violence (occasionally fatal), drive out the offending mandarin.\r\nPunishment rarely ensues. The King sends a new official, who squeezes\r\nand extorts in his turn with more or less vigor, until, if he also\r\npasses bearable limits, he is forcibly expelled, and things settle down\r\nonce more. This Tong-hak (“Oriental” or “National”) movement, though\r\nlost sight of in presence of more important issues, was of greater\r\nmoment, as being organized on a broader basis, so as to include a\r\ngreat number of adherents in Seoul and the other cities, and with such\r\ndefinite and reasonable objects that at first I was inclined to call\r\nits leaders “armed reformers” rather than “rebels.” At that time there\r\nwas no question as to the Royal authority.\r\n\r\nThe Tong-hak proclamation began by declaring in respectful language\r\nloyal allegiance to the King, and went on to state the grievances in\r\nvery moderate terms. The Tong-haks asserted, and with undoubted truth,\r\nthat officials in Korea, for their own purposes, closed the eyes and\r\nears of the King to all news and reports of the wrongs inflicted on\r\nhis people. That ministers of State, governors, and magistrates were\r\nall indifferent to the welfare of their country, and were bent only on\r\nenriching themselves, and that there were no checks on their rapacity.\r\nThat examinations (the only avenues to official life) were nothing more\r\nthan scenes of bribery, barter, and sale, and were no longer tests\r\nof fitness for civil appointment. That officials cared not for the\r\ndebt into which the country was fast sinking. That “they were proud,\r\nvainglorious, adulterous, avaricious.” That many officials receiving\r\nappointments in the country lived in Seoul. That “they flatter and fawn\r\nin peace, and desert and betray in times of trouble.”\r\n\r\nThe necessity for reform was strongly urged. There were no expressions\r\nof hostility to foreigners, and the manifesto did not appear to\r\ntake any account of them. The leader, whose individuality was never\r\ndefinitely ascertained, was credited with ubiquity and supernatural\r\npowers by the common people, as well as with the ability to speak\r\nboth Japanese and Chinese, and it was evident from his measures,\r\nforethought, the disposition of his forces, and some touches of Western\r\nstrategic skill, that he had some acquaintance with the modern art of\r\nwar. His followers, armed at first with only old swords and halberds,\r\nhad come to possess rifles, taken from the official armories and the\r\ndefeated Royal troops. For in the midst of the thousand wild rumors\r\nwhich were afloat, it appeared certain that the King sent several\r\nhundred soldiers against the Tong-haks under a general who, on his\r\nway to attack their camp, raised and armed 300 levies, who, in the\r\nengagement which followed, joined the “rebels” and turned upon the\r\nKing’s troops, that 300 of the latter were killed, and that the general\r\nwas missing. This, following other successes, the deposition of several\r\nimportant officials, and the rumored march on Seoul, had created great\r\nalarm, and the King was supposed to be prepared for flight.\r\n\r\nBut the events of the two or three days before I landed at Chemulpo\r\nthrew the local disturbance into the shade, and it is only with the\r\nobject of showing with what an excellent pretext for interference the\r\nTong-haks had furnished the Japanese, that I recall this petty chapter\r\nof what is now ancient history.\r\n\r\nThe questions vital to Korea and of paramount diplomatic importance\r\nwere, “What is the object of Japan? Is this an invasion? Is she here as\r\nan enemy or a friend?” Six thousand troops provisioned for three months\r\nhad been landed. Fifteen of the _Nippon Yusen Kaisha’s_ steamers had\r\nbeen withdrawn from their routes to act as transports, the Japanese\r\nhad occupied the Gap, a pass on the Seoul road, and Ma-pu, the river\r\nport of the capital, and with guns, and in considerable force, had\r\nestablished themselves on Nam Han, a wooded hill above Seoul, from\r\nwhich position they commanded both the palace and capital. All these\r\nmovements were carried out with a suddenness, celerity, and freedom\r\nfrom hitch which in their military aspects were worthy of the highest\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nTo any student of Far Eastern politics it must have been apparent that\r\nthis skilful and extraordinary move on the part of Japan was not made\r\nfor the protection of her colonies in Chemulpo and Seoul, nor yet\r\nagainst Korea. It has been said in various quarters, and believed,\r\nthat the Japanese ministry was shaky, and had to choose between its\r\nown downfall and a foreign war. This is a complete sophism. There\r\ncan be no question that Japan had been planning such a movement for\r\nyears. She had made accurate maps of Korea, and had secured reports\r\nof forage and provisions, measurements of the width of rivers and\r\nthe depth of fords, and had been buying up rice in Korea for three\r\nmonths previously, while even as far as the Tibetan frontier, Japanese\r\nofficers in disguise had gauged the strength and weakness of China,\r\nreporting on her armies on paper and, in fact, on her dummy guns, and\r\nantique, honeycombed carronades, and knew better than the Chinese\r\nthemselves how many men each province could put into the field, how\r\ndrilled and how armed, and they were acquainted with the infinite\r\ncorruption and dishonesty, combined with a total lack of patriotism,\r\nwhich nullified even such commissariat arrangements as existed on\r\npaper, and rendered it absolutely impossible for China to send an army\r\nefficiently into the field, far less sustain it during a campaign.\r\n\r\nTo all appearance Japan had completely outwitted China in Korea, and a\r\npanic prevailed among the Chinese. Thirty ladies of the households of\r\nthe Chinese Resident and Consul embarked for China on the appearance\r\nof the Japanese in Seoul, and 800 Chinamen left Chemulpo the day I\r\narrived, the consternation in the Chinese colony being so great that\r\neven the market gardeners, who have a monopoly of a most thriving\r\ntrade, fled.\r\n\r\nI never before saw the Chinaman otherwise than aggravatingly cool,\r\ncollected, and master of the situation, but on that June day he\r\nlost his head, and, frenzied by race hatred and pecuniary loss, was\r\ntransformed into a shouting barbarian, not knowing what he would\r\nbe at. The Chinese inn where I spent the day was one centre of the\r\nexcitement, and each time that I came in from a walk or received a\r\nEuropean visitor, a number of the _employés_, usually most quiet and\r\nreticent, huddled into my room with faces distorted by anxiety, asking\r\nwhat I had heard, what was going to be, whether the Chinese army would\r\nbe there that night, whether the British fleet was coming to help them,\r\netc., and even my Chinese servant, a most excellent fellow, was beside\r\nhimself, muttering in English through clenched teeth, “I must kill,\r\nkill, kill!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the dwarf battalions, a miracle of rigid discipline and good\r\nbehavior, were steadily tramping to Seoul, where matters then and for\r\nsome time afterwards stood thus. The King was in his secluded palace,\r\nand that which still posed as a Government had really collapsed. Mr.\r\nHillier, the English Consul-General, was in England on leave, and the\r\nacting Consul-General, Mr. Gardner, C.M.G., had only been in Korea\r\nfor three months. The American Minister was a newer man still. The\r\nFrench and German Consuls need hardly be taken into account, as they\r\nhad few, if any, interests to safeguard. Mr. Waeber, the able and\r\ncautious diplomatist who had represented Russia for nine years, and\r\nhad the confidence of the whole foreign community, had been appointed\r\n_chargé d’affaires_ at Peking, and had left Seoul in the previous week.\r\nThere remained, therefore, facing each other, Otori San, the Japanese\r\nambassador to Peking, who was in Korea on a temporary mission, and\r\nYuan, a military mandarin who had been for some years Chinese Resident\r\nin Seoul, a man entrusted by the Chinese Emperor with large powers, who\r\nwas credited by foreigners with great force, tact, and ability, and who\r\nwas generally regarded as “the power behind the throne.”\r\n\r\nI had frequently seen Otori San in the early months of the year, a\r\nJapanese of average height, speaking English well, wearing European\r\ndress as though born to it, and sporting white “shoulder-of-mutton”\r\nwhiskers. He lounged in drawing-rooms, making trivial remarks to\r\nladies, and was remarkable only for his insignificance. I believe\r\nhe made the same impression, or want of impression, at Peking. But\r\ncircumstances or stringent orders from Tokyo had transformed Mr. Otori.\r\nWhether he had worn a mask previously I know not, but he showed himself\r\nrough, vigorous, capable, a man of action, unscrupulous, and not only\r\nclever enough to outwit Yuan in a difficult and hazardous game, but\r\neverybody else.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of that memorable day at Chemulpo the Vice-Consul\r\ncalled on me and warned me that I must leave Korea that night, and\r\nthe urgency and seriousness of his manner left me no doubt that he\r\nwas acting on information which he was not at liberty to divulge. I\r\nhad left my travelling gear at Wön-san in readiness for an autumn\r\njourney, and was going to Seoul that night for a week to get my money\r\nand civilized luggage before going for the summer to Japan. It was a\r\nserious blow. Other Europeans advised me not to be “deported,” but it\r\nis one of my travelling rules never to be a source of embarrassment\r\nto British officials, and supposing the crisis to be an acute one, I\r\nreluctantly yielded, and that night, with two English fellow-sufferers,\r\nleft Chemulpo in the Japanese steamer _Higo Maru_, bound for ports\r\nin the Gulf of Pechili, which _cul-de-sac_ would have proved a\r\nveritable “lion’s mouth” to her had hostilities been as imminent as\r\nthe Vice-Consul believed them to be. I had nothing but the clothing I\r\nwore, a heavy tweed suit, and the mercury was 80°, and after paying my\r\npassage to Chefoo, the first port of call, I had only four cents left.\r\nIt was four months before I obtained either my clothes or my money!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nDEPORTED TO MANCHURIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThough I landed at Chefoo in heavy tweed clothing, I was obliged to\r\nwalk up the steep hill to the British Consulate, though the mercury\r\nwas 84° in the shade, because I had no money with which to pay for a\r\n_jinriksha_! My reflections were anything but pleasant. My passport\r\nand letters of introduction, both private and official, were in\r\nSeoul, my travelling dress was distinctly shabby, and I feared that\r\nan impecunious person without introductions, and unable to prove\r\nher identity, might meet with a very cool reception. I experienced\r\nsomething of the anxiety and timidity which are the everyday lot of\r\nthousands, and I have felt a far tenderer sympathy with the penniless,\r\nspecially the educated penniless, ever since. I was so extremely\r\nuncomfortable that I hung about the gate of the British Consulate for\r\nsome minutes before I could summon up courage to go to the door and\r\nsend in a torn address of a letter which was my only visiting card! I\r\nthought, but it may have been fancy, that the Chinese who took it eyed\r\nme suspiciously and contemptuously.\r\n\r\nThe sudden revulsion of feeling which followed I cannot easily forget.\r\nMr. Clement Allen, our justly popular Consul, met me with a warm\r\nwelcome. I needed no proof of identity or anything else, he only\r\ndesired to know what he could do for me. My anxiety was not quite over,\r\nfor I had to make the humiliating confession that I needed money,\r\nand immediately he took me to Messrs. Ferguson and Co., who transact\r\nbanking business, and asked them to let me have as much as I wanted. An\r\ninvitation to tiffin followed, and Lady O’Conor, and the wife of the\r\nSpanish minister at Peking, who were staying at the Consulate, made up\r\na bundle of summer clothing for me, and my “deportation” enriched me\r\nwith valued friendships.\r\n\r\nReturning in a very different frame of mind to the _Higo Maru_, I went\r\non in her in severe heat to the mouth of the Peiho River in sight of\r\nthe Taku forts, and after rolling on its muddy surges for two days,\r\nproceeded to Newchwang in Manchuria, reaching the mouth of the Liau\r\nRiver in five days from Chemulpo. Rain was falling, and a more hideous\r\nand disastrous-looking country than the voyage of two hours up to the\r\nport revealed, I never saw. The Liau, which has a tremendous tide and\r\nstrong current, and is thick with yellow mud, is at high water nearly\r\non a level with the adjacent flats, of which one sees little, except\r\nsome mud forts on the left bank of the river, which are said to be\r\nheavily armed with Krupp guns, and an expanse of mud and reeds.\r\n\r\nOf the mud-built Chinese city of Ying-tzŭ (Military Camp), known as\r\nNewchwang, though the real Newchwang is a derelict port 30 miles up\r\nthe Liau, nothing can be seen above the mud bank but the curved, tiled\r\nroofs of _yamens_ and temples, though it is a city of 60,000 souls,\r\nthe growth of its population having kept pace with its rapid advance\r\nin commercial importance since it was opened to foreign trade in 1860.\r\nSeveral British steamers with big Chinese characters on their sides\r\nwere at anchor in the tideway, and the river sides were closely fringed\r\nwith up-river boats and sea-going junks, of various picturesque builds\r\nand colors, from Southern China, steamers and junks alike waiting not\r\nonly for cargoes of the small beans for which Manchuria is famous, but\r\nfor the pressed bean cake which is exported in enormous quantities to\r\nfertilize the sugar plantations and hungry fields of South China.\r\n\r\nThere is a Bund, and along and behind it is the foreign settlement,\r\noccupied by about forty Europeans. The white buildings of the Chinese\r\nImperial Maritime Customs, the houses of the staff, the _hongs_ of two\r\nor three foreign merchants, and the British Consular buildings, may be\r\nsaid to constitute the settlement. It has the reputation of being one\r\nof the kindliest and friendliest in the Far East, and the fact that the\r\nriver closes annually about the 20th of November for about four months,\r\nand that the residents are thrown entirely on their own resources and\r\non each other, only serves to increase that inter-dependence which\r\nbinds this and similarly isolated communities so strongly together.\r\n\r\nI was most kindly welcomed at the English Consulate then and on my\r\nreturn, and have most pleasant remembrances of Newchwang, its cordial\r\nkindness, and cheerful Bund, and breezy blue skies, but at first sight\r\nit is a dreary, solitary-looking place of mud, and muddy waters for\r\never swallowing large slices of the land, and threatening to engulf it\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n“Peas,” really beans,[26] are its chief _raison d’être_, and their ups\r\nand downs in price its mild sensations. “Pea-boats,” long and narrow,\r\nwith matting roofs and one huge sail, bring down the beans from the\r\ninterior, and mills working night and day express their oil, which is\r\nas good for cooking as for burning.\r\n\r\nThe viceroyalty of Manchuria, in which I spent the next two months,\r\nis interesting as in some ways distinct from China, besides having a\r\nprospective interest in connection with Russia. Lying outside of the\r\nGreat Wall, it has a population of several distinct and mixed races,\r\nManchus (Tartars), Gilyaks, Tungusi, Solons, Daurs, and Chinese. Along\r\nwith these must be mentioned about 30,000 Korean families, the majority\r\nof whom have left Korea since 1868, in consequence of political\r\ndisturbance and official exactions.[27]\r\n\r\nThe facts that the dynasty which has ruled China by right of conquest\r\nsince 1644 is a Manchu dynasty, and that it imposed the shaven\r\nforehead and the pigtail on all Chinese men successfully, while it\r\nabsolutely failed to prevent the women from crippling their feet,\r\nthough up to this day no woman with “Golden Lilies” (crushed feet) is\r\nallowed to enter the Imperial palace, naturally turn attention to this\r\nviceroyalty, which, in point of its area of 380,000 square miles, is\r\nlarger than Austria and Great Britain and Ireland put together, while\r\nits population is estimated at from 18,000,000 to 20,000,000 only. Thus\r\nit offers a vast field for emigration from the congested provinces of\r\nNorthern China, and Chinese immigrants are steadily flocking in from\r\nShan-tung, Chi-li, and Shen-si, so that Southern Manchuria at this time\r\nis little behind the inner provinces of China in density of population.\r\n\r\nIt is different in the northern province, where a cold climate and\r\nvast stretches of forest render agriculture more difficult. If it had\r\nnot been for the war and its attendant complications, I had purposed\r\nto travel through it from Northern Korea. But it is unsettled at all\r\ntimes. The majority of its immigrants consists of convicts, fugitive\r\ncriminals, soldiers who have left the colors, and gold and ginseng\r\nhunters. There is something almost comical about some of the doings of\r\nthis unpromising community.\r\n\r\nIt comprises large organized bands of mounted brigands, well led and\r\narmed, who do not hesitate to come into collision with the Imperial\r\ntroops, frequently coming off victors, and at times, as when I was\r\nin Mukden, wresting forts from their hands. During the Taiping\r\nrebellion, when the Chinese troops were withdrawn from Manchuria,\r\nthese bands carried havoc and terror everywhere, and seizing upon\r\ntowns and villages, ruled them by right of conquest![28] In recent\r\nyears the Government has decided to let voluntary colonists settle\r\nin the northern provinces, and has even furnished them with material\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nStill, things are bad, and the brigands have come to be regarded as a\r\nnecessary evil, and are “arranged with.” They are not scrupulous as to\r\nhuman life, and when they catch a rich merchant from the south, they\r\nsend an envoy to his guild with a claim for ransom, strengthened by the\r\nthreat that if it is not forthcoming in so many days, the captive’s\r\nhead will be cut off. Winter, when the mud is frozen hard, is the only\r\ntime for the transit of goods by land, and long trains of mule carts\r\nmay then be seen, a hundred or more together, starting from Newchwang,\r\nMukden, and other southern cities, each carrying a small flag, which\r\ndenotes that a suitable blackmail has been paid to an agent of the\r\nbrigand chiefs, and that they will not be robbed on the journey! Later,\r\nwhen I was on the Siberian frontier of Manchuria, the brigands were in\r\ngreat force, and having been joined by half-starved deserters from the\r\nChinese army, were harrying the country, and the peasants were flying\r\nin terror from their farms.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious features of Manchurian brigandage, is that its\r\nvirulence rises or falls with good or bad harvests, inundations, etc.\r\nFor many of the usually respectable peasant farmers, in times of floods\r\nand scanty crops, join the robber bands, returning to their honest\r\navocations the next season!\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of this terrorism in the northeast, Manchuria is one\r\nof the most prosperous of the Chinese viceroyalties, and its foreign\r\ntrade is assuming annually increasing importance.[29]\r\n\r\nI was disappointed to find that the Manchus (or Tartars) differ\r\nlittle in appearance from the race which they have subdued. The women,\r\nhowever, are taller, comelier, and more robust in appearance, as may\r\nbe expected from their retaining the natural size and shape of their\r\nfeet, and not only their _coiffure_ but their costume is different, the\r\nManchu women wearing sleeveless dresses from the throat to the feet,\r\nover under dresses with wide embroidered sleeves. With some exceptions,\r\nthey are less secluded than their Chinese sisters, and have an air of\r\nfar greater freedom.\r\n\r\nMost of the Manchu customs have disappeared along with the language,\r\nwhich is only spoken in a few remote valleys, and is apparently only\r\nartificially preserved because the ruling dynasty is Manchu. It is only\r\nthose students who are aspirants for literary degrees and high office\r\nin the viceroyalty who are obliged to learn it.\r\n\r\nPeople of pure Manchu race are chiefly met with in the north. Manchus,\r\nas kinsmen of the present Imperial dynasty, enjoy various privileges.\r\nEvery male adult, as soon as he can string a short and remarkably\r\ninflexible bow (no easy task), becomes a “Bannerman,” _i.e._ he is\r\nenrolled in one of eight bodies of irregulars, called “Banners” from\r\ntheir distinctive flags, and from that time receives one _tael_\r\n(now about three shillings) per month, increased to from five to\r\nseven _taels_ a month when on active service. These “Bannermen,” as\r\na rule, are not specially reputable characters. They gamble, hang\r\nabout _yamens_ for odd bits of work, in hope of permanent official\r\nemployment, and generally sublet to the Chinese the lands which they\r\nreceive from the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular anomaly that bows and arrows are relied upon as\r\na means of defence in an empire which buys rifles and Krupp guns.\r\nLater, in Peking, which was supposed to be threatened by the Japanese\r\narmies, it was intended to post Bannermen with bows and arrows at\r\nthe embrasures of the wall, and on the Peking and Tungchow road I\r\nmet twenty carts carrying up loads of these primitive weapons for\r\nthe defence of the capital! Bow and arrow drill is one of the most\r\namusing of the many military mediæval sights of China. The Chinese\r\nBannermen are descendants of those Chinese who, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, espoused the cause of the Manchu conquerors of China. The\r\nwhole military force of the three provinces of the viceroyalty is\r\n280,000 men. Tartar garrisons and “Tartar cities” exist in many of the\r\ngreat provincial cities of China, and as the interests of these troops\r\nare closely bound up with those of the present Tartar dynasty, their\r\nfaithfulness is relied upon as the backbone of Imperial security.\r\n\r\nFrom its history and its audacious and permanent conquest of its\r\ngigantic neighbor, its mixed population and numerous aboriginal\r\ntribes, its mineral and agricultural wealth, and a certain freedom and\r\nbreeziness which constitute a distinctive feature, Manchuria is a very\r\ninteresting viceroyalty, and the two months which I spent in it gave it\r\na strong hold upon me.\r\n\r\nMud is a great feature of Newchwang, perhaps the leading feature\r\nfor some months of the year, during which no traffic by road is\r\npossible, and the Bund is the only practicable walk. The night I\r\narrived rain began, and continued with one hour’s cessation for five\r\ndays and nights, for much of the time coming down like a continuous\r\nthundershower. The atmosphere was steamy and hazy, and the mercury by\r\nday and night was pretty stationary at 78°. About 8.46 inches of rain\r\nfell on those days. The barometer varied from 29° to 29.3°. Afterwards,\r\nwhen the rain ceased for a day, the heat was nearly unbearable. Of\r\ncourse, no boat’s crew would start under such circumstances. Rumors of\r\nan extensive inundation came down the river, but these and all others\r\nof purely local interest gave place to an intense anxiety as to whether\r\nwar would be declared, and what the effect of war would be on the great\r\ntrading port of Newchwang.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] _Glycene hispides_ (Dr. Morrison).\r\n\r\n[27] According to information obtained by the Russian Diplomatic\r\nMission in Peking.\r\n\r\n[28] Information received by the Russian Diplomatic Mission in Peking.\r\n\r\n[29] Taking the port of Newchwang, through which, with certain\r\nexceptions, all exports of native produce and imports of foreign\r\nmerchandise and Chinese productions pass, in 1871 16 steamers and\r\n203 sailing vessels entered the port, with a total tonnage of 65,933\r\ntons; in 1881, 114 steamers and 218 sailing vessels, with a tonnage of\r\n159,098 tons; and in 1891, 372 steamers and 61 sailing vessels, with a\r\ntotal tonnage of 334,709 tons. In the same period, British tonnage had\r\nincreased from 38.6 of the whole to 58 per cent. of the whole. In 1871\r\nGerman tonnage nearly equalled British, being 37.6 of the whole, but it\r\nhad declined in 1891 to 28 per cent. of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA MANCHURIAN DELUGE--A PASSENGER CART--AN ACCIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt surprised me much to find that only one foreign resident had visited\r\nMukden, which is only 120 miles distant by a road which is traversable\r\nin winter, and is accessible by river during the summer and autumn in\r\nfrom eight to ten days. I left Newchwang on the 3rd of July, and though\r\nvarious circumstances were unpropitious, reached Mukden in eight days,\r\nbeing able to avoid many of the windings of the Liau by sailing over an\r\ninundation.\r\n\r\nThe kindly foreign community lent me necessaries for the journey, but\r\neven with these the hold of a “pea-boat” was not luxurious. My camp-bed\r\ntook up the greater part of it, and the roof was not much above my\r\nhead. The descent into the hold and the ascent were difficult, and\r\nwhen wind and rain obliged me to close the front, it was quite dark,\r\ncockroaches swarmed, and the smell of the bilge water was horrible.\r\nI was very far from well when I started, and in two days was really\r\nill, yet I would not have missed the special interest of that journey\r\nfor anything, or its solitude, for Wong’s limited English counted for\r\nnothing and involved no conversational effort.\r\n\r\nFor some distance above Newchwang or Ying-tzŭ, as far as the real\r\nNewchwang, there is a complication of muddy rivers hurrying through\r\nvast reed beds, the resort of wild fowl, with here and there a mud bank\r\nwith a mud hovel or two upon it. At that time reed beds and partially\r\ninundated swamps stretched away nearly to the horizon, which is limited\r\nin the far distance by the wavy blue outline of some low hills.\r\n\r\nWe ran up the river till the evening of the second day before a\r\nfair wind, and then were becalmed on a reedy expanse swarming with\r\nmosquitos. The mercury was at 89° in the hold that night. I had\r\nsevere fever, with racking pains in my head, back, and limbs, and in\r\nthe morning the stamping of the junkmen to and fro, along the narrow\r\nstrip of deck outside the roof, was hardly bearable. Wong had used up\r\nthe ample supply of water, and there was nothing wherewith to quench\r\nthirst but the brown, thick water of the Liau, the tea made with which\r\nresembled peasoup.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third day it began to rain and blow, and for the\r\nnext awful four days the wind and rain never ceased. The oiled paper\r\nwhich had been tacked over the roof of the boat was torn into strips by\r\nthe violence of the winds, which forced the rain through every chink.\r\nI lay down that night with the mercury at 80°, woke feeling very cold,\r\nbut, though surprised, fell asleep again. Woke again much colder,\r\nfeeling as if my feet were bandaged together, extricated myself with\r\ndifficulty, struck a light, and got up into 6 inches of a mixture of\r\nbilge water and rain water, with an overpowering stench, in or on which\r\nall things were sunk or floating. Wondered again at being so very cold,\r\nfound the temperature at 84°, and that I had been sleeping under a\r\nwringing sheet in soaked clothing and on soaked sacking, under a soaked\r\nmosquito net, and that there was not a dry article in the hold. For the\r\nnext three days and nights things remained in the same condition, and\r\nthough I was really ill I had to live in wet clothing and drink the\r\n“liquid cholera” of the flood, all the wells being submerged.\r\n\r\nTelegrams later in the English papers announced “Great floods in\r\nManchuria,” but of the magnitude of the inundation which destroyed for\r\nthat season the magnificent crops of the great fertile plain of the\r\nLiau, and swept away many of its countless farming villages, only the\r\nexperience of sailing over it could give any idea.\r\n\r\nIn that miserable night there were barkings of dogs, shouts of men,\r\nmewings of cats, and general noises of unrest, and in the morning, of\r\nthe village of Piengdo opposite to which we had moored the evening\r\nbefore, only one house and a barn remained, which were shortly carried\r\naway. Many of the people had escaped in boats, and the remainder, with\r\ntheir fowls, dogs, and cats, were in the spreading branches of a large\r\ntree. Although the mast of my boat was considerably in the way, and it\r\nwas difficult to make fast, I succeeded in rescuing the whole menagerie\r\nand in transferring it in two trips to a village on the other side,\r\nwhich was then 5 feet above the water.\r\n\r\nWe had reached the most prosperous region of Manchuria, a plain 60\r\nmiles in length, of deep, rich alluvial soil, bearing splendid crops,\r\nthe most lucrative of which are the bean, the oil from which is the\r\nstaple export of the country, the opium poppy, and tobacco. The great\r\nand small millet, wheat, barley, melons, and cucumbers cover the\r\nground, mulberry trees for the silkworm surround the farmhouses, and\r\nthe great plain is an idyll of bounteousness and fertility. Of all this\r\nnot a trace remained, except in a few instances the tops of the 8-feet\r\nmillet, which supplies the people not only with food, but with fuel,\r\nand fodder for their animals.\r\n\r\nThe river bank burst during the night, and the waters were raging into\r\nthe plain, from which I missed many a brown-roofed village, which the\r\nevening before stood among its willow and poplar trees. At 11 a fair\r\nwind sprang up, junks began to move, and my boatmen, who had talked of\r\nreturning, untied and moved too. After an exciting scene at a bend,\r\nwhere the river, leaping like a rapid, thumped the junks against the\r\nopposite shore, we passed one wrecked village after another, bits of\r\nwalls of houses alone standing. The people and their fowls were in\r\nthe trees. The women clung to their fowls as much as to their babies.\r\nDugouts, scows, and a few junks, mine among them, were busy saving\r\nlife, and we took three families and their fowls to Sho-wa Ku, a\r\nlarge junk port, where a number of houses were still standing. These\r\nfamilies had lost all their household goods and gods, as well as mules,\r\npigs, and dogs. On our way we sailed into a farmyard to try to get\r\nsome eggs, and the junk not replying to her helm, thumped one of the\r\nundermined walls down. It was a large farmhouse and full of refugees.\r\nThe water was 3 feet deep in the rooms, naked children were floating\r\nabout in tubs, and the women, looking resigned, sat on the tables. The\r\nmen said that it was the last of four houses, and that they might as\r\nwell be dead, for they had lost all their crops and their beasts.\r\n\r\nA fearful sight presented itself at Sho-wa Ku. There the river,\r\nindefinite as it had previously been, disappeared altogether, and the\r\nwhole country was a turbulent muddy sea, bounded on the east by a range\r\nof hills, and to the north and south limitless. Under it lay all the\r\nfruits of the tireless industry and garden cultivation of a large and\r\nprosperous population, and the remorseless waters under the influence\r\nof a gale were rolling in muddy surges, “crested with tawny foam,” over\r\nthe fast dissolving homes.\r\n\r\nOn this vast flood we embarked to shorten the distance, and sailed with\r\nthree reefs in the sail for 13 miles over it, till we were brought up\r\nby an insurmountable obstacle in the shape of a tremendous rush of\r\nwater where a bank had given way. There we were compelled to let go two\r\nanchors in the early afternoon. The wind had become foul, and the rain,\r\nwhich fell in torrents, was driven almost horizontally. Nothing that\r\nsuggested human life was in sight. It might have been “the Deluge,” for\r\nthe windows of heaven were opened. There were a muddy, rolling sea, and\r\na black sky, dark with tremendous rain, and the foliage of trees with\r\nsubmerged trunks was alone suggestive of even vegetable life and of the\r\nvillages which had been destroyed by the devouring waters.\r\n\r\nIn 13 miles just one habitation remained standing, a large, handsome\r\nbrick house with entrance arch, quadrangle, curved roofs, large farm\r\nbuildings, and many servants’ houses, some of which were toppling, and\r\nothers were submerged up to their roofs. There was a lookout on the\r\nprincipal roof and he hailed us, but as there were several scows about,\r\nenough to save life, I disregarded him, and we sailed on into the\r\ntempestuous solitude where we anchored.\r\n\r\nThe day darkened slowly into night, the junk rolled with short plunging\r\nrolls, the rain fell more tremendously than ever, and the strong\r\nwind, sweeping through the rigging with a desolate screech, only just\r\noverpowered the clatter on the roof. I was ill. The seas we shipped\r\ndrowned the charcoal, and it was impossible to make tea or arrowroot.\r\nThe rain dripped everywhere through the roof. My lamp spluttered and\r\nwent out and could not be relighted, bedding and clothing were soaked,\r\nmy bed stood in the water, the noise was deafening.\r\n\r\nNever in all my journeys have I felt so solitary. I realized that no\r\nother foreigner was travelling in Manchuria, that there was no help\r\nin illness, and that there was nothing to be done but lie there in\r\nsaturated clothes till things took a turn for the better.\r\n\r\nAnd so they did. By eight the next morning the scene was changed. The\r\nsky was blue and cloudless, there was a cool north wind, and the waste\r\nof water dimpled and glittered, the broken sparkle of its mimic waves\r\nsuggesting the ocean after a destructive storm has become a calm. After\r\nsailing over broad blue water all day, and passing “islands” on which\r\nthe luckier villages were still standing, towards evening we sailed\r\ninto a village of large farmhouses and made fast to the window-bars of\r\none of them, which, being of brick, had not suffered greatly. Eleven of\r\nthe farms had disappeared, and others were in process of disappearing.\r\nThe gardens, farmyards, and open spaces were under 5 feet of water,\r\nthe surface of which was covered by a bubbly scum. The horses and\r\ncattle were in the rooms of the brick houses where many human beings\r\nhad taken refuge. A raft made of farming implements ferried the people\r\namong the few remaining dwellings.\r\n\r\nAt that farm the skipper brought a quantity of rice for his family,\r\nand by a lovely moonlight we sailed over the drowned country to his\r\nvillage. The flood currents were strong, and when we got there we were\r\ndriven against two undermined houses and knocked them down, afterwards\r\ndrifting into a road with fine trees which entangled the mast and sail,\r\nand our stern bumped down the wall of the road, and the current carried\r\nus into a square of semi-submerged houses, and eventually we got into\r\nthe skipper’s garden, and saw his family mounted on tables and chairs\r\non the top of the _kang_.\r\n\r\nTwo uneventful days followed. The boatmen were in ceaseless dread of\r\npirates, and I was so ill that I felt I would rather die than make\r\nanother effort.\r\n\r\nArriving within 3 miles of Mukden, Wong engaged a passenger cart,\r\na conveyance of the roughest description, which is only rendered\r\ntolerable by having its back, sides, and bottom padded with mattresses,\r\nand I was destitute of everything! Nothing can exaggerate the horrors\r\nof an unameliorated Chinese cart on an infamous road. Down into ruts\r\n2 feet deep, out of which three fine mules could scarcely extricate\r\nus, over hillocks and big gnarled roots of trees, through quagmires\r\nand banked ditches, where, in dread of the awful jerk produced by the\r\nmules making a non-simultaneous jump up the farther side, I said to\r\nmyself, “This is my last hour,” getting a blow on my head which made\r\nme see a shower of sparks--so I entered the gate of the outer wall of\r\nbeaten clay 11¹⁄₂ miles in circuit which surrounds the second city of\r\nthe empire. Then, through a quagmire out of which we were dragged by\r\nseven mules, I bruised, breathless, and in great pain, and up a bank\r\nwhere the cart turned over, pulled the mules over with it, and rolled\r\ndown a slight declivity, I found myself in the roof with the cameras\r\non the top of me and my right arm twisted under me, a Chinese crowd\r\ncurious to see the “foreign devil,” a vague impress of disaster in my\r\nsomewhat dazed brain, and Wong raging at large! Then followed a shady\r\ncompound ablaze with flowers, a hearty welcome at the house of Dr.\r\nRoss, the senior missionary of the Scotch U.P. Church, sweet homelike\r\nrooms in a metamorphosed Chinese house, a large shady bedroom replete\r\nwith comforts, the immediate arrival of Dr. Christie, the medical\r\nmissionary, who pronounced my arm-bone “splintered” and the tendons\r\nseverely torn, and placed the limb in splints, and a time of kind and\r\nskilled nursing by Mrs. Ross, and of dreamy restfulness, in which the\r\nhorrors of the hold of the “pea-boat” and of the dark and wind-driven\r\nflood only served to emphasize the comfort and propitiousness of my\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASSENGER CART, MUKDEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMUKDEN AND ITS MISSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMukden stands at an altitude of 160 feet above the sea, in Lat. 41° 51′\r\nN. and Long. 123° 37′ E., in the centre of an immense alluvial plain,\r\nbearing superb crops and liberally sprinkled with farming villages\r\nembowered in wood, a wavy line of low blue hills at a great distance\r\nlimiting the horizon. It is 3 miles from the Hun-ho, a tributary of\r\nthe Liau, and within its outer wall idles along the silvery Siao-ho\r\nor “small river,” with a long Bund affording a delightful promenade\r\nand an airy position for a number of handsome houses, the residences\r\nof missionaries and mandarins, with stately outer and inner gates,\r\nthrough which glimpses are obtained of gardens and flowering plants\r\nand pots. This city of 260,000 inhabitants, owing to its connection\r\nwith the reigning dynasty, is the second city officially in the empire,\r\nand the Peking “boards” with one exception are nominally duplicated\r\nthere. Hence it not only has an army of Chinese and Tartar officials of\r\nall grades, but a large resident population of retired and expectant\r\nmandarins, living in handsome houses and making a great display in the\r\nstreets. There is an incessant movement of mule carts, the cabs of\r\nMukden, with their superb animals and their blue canopies covering both\r\nmule and driver, official mule carts driven at a trot, with four or\r\nmore outriders with white hats and red plumes, private carts belonging\r\nto young mandarin swells, who give daily entertainments at a restaurant\r\non the Bund, mandarins on horseback with runners clearing the way,\r\ncarts waiting for “lotus viewers,” tall, “big-footed” women promenading\r\nwith their children, their hair arranged in loops on silver frames and\r\ndecorated with flowers, hospital patients on stretchers and in chairs,\r\nmen selling melons and candies, and beggars who by blowing through a\r\nleaf imitate the cry of nearly every bird. Then in the summer evenings,\r\nwhen the mercury has fallen to 80°, the servants of rich men bring out\r\nsplendid ponies and mules and walk them on the Bund, and there come\r\nthe crowds to stare at the foreigners and hang round their gates. The\r\npresence of well-dressed women is a feature rare in the East. Up to the\r\nwar people were polite and friendly, but progress was difficult and the\r\nsmell of garlic strong. At night the dogs bark, guns are fired, drums\r\nand gongs are beaten, and the clappers of the watchmen rival each other\r\nin making night hideous.\r\n\r\nAll this life lies between the outer wall and the lofty quadrangular\r\ninner wall, 3 miles in circuit, built of brick, flanked by lofty\r\ntowers, and pierced by eight gates protected by lofty brick bastions.\r\nThis wall, on which three carriages could drive abreast, protects the\r\ncommercial and official part of the city, which is densely crowded,\r\nMukden, besides being a great grain emporium, being the centre of the\r\nChinese fur trade, which attracts buyers from all parts of the world.\r\nFine streets, though full of humps and quagmires, divide the city into\r\nnine wards or quarters, the central quarter being Imperial property,\r\nand containing a fine palace with much decorative yellow tiling, the\r\nexamination hall, and a number of palaces and _yamens_, all solidly\r\nbuilt. To my thinking no Chinese city is so agreeable as Mukden. The\r\nTartar capital is free from that atmosphere of decay which broods over\r\nPeking. Its wide streets are comparatively clean. It is regularly\r\nbuilt, and its fine residences are well kept up. It is a busy place,\r\nand does a large and lucrative trade, specially in grain, beans, and\r\nfurs. It has various industries, which include the tanning and dressing\r\nof furs and the weaving of silk stuffs; its bankers and merchants are\r\nrich, and it has great commercial as well as some political importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF GOD OF LITERATURE, MUKDEN.]\r\n\r\nAs the old capital of Manchuria and the abode of the Prince ancestors\r\nof the family which was placed on the Chinese throne in 1644, it has\r\nspecial privileges, among which are “Ministres de Parade,” nominally\r\nholding the same rank as the actual ministers in Peking. Near it are\r\nthe superb tombs of the ancestors of the present Emperor, on which\r\ngrand avenues of trees converge, bordered by colossal stone animals\r\nafter the fashion of those at the Ming tombs near Peking. Formerly\r\nthe Manchu Emperors made pilgrimages to these tombs and the sacred\r\ncity of their dynasty, but since the second decade of this century the\r\nChinese Emperor’s portrait only has been sent at intervals in solemn\r\nprocession, the Peking road being in the meantime closed to ordinary\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General of Manchuria resides in Mukden, as well as the\r\nmilitary Governor, who is assisted by a civil administrator and by the\r\nPresidents of five Boards. The great offices of State are filled in\r\nduplicate by Chinese and Manchus, and criminals of the two races are\r\ntried in separate courts.\r\n\r\nThe favorable reception given to Christianity is one of the features\r\nof Mukden. The fine pagoda of the Christian Church is _en évidence_\r\neverywhere. The Scotch U.P. missionaries, who have been established\r\nthere for twenty-five years, are on friendly terms with the people, and\r\nspecially with many of the mandarins and high officials, who show them\r\ntokens of regard publicly and privately on all occasions. Dr. Christie,\r\nthe medical missionary, is the trusted friend as well as the medical\r\nadviser of many of the leading officials and their wives, who, with\r\nevery circumstance of ceremonial pomp, have presented complimentary\r\ntablets to the hospital, and altogether the relations between the\r\nChinese and the missionaries are unique. I attribute these special\r\nrelations with the upper classes partly to the fact that Dr. Ross, the\r\nsenior missionary, and Dr. Christie, and those who have joined them\r\nsubsequently, have studied Chinese custom and etiquette very closely,\r\nand are careful to conform to both as far as is possible, while they\r\nare not only keen-sighted for the good that is in the Chinese, but\r\nbring the best out of them.\r\n\r\nThus Christianity, divested of the nonchalant or contemptuous\r\ninsularity by which it is often rendered repulsive, has made\r\nconsiderable progress not only in the capital but in the province,\r\nand until the roads became unsafe there was scarcely a day during my\r\nlong visit in which there were not deputations from distant villages\r\nasking for Christian workers, representing numerous bands of rural\r\nworshippers, who, having received some knowledge of Christianity from\r\nconverts, colporteurs, or catechists, had renounced many idolatrous\r\npractices, and desired further instruction. Of the “professing\r\nChristians,” Dr. Ross said that it was only a very small percentage\r\nwho had heard the Gospel from Europeans! Four thousand were already\r\nbaptized, and nearly as many again were “inquirers” with a view to\r\nbaptism. It was most curious to see men coming daily from remote\r\nregions asking for some one to go and instruct them in the “Jesus\r\ndoctrine,” for “they had learned as much as they could without\r\na teacher.” In many parts of Manchuria there are now Christian\r\ncommunities carrying on their own worship and discipline, and it\r\nis noteworthy that very many of the converts are members of those\r\nSecret Societies whose strongest bond of union is the search after\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\nThe Mission Hospital is one of the largest and best equipped in the\r\nFar East, and besides doing a great medical and surgical work, is a\r\nmedical school in which students pass through a four years’ curriculum.\r\nThere also Dr. Christie gives illustrated popular scientific lectures\r\nin the winter, which are attended among others by a number of sons\r\nof mandarins. Donations, both of money and food, are contributed to\r\nthis hospital both by officials and merchants; and General Tso, a\r\nmost charitable man and beloved by the poor, only the night before\r\nhe started for Korea, sent a bag of tickets for ice, so that the\r\nhospital might not suffer for the lack of it during his absence.\r\nOnly a few months before he presented it with a handsome tablet and\r\nsubscription.[30]\r\n\r\nEven in so civilized a city as Mukden, with its schools and literary\r\nexaminations, its thousands of literary aspirants to official position,\r\nits streets full of a busy and splendid officialism, its enormous\r\ntrade, its banks and _yamens_, its 20,000 Mussulmans, with their many\r\nmosques, and hatred of the pig, and the slow interpenetration of\r\nenlightened Western ideas, Chinese superstitions of the usual order,\r\nwell-known by every reader, prevail.\r\n\r\nThe system of medicine, though it contains the knowledge and use of\r\nsome valuable native drugs among the sixty which are exported, is\r\nin many respects extremely barbarous. The doctors have no operative\r\nsurgery and cannot even tie an artery! They use cupping, the cautery,\r\nand acupuncture hot or cold, with long coarse uncleanly needles, with\r\nwhich they pierce the liver, joints, and stomach for pains, sprains,\r\nand rheumatism. They close all abscesses, wounds, and ulcers with a\r\nblack impervious plaster. Witch doctors are resorted to in cases of\r\nhysteria or mental derangement. Vaccination is now to some extent\r\nadopted with calf or transferred lymph, the puncture being made in the\r\nnostrils. In order to ascertain whether a sick person is likely to\r\nlive, they plunge long needles into the body, and give up the case as\r\nhopeless if blood does not flow. When death is near the friends dress\r\nthe patient in the best clothes they can afford and remove him from the\r\n_kang_ (the usual elevated sleeping place) to the floor, or lay him on\r\nashes. As the spirit departs they cry loudly in the ear. In connection\r\nwith death, it may be mentioned that some of the most striking shops\r\nin Mukden, after the coffin shops, are those in which are manufactured\r\nand sold admirable lifesize representations of horses, men, asses,\r\nelephants, carts, and all the articles of luxury of this life, which\r\nare carried in procession and are burned at the grave, sometimes to the\r\nvalue of $1,000.\r\n\r\nFew children under nine years old are buried, and those only among the\r\nrichest class. When death occurs, the mother, wailing bitterly, wraps\r\nthe body in matting, and throws it away, _i.e._ she places it where the\r\ndogs can get at it. This ghastly burden must not be carried out of a\r\ndoor or window, but through a new or disused opening, in order that the\r\nevil spirit which causes the disease may not enter. The belief is that\r\nthe Heavenly Dog which eats the sun at the time of an eclipse demands\r\nthe bodies of children, and that if they are denied to him he will\r\nbring certain calamity on the household.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the _kang_, which is a marked feature of the houses\r\nand inns of Manchuria, which for its latitude has the coldest winter in\r\nthe world, the mercury often reaching 17° F. below zero. The _kang_ is\r\na brick platform covered with matting and heated economically by flues,\r\nand is at once sleeping and sitting place. The stalks of the _Holcus\r\nSorghum_ are used for fuel. In winter, when the external temperature\r\nmay be a little above and much below zero for a month at a time, the\r\nChinaman, unable to heat his whole room, drops his shoes, mounts his\r\n_kang_, sits crosslegged on the warm mat, covers his padded socks with\r\nhis padded robe, and there takes his meals and receives his friends\r\nin comfort. When I was invited to climb the _kang_ I felt myself a\r\n_persona grata_.\r\n\r\nThe pawnshops of Mukden, with their high outer walls, lofty gateways,\r\ntwo or three well-kept courts, fine buildings, and tall stone columns\r\nat the outer gate, with the sign of the business upon them, their\r\nscrupulous cleanliness, and their armies of polite, intelligent clerks,\r\nare as respectable as banks with us. They demand for every sum borrowed\r\nmovable property to double its amount. If the pledge be not redeemed\r\nwithin two years, it falls to the pawnbroker. Government fixes the\r\ninterest. The proprietor takes the same position as a capitalist owning\r\na bank in the West, and a _samshu_ distiller takes an equal place in\r\nlocal esteem.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of suicide is a feature of Mukden as of most Chinese\r\ncities. Certain peculiarities of Chinese justice render it a favorite\r\nway of wreaking spite upon an employer or neighbor, who is haunted\r\nbesides by the spirit of the self-murderer. Hence servants angry with\r\ntheir masters, shopmen with their employers, wives with their husbands,\r\nand above all, daughters-in-law with their mothers-in-law, show their\r\nspite by dying on their premises, usually by opium, or eating the tops\r\nof lucifer matches! It is quite a common thing for a person who has\r\na grudge against another to go and poison himself in his courtyard,\r\nsecuring revenge first by the mandarin’s inquiry and next by the\r\nhaunting terrors of his malevolent spirit. Young girls were daily\r\npoisoning themselves with lucifer matches to escape from the tyranny of\r\nmothers-in-law and leave unpleasantness behind them.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the seamy side which is uppermost in Mukden.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] General Tso’s cavalry brigade was perhaps the best-disciplined in\r\nthe Chinese army, and he was a severe disciplinarian, but he was also\r\nan earnest philanthropist, and though a strict Mussulman, always showed\r\nhimself friendly to the Christian religion, specially in its benevolent\r\naspects. His soup kitchens saved many a family from starvation. He\r\nestablished and was the chief support of a foundling hospital. During\r\nthe terrible inundation of 1888 he distributed food among the famishing\r\nwith his own hands. His friendly help could always be relied on by the\r\nmissionaries, who joined in the sorrow with which Manchuria mourned for\r\nhis premature death at Phyöng-yang in Korea. The benevolence of rich\r\nChinese ought not to be overlooked. The charities of China are on a\r\ngigantic scale, and many of them are admirably administered by men who\r\nexpend much self-sacrificing effort on their administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCHINESE TROOPS ON THE MARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weeks which I spent in Mukden were full of rumors and excitement.\r\nA few words on the origin of the war with Japan may make the situation\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nThe Tong-haks, as was mentioned in chapter xiii., had on several\r\noccasions defeated the Royal Korean troops, and after much hesitation\r\nthe Korean King invoked the help of China. China replied promptly by\r\ngiving Japan notice of her intention to send troops to Korea on 7th\r\nJune, 1894, both countries, under the treaty of Tientsin, having equal\r\nrights to do so under such circumstances as had then arisen. On the\r\nsame day Japan announced to China a similar intention. The Chinese\r\nGeneral, Yi, landed at A-san with 3,000 men, and the Japanese occupied\r\nChemulpo and Seoul in force.\r\n\r\nIn the Chinese despatch Korea was twice referred to as “our tributary\r\nstate.” Japan replied that the Imperial Government had never recognized\r\nKorea as a tributary state of China.\r\n\r\nThen came three proposals from Japan for the administration of Korea,\r\nto be carried out jointly by herself and China. These were--(1)\r\nExamination of the financial administration; (2) Selection of the\r\ncentral and local officials; (3) The establishment of a disciplined\r\narmy for national defence and the preservation of the peace of the land.\r\n\r\nTo these proposals China replied that Korea must be left to reform\r\nherself, and that the withdrawal of the Japanese troops must precede\r\nany negotiations, a suggestion rejected by Japan, who informed China\r\non 14th July, that she should regard the dispatch of any more troops\r\nto Japan as a belligerent act. On 20th July Japan demanded that the\r\nKing of Korea should order the Chinese troops to leave the country,\r\nthreatening “decisive measures” if this course were not adopted.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the request of the King, the representatives of the\r\nTreaty Powers were endeavoring to maintain peace, suggesting the\r\nsimultaneous withdrawal of the troops of both countries. To this China\r\nagreed, but Japan demanded delay, and on 23rd July took the “decisive\r\nmeasure” she had threatened, assaulted and captured the Palace, and\r\npractically made the King a prisoner, his father, the Tai-Won-Kun, at\r\nhis request, but undoubtedly at Japanese instigation, taking nominally\r\nthe helm of affairs.\r\n\r\nAfter this events marched with great rapidity. On 25th July the\r\ntransport _Kowshing_, flying the British flag and carrying 1,200\r\nChinese troops, was sunk with great loss of life by the Japanese\r\ncruiser _Naniwa_, and four days later the Japanese won the battle of\r\nA-san and dispersed the Chinese army. Before 30th July Korea gave\r\nnotice of the renunciation of the Conventions between herself and\r\nChina, which was equivalent to renouncing Chinese sovereignty. On 1st\r\nAugust war was declared. Of the sequence of these events, and even of\r\nthe events themselves, we knew little or nothing, and up to the middle\r\nof July Mukden kept “the even tenor of its way.”\r\n\r\nManchuria is far less hostile to foreigners than the rest of China, and\r\nthe name “devil” may even be used as a polite address with the prefix\r\nof “honorable”! No European women had previously passed through the\r\ngate of the inner wall and through the city on foot, but I not only was\r\nable to do so without molestation, though several times only attended\r\nby my servant, but actually was able to photograph in the quieter\r\nstreets, the curiosity of the crowd being quite friendly. The Scotch\r\nmissionaries had then been established in Mukden for twenty-two years,\r\nwere on very friendly terms with the people, there was much social\r\nintercourse, and altogether their relations with the Chinese were\r\nunique.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of July, however, the many wild rumors which were\r\nafloat, and the continual passage of troops on their way to Korea\r\n(war being a foregone conclusion before it was declared), produced a\r\ngeneral ferment. I had to abandon peregrinations in the city, and also\r\nphotography, a hostile crowd having mobbed me as I was “taking” the\r\nGate of Victory, in the belief that I kept a black devil in the camera,\r\nwith such a baleful Cyclopean eye that whatever living thing it looked\r\non would die within a year, and any building or wall would crumble away!\r\n\r\nAfter war was declared on 1st August, 1894, things grew worse rapidly.\r\nAs Japan had full command of the sea, all Chinese troops sent to Korea\r\nwere compelled to march through Manchuria, and undisciplined hordes\r\nof Manchu soldiers from Kirin, Tsitsihar, and other northern cities\r\npoured through Mukden at the rate of 1,000 a day, having distinguished\r\nthemselves on the southern march by seizing on whatever they could\r\nget hold of, riotously occupying inns without payment, beating the\r\ninnkeepers, and wrecking Christian chapels, not from anti-Christian but\r\nfrom anti-foreign feeling. Their hatred of foreigners culminated at\r\nLiau-yang, 40 miles from Mukden, when Manchu soldiers, after wrecking\r\nthe Christian chapel, beat Mr. Wylie, a Scotch missionary, to death,\r\nand attacked the chief magistrate for his friendliness to the “foreign\r\ndevils.”\r\n\r\nAnti-foreign feeling rose rapidly in Mukden. The servants of\r\nforeigners, and even the hospital assistants, were insulted in the\r\ntown, and the wildest rumors concerning foreigners were spread and\r\nbelieved. The friendly authorities, who took the safety of the three\r\nmission families into serious consideration, requested them to\r\ngive up their usual journeys into the interior, and to avoid going\r\ninto the city or outside the walls. Next the “street chapels” were\r\nclosed, the native Christians, a large body, being very apprehensive\r\nfor their own safety, being regarded as “one with the foreigners,”\r\nwho, unfortunately, were generally supposed to be “the same as the\r\nJapanese.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATE OF VICTORY, MUKDEN.]\r\n\r\nThe perils of the roads increased. Not a cart or animal was to be seen\r\nnear them. The great inns were closed or had their shutters wrecked,\r\nand the villages and farms were deserted. All tracks converging on\r\nMukden were thronged with troops, not marching, but straggling along\r\nanyhow, every tenth man carrying a great silk banner, but few were\r\narmed with modern weapons. I saw several regiments of fine physique\r\nwithout a rifle among them! In some, gingalls were carried by two men\r\neach, others were armed with antique muzzle-loading muskets, very\r\nrusty, or with long matchlocks, and some carried only spears, or\r\nbayonets fixed on red poles. All were equipped with such umbrellas\r\nand fans as I saw some time later in the ditches of the bloody field\r\nof Phyöng-yang. It was nothing but murder to send thousands of men so\r\narmed to meet the Japanese with their deadly Murata rifles, and the\r\nmen knew it, for when they happened to see a foreigner they made such\r\nremarks as, “This is one of the devils for whom we are going to be\r\nshot,” and when a large party of them, in attempting to make a forcible\r\nentry into the Governor-General’s palace, were threatened by the guard\r\nwith being shot, the reply was, “We are going to be shot in Korea, we\r\nmay as well be shot here.”\r\n\r\nThe nominal pay of soldiers is higher than that of laborers, and it was\r\nonly after the defeat and the great slaughter at A-san that there was\r\nany unwillingness to enter the ranks. The uniform is easy, but unfit\r\nfor hard wear, and very stagey--a short, loose, sleeved red cloak,\r\nbordered with black velvet, loose blue, black, or apricot trousers, and\r\nlong boots of black cotton cloth with thick soles of quilted rag. The\r\ndiscipline may be inferred from the fact that some regiments of fine\r\nphysique straggled through Mukden for the seat of war carrying rusty\r\nmuskets in one hand, and in the other poles with perches, on which\r\nsinging birds were loosely tethered! The men fell out of the ranks\r\nas they pleased, to buy fruit or tobacco or to speak to friends. Yet\r\nthey made a goodly scenic display in their brilliant coloring, with\r\ntheir countless long banners of crimson silk undulating in the breezy\r\nsunshine, and their officers with sable-tailed hats and yellow jackets\r\nriding beside them.\r\n\r\nThose who had rifles and modern weapons at all had them of all makes;\r\nso cartridges of twenty different sorts and sizes were huddled together\r\nwithout any attempt at classification, and in one open space all sorts\r\nwere heaped on the ground, and the soldiers were fitting them to their\r\narms, sometimes trying eight or ten before finding one to suit the\r\nweapon, and throwing them back on the heap! There were neither medical\r\narrangements nor an ambulance corps, Chinese custom being to strip the\r\nwounded and leave them, “wounded men being of no use.” The commissariat\r\nwas not only totally inefficient but grossly dishonest, and where\r\nstores had accumulated the contractors sold them for their own benefit.\r\nThus there was little provision of food or fodder in advance, and in\r\na very short time the soldiers were robbing at large, and eating the\r\nhorses and transport mules. The Chinese soldiers, bad as their drill\r\nand discipline are, are regarded by European officers as “excellent\r\nmaterial,” but the Manchus of the North (Tartars) are a shambling,\r\ndisorderly, insubordinate horde, dreaded by peaceable citizens,\r\npresuming on their Imperial relationship, and in disturbed times little\r\nbetter than licensed brigands.\r\n\r\nAmong the first troops to leave the city was the Fengtien Chinese\r\nbrigade of cavalry 5,000 strong, under General Tso, a brave and\r\nexperienced officer, who was at once feared and trusted, so that\r\nwhen he fell with his face to the foe at Phyöng-yang, his loss\r\ndemoralized the army, and the Japanese showed their appreciation of\r\nhim by erecting an obelisk to his memory. His brigade was in a state\r\nof strict discipline, admirably drilled, and on the whole well armed.\r\nThe troopers were mounted on active, well-built ponies, a little over\r\n13 hands high, up to great weight. After leaving Mukden they were\r\nentangled in a quagmire which extended for 100 miles, and the\r\ntelegrams of disaster were ominous. On the first day their commander\r\nbeheaded six men for taking melons without payment, and on the second\r\nfourteen were decapitated for desertion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE SOLDIERS]\r\n\r\nAfter General Tso’s departure with his disciplined force the disorder\r\nincreased, and the high officials, being left with few reliable\r\nsoldiers, became alarmed for their own positions, the hatred and\r\njealousy between the Chinese and Manchu troops not only constituting\r\none of the great difficulties of the war, but threatening official\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nRumors of disaster soon began to circulate, and with each one the\r\nferment increased, and an Imperial proclamation sent by courier from\r\nPeking in the interests of foreigners, declaring that the Emperor was\r\nonly at war with the “rebel _wojen_” (dwarfs), and was at peace with\r\nall other nations, did little to allay it. The able-bodied beggars\r\nand unemployed coolies in the city were swept into the army, and were\r\nsent off after three weeks’ drill. The mule carts of Mukden and the\r\nneighborhood were requisitioned for transport, paralyzing much of the\r\ntrade of the city. Later, many of these carts were burned as fuel to\r\ncook the mules for the starving troops. As Manchu soldiers continued\r\nto pour in, the shops were closed and the streets deserted at their\r\napproach, and many of the merchants fled to the hills. A Japanese\r\noccupation, ensuring security and order, came to be hoped for by many\r\nsufferers. The price of provisions rose, because the country people had\r\neither been robbed of all or did not dare to bring them in, and even\r\nthe hospital and dispensary for the same reason began to be scantily\r\nattended. After Mr. Wylie’s murder, things became increasingly serious,\r\nand by the end of August it became apparent to the authorities that the\r\nsafety of foreigners would be jeopardized by remaining much longer in\r\nMukden. Somewhat later they left, Dr. Ross and Dr. Christie remaining\r\nbehind for a short time at the special request of the Governor. I\r\nleft on 20th August, and though my friends were very anxious about\r\nmy safety, I reached Newchwang five days later, having encountered no\r\nworse risk than that of an attack by pirates, who captured some junks\r\nwith some loss of life, after I had eluded them by travelling at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nNAGASAKI--WLADIVOSTOK\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse of the rumor regarding the landing of the Japanese\r\nin force on the shores of the Gulf of Pechili, which obtained credence\r\nfor nearly a fortnight in the Far East, fluttered every Cabinet in\r\nEurope, forced even so cool and well-informed a man as Sir Robert Hart\r\ninto hasty action, and produced a hurried exodus of Europeans from\r\nPeking and a scare generally among the foreign residents in North\r\nChina, I returned from Peking to Chefoo to await the course of events.\r\n\r\nThe war, its requirements, and its uncertainties disarranged the\r\nmeans of ocean transit so effectually that, after hanging on for some\r\nweeks, in the midst of daily rumors of great naval engagements, for\r\na steamer for Wladivostok, I only succeeded in getting a passage in\r\na small German boat which reluctantly carried one passenger, and in\r\nwhich I spent a very comfortless five days, in stormy weather, varied\r\nby the pleasant interlude of a day at Nagasaki, then in the full glory\r\nof the chrysanthemum season, and aflame with scarlet maples. Lighted,\r\ncleaned, and policed to perfection, without a hole or a heap, this trim\r\ncity of dwarfs and dolls contrasts agreeably with the filth, squalor,\r\nloathsomeness, and general abominableness which are found in nearly all\r\nChinese cities outside the foreign settlements.\r\n\r\nChinese moved about the streets with an air as of a ruling race,\r\nand worked at their trades and pursued the important calling of\r\n_compradores_ with perfect freedom from annoyance, the only formality\r\nrequired of them being registration; while from China all the Japanese\r\nhad fled by the desire of their consuls, not always unmolested in\r\nperson and property, and any stray “dwarf” then found in a Chinese city\r\nwould have been all but certain to lose his life.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm for the war was still at a white heat. Gifts in money\r\nand kind fell in a continual shower on the Nagasaki authorities,\r\nnothing was talked of but military successes, and a theatre holding\r\n3,000 was giving the profits of two daily performances to crowded\r\naudiences in aid of the War Fund. The fact that ships were only allowed\r\nto enter the port by daylight, and were then piloted by a Government\r\nsteam-launch in charge of a “torpedo pilot,” was the only indication in\r\nthe harbor of an exceptional state of things.\r\n\r\nIt was warm autumn weather at Nagasaki, but when I reached Wladivostok\r\nthe hills which surround its superb harbor were powdered with the first\r\nsnows of winter, and a snowstorm two days later covered the country to\r\na depth of 18 inches. Wooded islands, wooded bays, wooded hills, deep\r\nsheltered channels and inlets, wooded to the water’s edge, bewilder a\r\nstranger, then comes Fort Godobin, and by a sharp turn the harbor is\r\nentered, one of the finest in the world, two and a half miles long by\r\nnearly one wide, with deep water everywhere, so deep that ships drawing\r\n25 feet lie within a stone’s throw of the wharves, and moor at the\r\nGovernment pier.\r\n\r\nThe first view of Wladivostok (“Possession of the East”) is very\r\nstriking, although the vandalism of its builders has deprived it\r\nof its naturally artistic background of wood. Otherwise the purple\r\ntone of the land and the blue crystal of the water reminded me of\r\nsome of our Nova Scotian harbors. There is nothing Asiatic about the\r\naspect of this Pacific capital, and indeed it is rather Transatlantic\r\nthan European. Seated on a deeply embayed and apparently landlocked\r\nharbor, along the shores of which it straggles for more than 3 miles,\r\nclimbing audaciously up the barren sides of denuded hills, irregular,\r\ntreeless-lofty buildings with bold fronts, Government House, “Kuntz\r\nand Albers,” the glittering domes of a Greek cathedral, a Lutheran\r\nchurch, Government Administrative Offices, the Admiralty, the Arsenal,\r\nthe Cadet School, the Naval Club, an Emigrant Home, and the grand and\r\nsolid terminus and offices of the Siberian Railway, rising out of an\r\nirregularity which is not picturesque, attract and hold the voyager’s\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WLADIVOSTOK.]\r\n\r\nRequesting to be taken at once to the Customs, the bewildered air of\r\nastonishment with which my request was met informed me that Wladivostok\r\nhad up to that time been a free port, and that I was at liberty to\r\nland unquestioned. After thumping about for some time among a number\r\nof stout _sampans_ in the midst of an unspeakable Babel, I was hauled\r\non shore by a number of laughing, shouting, dirty Korean youths, who,\r\nafter exchanging pretty hard blows with each other for my coveted\r\npossessions, shouldered them and ran off with them in different\r\ndirections, leaving me stranded with the tripod of my camera, to which\r\nI had clung desperately in the _mêlée_. There were droskies not far\r\noff, and four or five Koreans got hold of me, one dragging me towards\r\none vehicle, others to another, yelling Korean into my ears, till a\r\nCossack policeman came and thumped them into order. There were hundreds\r\nof them on the wharf, and except that they were noisier and more\r\naggressive, it was like landing at Chemulpo. Getting into a drosky, I\r\nsaid, “Golden Horn Hotel,” in my most distinct English, then “Hôtel\r\nCorne d’or,” in my most distinct French. The _moujik_ nodded and\r\ngrinned out of his fur hood, and started at a gallop in the opposite\r\ndirection! I clutched him, and made emphatic signs, speech being\r\nuseless, and he turned and galloped in a right direction, but stopped\r\nat the disreputable doorway of one of the lowest of the many drinking\r\nsaloons with which Wladivostok is infested.\r\n\r\nThere all my Koreans reappeared, vociferating and excited. I started\r\nthe _moujik_ off again at a gallop, the drosky jumping ruts and\r\nbounding out of holes with an energy of elasticity which took my\r\nbreath away, the Koreans racing. More gallops, more stoppages at\r\npothouses, and in this fashion I reached at last the Golded Horn\r\nHotel--a long, rambling, “disjaskit” building, with a shady air of\r\ndisreputableness hanging about it,--the escort of Koreans still\r\ngood-natured and vociferous. The landlady emerged. I tried her in\r\nEnglish and French, but she knew neither. The _moujik_ shouted at us\r\nboth in Russian, a little crowd assembled, each man trying to put\r\nmatters straight, and when every moment made them more entangled, and\r\nthe _moujik_ was gathering up his reins to gallop off on a further\r\nquest, a Russian officer came up, and in excellent English asked if he\r\ncould help me, interpreted my needs to the lady, lent me some _kopecks_\r\nwith which to appease the Koreans and the _moujik_, and gave me the\r\nenjoyment of listening to my own blessed tongue, which I had not heard\r\nfor five days.\r\n\r\nBy a long flight of stairs, past a great bar and dining-room,\r\nwhere _vodka_ was much _en evidence_, even in the forenoon, past a\r\nbilliard-room, occupied even at that early hour, and through a large,\r\ndark, and dusty theatre, I attained my rooms, a “parlor” and bedroom\r\n_en suite_, opening on and looking out upon a yard with pigsties. There\r\nwere five doors, not one of which would lock. The rooms were furnished\r\nin Louis Quatorze style, much gilding and velvet, all ancient and\r\ndusty. They looked as if they had known tragedies, and might know them\r\nagain. The barrier of language was impassable, and I must be unskilled\r\nin the use of signs, for I quite failed to make any one understand that\r\nI wanted food.\r\n\r\nI went out, cashed a circular note at the great German house of\r\nKuntz and Albers, the “Whiteleys” of Eastern Siberia, where all the\r\ninformation that I then needed was given in the most polite way, found\r\nit impossible anywhere else to make myself understood in English or\r\nFrench, failed in an attempt to buy postage stamps or to get food,\r\ndelivered the single letter of introduction which I had somewhat\r\nungraciously accepted, and returned to my melodramatic domicile to\r\nconsider the possibilities of travel, which at that moment were not\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nBefore long Mr. Charles Smith, the oldest foreign resident in\r\nWladivostok, to whom my letter was addressed, called, a kindly and\r\ngenial presence, and, as I afterwards found, full of good deeds and\r\nbenevolence. He took me at once to call on General Unterberger, the\r\nGovernor of the Maritime Province. I think I never saw so gigantic a\r\nman--military, too, from his spurs to his coat collar. As he rose to\r\nreceive me he looked as if his head might eventually touch the lofty\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith is a _persona grata_ in Wladivostok, and very much so with\r\nthe Governor, who consequently received me with much friendliness,\r\nand asked me to let him know my plans. I explained what I wanted to\r\ndo, subject to his approval, and presented my credentials, which\r\nwere of the best. He said that he quite approved of my project, and\r\nwould do anything he could to help me, and wrote on the spot a letter\r\nto the Frontier Commissioner, but he added that the disorganized\r\nand undisciplined state of the Chinese army near the frontier might\r\nrender some modification of my plan necessary, as I afterwards found.\r\nThe Governor and his wife speak excellent English, and the social\r\nintercourse which I had with them afterwards was most agreeable and\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon Mr. Smith returned, and saying that he and his\r\nwife could not endure my staying in that hotel, took me away to his\r\nhome high up on a steep hillside, with a glorious view of the city\r\nand harbor, and of which it is difficult to say whether the sunshine\r\nwere brighter within or without. Under such propitious circumstances\r\nmy two visits became full of sunny memories, and I may be pardoned if\r\nI see Wladivostok a little _couleur de rose_; for the extraordinary\r\nkindness which dogs and shadows the traveller in the Far East were met\r\nwith there in perfection, and where I was received by strangers I left\r\nhighly valued friends.\r\n\r\nAfter a snowstorm splendid weather set in. The snow prevented dust\r\nblasts, the ordinary drawback of an Eastern Siberian winter, the skies\r\nwere brilliant and unclouded, the sunsets carnivals of color, the air\r\nexhilarating, the mercury at night averaging 20°, there was light\r\nwithout heat, the main road was full of sleighs going at a gallop,\r\ntheir bells making low music, all that is unsightly was hidden, and\r\nthis weather continued for five weeks!\r\n\r\n“The Possession of the East” is nothing if not military and naval.\r\nForts, earthworks, at which it is prudent not to look too long or\r\nintently, great military hospitals, huge red brick barracks in every\r\ndirection, offices of military administration, squads of soldiers in\r\nbrown ulsters and peaked _pashaliks_, carrying pickaxes or spades\r\non their shoulders,[31] sappers with their tools, in small parties,\r\nofficers, mostly with portfolios or despatch boxes under their arms,\r\ndashing about in sleighs, and the prohibition of photography, all\r\nindicate its fortress character. Certainly two out of every three\r\npeople in the streets are in uniform, and the Cossack police, who\r\nabound, are practically soldiers.\r\n\r\nNaval it is also. There are ships of war in and out of commission, a\r\nbrand-new admiralty, a navy yard, a floating dock, a magnificent dry\r\ndock, only just completed, and a naval clubhouse, which is one of the\r\nfinest buildings in Wladivostok. No matter that Nature closes the\r\nharbor from Christmas to the end of March! Science has won the victory,\r\nand the port has been kept open for the last two winters by means\r\nof a powerful ice-breaker and the services of the troops in towing\r\nthe blocks of ice out to sea. Large steamers of the “Volunteer Fleet”\r\nleave Odessa and Wladivostok monthly or fortnightly. As the eastern\r\nterminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, Wladivostok aspires to be what\r\nshe surely will be--at once the Gibraltar and Odessa of the Far East,\r\none of the most important of commercial emporiums, as the “distributing\r\npoint” for the commerce of that vast area of prolific country which\r\nlies south of the Amur. Possibly a branch line to Port Shestakoff in\r\nHam-gyöng Do may enable the Government to dispense with the services of\r\nthe ice-breaker!\r\n\r\nThe progress of the city is remarkable. The site, then a forest, was\r\nonly surveyed in 1860. In 1863 many of the trees were felled and some\r\nshanties were erected. Later than that a tiger was shot on the site\r\nof the new Government House, and a man leaving two horses to be shod\r\noutside the smithy had them both devoured by tigers. Gradually the big\r\noaks and pines were cleared away, and wooden houses were slowly added,\r\nuntil 1872, when the removal of the naval establishment of 60 men from\r\nNicolaeffk on the Amur to the new settlement gave it a decided start.\r\nIn 1878 it had a population of 1,400. In 1897 its estimated civil\r\npopulation was 25,000, including 3,000 Koreans, who have their own\r\nsettlement a mile from the city, and are its draymen and porters, and\r\n2,000 Chinese. The latter keep most of the shops, and have obtained\r\na monopoly of the business in meat, fish, game, fruit, vegetables,\r\nand other perishable commodities, their guild being strong enough to\r\nsqueeze the Russians out of the trade in these articles, which are sold\r\nin four large wooden buildings by the harbor known as the “Bazar.”\r\nThere are some good Japanese shops, but the Japanese are usually\r\ndomestic servants at high wages, and after a few years return to enjoy\r\ntheir savings in their own country. A naturalized German is the only\r\nBritish subject, and my host and his family are the only Americans.\r\n\r\nThe capital has two subsidized and two independent lines of steamers,\r\n700 families of Russian assisted emigrants enter Primorsk annually,\r\neach head of a household being required to be the possessor of 600\r\nroubles (£60), and from 8,000 to 10,000 Chinese from the Shan-tung\r\nprovince arrive every spring to fulfil labor contracts, returning to\r\nChina in December, carrying out of the country from 25 to 50 dollars\r\neach, convict labor from the penal settlement of Saghalien having been\r\nabandoned as impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese shops, which are a feature of Wladivostok, undersell both\r\nRussians and Germans, and have an increasing trade. Kuntz and Albers, a\r\nHamburg firm of importers, bankers, shipping agents, and Whiteleyism in\r\ngeneral, with sixty clerks, mostly German, with a few Russians, Danes,\r\nand Koreans, conduct an enormous wholesale and retail business in a\r\n“palatial” pile of brick and stone buildings, and has sixteen branch\r\nhouses in Eastern Siberia, and the German firm of Langalutje runs them\r\nvery closely.\r\n\r\nThe railway station and offices are solid and handsome; an admirably\r\nbuilt railroad, open to the Ussuri Bridge, 186 miles, and progressing\r\ntowards the Amur with great rapidity, points to a new commercial\r\nfuture; streets of shops and dwelling-houses, in which brick and stone\r\nare fast replacing wood, are extending to the north, east, and west,\r\nand along the Gulf of Peter the Great, for fully three miles; and new\r\nand handsome official and private edifices of much pretension were\r\nbeing rapidly completed. One broad road, with houses sometimes on\r\none, sometimes on both sides, running along the hillside for 2 miles\r\nat a considerable height, is the “Main Street” or “High Street” of\r\nWladivostok. Along it are built most of the public buildings, and the\r\ngreat shops and mercantile offices. It is crossed by painfully steep\r\nroads climbing up the hill and descending with equal steepness to the\r\nsea. There are two or three parallel roads of small importance.\r\n\r\nThe builder was at work in all quarters, and the clink of the mason’s\r\ntrowel and the ring of the carpenter’s hammer were only silent for a\r\nfew hours during the night. Several of Government buildings were barely\r\nfinished, and were occupied before they were painted and stuccoed.\r\nBuilding up and pulling down were going on simultaneously. Roads were\r\nbeing graded, culverts and retaining walls built, and wooden houses\r\nshowed signs of disappearing from the principal thoroughfare. There\r\nwas a “boom” in real property. The value of land has risen fabulously.\r\n“Lots” which were bought in 1864 for 600 and 3,000 roubles are now\r\nworth 12,000 and 20,000, and in the centre of the town land is not to\r\nbe bought at any price.\r\n\r\nNewness, progress, hopefulness are characteristics of civil\r\nWladivostok. It has the aspect of a growing city in the American Far\r\nWest. Few things are finished and all are going ahead. The sidewalks\r\nare mostly narrow, and composed of rough planks, with a tendency to\r\ntip up or down, but here and there is a fine piece of granite flagging\r\n10 feet wide. The hotels have more of the shady character of “saloons”\r\nor barrooms than of anything reputable or established. Handsome houses\r\nof brick and stone shoulder wooden shanties. Fashionable carriages or\r\nsleighs bounce over ungraded streets. The antediluvian ox-cart with its\r\nKorean driver bumps and creaks through the streets alongside of the\r\n_troika_, with its three galloping horses in showy harness, and its\r\noccupants in the latest and daintiest of Parisian costumes.\r\n\r\nBut the all-pervading flavor of militarism overpowers the suggestion\r\nof the American Far West. The first buildings on the barren coast are\r\nmilitary hospitals and barracks, and barracks thicken as the city is\r\napproached. The female element is in a remarkable minority. The dull\r\nroll of artillery and commissariat wagons, the tramp, morning and\r\nnight, of brown battalions, and the continual throb of drum and blare\r\nof trumpet and bugle, recall one to the fact that this is the capital\r\nof Russia’s vast, growing, aspiring, Pacific Empire.\r\n\r\nTheatricals, concerts, and balls fill up the winter season. Except\r\non the few days on which snow falls, the skies are cloudless, the\r\ntemperature is not seriously below zero, and the dryness of the air is\r\nvery invigorating. In winters, happily somewhat exceptional, in which\r\nthere is no snowfall, and the strong winds create dust-storms, the\r\nclimate is less agreeable. Spring is abrupt and pleasant, and autumn is\r\na fine season, but summer is hot, damp, and misty.\r\n\r\nA fine Greek cathedral, with many domes and lofty gilded crosses, which\r\ngleam mysteriously in the sunset when the gloom of twilight has wrapped\r\nall else, a prominent Lutheran church, and a Chinese joss-house,\r\nprovide for the religious needs of the population. The Governor of\r\nthe Maritime Province, several of the leading, and many of the lower\r\nofficials are of German origin from the Baltic provinces, Lutherans,\r\nand possibly imbued with a few liberal ideas. But among the kindly,\r\ncultured, and agreeable people whose acquaintance I made in Wladivostok\r\none peculiarity impressed me forcibly--the absolute stagnation of\r\nthought, or the expression of it, on politics and all matters connected\r\nwith them, the administration of government, religion, the orthodox\r\nchurch, dissent, home and foreign policy, etc. It is true that\r\ncertain subjects, and these among the most interesting, are carefully\r\neliminated from conversation, and that to introduce any one of them\r\nmight subject the offender to social ostracism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] The Russian soldier does a great amount of day labor. Far from\r\ndisporting himself in brilliant uniform before the admiring eyes of\r\nboys and “servant girls,” he digs, builds, carpenters, makes shoes and\r\nharness, and does a good civil day’s work in addition to his military\r\nduties, and is paid for this as “piecework” on a fixed scale, his\r\ndaily earnings being duly entered in a book. When he has served his\r\ntime these are handed over to him, and a steady, industrious man makes\r\nenough to set himself up in a small business or on a farm. _Vodka_ and\r\n_schnaps_ are the Russian soldier’s great enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nKOREAN SETTLERS IN SIBERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief object of my visit to Russian Manchuria was to settle for\r\nmyself by personal investigation the vexed question of the condition of\r\nthose Koreans who have found shelter under the Russian flag, a number\r\nestimated in Seoul at 20,000. It was there persistently said that\r\nRussia was banishing them in large numbers, and that several thousands\r\nof them had already recrossed the Tu-men, and were in such poverty that\r\nthe King of Korea had sent agents to the north who were to settle them\r\non lands in Ham-gyöng Do.\r\n\r\nBut in Wladivostok the servant-interpreter difficulty was absolutely\r\ninsurmountable. No efforts on the part of my friends could obtain\r\nwhat did not exist, and I was on the verge of giving up what proved a\r\nvery interesting journey, when the Director of the Siberian Telegraph\r\nLines very kindly liberated the senior official in his department, who\r\nhad not had a holiday for many years, to go with me. Mr. Heidemann, a\r\nGerman from the Baltic provinces, spoke German, Russian, and English\r\nwith nearly equal ease, and as a Russian official was able to make\r\nthings smoother than they might otherwise have been in a very rough\r\npart of Primorsk. He was tall, good-looking, and verging on middle\r\nage, very gentlemanly, never failed in any courtesy, understood how to\r\nmanage _moujiks_, and was a capable and willing interpreter; but he was\r\nofficial, reticent, and uninterested, and gave me the impression of\r\nbeing frozen into his uniform!\r\n\r\nFortified as to my project by the cordial approval of the Governor,\r\nthe courtesy of the Telegraph Department, and the singular splendor of\r\nthe weather, I left Wladivostok by a red sunrise in a small steamer,\r\nwhich accomplished the 60 miles to Possiet Bay in seven hours, landing\r\nus in a deep inlet of clear water and white sand, soon to be closed by\r\nice, at the foot of low and absolutely barren hills fringing off into\r\nsandy knolls, where Koreans with their ox-carts awaited the steamer. A\r\nwell spread tea-table at the house of the Russian postmaster was very\r\nwelcome. Such a strong-looking family I had seldom seen, but afterwards\r\nI found that size and strength are characteristic of the Russian\r\nsettlers in Primorsk.\r\n\r\nPossiet Bay is a large military station of fine barracks and\r\nstorehouses. It scarcely seemed to possess a civil population, but\r\nthere are Korean settlements at no great distance, from which much of\r\nthe beef supply of Wladivostok is derived. We met a number of strong,\r\nthriving-looking Koreans driving 60 fine fat cattle down to the steamer.\r\n\r\nThe post wagon, in which we were cramped up among and under the\r\nmail-bags, took us at a two hours’ gallop along frozen inlets of the\r\nsea and across frozen rivers, over grassy, hilly country, scarcely\r\nenlivened by Korean farms in the valleys, to Nowo Kiewsk, which\r\nwe reached after nightfall, and were hospitably received by the\r\nrepresentative of Messrs. Kuntz and Albers, whose large brick and stone\r\nestablishment is the prominent object in the settlement.\r\n\r\nNowo Kiewsk is a great military post, to which 1,000 civilians, chiefly\r\nKoreans and Chinese, have been attracted by the prospect of gain.\r\nKoreans indeed form the bulk of this population, and do all the hauling\r\nof goods and fuel with their ox-teams. The centre of the town is a\r\ngreat dusty slope intersected by dusty and glaring roads, which resound\r\nat intervals from early morning till sunset with the steady tramp of\r\nbrown-ulstered battalions. Between Possiet Bay and Nowo Kiewsk there\r\nwere 10,000 infantry and artillery, and at the latter post 8 pieces of\r\nfield artillery and 24 two-wheeled ammunition wagons. Barracks for\r\n10,000 more men were in course of rapid construction. Long wooden sheds\r\nshelter the artillery ponies, and villages of low mud-houses of two\r\nrooms each, with windows consisting of a single small pane of glass,\r\nthe families of soldiers. There are great drill and parade grounds and\r\nan imposing Greek church of the usual pattern.\r\n\r\nWith its great open spaces and wide streets, Nowo Kiewsk looks laid out\r\nfor futurity, straggling along a treeless and bushless hill slope for\r\n2 miles. In addition to Kuntz and Albers, with their polyglot staff of\r\nclerks, among whom a young Korean in European dress was conspicuous for\r\nhis gentlemanliness and alacrity, there is another German house, and\r\nthere are forty small shops, chiefly kept by Chinese, at all of which\r\n_schnaps_ and _vodka_ are sold.\r\n\r\nI was detained there for three days while arrangements for my southern\r\njourney were being made, and during that time the Chief of Police, who\r\nspoke French, took me to several Korean villages. So far as I saw and\r\nheard, the whole agricultural population of the neighborhood is Korean,\r\nand is in a very prosperous condition. There, and down to the Korean\r\nfrontier, most of these settlers are doing well, and some of them are\r\ngrowing rich as contractors for the supply of meat and grain to the\r\nRussian forces. At this they have beaten their Chinese neighbors, and\r\nthey actually go into Chinese Manchuria, buy up lean cattle, and fatten\r\nthem for beef. To those who have only seen the Koreans in Korea, such a\r\nstatement will be hardly credible. Yet it does not stand alone, for I\r\nhave it on the best authority that the Korean settlers near Khabaroffka\r\nhave competed so successfully with the Chinese in market gardening that\r\nthe supplying that city with vegetables is now entirely in their hands!\r\n\r\nThe Russian _tarantass_ is one of the most uncouth of civilized\r\nvehicles--all that can be said of it is that it suits the roads, which\r\nin that region are execrable. On two sets of stout wheels and axles,\r\nattached to each other by long solid timbers, a long shallow box is\r\nsecured, with one, two, or even three boards, cushioned or not, “roped”\r\nacross it for seats. It may be drawn by either two or three horses\r\nabreast, one in the shafts and one or two outside, each with the most\r\nslender attachment to the vehicle, and his head held down and inwards\r\nby a tight strap. This outer animal is trained to a showy gallop, which\r\nnever slackens even though the shaft horse may keep up a decorous trot.\r\nThe _tarantass_ has no springs, and, going at a gallop, bumps and\r\nbounces over all obstacles, holes, hillocks, ruts and streams being\r\nalike to it.\r\n\r\nThe _tarantass_ of the Chief of Police made nothing of the obstacles on\r\nthe road to Yantchihe, where we were to hear of a Korean interpreter.\r\nThe level country, narrowing into a valley bordered by fine mountains,\r\nis of deep, rich black soil, and grows almost all cereals and roots.\r\nAll the crops were gathered in and the land was neatly ploughed. Korean\r\nhamlets with houses of a very superior class to those in Korea were\r\nsprinkled over the country. At one of the largest villages, where 140\r\nfamilies were settled on 750 acres of rich land, we called at several\r\nof the peasant farmers’ houses, and were made very welcome, even\r\nthe women coming out to welcome the official with an air of decided\r\npleasure. The farmers had changed the timid, suspicious, or cringing\r\nmanner which is characteristic of them to a great extent at home, for\r\nan air of frankness and manly independence which was most pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Police was a welcome visitor. The Koreans had nothing\r\nto fear, unless his quick scent discerned an insanitary odor or his\r\neye an unwarrantable garbage heap! The farmyards were clean and well\r\nswept, and the domestic animals were lodged in neat sheds. The houses,\r\nof strictly Korean architecture, were large, with five or six rooms,\r\ncarefully thatched, and very neat within, abounding in such comforts\r\nand plenishings as would only be dreamed of by mandarins at home. It\r\nis insisted on, however, that, instead of the flues which heat the\r\nfloors vomiting forth their smoke through many blackened apertures in\r\nthe walls, they shall unite in sending it heavenwards through a hollow\r\ntree trunk placed at a short distance from the house. This, and cleanly\r\nsurroundings in the interests of sanitation, are the only restrictions\r\non their Korean habits. The clothing and dwellings are the same as in\r\nKorea, and the “topknot” flourishes.\r\n\r\nA little farther on there is the large village of Yantchihe, with\r\na neat schoolhouse, in which Russian and Korean pupils sit side by\r\nside at their lessons, a Greek church, singularly rich in internal\r\ndecorations, and a priest’s house adjoining. This is a very prosperous\r\nvillage. In the neat police station a Korean sergeant wrote down my\r\nrequirements and sent off a smart Korean policeman in search of an\r\ninterpreter. Four hundred Koreans in this neighborhood have conformed\r\nto the Greek Church and have received baptism. On asking the priest,\r\nwho was more picturesque than cultivated, and whose large young family\r\nseemed oppressively large for the house, what sort of Christians they\r\nmade, he replied suggestively that they had “a great deal to learn,”\r\nand that there would be “more hope for the next generation.”\r\n\r\nI am not clear in my own mind as to the cause of the success which has\r\nattended “missionary effort” at Yantchihe and elsewhere. The statements\r\nI received on the subject differed widely, and in most cases were made\r\nhesitatingly, as if my informants were not sure of their ground. My\r\nimpression is that while Russia is tolerant of devil-worship, or any\r\nother worship which is not subversive of the externals of morality,\r\n“conformity” is required to obtain for the Korean alien those blessings\r\nwhich belong to naturalization as a Russian subject.\r\n\r\nPreparations being completed for travelling to the Korean frontier,\r\nand into Korea as far as Kyöng-heung, a town which a Trade Convention\r\nin 1888 opened to the residence of Russian subjects in the hope\r\nof creating a market there after the style of Kiachta, I had an\r\ninterview with Mr. Matunin, the Frontier Commissioner, who gave me\r\na very unpleasant account of insecurity on the frontier owing to the\r\nlawlessness of the Chinese troops, and an introduction to the Governor\r\nof Kyöng-heung.\r\n\r\nA large _tarantass_ with three ponies and a driver, a Korean on another\r\npony, and the Korean headman of a neighboring village, who spoke\r\nRussian well, and our saddles were our modest outfit. The details of\r\nthe two days’ journey to the Tu-men are too monotonous for infliction\r\non the reader. The road was infamous, and at times disappeared\r\naltogether on a hillside or in a swamp, and swamps are frequent for\r\nthe first 40 _versts_. The _tarantass_, always attempting a gallop,\r\nbounced, bumped, and thumped, till breathing became a series of gasps.\r\nOccasionally we stuck fast in swampy streams where the ice was broken,\r\nbeing extricated by a tremendous, united, and apparently trained, jump\r\non the part of the ponies, which compelled a strong grip of the vehicle\r\nwith hands and feet, and would have dislocated any other. Mr. Heidemann\r\nsmoked cigarettes unceasingly, and made no remarks.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the head of Possiet Bay and other inlets at a gallop on\r\nthin ice, forded several streams in the aforesaid fashion, and passed\r\nthrough several Korean coast villages given up to the making of salt by\r\na rude process, the finished product being carted away to Hun-chun in\r\nChina in baskets of finely woven reeds. These Chinese carts are drawn\r\nby seven mules each, constantly driven at a gallop.\r\n\r\nAfter 30 _versts_ the country became very hilly, with rugged mountains\r\nin the distance, all without a tree or bush, and covered with coarse\r\nand fine grasses mixed up with myriads of withered flower stalks of\r\n_Compositæ_ and _Umbelliferæ_, and here and there a lonely, belated\r\npurple aster shivered in the strong keen wind, which made an atmosphere\r\nat zero somewhat hard to face. The valleys are flat and broad, and\r\ntheir rich black soil, the product of ages of decaying vegetation, is\r\nabsolutely stoneless. Almost all crops can be raised upon it. Besides\r\nbeing a rich agricultural country, the region is well suited for cattle\r\nbreeding. There were large herds on the hills, and haystacks thickly\r\nscattered over the landscape indicated abundance of winter keep. The\r\npotato, which flourishes and is free from the disease, is largely\r\ncultivated, and is now with the Koreans an article of ordinary diet.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this fine country is settled by Koreans, for the few\r\nhamlets of wretched, tumble-down Chinese houses are of no account.\r\nWhether as squatters or purchasers, they are making the best of the\r\nland. The number of their domestic animals enables them to fertilize\r\nit abundantly; they plough deep, and rotate their crops, and get a\r\nsplendid yield from their lands. We halted at Saretchje, a village\r\nof 120 families, admirably housed, and with all material comforts\r\nabounding about them. Out of its 600 inhabitants, 450 have “conformed.”\r\nThe Koreans, having no religion, are apparently not unwilling to\r\nsecure the possible advantages of conversion, and though none of the\r\nGreek priests who conversed with me were enthusiastic about their\r\n“consistency,” it is at least more satisfactory to see an “_Ecce Homo_”\r\non the wall than the family dæmon.\r\n\r\nAt distances of 3 and 4 miles there are Korean villages, of which\r\nprosperity in greater or less degree is a characteristic. The houses\r\nare large and well-built, and the farmyards are well stocked with\r\ndomestic animals, the people and children are well clothed, and the\r\nvillage lands carefully cultivated.\r\n\r\nA long ascent, during which the road, which for some time had been\r\nintermittent, gradually disappeared, leads to the summit of a high\r\nhill, from which the mountainous frontiers of Russia, China, and Korea\r\nare seen to converge. After losing our way and our time, and crossing\r\nseveral ranges of hills without a road, just as the winter sun was\r\nsetting in a flood of red gold, glorifying the mountains on the Chinese\r\nfrontier, a turn round a bluff revealed what is geographically and\r\npolitically a striking view.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Russo-Korean frontier, 11 miles in length, and a\r\nbroad river full of sandbanks, passing through a desert of sandhills\r\nto the steely blue ocean, lay crimson in the sunset. On a steep bluff\r\nabove the river a tall granite slab marks the spot where the Russian\r\nand Chinese frontiers meet. Across the Tu-men, the barren mountains of\r\nKorea loomed purple through a haze of gold. Three empires are seen at a\r\nglance. A small and poor Korean village is situated in a valley below.\r\nClose to the Boundary Stone, on the high steep bluff above the Tu-men,\r\nthere is a large mud hut from which most of the whitewash had scaled\r\noff, with thatch held on by straw ropes, weighted with stones.\r\n\r\nIt was a very lonely scene. A Korean told us that it was absolutely\r\nimpossible for us to sleep at the village. A Cossack came out of the\r\nhut, took a long look at us, and returned. Then a forlorn-looking\r\ncorporal appeared, who also took a long look, and having hospitable\r\ninstincts, came up and told us that the village was impossible except\r\nfor the drivers and horses, but that he could put us up roughly in the\r\nhut, which consisted of one fair sized room, another very small one,\r\nand a lean-to.\r\n\r\nThe latest English papers had stated that “Russia has lately massed\r\n5,000 men on the Korean frontier, and 4,000 at Hun-chun.” It is not\r\ndesirable to make any inquiries about the positions and numbers of\r\nRussian troops, and I had prudently abstained from asking questions,\r\nand had looked forward with interest to seeing a great display of\r\nmilitary force. This hut is the military post of Krasnoye Celo, and\r\nthe “army” of Russia “massed on her Korean frontier” consisted of 15\r\nmen and a corporal, the officer being required to endure the isolation\r\nof the position for six months, and the privates for one. The roars of\r\nlaughter which greeted the English statement were not complimentary to\r\nnewspaper accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe corporal’s small room was of no particular shape, and was furnished\r\nwith only a deal chair and small table, and a big earthen jar of\r\nwater, but it was well-warmed, and had an iron camp-bed in a recess\r\nwith a wire-wove mattress, much broken and “sagging,” the sharp points\r\nof the broken wires sticking up in several places through the one rug\r\nwith which I attempted to mollify their asperities. This recess, which\r\njust contained the bed, was curtained off for me, and the corporal,\r\nMr. Heidemann, and three Korean headmen lay closely packed on the\r\nfloor. The corporal, glad to have people to talk with, talked more than\r\nhalf the night, and began again before daybreak. We supped on barrack\r\nfare--black bread, barley brose, and tea, with the addition of a little\r\n_kwass_, a very slightly fermented drink, made from black bread,\r\nraisins, sugar, and a little _vodka_, _schnaps_ and _vodka_ containing\r\n40 per cent. of alcohol. At 9 P.M. I was surprised and delighted with\r\nthe noble strains of a Greek Litany, chanted in well-balanced parts\r\nfrom the barrack-room, the evening worship of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nMy last sunset view of the Tu-men was of a sheet of ice. The headmen of\r\nthe Korean villages of Sajorni and Krasnoe, who were in council till\r\nnear midnight, thought it was impossible to get across, and they said\r\nthat the ferryboat was drawn ashore and was frozen in for the winter,\r\nand that two Russian Commissioners and a General, after waiting for\r\nthree days, had left the day before, having failed. However, yielding\r\nto my urgency, they set all the able-bodied men of Sajorni to work at 2\r\nA.M. to dig the boat out, and by 7 she had moved some yards towards the\r\nriver, which, however, was still a sheet of ice. Later, the corporal\r\nsent 14 of his men to help the Koreans, laughingly saying that I had\r\nthe “Whole Russian frontier army to get me across.” At 9 word came\r\nthat the boat was nearly afloat, and we started, on horseback, with\r\ntwo baggage ponies, and rode a mile over the hills and through the\r\nprosperous Korean village of Sajorni, down to a dazzling expanse of\r\nsand through which the Tu-men flows to the sea, there 10 miles off.\r\n\r\nThe river ice was breaking up into large masses under the morning sun,\r\nand between Russia and Korea there was much open water about 600 feet\r\nbroad. The experts said if we could get over at all it would be between\r\nnoon and 2, after which the ice would pack and freeze together again.\r\nKoreans and Cossacks worked with a will, breaking the ice, digging\r\nunder the boat, and moving her with levers, but it was noon before the\r\nunwieldy craft, used for the ferriage of oxen, moved into the water,\r\naccompanied by a hearty cheer. She leaked badly, two men were required\r\nto bale her, and the stern platform, by which animals enter her, was\r\ncarried away. The baggage was carried in by men wading much over their\r\nknees, and then came the turn of the ponies, but not the whole Russian\r\narmy by force or persuasion could get those wretched animals embarked.\r\n\r\nAfter a whole hour’s work and any amount of kicking, plunging,\r\nand injuries, from getting one or two legs over the bulwarks, and\r\nstruggling back, and rolling backwards into the river, two were\r\napparently safe in the ferryboat, when suddenly they knocked over the\r\nman who held them and jumped into the water, one blind animal being\r\nrescued with difficulty, and the other cutting his legs considerably.\r\nThe ice was then fast forming, but the soldiers made one more attempt,\r\nwhich failed, owing to what Americans would not inaptly call the\r\n“cussedness” of the Siberian ponies. For the first time on any journey\r\nI had to confess myself baffled, for it was impossible to swim the\r\ncontumacious animals across, owing to the heavy ice floes and the\r\nlow temperature of the water. I had sat on my pony watching these\r\nproceedings for nearly four hours, watching too the grand Korean\r\nmountains as they swept down to the icy river in every shade of cobalt\r\nblue, varied by indigo shadows of the white cloud masses which sailed\r\nslowly across the heavenly sky. At that point from which I most\r\nreluctantly turned back, the Tu-men has a large volume of water, but\r\nabove and below sandbanks render the navigation so difficult that it\r\nis only in the rainy season that flat-bottomed boats make the attempt,\r\nand not always with success, to reach the Korean town of K’wan, 80\r\n_versts_, or something over 50 miles, above Krasnoye Celo. The Chinese,\r\nin the insane notion that Japan was about to land a large force on the\r\nsouth bank of the Tu-men, had seized all the boats above the Russian\r\npost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN “ARMY,” KRASNOYE CELO.]\r\n\r\nI photographed the “Russian army” and the barracks as well as the\r\nBoundary Stone, and the corporal slouching against the scaly forlorn\r\nquarters on the desolate height in an attitude of extreme dejection, as\r\nwe drove away leaving him to his usual dulness.\r\n\r\nThe days of the return journey gave me a good opportunity of learning\r\nsomething of the condition of the Koreans under another Government than\r\ntheir own. So long ago as 1863, 13 families from Ham-gyöng Do crossed\r\nthe frontier and settled on the river Tyzen Ho, a little to the north\r\nof Possiet Bay. By 1866 there were 100 families there, very poor,\r\namong which the Russian Government distributed cattle and seed for\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nDuring 1869, a year of very great scarcity in Northern Korea, 4,500\r\nKoreans migrated, hunger-driven, into Primorsk, some 3,800 of them\r\nbeing absolutely destitute. These had to be supported, no easy thing,\r\nas the territory, only ceded to Russia a few years before, was but a\r\nthinly peopled wilderness, and was also suffering from a bad harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 there were in Primorsk 32 village districts, _i.e._ villages\r\nwith outlying hamlets, divided into 5 administrative districts. Besides\r\nthese, one village belongs to the city of Khabaroffka on the Amur,\r\nand there are large Korean settlements adjacent to Wladivostok and\r\nNikolskoye. The total number of Korean immigrants is estimated at from\r\n16,000 to 18,000. It must be remembered that several thousands of these\r\nwere literally paupers, and that they subsisted for nearly a year on\r\nthe charity of the Russian authorities, and after that were indebted\r\nto them for seed corn. They settled on the rich lands of the Siberian\r\nvalleys mostly as squatters, but have been unmolested for many years.\r\nMany have purchased the lands they occupy, and in other cases villages\r\nhave acquired community rights to their adjacent lands. It is the\r\nintention of Government that squatting shall gradually be replaced by\r\npurchase, the purchasers receiving legal title-deeds.\r\n\r\nThese alien settlers practically enjoy autonomy. At the head of each\r\ndistrict is an Elder or Headman, with from one to three assistants\r\naccording to its size. The police and their officers are Korean. In\r\neach district there are two or three judges with their clerks, who try\r\nminor offences. The headmen, who are responsible for order and the\r\ncollection of taxes, are paid salaries, or receive various allowances.\r\nAll these officials are Koreans, and are elected by the people\r\nthemselves from among themselves. The Government taxation is 10 roubles\r\n(about £1) on each farm per annum. The local taxation, settled by the\r\nvillagers in council for their own purposes, such as roads, ditches,\r\nbridges, and schools, is limited to 3 roubles per farm per annum. Men\r\nwho are not landholders pay from 1 to 2 roubles per annum.\r\n\r\nKoreans settled in Siberia prior to 1884 can claim rights as Russian\r\nsubjects, and at this time those who can prove that they have been\r\nsettled on purchased lands for ten years can do so, as well as certain\r\nothers, well reported of as being of settled lives and good conduct.\r\nOwing to the steady influx of settlers from Southern Russia, the rich\r\nlands near the railroad are required for colonization, and further\r\nimmigration from Korea has been prohibited; The sending of Koreans who\r\nare either squatters or of unsettled lives to the Amur Province is\r\nunder discussion.\r\n\r\nThe villages between Krasnoye Celo and Nowo Kiewsk are fair average\r\nspecimens of Russo-Korean settlements. The roads are fairly good, and\r\nthe ditches which border them well kept. Sanitary rules are strictly\r\nenforced, the headman being made responsible for village cleanliness.\r\nUnlike the poor, ragged, filthy villages of the peninsula, these\r\nare well-built in Korean style, of whitewashed mud and laths, trimly\r\nthatched, the compounds or farmyards are enclosed by whitewashed walls,\r\nor high fences of neatly woven reeds, and look as if they were swept\r\nevery morning, and the farm buildings are substantial and well kept.\r\nEven the pigsties testify to the Argus eyes of the district chiefs of\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nMost of the dwellings have four, five, and even six rooms, with papered\r\nwalls and ceilings, fretwork doors and windows, “glazed” with white\r\ntranslucent paper, finely matted floors, and an amount of plenishings\r\nrarely to be found even in a mandarin’s house in Korea. Cabinets,\r\nbureaus, and rice chests of ornamental wood with handsome brass\r\ndecorations, low tables, stools, cushions, brass samovars, dressers\r\ndisplaying brass dinner services, brass bowls, china, tea-glasses,\r\nbrass candlesticks, brass kerosene lamps, and a host of other things,\r\nillustrate the capacity to secure comfort. Pictures of the Tsar and\r\nTsaritza, of the Christ, and of Greek saints, and framed cards of\r\ntwelve Christian prayers, replace the coarse daubs of the family dæmons\r\nin very many houses. Out of doors full granaries, ponies, mares with\r\nfoals, black pigs of an improved breed, draught oxen, and fat oxen for\r\nthe Wladivostok market, with ox-carts and agricultural implements,\r\nattest solid material prosperity. It would be impossible for a\r\ntraveller to meet with more cordial hospitality and more cleanly and\r\ncomfortable accommodation than I did in these Korean homes.\r\n\r\nBut there is more than this. The air of the men has undergone a subtle\r\nbut real change, and the women, though they nominally keep up their\r\nhabit of seclusion, have lost the hang-dog air which distinguishes them\r\nat home. The suspiciousness and indolent conceit, and the servility\r\nto his betters, which characterize the home-bred Korean have very\r\ngenerally given place to an independence and manliness of manner rather\r\nBritish than Asiatic. The alacrity of movement is a change also, and\r\nhas replaced the conceited swing of the _yang-ban_ and the heartless\r\nlounge of the peasant. There are many chances for making money, and\r\nthere is neither mandarin nor _yang-ban_ to squeeze it out of the\r\npeople when made, and comforts and a certain appearance of wealth no\r\nlonger attract the rapacious attentions of officials, but are rather\r\na credit to a man than a source of insecurity. All who work can be\r\ncomfortable, and many of the farmers are rich and engage in trade,\r\nmaking and keeping extensive contracts.\r\n\r\nThose Koreans who are not settled on lands chiefly in the direction of\r\nthe Chinese frontier, and who subsist by wood cutting and hauling, are\r\nless well off, and their hamlets have something of squalor about them.\r\n\r\nIn Korea I had learned to think of Koreans as the dregs of a race, and\r\nto regard their condition as hopeless, but in Primorsk I saw reason for\r\nconsiderably modifying my opinion. It must be borne in mind that these\r\npeople, who have raised themselves into a prosperous farming class,\r\nand who get an excellent character for industry and good conduct alike\r\nfrom Russian police officials, Russian settlers, and military officers,\r\nwere not exceptionally industrious and thrifty men. They were mostly\r\nstarving folk who fled from famine, and their prosperity and general\r\ndemeanor give me the hope that their countrymen in Korea, if they ever\r\nhave an honest administration and protection for their earnings, may\r\nslowly develop into _men_.\r\n\r\nIn parts of Western Asia I have had occasion to note the success of\r\nRussian administration in conquered or acquired provinces, and with\r\nsubject races, specially her creation of an orderly, peaceful, and\r\nsettled agricultural population out of the nomadic and predatory tribes\r\nof Turkestan. Her success with the Korean immigrants is in its way as\r\nremarkable, for the material is inferior. She is firm where firmness\r\nis necessary, but outside that limit allows extreme latitude, avoids\r\nharassing aliens by petty prohibitions and irksome rules, encourages\r\nthose forms of local self-government which suit the genius and habits\r\nof different peoples, and trusts to time, education, and contact with\r\nother forms of civilization to amend what is reprehensible in customs,\r\nreligion, and costume.\r\n\r\nA few days later I went to Hun-chun on the frontier of Chinese\r\nManchuria, from its position an important military post, and was most\r\nhospitably received by the Commandant and his married _aide-de-camp_.\r\nThere, as everywhere in Primorsk, and from the civil as well as\r\nthe military authorities, I not only received the utmost kindness,\r\ncourtesy, and hospitality, but information was frankly given on the\r\nvarious topics I was interested in, and help towards the attainment of\r\nmy objects. Hun-chun is in the midst of mountainous country, denuded\r\nof wood in recent years, and abounding in rich, well-watered valleys\r\ninhabited only by Koreans. A wilder, drearier, and more wind-swept\r\nsituation it would be hard to find.\r\n\r\nInstead of “4,000 troops” there were only 200 Cossacks, housed in a\r\ngood brick barrack, one half of which is a much decorated chapel,\r\nbesides which there are only open thatched sheds for their hardy,\r\nactive Baikal horses, a small, well-arranged hospital, a wooden house\r\nfor the Colonel Commandant, and some terra-cotta mud-houses for the\r\nofficers and married troopers. The whole Russian military force from\r\nHun-chun to the Amur consisted of 1,500 Cossacks, distributed among\r\nthirty frontier posts. The Commandant told me that their chief duty at\r\nthat time was the “daily” arresting of Chinese brigands who crossed\r\nthe frontier to harry the Korean villages, and who, on being marched\r\nback and handed over to the mandarins, were at once liberated to repeat\r\ntheir forays.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese had “massed” several thousand of their Manchu troops at\r\nHun-chun, and they had created such a reign of terror that the peasant\r\nfarmers had deserted their homes over a large area of country. The\r\nsoldiers, robbed by their officers of their nominal pay, and only\r\nhalf fed, relied on unlimited pillage for making up the deficiency,\r\nand neither women nor property were safe from their brutality and\r\nviolence. So desperately undisciplined were they that only a few\r\ndays before the Secretary and Interpreter of the Russian frontier\r\nCommissioner at Nowo Kiewsk, visiting Hun-chun on official business,\r\nnarrowly escaped actual violence at their hands, and the Chinese\r\nGovernor told them that he had no control at all over the troops.\r\nIt was only the rigid discipline of the Cossacks which prevented\r\nscrimmages which might have produced a serious conflagration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOREAN SETTLERS’ HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Wladivostok, accompanied by a young Danish gentleman\r\nwho was kindly lent to me by Messrs. Kuntz and Albers, and who spoke\r\nEnglish and Russian, I spent a week on the Ussuri Railway, the eastern\r\nsection of the Trans-Siberian Railway, going as far as the hamlet of\r\nUssuri on the Ussuri River at the great Ussuri Bridge, beyond which\r\nthe line, though completed for 50 _versts_, was not open for traffic.\r\nIndeed, up to that point from Nikolskoye trains were run twice daily\r\nrather to “settle the line” than for profit, and their average speed\r\nwas only twelve miles an hour. The weather was brilliant, varied by a\r\nheavy snowstorm.\r\n\r\nThe present Tsar is understood to be enthusiastic about this railroad.\r\nDuring his visit to Wladivostok in 1891, when Tsarevitch, he\r\ninaugurated the undertaking by wheeling away the first barrowful of\r\nearth and placing the first stone in position, after which, work was\r\nbegun simultaneously at both ends.\r\n\r\nThe eastern terminus of this great railroad undertaking is close to\r\nthe sea and the Government deep water pier, at which the fine steamers\r\nfrom Odessa of the Russian “Volunteer Fleet” discharge their cargoes.\r\nThe station is large and very handsome, and both it and the noble\r\nadministrative offices are built of gray stone, with the architraves\r\nof the doors and windows in red brick. Buffets and all else were in\r\nefficient working order. In the winter of 1895-96 only third and fourth\r\nclass cars were running, the latter chiefly patronized by Koreans and\r\nChinese. Each third class carriage is divided into three compartments\r\nwith a corridor, and has a lavatory and steam-heating apparatus. The\r\nbacks of the seats are hooked up to form upper berths for sleeping, and\r\nas the cars are eight feet high they admit of broad luggage shelves\r\nabove these. The engines which ran the traffic were old American\r\nlocomotives, but those which are to be introduced, as well as all the\r\nrolling stock, are being manufactured in the Baltic provinces. So also\r\nare the rails, the iron and steel bridges, the water tanks, the iron\r\nwork required for stations, and all else.\r\n\r\nLarge railway workshops with rows of substantial houses for artisans\r\nhave been erected at Nikolskoye, 102 _versts_ from Wladivostok, for the\r\nrepairs of rolling stock on the Ussuri section, and were already in\r\nfull activity.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing about this Ussuri Railway of the newness and\r\nprovisional aspect of the Western American lines, or even of parts of\r\nthe Canadian Pacific Railroad. The track was already ballasted as far\r\nas Ussuri (327 _versts_), steel bridges spanned the minor streams, and\r\nsubstantial stations either of stone or decorated wood, with buffets at\r\nfixed distances, successfully compare both in stability and appearance\r\nwith those of our English branch lines. The tank houses are of hewn\r\nstone. Houses for the employés, standing in neatly fenced gardens,\r\nare both decorative and substantial, being built of cement and logs\r\nprotected by five coats of paint, and contain four rooms each. The\r\ncrossings are well laid and protected. Culverts and retaining walls\r\nare of solid masonry, and telegraph wires accompany the road, which\r\nis worked strictly on the block system. The aspect of solidity and\r\npermanence is remarkable. Even the temporary bridge over the Ussuri,\r\n1,050 feet in length, a trestle bridge of heavy timber to resist the\r\nimpact of the ice, is so massive as to make the great steel bridge, the\r\nhandsome abutments of which were already built, appear as if it would\r\nbe a work of supererogation.\r\n\r\nUp to that point there are no serious embankments or cuttings, and the\r\ngradients are easy. The cost of construction of the Ussuri section is\r\n50,000 roubles per _verst_, a rouble at this time being worth about\r\n2s. 2d. This includes rolling stock, stations, and all bridges except\r\nthat over the Amur, which was to cost 3,000,000 roubles, but may now be\r\ndispensed with owing to the diversion of the route through Manchuria.\r\nConvict labor was abandoned in 1894, and the line in Primorsk is being\r\nconstructed by Chinese “navvies,” who earn about 80 cents per day,\r\nand who were bearing the rigor of a Siberian winter in well-warmed,\r\nsemi-subterranean huts, the line being pushed on as much as possible\r\nduring the cold season. For the first 102 _versts_, it passes along\r\nprettily wooded shores of inlets and banks of streams, and the country\r\nis fairly well peopled, judging from the number of sleighs and the\r\nbustle at the six stations _en route_. The line as far as Nikolskoye\r\nwas opened in early November, 1893, and in a year had earned 280,000\r\nroubles. The last section had only been open for eight weeks when I\r\ntravelled upon it.\r\n\r\nNikolskoye, where I spent two pleasant days at the hospitable\r\nestablishment of Messrs. Kuntz and Albers, is the only place between\r\nWladivostok and Ussuri of any present importance. It is a _village_ of\r\n8,000 inhabitants on a rich rolling prairie, watered by the Siphun. It\r\nhas six streets of grotesque width, a _verst_ and a half long each.\r\nThere is no poverty. It is a place of rapid growth and prosperity, the\r\ncentre of a great trade in grain, and has a large flour mill owned by\r\nMr. Lindholm, a Government contractor. It has a spacious market-place\r\nand bazaar, and two churches. It reminds me of parts of Salt Lake City,\r\nand the houses are of wood, plastered and whitewashed, with corrugated\r\niron roofs mainly. A few are thatched. All stand in plots of garden\r\nground. Utilitarianism is supreme. I drove for 20 miles in the region\r\nround the settlement, and everywhere saw prosperous farms and farming\r\nvillages on the prairie, Russian and Korean, and found the settlers\r\nkindly and hospitable, and surrounded by material comfort. Nikolskoye\r\nis a great military station. There were infantry and artillery to\r\nthe number of 9,000, and there, as elsewhere, large new barracks were\r\nbeing pushed to completion. An area of 50 acres was covered with brick\r\nbarracks, magazines, stables, drill and parade grounds, and officers’\r\nquarters, and the military club is a really fine building. Newness,\r\nprogress, and confidence in the future are as characteristic of\r\nNikolskoye as of any rising town in the Far West of America.\r\n\r\nThe farther journey, occupying the greater part of two days and a\r\nnight, except when near the swamps of the Hanka Lake, is through a\r\nsuperb farming region. Large villages with windmills are met with along\r\nthe line for the first 30 _versts_, as far as the buffet station of\r\nSpasskoje. The stoneless soil, a rich loam 6 feet and more in depth,\r\nproduces heavy crops of oats, wheat, barley, maize, rye, potatoes, and\r\ntobacco. Beyond Spasskoje and east of the Hanka Lake up to the Amur a\r\nmagnificent region waits to be peopled.\r\n\r\nWell may Eastern Siberia receive the name of Russia’s “Pacific Empire,”\r\nincluding as it does the Amur and Maritime provinces, with their\r\narea of 880,000 square miles,[32] rich in gold, copper, iron, lead,\r\nand coal, and with a soil which for a vast extent is of unbounded\r\nfertility. When China ceded to Russia in 1860 the region which we\r\ncall Russian Manchuria, she probably did so in ignorance of its vast\r\nagricultural capacities and mineral wealth.\r\n\r\nThe noble Amur, with its forest-covered shores, is navigable for\r\n1,000 miles, and already 50 merchant steamers ply upon it, and its\r\ngreat tributary the Ussuri can be navigated to within 120 miles of\r\nWladivostok. The great basin of the Ussuri, it is estimated, could\r\nsupport five million people, and from Khabaroffka to the Tu-men, it is\r\nconsidered by experts that the land could sustain from 20 to 40 to the\r\nsquare mile, while at present the population of the Amur and Ussuri\r\nprovinces is only ⁴⁄₅ths of a man to the square mile!\r\n\r\nGrass, timber, water, coal, minerals, a soil as rich as the prairies of\r\nIllinois, and a climate not only favorable to agriculture but to human\r\nhealth, all await the settler, and the broad, unoccupied, and fertile\r\nlands which Russian Manchuria offers are clamoring for inhabitants.\r\nTo set against these advantages there are the frozen waterways and\r\nthe ice-bound harbor. It is utterly impossible that an increasing\r\npopulation will content itself without an outlet for its produce.\r\nA port on the Pacific open all the year is fast becoming as much a\r\ncommercial as a political necessity, and doubtless the opening of the\r\nTrans-Siberian Railroad four years hence will settle the question (if\r\nit has not been settled before) and doom the policy which has shut\r\nRussia up in regions of “thick ribbed ice” to utter extinction.\r\n\r\nIn the Maritime Province, Russia is steadily and solidly laying the\r\nfoundations of a new empire which she purposes to make as nearly as\r\npossible a homogeneous one. “No foreigner need apply”! The emigrants,\r\nwho are going out at the rate of from 700 to 1,000 families a year,\r\nare of a good class. Emigration is fostered in two ways. By the first,\r\nthe Government grants assisted passages to heads of families who are\r\npossessed of 600 roubles (about £60 at present), which are deposited\r\nwith a Government official at Odessa, and are repaid to the emigrant\r\non landing at Wladivostok. The industry and thrift represented by\r\nthis sum indicate a large proportion of the best class of settlers.\r\nUnder the second arrangement, families possessed of little capital or\r\nnone receive free passages. On arriving, emigrants of both classes\r\nare lodged in excellent emigrant barracks, and can buy the necessary\r\nagricultural implements at cost price from a Government depôt, advice\r\nas to the purchase being thrown in. Each family receives a free\r\nallotment of from 200 to 300 acres of arable land, and a loan of 600\r\nroubles, to be repaid without interest in thirty-two years, the young\r\nmale colonists being exempted from military service for the same\r\nperiod. Already much of the land along the line as far as the Ussuri\r\nhas been allotted, and houses are rapidly springing up, and there is\r\nnothing to prevent this fine country from being peopled up to the Amur,\r\nthe rivers Sungacha and Ussuri, which form the boundary of Russia\r\nfrom the Hanka Lake to Khabaroffka, giving a natural protection from\r\nChinese brigandage. In addition to direct emigration, large numbers of\r\ntime-expired men, chiefly Cossacks, are encouraged to settle on lands\r\nand do so.\r\n\r\nIt would be shortsighted to minimize the importance of the present\r\ndrift of population to Eastern Siberia, which is likely to assume\r\nimmense proportions on the opening of the railway, or the commercial\r\nvalue of that colossal undertaking, which is greatly enhanced by the\r\ntreaty under which Russia has taken powers to run the Trans-Siberian\r\nline through Chinese Manchuria. The creation of a new route which\r\nwill bring the Far East within 6,000 miles and 16 days of London, and\r\ncheapen the cost of the transit of passengers very considerably, cannot\r\nbe overlooked either. The railroad is being built for futurity, and is\r\nan enterprize worthy of the great nation which undertakes it.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] The area of France is 204,000, and that of the British Isles\r\n120,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n[33] I am very glad to be able to fortify my opinion of the solid\r\nand careful construction of this line by that of Colonel Waters,\r\nmilitary attaché to the British Embassy at St. Petersburg, who has\r\nrecently crossed Siberia, and desires to give emphatic testimony to\r\n“the magnificent character of the great railway crossing Siberia,”\r\nas well as by that of another recent traveller, Mr. J. Y. Simpson,\r\nwho, in _Blackwood’s Magazine_ for January, 1897, in an article “The\r\nGreat Siberian Iron Road,” after a long description of the laborious\r\ncarefulness with which the line is being built, writes thus: “Lastly,\r\none is impressed with the _extremely finished_ nature of the work.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE KING’S OATH--AN AUDIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Wladivostok by the last Japanese steamer of the season, I\r\nspent two days at Wön-san, little changed, except that its background\r\nof mountains was snow-covered, that the Koreans were enriched by the\r\nextravagant sums paid for labor by the Japanese during the war, that\r\nbusiness was active, and that Japanese sentries in wooden sentry-boxes\r\nguarded the peaceful streets. Twelve thousand Japanese troops had\r\npassed through Wön-san on their way to Phyöng-yang. At Fusan, my next\r\npoint, there were 200 Japanese soldiers, new waterworks, and a military\r\ncemetery on a height, in which the number of graves showed an enormous\r\nJapanese mortality.\r\n\r\nReaching Chemulpo on 5th January, 1895, _viâ_ Nagasaki, I found a\r\nsingular contrast to the crowd, bustle, and excitement of the previous\r\nJune. In the outer harbor there were two foreign warships only, in the\r\ninner three Japanese merchant steamers. The former predominant military\r\nelement was represented by a few soldiers, ten large hospital sheds,\r\nand a crowded cemetery, in which the Japanese military dead lie in rows\r\nof 60, each grave marked by a wooden obelisk. The solid and crowded\r\nChinese quarter, with its roaring trade, large shops, and noise of\r\ndrums, gongs, and crackers, by day and night, was silent and deserted,\r\nand not a single Chinese was in the street as I went up to I-tai’s inn.\r\nOne shop had ventured to reopen. At night, instead of throngs, noise,\r\nlights, and jollification, there was a solitary glimmer from behind a\r\nclosed shutter. The Japanese occupation had been as destructive of that\r\nquarter of Chemulpo as a mediæval pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese quarter and all along the shore the utmost activity\r\nprevailed. The beach was stacked with incoming and outgoing cargo. The\r\nstreets were only just passable, not alone from the enormous traffic on\r\nbulls’ and coolies’ backs, but from the piles of beans and rice which\r\nwere being measured and packed on the roadway. Prices were high, wages\r\nhad more than doubled, “squeezing” was diminished, and the Koreans were\r\nworking with a will.\r\n\r\nI went up to Seoul on horseback, snow falling the whole time. So safe\r\nwas the country that no escort was needed, and I rode as far as Oricol\r\nwithout even a _mapu_. The halfway house of my first visit was a\r\nJapanese post, and going to it in ignorance of the change, I was very\r\nkindly received by the Japanese soldiers, who gave me tea and a brazier\r\nof charcoal. The Seoul road, pegged out by Japanese surveyors for a\r\nrailroad, was thickly sprinkled for the whole distance with laden men\r\nand bulls.\r\n\r\nAt Seoul I was the guest of Mr. Hillier, the British Consul-General,\r\nfor five weeks. The weather was glorious, and the mercury sank on\r\ntwo occasions to 7° below zero, the lowest temperature on record. I\r\nreceived the warmest welcome from the kindly foreign community, and was\r\nsteeped in Seoul life, the political and other interests growing upon\r\nme daily; and having a pony and a soldier at my disposal, I saw the\r\ncity in all its turnings and windings, and the charming country outside\r\nthe gates, and several of the Royal tombs with their fine trees, and\r\navenues of stately stone figures.\r\n\r\nThe stagnation of the previous winter was at an end. Japan was in the\r\nascendant. She had a large garrison in the capital, some of the leading\r\nmen in the Cabinet were her nominees, her officers were drilling the\r\nKorean army, changes, if not improvements, were everywhere, and the air\r\nwas thick with rumors of more to come. The King, whose Royal authority\r\nwas nominally restored to him, accepted the situation, the Queen was\r\ncredited with intriguing against the Japanese, but Count Inouye was\r\nacting as Japanese minister, and his firmness and tact kept everything\r\nsmooth on the surface.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January, 1895, I witnessed a singular ceremony, which\r\nmay have far-reaching results in Korean history. The Japanese having\r\npresented Korea with the gift of Independence, demanded that the King\r\nshould formally and publicly renounce the suzerainty of China, and\r\nhaving resolved to cleanse the Augean stable of official corruption,\r\nthey compelled him to inaugurate the task by proceeding in semi-state\r\nto the Altar of the Spirits of the Land, and there proclaiming Korean\r\nindependence, and swearing before the spirits of his ancestors to the\r\nproposed reforms. His Majesty, by exaggerating a trivial ailment, had\r\nfor some time delayed a step which was very repulsive to him, and even\r\nthe day before the ceremony, a dream in which an Ancestral Spirit\r\nhad appeared to him adjuring him not to depart from ancestral ways,\r\nterrified him from taking the proposed pledge.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of Count Inouye proved more masterful than the Ancestral\r\nSpirit, and the oath was taken in circumstances of great solemnity in a\r\ndark pine wood, under the shadow of Puk Han, at the most sacred altar\r\nin Korea, in presence of the Court and the dignitaries of the kingdom.\r\nOld and serious men had fasted and mourned for two previous days, and\r\nin the vast crowd of white-robed and black-hatted men which looked down\r\nupon the striking scene from a hill in the grounds of the Mulberry\r\nPalace, there was not a smile or a spoken word. The sky was dark and\r\ngrim, and a bitter east wind was blowing--ominous signs in Korean\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\nThe Royal procession, which had something of the aspect of the\r\n_kur-dong_, was shorn of the barbaric splendor which made that\r\nceremonial one of the most imposing in the Eastern world. It was, in\r\nfact, barbaric with the splendor left out; and there were suggestions\r\nof a new era and a forthcoming swamping wave of Western civilization,\r\nin the presence within the Palace gates and in the procession of a\r\nfew trim, dapper, blue-ulstered Japanese policemen, as the special\r\nprotectors of the Home Minister Pak-Yöng-Ho, one of the revolutionaries\r\nof 1884, against whom there was a vow of vengeance, though the King had\r\nbeen compelled to pardon him, to reinstate his ancestors who had been\r\ndegraded, to recall him from exile, and to confer upon him high office.\r\n\r\nThe long road outside the Palace was lined with Korean cavalry, who\r\nturned their faces to the wall and their backs and their ponies’ tails\r\nto the King. Great numbers of Korean soldiers carrying various makes\r\nof muskets, dressed in rusty black, brown, and blue cotton uniforms,\r\ntrousers sometimes a foot too short, at others a foot too long, white\r\nwadded socks, string shoes, and black felt hats of Tyrolese style, with\r\npink ribbon round the crowns, stood in awkward huddles, mixed up with\r\nthe newly-created Seoul police in blue European uniforms, and a number\r\nof handsome overfed ponies of Court officials, with saddles over a foot\r\nhigh, gorgeous barbaric trappings, red pompons on their heads, and a\r\nflow of red manes. The populace stood without speech or movement.\r\n\r\nAfter a long delay and much speculation as to whether the King at\r\nthe last moment would resist the foreign pressure, the procession\r\nemerged from the Palace gate--huge flags on trident-headed poles,\r\npurple bundles carried aloft, a stand of stones conveyed with much\r\nceremony[34]--groups of scarlet- and blue-robed men in hats of the\r\nsame colors, shaped like fools’ caps, the King’s personal servants in\r\nyellow robes and yellow bamboo hats, and men carrying bannerets. Then\r\ncame the red silk umbrella, followed not by the magnificent State chair\r\nwith its forty bearers, but by a plain wooden chair with glass sides,\r\nin which sat the sovereign, pale and dejected, borne by only four men.\r\nThe Crown Prince followed in a similar chair. Mandarins, ministers,\r\nand military officers were then assisted to mount their caparisoned\r\nponies, and each, with two attendants holding his stirrups and two\r\nmore leading his pony, fell in behind the Home Minister, riding a dark\r\ndonkey, and rendered conspicuous by his foreign saddle and foreign\r\nguard. When the procession reached the sacred enclosure, the military\r\nescort and the greater part of the cavalcade remained outside the wall,\r\nonly the King, dignitaries, and principal attendants proceeding to the\r\naltar. The grouping of the scarlet-robed men under the dark pines was\r\nmost effective from an artistic point of view, and from a political\r\nstandpoint the taking of the following oath by the Korean King was one\r\nof the most significant acts in the tedious drama of the late war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOREAN THRONE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING’S OATH.\r\n\r\n On this 12th day of the 12th moon of the 503rd year of the founding\r\n of the Dynasty, we presume to announce clearly to the Spirits of\r\n all our Sacred Imperial Ancestors that we, their lowly descendant,\r\n received in early childhood, now thirty and one years ago, the mighty\r\n heritage of our ancestors, and that in reverent awe towards Heaven,\r\n and following in the rule and pattern of our ancestors, we, though we\r\n have encountered many troubles, have not loosed hold of the thread.\r\n How dare we, your lowly descendant, aver that we are acceptable to\r\n the heart of Heaven? It is only that our ancestors have graciously\r\n looked down upon us and benignly protected us. Splendidly did our\r\n ancestor lay the foundation of our Royal House, opening a way for us\r\n his descendants through five hundred years and three. Now, in our\r\n generation, the times are mightily changed, and men and matters are\r\n expanding. A friendly Power, designing to prove faithful, and the\r\n deliberations of our Council aiding thereto, show that only as an\r\n independent ruler can we make our country strong. How can we, your\r\n lowly descendant, not conform to the spirit of the time and thus guard\r\n the domain bequeathed by our ancestors? How venture not to strenuously\r\n exert ourselves and stiffen and anneal us in order to add lustre\r\n to the virtues of our predecessors. For all time from now no other\r\n State will we lean upon, but will make broad the steps of our country\r\n towards prosperity, building up the happiness of our people in order\r\n to strengthen the foundations of our independence. When we ponder on\r\n this course, let there be no sticking in the old ways, no practice of\r\n ease or of dalliance; but docilely let us carry out the great designs\r\n of our ancestors, watching and observing sublunary conditions,\r\n reforming our internal administration, remedying there accumulated\r\n abuses.\r\n\r\n We, your lowly descendant, do now take the fourteen clauses of the\r\n Great Charter and swear before the Spirits of our Ancestors in\r\n Heaven that we, reverently trusting in the merits bequeathed by our\r\n ancestors, will bring these to a successful issue, nor will we dare to\r\n go back on our word. Do you, bright Spirits, descend and behold!\r\n\r\n 1. All thoughts of dependence on China shall be cut away, and a firm\r\n foundation for independence secured.\r\n\r\n 2. A rule and ordinance for the Royal House shall be established, in\r\n order to make clear the line of succession and precedence among the\r\n Royal family.\r\n\r\n 3. The King shall attend at the Great Hall for the inspection of\r\n affairs, where, after personally interrogating his Ministers, he shall\r\n decide upon matters of State. The Queen and the Royal family are not\r\n allowed to interfere.\r\n\r\n 4. Palace matters and the government of the country must be kept\r\n separate, and may not be mixed up together.\r\n\r\n 5. The duties and powers of the Cabinet and of the various Ministers\r\n shall be clearly defined.\r\n\r\n 6. The payment of taxes by the people shall be regulated by law.\r\n Wrongful additions may not be made to the list, and no excess\r\n collected.\r\n\r\n 7. The assessment and collection of the land tax, and the disbursement\r\n of expenditure, shall be under the charge and control of the Finance\r\n Department.\r\n\r\n 8. The expenses of the Royal household shall be the first to be\r\n reduced, by way of setting an example to the various Ministries and\r\n local officials.\r\n\r\n 9. An estimate shall be drawn up in advance each year of the\r\n expenditure of the Royal household and the various official\r\n establishments, putting on a firm foundation the management of the\r\n revenue.\r\n\r\n 10. The regulations of the local officers must be revised in order to\r\n discriminate the functions of the local officials.\r\n\r\n 11. Young men of intelligence in the country shall be sent abroad in\r\n order to study foreign science and industries.\r\n\r\n 12. The instruction of army officers, and the practice of the methods\r\n of enlistment, to secure the foundation of a military system.\r\n\r\n 13. Civil law and criminal law must be strictly and clearly laid down;\r\n none must be imprisoned or fined in excess, so that security of life\r\n and property may be ensured for all alike.\r\n\r\n 14. Men shall be employed without regard to their origin, and in\r\n seeking for officials recourse shall be had to capital and country\r\n alike in order to widen the avenues for ability.\r\n\r\n Official translation of the text of the oath taken by His Majesty the\r\n King of Korea, at the Altar of Heaven, Seoul, on January 8, 1895.\r\n\r\nThough at this date Korea is being reformed under other than Japanese\r\nauspices, it is noteworthy that nearly every step in advance is on the\r\nlines laid down by Japan.\r\n\r\nCount Inouye is reported by the _Nichi Nichi Shimbun_ to have said\r\nregarding Korea, “In my eyes there were only the Royal Family and the\r\nnation.” Such a conclusion was legitimate in the early part of 1895,\r\nand in arriving at it as I did I am glad to be sheltered by such an\r\nunexceptionable authority.\r\n\r\nHence it was with real pleasure that I received an invitation from\r\nthe Queen to a private audience, to which I was accompanied by Mrs.\r\nUnderwood, an American medical missionary and the Queen’s physician\r\nand valued friend. Mr. Hillier sent me to the Kyeng-pok Palace in an\r\neight-bearer official chair, escorted by the Korean Legation Guard.\r\nI have been altogether six times at this palace, and always with\r\nincreased wonder at its intricacy, and admiration of its quaintness and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nEntering by a grand three-arched gateway with its stone-balustraded\r\nstone staircase, and stone lions on stone pedestals below, one\r\nis bewildered by the number of large flagged courtyards, huge\r\naudience-halls, pavilions, buildings of all descriptions more or less\r\ndecorated, stone bridges, narrow passages, and gateways with double\r\ntiered carved roofs through and among which one passes. A Japanese\r\npoliceman was at the grand gate. At each of the interior gates, and\r\nthere are many, there were six Korean sentries lounging, who pulled\r\nthemselves together as we approached and presented arms! What with 800\r\ntroops, 1,500 attendants and officials of all descriptions, courtiers\r\nand ministers and their attendants, secretaries, messengers, and\r\nhangers-on, the vast enclosure of the Palace seemed as crowded and\r\npopulated as the city itself. We had nearly half a mile of buildings\r\nto pass through before we reached a very pretty artificial lake with\r\na decorative island pavilion in the centre, near which are a foreign\r\npalace, built not long before, and the simple Korean buildings then\r\noccupied by the King and Queen. Alighting at the gateway of the\r\ncourtyard which led to the Queen’s house, we were received by the Court\r\ninterpreter, a number of eunuchs, two of the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting,\r\nand her nurse, who was at the head of the Palace ladies--a very\r\nprivileged person, middle-aged, with decidedly fine features.\r\n\r\nIn a simple room hung with yellow silk we were entertained in courteous\r\nfashion with coffee and cake on arriving, and afterwards at dinner,\r\nthe nurse, “supported” by the Court interpreter, taking the head of\r\nthe very prettily decorated table. The dinner was admirably cooked in\r\n“foreign style,” and included soup, fish, quails, wild duck, pheasant,\r\nstuffed and rolled beef, vegetables, creams, glacé walnuts, fruit,\r\nclaret, and coffee. Several of the Court ladies and others sat at table\r\nwith us. After this long delay we were ushered, accompanied only by\r\nthe interpreter, into a small audience-room, upon the dais at one end\r\nof which stood the King, the Crown Prince, and the Queen in front of\r\nthree crimson velvet chairs, which, after Mrs. Underwood had presented\r\nme, they resumed and asked us to be seated on two chairs which were\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, who was then past forty, was a very nice-looking slender\r\nwoman, with glossy raven-black hair and a very pale skin, the pallor\r\nenhanced by the use of pearl powder. The eyes were cold and keen, and\r\nthe general expression one of brilliant intelligence. She wore a very\r\nhandsome, very full, and very long skirt of mazarine blue brocade,\r\nheavily pleated, With the waist under the arms, and a full sleeved\r\nbodice of crimson and blue brocade, clasped at the throat by a coral\r\nrosette, and girdled by six crimson and blue cords, each one clasped\r\nwith a coral rosette, with a crimson silk tassel hanging from it. Her\r\nhead-dress was a crownless black silk cap edged with fur, pointed over\r\nthe brow, with a coral rose and full red tassel in front, and jewelled\r\naigrettes on either side. Her shoes were of the same brocade as her\r\ndress. As soon as she began to speak, and especially when she became\r\ninterested in conversation, her face lighted up into something very\r\nlike beauty.\r\n\r\nThe King is short and sallow, certainly a plain man, wearing a thin\r\nmoustache and a tuft on the chin. He is nervous and twitches his hands,\r\nbut his pose and manner are not without dignity. His face is pleasing,\r\nand his kindliness of nature is well-known. In conversation the Queen\r\nprompted him a good deal. He and the Crown Prince were dressed alike\r\nin white leather shoes, wadded silk socks, and voluminous wadded white\r\ntrousers. Over these they wore first, white silk tunics, next pale\r\ngreen ones, and over all sleeveless dresses of mazarine blue brocade.\r\nThe whole costume, being exquisitively fresh, was pleasing. On their\r\nheads they wore hats and _mung-huns_ of very fine horsehair gauze, with\r\nblack silk hoods bordered with fur, for the mercury stood at 5° below\r\nzero. The Crown Prince is fat and flabby, and though unfortunately\r\nvery near-sighted, etiquette forbids him to wear spectacles, and at\r\nthat time he produced on every one as on me the impression of being\r\ncompletely an invalid. He was the only son and the idol of his mother,\r\nwho lived in ceaseless anxiety about his health, and in dread lest the\r\nson of a concubine should be declared heir to the throne. To this cause\r\nmust be attributed several of her unscrupulous acts, her invoking the\r\ncontinual aid of sorcerers, and her always increasing benefactions to\r\nthe Buddhist monks. During much of the audience mother and son sat with\r\nclasped hands.\r\n\r\nAfter the Queen had said many kind things to me personally, showing\r\nherself quick-witted as well as courteous, she said something to\r\nthe King, who immediately took up the conversation and continued it\r\nfor another half-hour. At the close of the audience I asked leave to\r\nphotograph the Lake Pavilion, and the King said, “Why that alone?\r\ncome many days and photograph many things,” mentioning several;\r\nand he added, “I should like you to be suitably attended.” We then\r\ncurtseyed ourselves out, after a very agreeable and interesting hour,\r\nand as it was dusk, the King sent soldiers with us, and a number of\r\nlantern-bearers, with floating drapery of red and green silk gauze.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the “suitable attendance” turned out to be an unwieldy\r\nand embarrassing crowd, consisting of five military officers, half a\r\nregiment of soldiers, and a number of Palace attendants! I was greatly\r\nimpressed by a certain grandeur and stateliness in the buildings, the\r\nvast Hall of Audience resting on a much elevated terrace ascended by a\r\ntriple flight of granite stairs, the noble proportions of the building,\r\nthe richly carved ceiling with its manifold reticulations, painted red,\r\nblue, and green, the colossal circular pillars, red with white bases,\r\nand in the dimness of the vast area fronting the entrance, the shadowy\r\nsplendor of the Korean throne. Grand, too, in its simplicity and\r\nsolidity, is the Summer Palace or “Hall of Congratulations,” on a stone\r\nplatform approached by three granite bridges, in a lotus lake of oblong\r\nform beautified conventionally with two stone-faced islands, and by a\r\nbroad flagged promenade carried the whole way round it on a stone-faced\r\nembankment. This palace is a noble building. The upper hall, with its\r\nvast sweeping roof, is supported on forty-eight granite pillars 16 feet\r\nin height and 3 feet square at the base-all monoliths. The situation\r\nand the views are beautiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUMMER PAVILION, OR “HALL OF CONGRATULATIONS.”]\r\n\r\nDuring the next three weeks I had three more audiences, on the second\r\nbeing accompanied as before by Mrs. Underwood, the third being a formal\r\nreception, and the fourth a strictly private interview, lasting over an\r\nhour. On each occasion I was impressed with the grace and charming\r\nmanner of the Queen, her thoughtful kindness, her singular intelligence\r\nand force, and her remarkable conversational power even through\r\nthe medium of an interpreter. I was not surprised at her singular\r\npolitical influence, or her sway over the King and many others. She\r\nwas surrounded by enemies, chief among them being the Tai-Won-Kun, the\r\nKing’s father, all embittered against her because by her talent and\r\nforce she had succeeded in placing members of her family in nearly all\r\nthe chief offices of State. Her life was a battle. She fought with all\r\nher charm, shrewdness, and sagacity for power, for the dignity and\r\nsafety of her husband and son, and for the downfall of the Tai-Won-Kun.\r\nShe had cut short many lives, but in doing so she had not violated\r\nKorean tradition and custom, and some excuse for her lies in the fact\r\nthat soon after the King’s accession his father sent to the house of\r\nHer Majesty’s brother an infernal machine in the shape of a beautiful\r\nbox, which on being opened exploded, killing her mother, brother, and\r\nnephew, as well as some others. Since then he plotted against her own\r\nlife, and the feud between them was usually at fever heat.\r\n\r\nThe dynasty is worn out, and the King, with all his amiability and\r\nkindness of heart, is weak in character and is at the mercy of\r\ndesigning men, as has appeared increasingly since the strong sway of\r\nthe Queen was withdrawn. I believe him to be at heart, according to\r\nhis lights, a patriotic sovereign. Far from standing in the way of\r\nreform, he has accepted most of the suggestions offered to him. But\r\nunfortunately for a man whose edicts become the law of the land, and\r\nmore unfortunately for the land, he is persuadable by the last person\r\nwho gets his ear, he lacks backbone and tenacity of purpose, and many\r\nof the best projects of reform become abortive through his weakness\r\nof will. To substitute constitutional restraints for absolutism would\r\ngreatly mend matters, but _cela va sans dire_ this could only be\r\nsuccessful under foreign initiative.\r\n\r\nThe King was forty-three, the Queen a little older. During his\r\nminority, and while he was receiving the usual Chinese education, his\r\nfather, the Tai-Won-Kun, who is described by a Korean writer as having\r\n“bowels of iron and a heart of stone,” ruled as Regent with excessive\r\nvigor for ten years, and in 1866 put 2,000 Korean Catholics to death.\r\nAble, rapacious, and unscrupulous, his footsteps have always been\r\nblood-stained. He even put to death one of his own sons. From the time\r\nwhen his Regency ceased until the murder of the Queen, Korean political\r\nhistory is mainly the story of the deadly feud between the Queen and\r\nher clan and the Tai-Won-Kun. I was presented to him at the Palace, and\r\nwas much impressed by the vitality and energy of his expression, his\r\nkeen glance, and the vigor of his movements, though he is an old man.\r\n\r\nThe King’s expression is gentle. He has a wonderful memory, and is\r\nsaid to know Korean history so well that when any question as to fact\r\nor former custom arises he can give full particulars, with a precise\r\nreference to the reign in which any historic event occurred and to\r\nthe date. The office of Royal Reader is not a sinecure, and the Royal\r\nLibrary, which is contained in one of the most beautiful buildings of\r\nthe Kyeng-pok Palace, is a very extensive one in Chinese literature. He\r\nhas no anti-foreign feeling. His friendliness to foreigners is marked,\r\nand in his manifold perils he has frankly relied upon their aid. At\r\nthe time of my second visit, when Japan was in the ascendant, the King\r\nand Queen showed special attention and kindness to Europeans, and even\r\ninvited the whole foreign community to a skating party on the lake.\r\nThe King’s attitude towards Christian Missions is very friendly, and\r\ntoleration is a reality. The American medical attendants of both the\r\nKing and Queen, as well as other foreigners, with whom they were in\r\nconstant contact, were warmly attached to them, and I think that the\r\ngeneral feeling among Koreans is one of affectionate loyalty, the blame\r\nfor oppressive and mistaken actions being laid on the ministers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL LIBRARY, KYENG-POK PALACE.]\r\n\r\nI have dwelt so long on the King’s personality because he is _de facto_\r\nthe Korean Government, and not a mere figure-head, as there is no\r\nconstitution, written or unwritten, no representative assembly, and\r\nit may be said no law except his published Edicts. He is extremely\r\nindustrious as a ruler, acquaints himself with all the work of\r\ndepartments, receives and attends to an infinity of reports and\r\nmemorials, and concerns himself with all that is done in the name of\r\nGovernment. It is often said that in close attention to detail he\r\nundertakes more than any one man could perform. At the same time he\r\nhas not the capacity for getting a general grip of affairs. He has so\r\nmuch goodness of heart and so much sympathy with progressive ideas,\r\nthat if he had more force of character and intellect, and were less\r\neasily swayed by unworthy men, he might make a good sovereign, but his\r\nweakness of character is fatal.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of conversation introduced at three of my audiences\r\nnot only showed an intelligent desire for such information as might\r\nbe serviceable, but reflected the reforms which the Japanese were\r\npressing on the King. I was very closely questioned as to what I had\r\nseen of China and Siberia, as to the Siberian and Japanese railroads,\r\ncost of construction per _li_, as to the popular feeling in Japan\r\nconcerning the war, etc. Again I was catechised as to the avenues to\r\nofficial employment in England, the possibility of men “not of the\r\nnoble class” reaching high positions in the Government, the position of\r\nthe English nobility with regard to “privileges,” and their attitude\r\nto inferiors. On one day the whole attention of the King and Queen\r\nwas concentrated on the relations between the English Crown and the\r\nCabinet, specially with regard to the Civil List, on which the King’s\r\nquestions were so numerous and persistent as very nearly to pose me. He\r\nwas specially anxious to know if the “Finance Minister” (the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer, I suppose) exercised any control over the personal\r\nexpenditure of Her Majesty, and if the Queen’s personal accounts were\r\npaid by herself or through the Treasury. The affairs under the control\r\nof each Secretary of State were the subject of another series of\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nMany queries were about the duties of the Home Minister, the position\r\nof the Premier, and his relations with the other Ministers and the\r\nCrown. He was very anxious to know if the Queen could dismiss her\r\nMinisters if they failed to carry out her wishes, and it was impossible\r\nto explain to him through an interpreter, to whom the ideas were\r\nunfamiliar, the constitutional checks on the English Crown, and that\r\nthe sovereign only nominally possesses the right of choosing her\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\nJust before I left Korea, I was summoned to a farewell audience,\r\nand asked to take the Legation interpreter with me. I went in an\r\neight-bearer chair, and was received with the usual honors, soldiers\r\npresenting arms, etc! There was no crowd of attendants and no delay.\r\nAs I was being escorted down a closed veranda by several eunuchs\r\nand military officers, a sliding window was opened by the King, who\r\nbeckoned to me to enter, and then closed it. I found myself in the\r\nraised alcove in which the Royal Family usually sat, but the sliding\r\npanels between it and the audience-chamber were closed, and as it is\r\nnot more than 6 feet wide, it was impossible to make the customary\r\nprofound curtseys. Instead of the usual throng of attendants, eunuchs,\r\nladies-in-waiting in silk gowns a yard too long for them, and heavy\r\ncoils and pillows of artificial hair on their heads, and privileged\r\npersons standing behind the King and Queen and crowding the many\r\ndoorways, there were present only the Queen’s nurse and my interpreter,\r\nwho stood at a chink between the panels where he could not see the\r\nQueen, bent into an attitude of abject reverence, never lifting\r\nhis eyes from the ground or raising his voice above a whisper. The\r\nprecautions, however, failed to secure the privacy which the King and\r\nQueen desired. I was certain that through the chink I saw the shadow\r\nof a man in the audience-room, and the interpreter’s subsequent\r\nremark, “It was very hard for me to interpret for His Majesty to-day”\r\nwas intelligible when I heard that the “shadow” belonged to one of the\r\nMinisters of State specially distrusted by the King, and who later\r\nhad to fly from Korea. It was understood that this person carried the\r\nsubstance of what the King and Queen said to a foreign legation.\r\n\r\nI cannot here allude to the matter on which the King spoke, but the\r\naudience, which lasted for an hour, was an extremely interesting one.\r\nOn one point the King expressed himself very strongly, as he has\r\ndone to many others. He considers that now that Korea is formally\r\nindependent of China, she is entitled to a Resident Minister accredited\r\nsolely to the Korean Court. He expressed great regard and esteem for\r\nMr. Hillier, and said that nothing would be more acceptable to him than\r\nhis appointment as the first Minister to Korea.\r\n\r\nThe Queen spoke of Queen Victoria, and said, “She has everything that\r\nshe can wish--greatness, wealth, and power. Her sons and grandsons are\r\nkings and emperors, and her daughters empresses. Does she ever in her\r\nglory think of poor Korea? She does so much good in the world, her life\r\nis a good. We wish her long life and prosperity”; to which the King\r\nadded, “England is our best friend.” It was really touching to hear the\r\noccupants of that ancient but shaky throne speaking in this fashion.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the Queen was dressed in a bodice of brocaded amber\r\nsatin, a mazarine blue brocaded trained skirt, a crimson girdle with\r\nfive clasps and tassels of coral, and a coral clasp at the throat. Her\r\nhead was uncovered, and her abundant black hair gathered into a knot\r\nat the back. She wore no ornament except a pearl and coral jewel on\r\nthe top of the head. The King and Queen rose when I took leave, and\r\nthe Queen shook hands. They both spoke most kindly, and expressed the\r\nwish that I should return and see more of Korea. When I did return nine\r\nmonths later, the Queen had been barbarously murdered, and the King\r\nwas practically a prisoner in his own palace.\r\n\r\nTravellers received by the Korean King have often ridiculed the\r\naudience, the surroundings, and the Palace. I must say that I saw\r\nnothing to ridicule, unless national customs and etiquette varying\r\nfrom our own are necessarily ridiculous. On the contrary, there were\r\na simplicity, dignity, kindliness, courtesy, and propriety which have\r\nleft a very agreeable impression on me, and my four audiences at Palace\r\nwere the great feature of my second visit to Korea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOREAN GENTLEMAN IN COURT DRESS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] These are ancient musical instruments called by the Chinese\r\n_ch’ing_, and were in use at courts in the days of Confucius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nA TRANSITION STAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring January, 1895, Seoul was in a curious condition. The “old order”\r\nwas changing, but the new had not taken its place. The Japanese,\r\nvictorious by land and sea, were in a position to enforce the reforms\r\nin which before the war they had asked China to coöperate. The King,\r\nsince the capture of the Palace by the Japanese in July, 1894, had\r\nbecome little more than a “salaried automaton,” and the once powerful\r\nmembers of the Min clan had been expelled from their offices. The\r\nJapanese were prepared to accept the responsibility of the supervision\r\nof all departments, and to enforce honesty on a corrupt executive.\r\nThe victory over the Chinese at Phyöng-yang on 17th September, 1894,\r\nhad set them free to carry out their purposes. Count Inouye, one of\r\nthe foremost of the statesmen who created the new Japan, arrived as\r\n“Resident” on October 20, 1894, and practically administered the\r\nGovernment in the King’s name. There were Japanese controllers in all\r\nthe departments, the army was drilled by Japanese drill instructors,\r\na police force was organized and clothed in badly fitting Japanese\r\nuniforms, a Council of Koreans was appointed to draft a scheme of\r\nreform, and form the nucleus of a possible Korean Parliament, and\r\nCount Inouye as Japanese adviser had the right of continual access\r\nto the King, and with an interpreter and stenographer sat at the\r\nmeetings of the Cabinet. Every day Japanese ascendency was apparent in\r\nnew appointments, regulations, abolitions, and reforms. The Japanese\r\nclaimed that their purpose was to reform the administration of Korea\r\nas we had done that of Egypt, and I believe they would have done it had\r\nthey been allowed a free hand. It was apparent, however, that Count\r\nInouye found the task of reformation a far harder one than he expected,\r\nand that the difficulties in his way were nearly insurmountable. He\r\nsaid himself that there were “no tools to work with,” and in the hope\r\nof manufacturing them a large number of youths of the upper class were\r\nsent for two years to Japan, one year to be spent in education and\r\nanother in learning accuracy and “the first principles of honor” in\r\ncertain Government departments.\r\n\r\nSundry Japanese demands, though conceded at the time by the King, had\r\nbeen allowed to drop, and it was not till December, 1894, that Count\r\nInouye obtained a formal covenant that five of them should be at once\r\ncarried out. (1) A full pardon for all the conspirators of 1884;\r\n(2) That the Tai-Won-Kun and the Queen should interfere no more in\r\npublic affairs; (3) That no relatives of the Royal Family should be\r\nemployed in any official capacity; (4) That the number of eunuchs and\r\n“Palace ladies” should at once be reduced to a minimum; (5) That caste\r\ndistinctions--patrician and plebeian--should no longer be recognized.\r\n\r\nEdicts on some of the foregoing subjects appeared in the _Gazette_,\r\nand large numbers of the eunuchs packed up their clothes and left\r\nthe Palace quietly in the night, along with the “Palace ladies”; but\r\nthe King in his vast dwelling was so lonely without them that the\r\nnext morning he sent an order commanding their immediate return under\r\nserious penalties, and it was obeyed at once!\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Korean official class, with the exception of a\r\nsmall number who were personally interested in the success of Japan,\r\nwas altogether unfavorable to the new _régime_, and every change was\r\nregarded with indignation. Though destitute of true patriotism, the\r\ncommon people looked upon the King as a sacred person, and they were\r\nfurious at the indignities to which he had been subjected. The official\r\nclass saw that reform meant the end of “squeezing” and ill-gotten\r\ngains, and they, with the whole army of parasites and hangers-on of\r\n_yamens_, were all pledged by the strongest personal interest to oppose\r\nit by active opposition or passive resistance. Though corruption has\r\nits stronghold in Seoul, every provincial government repeats on a\r\nsmaller scale the iniquities of the capital, and has its own army\r\nof dishonest and lazy officials fattening on the earnings of the\r\nindustrious classes.\r\n\r\nThe cleansing of the Augean stable of the Korean official system, which\r\nthe Japanese had undertaken, was indeed an Herculean labor. Traditions\r\nof honor and honesty, if they ever existed, had been forgotten for\r\ncenturies. Standards of official rectitude were unknown. In Korea when\r\nthe Japanese undertook the work of reform there were but two classes,\r\nthe robbers and the robbed, and the robbers included the vast army\r\nwhich constituted officialdom. “Squeezing” and peculation were the rule\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest, and every position was bought and sold.\r\n\r\nThe transition stage, down to 12th February, 1895, when I left Korea,\r\nwas a remarkable one. The _Official Gazette_ curiously reflected that\r\nsingular period. One day a decree abolished the 3 feet long tobacco\r\npipes which were the delight of the Koreans of the capital; another,\r\nthere was an enlightened statute ordering the planting of pines to\r\nremedy the denudation of the hills around Seoul, the same _Gazette_\r\ndirecting that duly appointed geomancers should find “an auspicious\r\nday” on which the King might worship at the ancestral tablets! One\r\nday barbarous and brutalizing punishments were wisely abolished;\r\nanother, there appeared a string of vexatious and petty regulations\r\ncalculated to harass the Chinese out of the kingdom, and appointing as\r\na punishment for the breach of them a fine of 100 dollars or 100 blows!\r\n\r\nFailure in tact was one great fault of the Japanese. The seizure of the\r\nPalace and the King’s person in July, 1894, even if a dubious political\r\nnecessity, did not excuse the indignities to which the sovereign was\r\nexposed. The forcing of former conspirators into high office was a\r\ngrave error, and tactless proceedings, such as the abolition of long\r\npipes, alterations in Court and other dress, many interferences with\r\nsocial customs, and petty and harassing restrictions and regulations,\r\nembittered the people against the new _régime_.\r\n\r\nThe Tong-haks, who had respectfully thrown off allegiance to the King\r\non the ground that he was in the hands of foreigners, and had appointed\r\nanother sovereign, had been vanquished early in January, and their\r\nking’s head had been sent to Seoul by a loyal governor. There I saw it\r\nin the busiest part of the Peking Road, a bustling market outside the\r\n“little West Gate,” hanging from a rude arrangement of three sticks\r\nlike a camp-kettle stand, with another head below it. Both faces wore a\r\ncalm, almost dignified, expression. Not far off two more heads had been\r\nexposed in a similar frame, but it had given way, and they lay in the\r\ndust of the roadway, much gnawed by dogs at the back. The last agony\r\nwas stiffened on their features. A turnip lay beside them, and some\r\nsmall children cut pieces from it and presented them mockingly to the\r\nblackened mouths. This brutalizing spectacle had existed for a week.\r\n\r\nThree days later, in the stillness of the Korean New Year’s Day, I rode\r\nwith a friend along a lonely road passing through a fair agricultural\r\nvalley among pine-clothed knolls outside the South and East Gates of\r\nSeoul. Snow lay on the ground and the grim sky threatened a further\r\nstorm. It was cold, and we observed with surprise three coolies in\r\nsummer cotton clothing lying by the roadside asleep; but it was the\r\nlast sleep, for on approaching them we found that, though their\r\nattitudes were those of easy repose, the bodies were without heads, nor\r\nhad the headsman’s axe been merciful or sharp. In the middle of the\r\nroad were great, frozen, crimson splashes where the Tong-hak leaders\r\nhad expiated their treason, criminals in Korea, as in old Jerusalem,\r\nsuffering “without the gate.”\r\n\r\nA few days later an order appeared in the _Gazette_ abolishing\r\nbeheading and “slicing to death,” and substituting death by\r\nstrangulation for civil, and by shooting for military capital crimes.\r\nThis order practically made an end of the prerogative of life and death\r\nheretofore possessed by the Korean sovereigns.\r\n\r\nSo the “old order” was daily changing under the pressure of the\r\nJapanese advisers, and on the whole changing most decidedly for\r\nthe better, though, owing to the number of reforms decreed and in\r\ncontemplation, everything was in a tentative and chaotic state. Korea\r\nwas “swithering” between China and Japan, afraid to go in heartily for\r\nthe reforms initiated by Japan lest China should regain position and be\r\n“down” upon her, and afraid to oppose them actively lest Japan should\r\nbe permanently successful.\r\n\r\nOn that same New Year’s Day there was more to be seen than headless\r\ntrunks. Through the length of Seoul, towards twilight, an odor of\r\nburning hair overpowered the aromatic scent of the pine brush, and\r\nall down every street, outside every door, there were red glimmers\r\nof light. It is the custom in every family on that day to carry out\r\nthe carefully preserved clippings and combings of the family hair and\r\nburn them in potsherds, a practice which it is hoped will prevent the\r\nentrance of certain dæmons into the house during the year. Rude straw\r\ndolls stuffed with a few _cash_ were also thrown into the street. This\r\neffigy is believed to take away troubles and foist them on whoever\r\npicks it up. To prevent such a vicarious calamity, more than one mother\r\non that evening pounced upon a child who childlike had picked up the\r\ndoll and threw it far from him.\r\n\r\nOn that night round pieces of red or white paper placed in cleft sticks\r\nare put upon the roofs of houses, and those persons who have been\r\nwarned by the sorcerers of troubles to come, pray (?) to the moon to\r\nremove them.\r\n\r\nA common Korean custom on the same day is for people to paint images\r\non paper, and to write against them their troubles of body or mind,\r\nafterwards giving the paper to a boy who burns it.\r\n\r\nA more singular New Year custom in Seoul is “Walking the Bridges.” Up\r\nto midnight, men, women, and children cross a bridge or bridges as many\r\ntimes as they are years old. This is believed to prevent pains in the\r\nfeet and legs during the year.\r\n\r\nThis day, the “Great Fifteenth Day,” concludes the kite-flying and\r\nstone fights which enliven Seoul for the previous fortnight, and every\r\nKorean insists on keeping it as a holiday. Graves are formally visited,\r\nand gathered families spread food before the ancestral tablets. Curious\r\ncustoms prevail at this time. A few days before, the Palace eunuchs\r\nchant invocations, swinging burning torches as they do so. This is\r\nsupposed to ensure bountiful crops for the next season. People buy\r\nquantities of nuts, which they crack, hold the kernels in the mouth,\r\nand then throw them away. This is to prevent summer sores and boils.\r\nAlso on the Great Fifteenth Day men try to find out the probable\r\nrainfall for each month by splitting a small piece of bamboo, and\r\nlaying twelve beans side by side in one of the halves, after which it\r\nis closed, and after being bound tightly with cord, is lowered into a\r\nwell for the night. Each bean represents a month. In the morning, when\r\nthey are examined in rotation, they are variously enlarged, and the\r\nenlargement indicates the proportion of rain in that special moon. If,\r\non the contrary, one or more are wizened, it causes great alarm, as\r\nindicating complete or partial drought in one or more months. Dogs do\r\nnot get their usual meal on the morning of the “Great Fifteenth,” in\r\nthe belief that the deprivation will keep them from being pestered with\r\nflies during the long summer.\r\n\r\nIf a boy has been born during the year, poles bearing paper fish by day\r\nand lanterns by night project from the house of the parents. The people\r\nat night watch the burning of candles. If they are entirely burned, the\r\nlife of the child will be long; if only partially burned, it will be\r\nproportionately shorter.\r\n\r\nI left Seoul very regretfully on 5th February. The Japanese had\r\nintroduced _jinrikshas_, but the runners were unskilled, and I met with\r\nso severe an accident in going down to Chemulpo that I did not recover\r\nfor a year. The line of steamers to Japan was totally disorganized by\r\nthe war, and in the week that I waited for the _Higo Maru_ war was\r\nuppermost in people’s thoughts. There were some who even then could not\r\nbring themselves to believe in the eventual success of the Japanese.\r\nThe fall of Wei-hai-wei and the capture of the Chinese fleet opened\r\nmany eyes. I was in the office of the “N.Y.K.” when the news came, and\r\nthe clerks were too wild with excitement to attend to me, apologizing\r\nby saying, “It’s another victory!” Chemulpo was decorated, illuminated,\r\nand processioned for victories, Li Hung Chang was burned in effigy, and\r\nunlimited _sake_ for all comers was supplied from tubs at the street\r\ncorners.\r\n\r\nThere were indications of the cost of victory, however. The great\r\nmilitary hospitals were full, the cemetery was filling fast, military\r\nfunerals with military pomp and Shinto priests passed down the bannered\r\nstreet, and 600 transport coolies tramping from Manchuria arrived in\r\nrags and tatters, some clothed in raw hides and raw skins of sheep,\r\ntheir feet, hands, and lips frost-bitten, and with blackened stumps of\r\nfingers and toes protruding from filthy bandages. The Japanese schools\r\nteach that Japan has a right to demand all that a man has, and that\r\nlife itself is not too costly a sacrifice for him to lay on the altar\r\nof his country. Undoubtedly the teaching bears fruit. Not long before\r\nat Osaka I saw the wharves piled high with voluntary contributions for\r\nthe troops, and the Third Army leave the city amidst an outburst of\r\npopular enthusiasm such as I never saw equalled. Most of these coolies,\r\nwhen they received new clothing, volunteered for further service, and\r\ndying soldiers on battlefields and in hospitals uttered “_Dai Nippon\r\nBanzai!_” (Great Japan forever!) with their last faltering breath.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Korea the condition of things may be summarized\r\nthus. Japan was thoroughly in earnest as to reforming the Korean\r\nadministration through Koreans, and very many reforms were decreed\r\nor in contemplation, while some evils and abuses were already swept\r\naway. The King, deprived of his absolute sovereignty, was practically\r\na salaried registrar of decrees. Count Inouye occupied the position of\r\n“Resident,” and the Government was administered in the King’s name by a\r\nCabinet consisting of the heads of ten departments, in some measure the\r\nnominees of the “Resident.”[35]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE OF THE QUEEN’S CREMATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] I repeat this statement in this form for the benefit of the\r\nreader, and ask him to compare it with a summary of Korean affairs\r\nearly in 1897, given in the 36th chapter of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, a treaty of peace between China and Japan was signed at\r\nShimonoseki, a heavy indemnity, the island of Formosa, and a great\r\naccession of prestige, being the gains of Japan. From thenceforward no\r\npower having interests in the Far East could afford to regard her as a\r\n_quantité négligéable_.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling for some months in South and Mid China, and spending\r\nthe summer in Japan, I arrived in Nagasaki in October, 1895, to hear a\r\nrumor of the assassination of the Korean Queen, afterwards confirmed\r\non board the _Suruga Maru_ by Mr. Sill, the American Minister, who was\r\nhurrying back to his post in Seoul in consequence of the disturbed\r\nstate of affairs. I went up immediately from Chemulpo to the capital,\r\nwhere I was Mr. Hillier’s guest at the English Legation for two\r\nexciting months.\r\n\r\nThe native and foreign communities were naturally much excited by the\r\ntragedy at the Palace, and the treatment which the King was receiving.\r\nCount Inouye, whose presence in Seoul always produced confidence, had\r\nleft a month before, and had been succeeded by General Viscount Miura,\r\na capable soldier, without diplomatic experience.\r\n\r\nIn an interview which Count Inouye had with the Queen shortly before\r\nhis departure, speaking of the ascendency of the Tai-Won-Kun, after the\r\ncapture of the Palace by Mr. Otori in the previous July, Her Majesty\r\nsaid, “It is a matter of regret to me that the overtures made by me\r\ntowards Japan were rejected. The Tai-Won-Kun, on the other hand, who\r\nshowed his unfriendliness towards Japan, was assisted by the Japanese\r\nMinister to rise in power.”\r\n\r\nIn the despatch in which Count Inouye reported this interview to his\r\nGovernment he wrote:--\r\n\r\n I gave as far as I could an explanation of these things to the Queen,\r\n and after so allaying her suspicions, I further explained that it was\r\n the true and sincere desire of the Emperor and Government of Japan to\r\n place the independence of Korea on a firm basis, and in the meantime\r\n to strengthen the Royal House of Korea. _In the event of any member of\r\n the Royal Family, or indeed any Korean, therefore attempting treason\r\n against the Royal House, I gave the assurance that the Japanese\r\n Government would not fail to protect the Royal House even by force of\r\n arms, and so secure the safety of the kingdom._ These remarks of mine\r\n seemed to have moved the King and Queen, and their anxiety for the\r\n future appeared to be much relieved.\r\n\r\nThe Korean sovereigns would naturally think themselves justified\r\nin relying on the promise so frankly given by one of the most\r\ndistinguished of Japanese statesmen, whom they had learned to regard\r\nwith confidence and respect, and it is clear to myself that when the\r\nfateful night came, a month later, their reliance on this assurance\r\nled them to omit certain possible precautions, and caused the Queen to\r\nneglect to make her escape at the first hint of danger.\r\n\r\nWhen the well-known arrangement between Viscount Miura and the\r\nTai-Won-Kun was ripe for execution, the Japanese Minister directed the\r\nCommandant of the Japanese battalion quartered in the barracks just\r\noutside the Palace gate to facilitate the Tai-Won-Kun’s entry into\r\nthe Palace by arranging the disposition of the _Kun-ren-tai_ (Korean\r\ntroops drilled by Japanese), and by calling out the Imperial force to\r\nsupport them. Miura also called upon two Japanese to collect their\r\nfriends, go to Riong San on the Han, where the intriguing Prince was\r\nthen living, and act as his bodyguard on his journey to the Palace. The\r\nMinister told them that on the success of the enterprise depended the\r\neradication of the evils which had afflicted the kingdom for twenty\r\nyears, and INSTIGATED THEM TO DISPATCH THE QUEEN WHEN THEY ENTERED THE\r\nPALACE. One of Miura’s agents then ordered the Japanese policemen who\r\nwere off duty to put on civilian dress, provide themselves with swords,\r\nand accompany the conspirators to the Tai-Won-Kun’s house.\r\n\r\nAt 3 A.M. on the morning of the 8th of October they left Riong San,\r\nescorting the Prince’s palanquin, Mr. Okamoto, to whom much had been\r\nentrusted, assembling the whole party when on the point of departure,\r\nand declaring to them that on entering the Palace the “Fox” should be\r\ndealt with according “as exigency might require.” Then this procession,\r\nincluding ten Japanese who had dressed themselves in uniforms taken\r\nfrom ten captured Korean police, started for Seoul, more than three\r\nmiles distant. Outside the “Gate of Staunch Loyalty” they were met by\r\nthe _Kun-ren-tai_, and then waited for the arrival of the Japanese\r\ntroops, after which they proceeded at a rapid pace to the Palace,\r\nentering it by the front gate, and after killing some of the Palace\r\nGuard, proceeded a quarter of a mile to the buildings occupied by the\r\nKing and Queen, which have a narrow courtyard in front.\r\n\r\nSo far I have followed the Hiroshima judgment in its statement of the\r\nfacts of that morning, but when it has conducted the combined force to\r\n“the inner chambers” it concludes abruptly with a “not proven” in the\r\ncase of all the accused! For the rest of the story, so far as it may\r\ninterest my readers, I follow the statements of General Dye and Mr.\r\nSabatin of the King’s Guard, and of certain official documents.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to go back upon various events which preceded\r\nthe murder of Her Majesty. Trouble arose in October between the\r\n_Kun-ren-tai_ and the Seoul police, resulting in the total defeat of\r\nthe latter. The _Kun-ren-tai_, numbering 1,000, were commanded by\r\nColonel Hong, who in 1882 had rescued the Queen from imminent danger,\r\nand was trusted by the Royal Family. The Palace was in the hands of\r\nthe Old Guard under Colonel Hyön, who had saved Her Majesty’s life\r\nin 1884. In the first week of October the strength of this Guard\r\nwas greatly reduced, useful weapons were quietly withdrawn, and the\r\nammunition was removed.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 7th the _Kun-ren-tai_, with their Japanese\r\ninstructors, marched and countermarched till they were found on all\r\nsides of the Palace, causing some uneasiness within. The alarm was\r\ngiven to General Dye and Mr. Sabatin early on the morning of the\r\n8th.[36] These officers, looking through a chink of the gate, saw a\r\nnumber of Japanese soldiers with fixed bayonets standing there, who,\r\non being asked what they were doing, filed right and left out of the\r\nmoonlight under the shadow of the wall. Skulking under another part of\r\nthe wall were over 200 of the _Kun-ren-tai_. The two foreigners were\r\nconsulting as to the steps to be taken when heavy sounds of battering\r\ncame from the grand entrance gate, followed by firing.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dye attempted to rally the Guard, but after five or six volleys\r\nfrom the assailants they broke with such a rush as to sweep the two\r\nforeigners past the King’s house to the gateway of the Queen’s. No\r\nclear account has ever been given of the events which followed. Colonel\r\nHong, the commander of the _Kun-ren-tai_, was cut down by a Japanese\r\nofficer at the great gate, and was afterwards mortally wounded by eight\r\nbullets. The _Kun-ren-tai_ swarmed into the Palace from all directions,\r\nalong with Japanese civilians armed with swords, who frantically\r\ndemanded the whereabouts of the Queen, hauling the Palace ladies about\r\nby the hair to compel them to point out Her Majesty, rushing in and out\r\nof windows, throwing the ladies-in-waiting from the 7 feet high veranda\r\ninto the compound, cutting and kicking them, and brutally murdering\r\nfour in the hope that they had thus secured their victim.\r\n\r\nJapanese troops also entered the Palace, and formed in military order\r\nunder the command of their officers round the small courtyard of\r\nthe King’s house and at its gate, protecting the assassins in their\r\nmurderous work. Before this force of Japanese regulars arrived there\r\nwas a flying rout of servants, runners, and Palace Guards rushing from\r\nevery point of the vast enclosure in mad haste to get out of the gates.\r\nAs the Japanese entered the building, the unfortunate King, hoping to\r\ndivert their attention and give the Queen time to escape, came into\r\na front room where he could be distinctly seen. Some of the Japanese\r\nassassins rushed in brandishing their swords, pulled His Majesty about,\r\nand beat and dragged about some of the Palace ladies by the hair in\r\nhis presence. The Crown Prince, who was in an inner room, was seized,\r\nhis hat torn off and broken, and he was pulled about by the hair and\r\nthreatened with swords to make him show the way to the Queen, but he\r\nmanaged to reach the King, and they have never been separated since.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair did not occupy much more than an hour. The Crown\r\nPrince saw his mother rush down a passage followed by a Japanese with\r\na sword, and there was a general rush of assassins for her sleeping\r\napartments. In the upper story the Crown Princess was found with\r\nseveral ladies, and she was dragged by the hair, cut with a sword,\r\nbeaten, and thrown downstairs. Yi Kyöng-jik, Minister of the Royal\r\nHousehold, seems to have given the alarm, for the Queen was dressed and\r\nwas preparing to run and hide herself. When the murderers rushed in, he\r\nstood with outstretched arms in front of Her Majesty, trying to protect\r\nher, furnishing them with the clue they wanted. They slashed off both\r\nhis hands and inflicted other wounds, but he contrived to drag himself\r\nalong the veranda into the King’s presence, where he bled to death.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, flying from the assassins, was overtaken and stabbed,\r\nfalling down as if dead, but one account says that, recovering a\r\nlittle, she asked if the Crown Prince, her idol, was safe, on which\r\na Japanese jumped on her breast and stabbed her through and through\r\nwith his sword. Even then, though the nurse whom I formerly saw in\r\nattendance on her covered her face, it is not certain that she was\r\ndead, but the Japanese laid her on a plank, wrapped a silk quilt round\r\nher, and she was carried to a grove of pines in the adjacent deer park,\r\nwhere kerosene oil was poured over the body, which was surrounded by\r\nfaggots and burned, only a few small bones escaping destruction.\r\n\r\nThus perished, at the age of forty-four, by the hands of foreign\r\nassassins, instigated to their bloody work by the Minister of a\r\nfriendly power, the clever, ambitious, intriguing, fascinating, and in\r\nmany respects lovable Queen of Korea. In her lifetime Count Inouye,\r\nwhose verdict for many reasons may be accepted, said, “Her Majesty has\r\nfew equals among her countrymen for shrewdness and sagacity. In the art\r\nof conciliating her enemies and winning the confidence of her servants\r\nshe has no equals.”\r\n\r\nA short time after daylight the Tai-Won-Kun issued two proclamations,\r\nof which the following sentences are specimens:--\r\n\r\n 1st, “The hearts of the people dissolve through the presence in the\r\n Palace of a crowd of base fellows. So the National Grand Duke is\r\n returned to power to inaugurate changes, expel the base fellows,\r\n restore former laws, and vindicate the dignity of His Majesty.”\r\n\r\n 2nd, “I have now entered the Palace to aid His Majesty, expel the low\r\n fellows, perfect that which will be a benefit, save the country, and\r\n introduce peace.”\r\n\r\nThe Palace gates were guarded by the mutinous _Kun-ren-tai_ with fixed\r\nbayonets, who allowed a constant stream of Koreans to pass out, the\r\nremnants of the Old Palace Guard, who had thrown off their uniforms and\r\nhidden their arms, each man being seized and searched before his exit\r\nwas permitted. Near the gate was a crimson pool marking the spot where\r\nColonel Hong fell. Three of the Ministers were at once dismissed from\r\ntheir posts, some escaped, and many of the high officials sought safety\r\nin flight. Nearly every one who was trusted by the King was removed,\r\nand several of the chief offices of State were filled by the nominees\r\nof the officers of the _Kun-ren-tai_, who, later, when they did not\r\nfind the Cabinet, which was chiefly of their own creation, sufficiently\r\nsubservient, used to threaten it with drawn swords.\r\n\r\nViscount Miura arrived at the Palace at daylight, with Mr. Sugimura,\r\nSecretary of the Japanese Legation (who had arranged the details of the\r\nplot), and a certain Japanese who had been seen by the King apparently\r\nleading the assassins, and actively participating in the bloody work,\r\nand had an audience of His Majesty, who was profoundly agitated. He\r\nsigned three documents at their bidding, after which the Japanese\r\ntroops were withdrawn from the Palace, and the armed forces, and even\r\nthe King’s personal attendants, were placed under the orders of those\r\nwho had been concerned in attack. The Tai-Won-Kun was present at this\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nDuring the day all the Foreign Representatives had audiences of the\r\nKing, who was much agitated, sobbed at intervals, and, believing the\r\nQueen to have escaped, was very solicitous about his own safety, as\r\nhe was environed by assassins, the most unscrupulous of all being\r\nhis own father. In violation of custom, he grasped the hands of\r\nthe Representatives, and asked them to use their friendly offices\r\nto prevent further outrage and violence. He was anxious that the\r\n_Kun-ren-tai_ should be replaced by Japanese troops. On the same\r\nafternoon the Foreign Representatives met at the Japanese Legation\r\nto hear Viscount Miura’s explanation of circumstances in which his\r\ncountrymen were so seriously implicated.\r\n\r\nThree days after the events in the Palace, and while the King and\r\nthe general public believed the Queen to be alive, a so-called Royal\r\nEdict, a more infamous outrage on the Queen even than her brutal\r\nassassination, was published in the _Official Gazette_. The King on\r\nbeing asked to sign it refused, and said he would have his hands cut\r\noff rather, but it appeared as his decree, and bore the signatures\r\nof the Minister of the Household, the Prime Minister, and six other\r\nmembers of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL EDICT.\r\n\r\n It is now thirty-two years since We ascended the throne, but Our\r\n ruling influence has not extended wide. The Queen Min introduced her\r\n relatives to the Court and placed them about Our person, whereby\r\n she made dull Our senses, exposed the people to extortion, put Our\r\n Government in disorder, selling offices and titles. Hence tyranny\r\n prevailed all over the country and robbers arose in all quarters.\r\n Under these circumstances the foundation of Our dynasty was in\r\n imminent peril. We knew the extreme of her wickedness, but could not\r\n dismiss and punish her because of helplessness and fear of her party.\r\n\r\n We desire to stop and suppress her influence. In the twelfth moon of\r\n last year we took an oath at Our Ancestral Shrine that the Queen and\r\n her relatives and Ours should never again be allowed to interfere in\r\n State affairs. We hoped this would lead the Min faction to mend their\r\n ways. But the Queen did not give up her wickedness, but with her party\r\n aided a crowd of low fellows to rise up about Us and so managed as\r\n to prevent the Ministers of State from consulting Us. Moreover, they\r\n have forged Our signature to a decree to disband Our loyal soldiers,\r\n thereby instigating and raising a disturbance, and when it occurred\r\n she escaped as in the Im O year. We have endeavored to discover\r\n her whereabouts, but as she does not come forth and appear We are\r\n convinced that she is not only unfitted and unworthy of the Queen’s\r\n rank, but also that her guilt is excessive and brimful. Therefore\r\n with her We may not succeed to the glory of the Royal Ancestry. So We\r\n hereby depose her from the rank of Queen and reduce her to the level\r\n of the lowest class.\r\n\r\n  Signed by\r\n  YI CHAI-MYON, Minister of the Royal Household.\r\n  KIM HONG-CHIP, Prime Minister.\r\n  KIM YUN-SIK, Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n  PAK CHONG-YANG, Minister of Home Affairs.\r\n  SHIM SANG-HUN, Minister of Finance.\r\n  CHO HEUI-YON, Minister of War.\r\n  SO KWANG-POM, Minister of Justice.\r\n  SO KWANG-POM, Minister of Education.\r\n  CHONG PYONG-HA, Vice-Minister of Agriculture and Commerce.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the issue of this fraudulent and infamous edict,\r\nanother appeared in which Her Majesty, out of pity for the Crown Prince\r\nand as a reward for his deep devotion to his father, was “raised” by\r\nthe King to the rank of “Concubine of the First Order”!\r\n\r\nThe diplomats were harassed and anxious, and met constantly to\r\ndiscuss the situation. Of course the state of extreme tension was not\r\ncaused solely by “happenings” in Korea and their local consequences.\r\nFor behind this well-executed plot, and the diabolical murder of a\r\ndefenceless woman, lay a terrible suspicion, which gained in strength\r\nevery hour during the first few days after the tragedy till it\r\nintensified into a certainty, of which people spoke as in cipher, by\r\nhints alone, that other brains than Korean planned the plot, that other\r\nthan Korean hands took the lives that were taken, that the sentries\r\nwho guarded the King’s apartments while the deed of blood was being\r\nperpetrated wore other than Korean uniforms, and that other than Korean\r\nbayonets gleamed in the shadow of the Palace wall.\r\n\r\nPeople spoke their suspicions cautiously, though the evidence of\r\nGeneral Dye and of Mr. Sabatin pointed unmistakably in one direction.\r\nSo early as the day after the affair, the question which emerged\r\nwas, “Is Viscount General Miura criminally implicated or not?” It\r\nis needless to go into particulars on this subject. Ten days after\r\nthe tragedy at the Palace, the Japanese Government, which was soon\r\nproved innocent of any complicity in the affair, recalled and arrested\r\nViscount Miura, Sugimura, and Okamoto, Adviser to the Korean War\r\nDepartment, who, some months later, along with forty-five others, were\r\nplaced on their trial before the Japanese Court of First Instance at\r\nHiroshima, and were acquitted on the technical ground that there was\r\n“no sufficient evidence to prove that any of the accused actually\r\ncommitted the crime originally meditated by them,” this crime,\r\naccording to the judgment, being that two of the accused, “AT THE\r\nINSTIGATION OF MIURA, DECIDED TO MURDER THE QUEEN, and took steps by\r\ncollecting accomplices ... more than ten others were directed by these\r\ntwo persons to do away with the Queen.”\r\n\r\nViscount Miura was replaced by Mr. Komura, an able diplomatist, and\r\nshortly afterwards Count Inouye arrived, bearing the condolences of\r\nthe Emperor of Japan to the unfortunate Korean King. A heavier blow\r\nto Japanese prestige and position as the leader of civilization in\r\nthe East could not have been struck, and the Government continues\r\nto deserve our sympathy on the occasion. For when the disavowal is\r\nforgotten, it will be always remembered that the murderous plot was\r\narranged in the Japanese Legation, and that of the Japanese dressed as\r\ncivilians and armed with swords and pistols, who were directly engaged\r\nin the outrages committed in the Palace, some were advisers to the\r\nKorean Government and in its pay, and others were Japanese policemen\r\nconnected with the Japanese Legation--sixty persons in all, including\r\nthose known as _Soshi_, and exclusive of the Japanese troops.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Representatives with one exception informed the Cabinet\r\nthat until steps were taken to bring the assassins to justice, till the\r\n_Kun-ren-tai_ Guard was removed from the Palace, and till the recently\r\nintroduced members of the Cabinet who were responsible for the outrages\r\nhad been arraigned or at least removed from office, they declined to\r\nrecognize any act of the Government, or to accept as authentic any\r\norder issued by it in the King’s name. The prudence of this course\r\nbecame apparent later.\r\n\r\nOn 15th October, in an extra issue of the _Official Gazette_, it was\r\nannounced “By Royal Command” that, as the position of Queen must not\r\nremain vacant for a day, proceedings for the choice of a bride were\r\nto begin at once! This was only one among the many insults which were\r\nheaped upon the Royal prisoner.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of October and November there was no improvement\r\nin affairs. The gloom was profound. Instead of Royal receptions and\r\nentertainments, the King, shaken by terror and in hourly dread of\r\npoison or assassination, was a close prisoner in a poor part of his\r\nown palace, in the hands of a Cabinet chiefly composed of men who were\r\nthe tools of the mutinous soldiers who were practically his jailers,\r\ncompelled to put his seal to edicts which he loathed, the tool of men\r\non whose hands the blood of his murdered Queen was hardly dry. Nothing\r\ncould be more pitiable than the condition of the King and Crown Prince,\r\neach dreading that the other would be slain before his eyes, not daring\r\nto eat of any food prepared in the Palace, dreading to be separated,\r\neven for a few minutes, without an adherent whom they could trust, and\r\nwith recent memories of infinite horror as food for contemplation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dye, the American military adviser, an old and feeble man,\r\nslept near the Palace Library, and the American missionaries in twos\r\ntook it in turns to watch with him. This was the only protection\r\nwhich the unfortunate sovereign possessed. He was also visited daily\r\nby the Foreign Representatives in turns, with the double object of\r\nascertaining that he was alive and assuring him of their sympathy and\r\ninterest. Food was supplied to him in a locked box from the Russian or\r\nU. S. Legations, but so closely was he watched, that it was difficult\r\nto pass the key into his hand, and a hasty and very occasional whisper\r\nwas the only communication he could succeed in making to these\r\nforeigners, who were his sole reliance. Undoubtedly from the first he\r\nhoped to escape either to the English or Russian Legation. At times he\r\nsobbed piteously and shook the hands of the foreigners, who made no\r\nattempt to conceal the sympathy they felt for the always courteous and\r\nkindly sovereign.\r\n\r\nEntertainments among the foreigners ceased. The dismay was too profound\r\nand the mourning too real to permit even of the mild gaieties of\r\na Seoul winter. Every foreign lady, and specially Mrs. Underwood,\r\nHer Majesty’s medical attendant, and Mme. Waeber, who had been an\r\nintimate friend, felt her death as a personal loss. Her Oriental\r\nunscrupulousness in politics was forgotten in the horror excited by the\r\nstory of her end. Yet then and for some time afterwards people clung\r\nto the hope that she had escaped as on a former occasion, and was in\r\nhiding. Among Koreans opinion was greatly concealed, for there were\r\ninnumerable arrests, and no one knew when his turn might come, but it\r\nwas believed that there was an earnest desire to liberate the King. A\r\nnumber of foreign warships lay at Chemulpo, and the British, Russian,\r\nand American Legations were guarded by marines.\r\n\r\nNearly a month after the assassination of the Queen, and when all\r\nhope of her escape had been abandoned, the condition of things was so\r\nserious under the rule of the new Cabinet, that an attempt was made\r\nby the Foreign Representatives to terminate it by urging on Count\r\nInouye to disarm the _Kun-ren-tai_, and occupy the Palace with Japanese\r\ntroops until the loyal soldiers had been drilled into an efficiency\r\non which the King might rely for his personal safety. It will be\r\nseen from this proposal how completely the Japanese Government was\r\nexonerated from blame by the diplomatic agents of the Great Powers.\r\nThis proposal was not received with cordial alacrity by Count Inouye,\r\nwho felt that the step of an armed reoccupation of the Palace by the\r\nJapanese, though with the object of securing the King’s safety, would\r\nbe liable to serious misconstruction, and might bring about very\r\ngrave complications. Such an idea was only to be entertained if Japan\r\nreceived a distinct mandate from the Powers. The telegraph was set to\r\nwork, a due amount of consent to the arrangement was obtained, and when\r\nI left Seoul on a northern journey on November 7th, it was in the full\r\nbelief that on reaching Phyöng-yang I should find a telegram announcing\r\nthat this serious _coup d’état_ had been successfully accomplished in\r\nthe presence of the Foreign Representatives. Japan, however, did not\r\nundertake the task, though urged to do so both by Count Inouye and\r\nMr. Komura, the new Representative, and the _Kun-ren-tai_ remained in\r\npower, and the King a prisoner. Had the recommendation of the Foreign\r\nRepresentatives, among whom the Russian Representatives was the most\r\nemphatic in urging the interference of Japan, been adopted, it is\r\nmore than probable that the present predominance of Russian influence\r\nin Korea would have been avoided. It is only fair to the Russian\r\nGovernment to state that it gave a distinct mandate to the Japanese\r\nto disarm the _Kun-ren-tai_ and take charge of the King. The Japanese\r\nGovernment declined, and therefore is alone responsible for Russia’s\r\nsubsequent intervention.\r\n\r\nDuring November the dissatisfaction throughout Korea with the measures\r\nwhich were taken and proposed increased, and the position became so\r\nstrained, owing to the demand of the Foreign Representatives and of\r\nall classes of Koreans that the occurrences of the 8th of October must\r\nbe investigated, and that the fiction of the Queen being in hiding\r\nshould be abandoned, that the Cabinet unwillingly recognized that\r\nsomething must be done. So on 26th November the Foreign Representatives\r\nwere invited by the King to the Palace, and the Prime Minister, in\r\npresence of His Majesty, who was profoundly agitated, produced a\r\ndecree bearing the King’s signature, dismissing the special nominees\r\nof the mutineers, the Ministers of War and Police, declaring that the\r\nso-called Edict degrading the Queen was set aside and treated as void\r\nfrom the beginning, and that she was reinstated in her former honors;\r\nthat the occurrences of the 8th October were to be investigated by the\r\nDepartment of Justice, and that the guilty persons were to be tried and\r\npunished. The death of Her Majesty was announced at the same time.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this audience, Mr. Sill, the United States\r\nMinister, expressed to the King “his profound satisfaction with the\r\nannouncement.” Mr. Hillier followed by “congratulating His Majesty on\r\nthese satisfactory steps, and hoped it would be the beginning of a time\r\nof peace and tranquillity, and relieve His Majesty from much anxiety.”\r\nThese good wishes were cordially endorsed by his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe measures proposed by the King to reassert his lost authority and\r\npunish the conspirators promised very well, but were rendered abortive\r\nby a “loyal plot,” which was formed by the Old Palace Guard and a\r\nnumber of Koreans, some of them by no means insignificant men. It had\r\nfor its object the liberation of the sovereign and the substitution\r\nof loyal troops for the _Kun-ren-tai_. Though it ended in a fiasco\r\ntwo nights after this hopeful interview, its execution having been\r\nfrustrated by premature disclosures, its results were disastrous,\r\nfor it involved a number of prominent men, created grave suspicions,\r\nraised up a feeling of antagonism to foreigners, some of whom (American\r\nmissionaries) were believed to be cognizant of the plot, if not\r\nactually accessories, and brought about a general confusion, from\r\nwhich, when I left Korea five weeks later, there was no prospect of\r\nescape. The King was a closer prisoner than ever; those surrounding him\r\ngrew familiar and insolent; he lived in dread of assassination; and\r\nhe had no more intercourse with foreigners, except with those who had\r\nan official right to enter the Palace, which they became increasingly\r\nunwilling to exercise.\r\n\r\nIt was with much regret that I left Seoul for a journey in the interior\r\nat this most exciting time, when every day brought fresh events and\r\nrumors, and a _coup d’état_ of great importance was believed to be\r\nimpending; but I had very little time at my disposal before proceeding\r\nto Western China on a long-planned journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] General Dye, late of the U.S. army, was instructor of the Old\r\nGuard. Mr. Sabatin, a Russian subject, was temporarily employed as a\r\nwatchman to see that the sentries were at their posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nBURIAL CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the interpreter difficulty had appeared as before insurmountable,\r\nI was provided with one who acquitted himself to perfection, and\r\nthrough whose good offices I came much nearer to the people than if I\r\nhad been accompanied by a foreigner. He spoke English remarkably well,\r\nwas always bright, courteous, intelligent, and good-natured; he had a\r\nkeen sense of the ludicrous, and I owe much of the pleasure, as well as\r\nthe interest, of my journey to his companionship. Mr. Hillier equipped\r\nme with Im, a soldier of the Legation Guard, as my servant. He had\r\nattended me on photographing expeditions on a former visit, and on the\r\njourney I found him capable, faithful, quick, and full of “go,”--so\r\nvaluable and efficient, indeed, as to “take the shine” out of any\r\nsubsequent attendant. With these, a passport, and a _kwan-ja_ or letter\r\nfrom the Korean Foreign Office commending me to official help (never\r\nused), my journey was made under the best possible auspices.\r\n\r\nThe day before I left was spent in making acquaintance with Mr. Yi\r\nHak In, receiving farewell visits from many kind and helpful friends,\r\nlooking over the backs and tackle of the ponies I had engaged for\r\nthe journey, and in arranging a photographic outfit. Im was taught\r\nto make curry, an accomplishment in which he soon excelled, and I\r\nhad no other cooking done on the journey. For the benefit of future\r\ntravellers I will mention that my equipment consisted of a camp-bed\r\nand bedding, candles, a large, strong, doubly oiled sheet, a folding\r\nchair, a kettle, two pots, a cup and two plates of enamelled iron,\r\nsome tea which turned out musty, some flour, curry powder, and\r\na tin of Edward’s “dessicated soup,” which came back unopened!\r\nTo the oft-repeated question, “Did you eat Korean food?” I reply\r\ncertainly--pheasants, fowls, potatoes, and eggs. Warm winter clothing,\r\na Japanese _kurumaya’s_ hat (the best of all travelling hats), and\r\nKorean string shoes completed my outfit, and I never needed anything I\r\nhad not got!\r\n\r\nThe start on 7th November was managed in good time, without any of\r\nthe usual delays, and I may say at once that the _mapu_, the bugbear\r\nand torment of travellers usually, never gave the slightest trouble.\r\nThough engaged by the day, they were ready to make long day’s journeys,\r\nwere always willing and helpful, and a month later we parted excellent\r\nfriends. As this is my second favorable experience, I am inclined to\r\nthink that Korean _mapu_ are a maligned class. For each pony and man,\r\nthe food of both being included, I paid $1, about 2s., per day when\r\ntravelling, and half that sum when halting. Mr. Yi had two ponies, I\r\ntwo baggage animals, on one of which Im rode, and a saddle pony, _i.e._\r\na pack pony equipped with my sidesaddle for the occasion.\r\n\r\nStarting from the English Legation and the Customs’ buildings, we left\r\nthe city by the West Gate, and passing the stone stumps which up till\r\nlately supported the carved and colored roof under which generations\r\nof Korean kings after their accession met the Chinese envoys, who came\r\nin great state to invest them with Korean sovereignty, and through\r\nthe narrow and rugged defile known as the Peking Pass, we left the\r\nunique capital and its lofty clambering wall out of sight. The day was\r\nsplendid even for a Korean autumn, and the frightful black pinnacles,\r\nserrated ridges, and flaming corrugations of Puk Han on the right\r\nof the road were atmospherically idealized into perfect beauty. For\r\nseveral miles the road was thronged with bulls loaded with faggots,\r\nrice, and pine brush, for the supply of the daily necessities of\r\nthe city; then, except when passing through the villages, it became\r\nsolitary enough, except for an occasional group of long-sworded\r\nJapanese travellers, or baggage ponies in charge of Japanese soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe road as far as Pa Ju lies through pretty country, small valleys\r\neither terraced for rice, which was lying out to dry on the dykes,\r\nor growing barley, wheat, millet, and cotton, surrounded by low but\r\nshapely hills, denuded of everything but oak and pine scrub, but with\r\nfolds in which the _Pinus sinensis_ grew in dark clumps, lighted up\r\nby the vanishing scarlet of the maple and the glowing crimson of the\r\n_Ampelopsis Veitchii_.\r\n\r\nOn the lower slopes, and usually in close proximity to the timber, are\r\nnumerous villages, their groups of deep-eaved, brown-thatched roofs,\r\non which scarlet capsicums were laid out to dry, looking pretty enough\r\nas adjuncts to landscapes which on the whole lack life and emphasis.\r\nThe villages through which the road passes were seen at their best, for\r\nthe roadway, serving for the village threshing floor, was daily swept\r\nfor the threshing of rice and millet, the passage of travellers being a\r\nsecondary consideration; everything was dry, and the white clothes of\r\nthe people were consequently at their cleanliest.\r\n\r\nAt noon we reached Ko-yang, a poor place of 300 hovels, with ruinous\r\nofficial buildings of some size, once handsome. At this, and every\r\nother magistracy up to Phyöng-yang, from 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers\r\nwere quartered in the _yamens_. The people hated them with a hatred\r\nwhich is the legacy of three centuries, but could not allege anything\r\nagainst them, admitting that they paid for all they got, molested no\r\none, and were seldom seen outside the _yamen_ gates. There the _mapu_\r\nhalted for two hours to give their ponies and themselves a feed.\r\nThis midday halt is one bone of contention between travellers and\r\nthemselves. No amount of hunting and worrying them shortens the halt by\r\nmore than ten minutes, and I preferred peace of spirit, only insisting\r\nthat when the road admitted of it, as it frequently did, they should\r\ntravel 12 _li_, or about three and three-quarter miles, an hour. At\r\nKo-yang I began the custom of giving the landlord of the inn at which\r\nI halted 100 _cash_ for the room in which I rested, which gave great\r\nsatisfaction. I had my mattress laid upon the hot floor, and as Im,\r\nby instinct, secured privacy for me by fastening up mats and curtains\r\nover the paper walls and doors, these midday halts were very pleasant.\r\nAlmost every house in these roadside villages and small towns has a low\r\ntable of such food as Koreans love laid out under the eaves.\r\n\r\nBeyond Ko-yang, standing out in endless solemnity above a pine wood on\r\nthe side of a steep hill, are two of the strangely few antiquities of\r\nwhich Korea can boast. These are two _mirioks_, colossal busts, about\r\n35 feet in height, carved out of the solid rock. They are supposed to\r\nbe relics of the very early days of Korean Buddhism, when men were\r\nreligious enough to toil at such stupendous works, and to represent the\r\nmale and female elements in nature. They are side by side. One wears\r\na round and the other a square hat. The Buddhistic calm, or rather\r\nI should say apathy, rests on their huge faces, which have looked\r\nstolidly on many a change in Korea, but on none greater than the last\r\nyear had witnessed.\r\n\r\nDuring the day we saw three funerals, and I observed that a Japanese\r\ndetachment which occupied the whole road filed to the right and left\r\nto let one of the processions pass, the men raising their caps to the\r\ncorpse as they did so. These funerals gave an impression of gaiety\r\nrather than grief. Two men walked first, carrying silk bannerets which\r\ndesignated the woman about to be interred as the wife of so and so, a\r\nmarried woman having no name. Next came a man walking backwards with\r\nmany streamers of colored ribbon floating from his hat, ringing a large\r\nbell, and accompanying its clang with a dissonance supposed to be\r\nsinging. The coffin, under a four-posted domed cover and concealed by\r\ngay curtains, was borne on a platform by twelve men, and was followed\r\nby a large party of male mourners, a man with a musical instrument, a\r\ntable, and a box of food. None of the faces were composed to a look of\r\ngrief. On the dome were two mythical birds resembling the phœnix. The\r\ndome and curtains were brilliantly colored, and decorated with ribbon\r\nstreamers. Two corpses, each extended on a board and covered with white\r\npaper pasted over small hoops, lay in the roadway at different places.\r\nThese were bodies of persons who had died far from home and were being\r\nconveyed to their friends for burial. Later we met another funeral, the\r\ncorpse carried as before on a platform by twelve bearers, who moved\r\nto a rhythmic chant of the most cheerful description, the whole party\r\nbeing as jolly as if they were going to a marriage. There was a cross\r\nin front of the gay hearse with an extended dragon on each arm, and\r\nfour large gaily painted birds resembling pheasants were on the dome.\r\n\r\nKorean customs as to death and burial deserve a brief notice. When a\r\nman or woman falls ill, the _mu-tang_ or sorceress is called in to\r\nexorcise the spirit which has caused the illness. When this fails and\r\ndeath becomes imminent, in the case of a man no women are allowed to\r\nremain in the room but his nearest female relations, and in that of a\r\nwoman all men must withdraw except her husband, father, and brother.\r\nAfter death the body, specially at the joints, is shampooed, and when\r\nit has been made flexible it is covered with a clean sheet and laid for\r\nthree days on a board, on which seven stars are painted. This board is\r\neventually burned at the grave. The “Star Board,” as it is called, is\r\na euphemism for death, and is spoken of as we speak of “the grave.”\r\nDuring these days the grave-clothes, which are of good materials in\r\nred, blue, and yellow coloring, are prepared. Korean custom enjoins\r\nthat burial shall be delayed in the case of a poor man three days only,\r\nin that of a middle class man nine days, of a nobleman or high official\r\nthree months, and in that of one of the Royal Family nine months, but\r\nthis period may be abridged or extended at the pleasure of the King.\r\n\r\nMan is supposed to have three souls. After death one occupies the\r\ntablet, one the grave, and one the Unknown. During the passing of\r\nthe spirit there is complete silence. The under garments of the dead\r\nare taken out by a servant, who waves them in the air and calls him\r\nby name, the relations and friends meantime wailing loudly. After\r\na time the clothes are thrown upon the roof. When the corpse has\r\nbeen temporarily dressed, it is bound so tightly round the chest as\r\nsometimes to break the shoulder blades, which is interpreted as a sign\r\nof good luck. After these last offices a table is placed outside the\r\ndoor, on which are three bowls of rice and a squash. Beside it are\r\nthree pair of straw sandals. The rice and sandals are for the three\r\n_sajas_, or official servants, who come to conduct one of the souls\r\nto the “Ten Judges.” The squash is broken, the shoes burned, and the\r\nrice thrown away within half an hour after death. Pictures of the\r\n_Siptai-wong_ or “Ten Judges” are to be seen in Buddhist temples in\r\nKorea. On a man’s death one of his souls is seized by their servants\r\nand carried to the Unknown, where these Judges, who through their spies\r\nare kept well-informed as to human deeds, sentence it accordingly,\r\neither to “a good place” or to one of the manifold hells. The influence\r\nof Buddhism doubtless maintains the observance of this singular custom,\r\neven where the idea of its significance is lost or discredited.\r\n\r\nThe coffin is oblong. Where interment is delayed, it is hermetically\r\nsealed with several coats of lacquer. Until the funeral there is\r\nwailing daily in the dead man’s house at the three hours of meals. Next\r\nthe geomancer is consulted about the site for the grave, and receives\r\na fee heavy in proportion to the means of the family. He is believed\r\nfrom long study to have become acquainted with all the good and bad\r\ninfluences which are said to reside in the ground. A fortunate site\r\nbrings rank, wealth, and many sons to the sons and grandsons of the\r\ndeceased, and should be, if possible, on the southerly slope of a hill.\r\nHe also chooses an auspicious day for the burial.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a rich man, the grave with a stone altar in front of it\r\nis prepared beforehand, in that of a poor man not till the procession\r\narrives. The coffin is placed in a gaily decorated hearse, and with\r\nwailing, music, singing, wine, food, and if in the evening, with many\r\ncolored lanterns, the _cortège_ proceeds to the grave. A widow may\r\naccompany her husband’s corpse in a closed chair, though this appears\r\nunusual, but the mourners are all men in immense hats, which conceal\r\ntheir faces, and sackcloth clothing.\r\n\r\nAfter the burial and the making of the circular mound over the coffin,\r\na libation of wine is poured out and the company proceeds to sacrifice\r\nand to feast. Offerings of wine and dried fish are placed on the stone\r\naltar in front of the grave if it has been erected, or on small tables.\r\nThe relatives, facing these and the grave, make five prostrations,\r\nand a formula wishing peace to the spirit which is to dwell there is\r\nrepeated. Behind the grave similar offerings and prostrations are made\r\nto the mountain spirit, who presides over it, and who is the host of\r\nthe soul committed to his care. The wine is thrown away, and the fish\r\nbestowed upon the servants. It will be observed that no priest has any\r\npart in the ceremonies connected with death and burial, and that two\r\nsouls have now been disposed of--one to the judgment of the Unknown,\r\nand the other to the keeping of the mountain spirit.\r\n\r\nA chair is invariably carried in a funeral procession containing the\r\nmemorial, or, as we say, the “ancestral tablet” of the deceased, a\r\nstrip of white wood, bearing the family name, set in a socket. A part\r\nof the inscription on this is written at the house, and it is completed\r\nat the grave. It is carried back with exactly the same style and\r\nattendance that the dead man would have had had he been living, for the\r\nthird soul is supposed to return to the house with the mourners, and\r\nto take up its abode in the tablet, which is placed in a vacant room\r\nand raised on a black lacquer chair with a black lacquer table before\r\nit, on which renewed offerings are made of bread, wine, cooked meat,\r\nand vermicelli soup, the spirit being supposed to regale itself with\r\ntheir odors. The mourners again prostrate themselves five times, after\r\nwhich they eat the offerings in an adjoining room. It is customary for\r\nfriends to strew the route of the procession with paper money.\r\n\r\nIn the period between the death and the interment silence is observed\r\nin the house of mourning, and only those visitors are received who come\r\nto condole with the family and speak of the virtues of the departed.\r\nIt is believed that conversation on any ordinary topic will cause the\r\ncorpse to shake in the coffin and show other symptoms of unrest. For\r\nthe same reason the servants are very particular in watching the cats\r\nof the household if there are any, but cats are not in favor in Korea.\r\nIt is terribly unlucky for a cat to jump over a corpse. It may even\r\ncause it to stand upright. After the deceased has been carried out\r\nof the house, two or three _mu-tangs_ or sorceresses enter it with\r\nmusical instruments and the other paraphernalia of their profession.\r\nAfter a time one becomes “inspired” by the spirit of the dead man,\r\nand accurately impersonates him, even to his small tricks of manner,\r\nmovement, and speech. She gives a narrative of his life in the first\r\nperson singular, if he were a bad man confessing his misdeeds, which\r\nmay have been unsuspected by his neighbors, and if he were a good man,\r\nnarrating his virtues with becoming modesty. At the end she bows, takes\r\na solemn farewell of those present, and retires.\r\n\r\nAfter the tablet has been removed to the ancestral temple, and the\r\nperiod of mourning is over, meals are offered in the shrine once every\r\nmonth, and also on the anniversary of each death, all the descendants\r\nassembling, and these observances extend backwards to the ancestors\r\nof five generations. Thus it is a very costly thing to have many near\r\nrelations and a number of ancestors, the expense falling on the eldest\r\nson and his heirs. A Korean gentleman told me that his nephew, upon\r\nwhom this duty falls, spends more upon it than upon his household\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nIt is not till the three years’ mourning for a father has expired that\r\nhis tablet is removed to the ancestral temple which rich men have near\r\ntheir houses. During the period of mourning it is kept in a vacant\r\nroom, usually in the women’s apartments. A poor man puts it in a box on\r\none side of his room, and when he worships his other ancestors, strips\r\nof paper with their names upon them are pasted on the mud wall. I have\r\nslept in rooms in which the tablet lay smothered in dust on one of the\r\ncrossbeams. Common people only worship for their ancestors of three\r\ngenerations. The anniversary of a father’s death is kept with much\r\nceremony for three years. On the previous night sacrifice is offered\r\nbefore the tablet, and on the following day the friends pay visits of\r\ncondolence to the family, and eat varieties of food. During the day\r\nthey visit the grave and offer sacrifices to the soul and the mountain\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nA widow wears mourning all her life. If she has no son she acts the\r\npart of a son in performing the ancestral rites for her husband. It has\r\nnot been correct for widows to remarry. If, however, a widow inherits\r\nproperty she occasionally marries to rid herself of importunities, in\r\nwhich case she is usually robbed and deserted.\r\n\r\nThe custom of tolerating the remarriage of widows has, however, lately\r\nbeen changed into the _right_ of remarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nSONG-DO: A ROYAL CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt grew dark before we reached Pa Ju, and the _mapu_ were in great\r\nterror of tigers and robbers. It is unpleasant to reach a Korean\r\ninn after nightfall, for there are no lights by which to unload the\r\nbaggage, and noise and confusion prevail.\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller arrives a man rushes in with a brush, stirs up the\r\ndust and vermin, and sometimes puts down a coarse mat. Experience has\r\ntaught me that an oiled sheet is a better protection against vermin\r\nthan a pony-load of insect powder. I made much use of the tripod of\r\nmy camera. It served as a candle-stand, a barometer suspender, and an\r\narrangement on which to hang my clothes at night out of harm’s way. In\r\ntwo hours after arrival my food was ready, after which Mr. Yi came in\r\nto talk over the day, to plan the morrow, to enlighten me on Korean\r\ncustoms, and to interpret my orders to the faithful Im, and by 8.30 I\r\nwas asleep!\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Pa Ju the country is extremely pretty, and one of the\r\nmost picturesque views in Korea is from the height overlooking the\r\nromantically situated village of Im-jin, clustering along both sides of\r\na ravine, which terminates on the broad Im-jin Gang, a tributary of the\r\nHan, in two steep rocky bluffs, sprinkled with the _Pinus sinensis_,\r\nthe two being connected by a fine, double-roofed granite Chinese\r\ngateway, inscribed “Gate for the tranquillization of the West.” The\r\nroad passing down the village street reaches the water’s edge through\r\nthis relic, one of three or four similar barriers on this high-road\r\nto China. The Im-jin Gang, there 343 yards broad, has shallow water\r\nand a flat sandy shore on its north side, but a range of high bluffs,\r\ncrowned with extensive old defensive works, lines the south side, the\r\ngateway being the only break for many miles. Below these the river is\r\na deep green stream, navigable for craft of 14 tons for 40 miles from\r\nits mouth. There was a still, faintly blue atmosphere, and the sails of\r\nboats passing dreamily into the mountains over the silver water had a\r\nmost artistic effect.\r\n\r\nThere are two Chinese bridges on that road, curved slabs of stone,\r\nsupported on four-sided blocks of granite, giving one a feeling of\r\nsecurity, even though they have no parapets. Korean bridges are poles\r\nlaid over a river, with matting or brushwood covered with earth upon\r\nthem, and are usually full of holes. These precarious structures had\r\njust been replaced after the summer rains. A _mapu_ usually goes ahead\r\nto test their solidity. The region is extremely fertile, producing\r\nfine crops of rice, wheat, barley, millet, buckwheat, cotton, sesamum,\r\ncastor oil, beans, maize, tobacco, capsicums, egg plant, peas, etc. But\r\nRussian and American kerosene is fast displacing the vegetable oils for\r\nburning, and is producing the same revolution in village evening life\r\nwhich it has effected in the Western Islands of Scotland. I never saw\r\na Korean hamlet south of Phyöng-yang, however far from the main road,\r\ninto which kerosene had not penetrated.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to halt for the night when only 10 _li_ from Song-do, all\r\nthe more regretfully, because the people were unwilling to receive a\r\nforeigner, and the family room which I occupied, only 8 feet 6 inches\r\nby 6 feet, was heated up to 85°, was poisoned with the smell of cakes\r\nof rotting beans, and was so alive with vermin of every description\r\nthat I was obliged to suspend a curtain over my bed to prevent them\r\nfrom falling upon it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, in an atmosphere which idealized everything, we\r\nreached Song-do, or Kai-söng, now the second city in the kingdom, once\r\nthe capital of Hon-jö, one of the three kingdoms which united to form\r\nKorea, and the capital of Korea five centuries ago. A city of 60,000\r\npeople, lying to the south of Sang-dan San, with a wall ten miles\r\nin circumference running irregularly over heights, and pierced by\r\ndouble-roofed gateways, with a peaked and splintered ridge extending\r\nfrom Sang-dan San to the northeast, its higher summits attaining\r\naltitudes of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, it has a striking resemblance to\r\nSeoul.\r\n\r\nThe great gate is approached by an avenue of trees, and the road\r\nis lined with _seun-tjeung-pi_, monuments to good governors and\r\nmagistrates, faithful widows, and pious sons. A wide street, its\r\napparent width narrowed by two rows of thatched booths, divides the\r\ncity. It was a scene of bustle, activity, and petty trade, something\r\nlike a fair. The women wear white sheets gathered round their heads and\r\nnearly reaching their feet. The street was thronged with men in huge\r\nhats and very white clothing, with boy bridegrooms in pink garments\r\nand the quaint yellow hats which custom enjoins for several months\r\nafter marriage, and with mourners dressed in sackcloth from head to\r\nfoot, the head and shoulders concealed by peaked and scalloped hats,\r\nthe identity being further disguised by two-handled sackcloth screens,\r\nheld up to their eyes. In thatched stalls on low stands and on mats on\r\nthe ground were all Korean necessaries and luxuries, among which were\r\nlarge quantities of English piece goods, and hacked pieces of beef\r\nwith the blood in it, Korean killed meat being enough to make any one\r\na vegetarian. Goats are killed by pulling them to and fro in a narrow\r\nstream, which method is said to destroy the rank taste of the flesh;\r\ndogs by twirling them in a noose until they are unconscious, after\r\nwhich they are bled. I have already inflicted on my readers an account\r\nof the fate of a bullock at Korean hands. It was a busy, dirty, poor,\r\nmean scene under the hot sun.\r\n\r\nThe Song-do inns are bad, and a friend of Mr. Yi kindly lent me a\r\nhouse, partly in ruins, but with two rooms which sheltered Im and\r\nmyself, and in this I spent two pleasant days in lovely weather,\r\nMr. Yi, who was visiting friends, escorting me to the Song-do\r\nsights, which may be seen in one morning, and to pay visits in some\r\nof the better-class houses. My quarters, though by comparison very\r\ncomfortable, would not at home be considered fit for the housing of\r\na better-class cow! But Korea has a heavenly climate for much of the\r\nyear. The squalor, dust, and rubbish in my compound and everywhere were\r\ninconceivable, though the city is rather a “well-to-do” one. The water\r\nsupply is atrocious, offal and refuse of all kinds lying up to the\r\nmouths of the wells. It says something for the security of Korea that a\r\nforeign lady could safely live in a dwelling up a lonely alley in the\r\nheart of a big city, with no attendant but a Korean soldier knowing not\r\na word of English, who, had he been so minded, might have cut my throat\r\nand decamped with my money, of which he knew the whereabouts, neither\r\nmy door nor the compound having any fastening!\r\n\r\nPoints of interest in a Korean city are few, and the ancient capital is\r\nno exception to the rule. There is a fine bronze bell with curiously\r\ninvolved dragons in one of the gate towers, cast five centuries ago,\r\nan archery ground with official pavilions on a height with a superb\r\nview, the Governor’s _yamen_, once handsome, now ruinous, with Japanese\r\nsentries, a dismal temple to Confucius, and a showy one to the God of\r\nWar. Outside the crowd and bustle of the city, reached by a narrow path\r\namong prosperous ginseng farms and persimmon-embowered hamlets, are the\r\nlonely remains of the palace of the Kings who reigned in Korea prior\r\nto the dynasty of which the present sovereign is the representative,\r\nand even in their forlornness they give the impression that the Korean\r\nKings were much statelier monarchs then than now.\r\n\r\nThe remains consist of an approach to the main platform on which the\r\npalace stood, by two subsidiary platforms, the first reached by a\r\nnearly obliterated set of steps. Four staircases 15 feet wide, of\r\nthirty steps each, lead to a lofty artificial platform, faced with\r\nhewn stone in great blocks, 14 feet high, and by rough measurement 846\r\nfeet in length. On the east side there are massive abutments. On the\r\nwest the platform broadens irregularly. At the entrance, 80 feet wide,\r\nat the top of the steps, there are the bases of columns suggestive of\r\na very stately approach. The palace platform is intersected by massive\r\nstone foundations of halls and rooms, some of large area. It is backed\r\nby a pine-clothed knoll, and is prettily situated in an amphitheatre of\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nSong-do as a royal city, and as one of the so-called fortresses for\r\nthe protection of the capital, still retains many ancient privileges.\r\nIt is a bustling business town, and a great centre of the grain trade.\r\nIt has various mercantile guilds with their places of business, small\r\nshops built round compounds with entrance gates. It makes wooden\r\nshoes, coarse pottery and fine matting, and imports paper, which it\r\nmanufactures with sesamum oil into the oil paper for which Korea is\r\nfamous, and which is made into cloaks, umbrellas, tobacco-pouches, and\r\nsheets for walls and floors. In answer to many inquiries, I learned\r\nthat trade had improved considerably since the war, but the native\r\ntraders now have to compete with fourteen Japanese shops, and to suffer\r\nthe presence of forty Japanese residents.\r\n\r\nI have left until the last the commodity for which Song-do is famous,\r\nand which is the chief source of its prosperity--ginseng. _Panax\r\nGinseng_ or _quinquefolia_ (?) is, as its name imports, a “panacea.” No\r\none can be in the Far East for many days without hearing of this root\r\nand its virtues. No drug in the British Pharmacopœia rivals with us\r\nthe estimation in which this is held by the Chinese. It is a tonic, a\r\nfebrifuge, a stomachic, the very elixir of life, taken spasmodically or\r\nregularly in Chinese wine by most Chinese who can afford it. It is one\r\nof the most valuable articles which Korea exports, and one great source\r\nof its revenue. In the steamer in which I left Chemulpo there was a\r\nconsignment of it worth $140,000. But valuable as the cultivated root\r\nis, it is nothing to the value of the wild, which grows in Northern\r\nKorea, a single specimen of which has been sold for £40! It is chiefly\r\nfound in the Kang-ge Mountains; but it is rare, and the search so\r\noften ends in failure, that the common people credit it with magical\r\nproperties, and believe that only men of pure lives can find it.\r\n\r\nThe ginseng season was at its height. People talked, thought, and\r\ndreamed ginseng, for the risks of its six or seven years’ growth were\r\nover, and the root was actually in the factory. I went to several\r\nginseng farms, and also saw the different stages of the manufacturing\r\nprocess, and received the same impression as in Siberia, that if\r\nindustry were lucrative, and the Korean were sure of his earnings, he\r\nwould be an industrious and even a thrifty person.\r\n\r\nAll round Song-do are carefully fenced farms on which ginseng is\r\ngrown with great care and exquisite neatness on beds 18 inches wide,\r\n2 feet high, and neatly bordered with slates. It is sown in April,\r\ntransplanted in the following spring, and again in three years into\r\nspecially prepared ground, not recently cultivated, and which has not\r\nbeen used for ginseng culture for seven years. Up to the second year\r\nthe plant has only two leaves. In the fourth year it is six inches\r\nhigh with four leaves, standing out at right angles from the stalk. It\r\nreaches maturity in the sixth or seventh year. During its growth it is\r\nsheltered from both wind and sun by well-made reed roofs with blinds,\r\nwhich are raised or lowered as may be required. When the root is taken\r\nup it is known as “white ginseng,” and is bought by merchants, who get\r\nit “manufactured,” about 3¹⁄₄ _catties_ of the fresh root making one\r\n_cattie_ of “red” or commercial ginseng. The grower pays a tax of 20\r\ncents per _cattie_, and the merchant 16 dollars a _cattie_ for the root\r\nas received from the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe annual time of manufacture depends on orders given by the\r\nGovernment. The growers and merchants make the most profit when the\r\ndate is early. Only two manufacturers are licensed, and one hundred\r\nand fifty growers. The quantity to be manufactured is also limited.\r\nIn 1895 it was 15,000 _catties_ of red ginseng and 3,000 of “beards.”\r\nThe terms “beards” and “tails” are used to denote different parts of\r\nthe root, which eventually has a grotesque resemblance to a headless\r\nman! It is possible that this likeness is the source of some of the\r\nalmost miraculous virtues which are attributed to it. Everything about\r\nthe factories is scrupulously clean, and would do credit to European\r\nmanagement. The row of houses used by what we should call the excisemen\r\nare well built and comfortable. There are two officials sent from Seoul\r\nby the Agricultural Department for the “season,” with four policemen\r\nand two attendants, whose expenses are paid by the manufacturers,\r\nand each step of the manufacture and the egress of the workmen are\r\ncarefully watched. Mr. Yi was sent by the Customs to make special\r\ninquiries in connection with the revenue derived.\r\n\r\nGinseng is steamed for twenty-four hours in large earthen jars over\r\niron pots built into furnaces, and is then partially dried in a room\r\nkept at a high temperature by charcoal. The final drying is effected\r\nby exposing the roots in elevated flat baskets to the rays of the\r\nbright winter sun. The human resemblance survives these processes,\r\nbut afterwards the “beards” and “tails,” used chiefly in Korea, are\r\ncut off, and the trunk, from 3 to 4 inches long, looks like a piece\r\nof clouded amber. These trunks are carefully picked over, and being\r\nclassified according to size, are neatly packed in small oblong baskets\r\ncontaining about five _catties_ each, twelve or fourteen of these being\r\npacked in a basket, which is waterproofed and matted, and stamped and\r\nsealed by the Agricultural Department as ready for exportation. A\r\nbasket, according to quality, is worth from $14,000 to $20,000! In a\r\ngood season the grower makes about fifteen times his outlay. Ginseng\r\nwas a Royal monopoly, but times have changed. This medicine, which has\r\nsuch a high and apparently partially deserved reputation throughout\r\nthe Far East, does not suit Europeans, and is of little account with\r\nEuropean doctors.\r\n\r\nA Post Office had been established in Song-do under Korean management,\r\nand I not only received but sent a letter, which reached its\r\ndestination safely! Buddhism still prevails to some extent in this\r\ncity, and large sums are expended upon the services of sorcerers. In\r\nSong-do I saw, what very rarely may be seen in Seoul and elsewhere, a\r\n“Red Door.” These are a very high honor reserved for rare instances of\r\nfaithfulness in widows, loyalty in subjects, and piety in sons. When\r\na widow (almost invariably of the upper class) weeps ceaselessly for\r\nher husband, maintains the deepest seclusion, attends loyally to her\r\nfather- and mother-in-law, and spends her time in pious deeds, the\r\npeople of the neighborhood, proud of her virtues, represent them to the\r\nGovernor of the province, who conveys their recommendation to the King,\r\nwith whom it rests to confer the “Red Door.” The distinction is also\r\ngiven to the family of an eminently loyal subject, who has given his\r\nlife for the King’s life.\r\n\r\nThe case of a son whose father has reached a great age is somewhat\r\ndifferent, and the honor is more emphatic still. His filial virtue is\r\nshown by such methods as these. He goes every morning to his father’s\r\napartments, asks him how his health is, how he has slept, what he has\r\neaten for breakfast, and how he enjoyed the meal--if he has any fancies\r\nfor dinner, and if he shall go to the market and buy him some _tai_\r\n(the best fish in Korea), and if he shall come back and assist him to\r\ntake a walk? The reader will observe how extremely material the pious\r\nson’s inquiries are. Such assiduity continued during a course of years,\r\non being represented to the King, may receive the coveted red portal.\r\nIn former days, these matters used to be referred to the Suzerain, the\r\nEmperor of China. In Song-do, as in the villages, a straw fringe is\r\nfrequently to be seen stretched across a door, either plain or with\r\nbits of charcoal knotted into it. The former denotes the birth of a\r\ngirl, the latter that of a boy. A girl is not specially welcome, nor is\r\nthe occasion one of festivity, but neither is it, as in some countries,\r\nregarded as a calamity, although, if it be a firstborn, the friends\r\nof the father are apt to write letters of condolence to him, with the\r\nconsoling suggestion that “the next will be a boy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIL-SUNG MON, SEVEN STAR GATE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE PHYÖNG-YANG BATTLEFIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nGlorious weather favored my departure from the ancient Korean capital.\r\nThe day’s journey lay through pretty country, small valleys, and\r\npicturesquely shaped hills, on which the vegetation, whatever it\r\nwas, had turned to a purple as rich as the English heather blossom,\r\nwhile the blue gloom of the pines emphasized the flaming reds of the\r\ndying leafage. The villages were few and small, and cultivation was\r\naltogether confined to the valleys. Pheasants were so abundant that the\r\n_mapu_ pelted them out of the cover by the roadside, and wild ducks\r\nabounded on every stream. The one really fine view of the day is from\r\nthe crest of a hill just beyond O-hung-suk Ju, where there is a second\r\ndefensive gate, with a ruinous wall carried along a ridge for some\r\ndistance on either side. The masonry and the gate-house are fine, and\r\nthe view down the wild valley beyond with its rich autumn coloring was\r\nalmost grand. It was evident that officials were expected, for the road\r\nwas being repaired everywhere--that is, spadefuls of soft soil were\r\nbeing taken from the banks and roadsides, and were being thrown into\r\nthe ruts and holes to deepen the quagmire which the next rain would\r\nproduce. From four to seven men were working at each spade! A great\r\npart of the male population had turned out; for when an official of\r\nrank is to travel, every family in the district must provide one male\r\nmember or a substitute to put the road in order. The repairs of the\r\nroads and bridges devolve entirely on the country people.\r\n\r\nThe following day brought a change of weather. My room had no hot\r\nfloor and the mercury at daybreak was only 20°! When we started, a\r\nstrong northwester was blowing, which increased to a gale by noon, the\r\nsame fierce gale in which at Chemulpo H.M.S. _Edgar_ lost her boat with\r\nforty-seven men. My pony and I would have been blown over a wretched\r\nbridge had not four men linked themselves together to support us;\r\nand later, on the top of a precipice above a river, a gust came with\r\nsuch force that the animals refused to face it, and one of them was\r\nas nearly lost as possible. By noon it was impossible to sit on our\r\nhorses, and we fought the storm on foot. When Im lifted me from my pony\r\nI fell down, and it took several men shouting with laughter to set me\r\non my feet again. When Mr. Yi and I spoke to each other, our voices had\r\na bobbery clatter, and sentences broke off halfway in an insane giggle.\r\nI felt as if there were hardly another “shot in the locker,” but if a\r\ntraveller “says die,” the men lose all heart, so I summoned up all my\r\npluck, took a photograph after the noon halt, and walked on at a good\r\npace.\r\n\r\nBut the wind, with the mercury at 26°, was awful, gripping the heart\r\nand benumbing the brain. I have not felt anything like it since I\r\nencountered the “devil wind” on the Zagros heights in Persia. At some\r\ndistance from our destination Mr. Yi, Im, and the _mapu_ begged me to\r\nhalt, as they could no longer face it, though the accommodation for\r\nman and beast at Tol Maru, where we put up, was the worst imaginable,\r\nand the large village the filthiest, most squalid, and most absolutely\r\npoverty-stricken place I saw in that land of squalor. The horses were\r\ncrowded together, and their baffled attempts at fighting were only less\r\nhideous than the shouts and yells of the _mapu_, who were constantly\r\nbeing roused out of a sound sleep to separate them.\r\n\r\nMy room was 8 feet by 6, and much occupied by the chattels of the\r\npeople, besides being alive with cockroaches and other forms of horrid\r\nlife. The dirt and discomfort in which the peasant Koreans live are\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nAn uninteresting tract of country succeeded, and some time was occupied\r\nin threading long treeless valleys, cut up by stony beds of streams,\r\nmargined by sandy flats, inundated in summer, and then covered chiefly\r\nwith withered reeds, asters, and artemisia, a belated aster every now\r\nand then displaying its untimely mauve blossom. All these and the dry\r\ngrasses and weeds of the hillsides were being cut and stacked for fuel,\r\neven brushwood having disappeared. This work is done by small boys, who\r\ncarry their loads on wooden saddles suited to their size. That region\r\nis very thinly peopled, only a few hamlets of squalid hovels being\r\nscattered over it, and cultivation was rare and untidy, except in one\r\nfine agricultural valley where wheat and barley were springing. No\r\nanimals, except a breed of pigs not larger than English terriers, were\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nOne of the most dismal and squalid “towns” on this route is Shur-hung,\r\na long rambling village of nearly 5,000 souls, and a magistracy, built\r\nalong the refuse-covered bank of a bright, shallow stream. As if the\r\nCrown official were the upas tree, the town with a _yamen_ is always\r\nmore forlorn than any other. In Shur-hung the large and once handsome\r\n_yamen_ buildings are all but in ruins, and so is the Confucian temple,\r\nvisited periodically, as all such temples are, by the magistrate, who\r\nbows before the tablet of the “most holy teacher” and offers an animal\r\nin sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe Korean official is the vampire which sucks the lifeblood of the\r\npeople. We had crossed the Tao-jol, the boundary between the provinces\r\nof Kyöng-hwi and Hwang-hai, and were then in the latter. Most officials\r\nof any standing live in Seoul for pleasure and society, leaving\r\nsubordinates in charge, and as their tenure of office is very brief,\r\nthey regard the people within their jurisdiction rather with reference\r\nto their squeezeableness than to their capacity for improvement.\r\n\r\nForty Japanese soldiers found a draughty shelter within the tumble-down\r\nbuildings of the _yamen_. As I walked down the street one of them\r\ntouched me on the shoulder, asking my nationality, whence I came, and\r\nwhither I was going, not quite politely, I thought. When I reached my\r\nroom a dozen of them came and gradually closed round my door, which I\r\ncould not shut, standing almost within it. A trim sergeant raised his\r\ncap to me, and passing on to Mr. Yi’s room, asked him where I came from\r\nand whither I was going, and on hearing, replied, “All right,” raised\r\nhis cap to me, and departed, withdrawing his men with him. This was\r\none of several domiciliary visits, and though they were usually very\r\npolitely made, they suggested the query as to the right to make them,\r\nand to whom the mastership in the land belonged. There, as elsewhere,\r\nthough the people hated the Japanese with an intense hatred, they were\r\nobliged to admit that they were very quiet and paid for everything they\r\ngot. If the soldiers had not been in European clothes, it would not\r\nhave occurred to me to think them rude for crowding round my door.\r\n\r\nA day’s ride through monotonous country brought us to Pong-san, where\r\nwe halted in the dirtiest hole I had till then been in. As soon as\r\nmy den was comfortably warm, myriads of house flies, blackening\r\nthe rafters, renewed a semi-torpid existence, dying in heaps in\r\nthe soup and curry, filling the well of the candlestick with their\r\nsinged bodies, and crawling in hundreds over my face. Next came the\r\ncockroaches in legions, large and small, torpid and active, followed\r\nby a great army of fleas and bugs, making life insupportable. To judge\r\nfrom the significant sounds from the public room, no one slept all\r\nnight, and when I asked Mr. Yi after his welfare the next morning, he\r\nuttered the one word “miserable.” Discomforts of this nature, less or\r\nmore, are inseparable from the Korean inn.\r\n\r\nThe following day, at a large village, we came upon the weekly market.\r\nIt is usual to inquire regarding the trade of a district, and as the\r\nresult of my inquiries, I assert that “trade” in the ordinary sense\r\nhas no existence in a great part of Central and Northern Korea, _i.e._\r\nthere is no exchange of commodities between one place and another, no\r\nexports, no imports by resident merchants, and no industries supplying\r\nmore than a local demand. Such are to be found to some extent in\r\nSouthern Korea, and specially in the province of Chul-la. Apart from\r\nPhyöng-yang, “trade” does not exist in the region through which I\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\nReasons for such a state of things may be found in the debased coinage,\r\nso bulky that a pony can only carry £10 worth of it, the entire lack\r\nof such banking facilities as even in Western China render business\r\ntransactions easy; the general mutual distrust; prejudices against\r\npreparing hides and working leather; caste prejudices; the general\r\ninsecurity of earnings, ignorance absolutely inconceivable, and the\r\nexistence of numerous guilds which possess practical monopolies.\r\n\r\nUnder Japanese influence, however, the superb silver _yen_ has made its\r\nway slowly into the interior, and instead of having to carry a load of\r\n_cash_, as on my former journey, or to be placed in great difficulties\r\nby the want of it, this large silver coin was readily taken at all\r\nthe inns, although I did not see a single specimen of the new Korean\r\ncoinage.\r\n\r\n“Trade,” as I became acquainted with it, is represented by Japanese\r\nbuyers, who visit the small towns and villages, buying up rice, grain,\r\nand beans, which they forward to the ports for shipment to Japan, and\r\nby an organized corporation of _pusang_ or pedlars, one of the most\r\nimportant of the many guilds which have been among the curious features\r\nof Korea.\r\n\r\nThere are no shops in villages, and few, where there are any, even\r\nin small towns. It is, in fact, impossible to buy anything except on\r\nthe market-day, as no one keeps any stock of anything. At the weekly\r\nmarket the usual melancholy dulness of a Korean village is exchanged\r\nfor bustle, color, and crowds of men. From an early hour in the morning\r\nthe paths leading to the officially appointed centre are thronged with\r\npeasants bringing in their wares for sale or barter, chiefly fowls\r\nin coops, pigs, straw shoes, straw hats, and wooden spoons, while\r\nthe main road has its complement of merchants, _i.e._ pedlars, mostly\r\nfine, strong, well-dressed men, either carrying their heavy packs\r\nthemselves or employing porters or bulls for the purpose. These men\r\ntravel on regular circuits to the village centres, and are industrious\r\nand respectable. A few put-up stalls, specially those who sell silks,\r\ngauzes, cords for girdles, dress shoes, amber, buttons, silks in\r\nskeins, small mirrors, tobacco-pouches, dress combs of tortoise-shell\r\nfor men’s topknots, tape girdles for trousers, boxes with mirror tops,\r\nand the like. But most of the articles, from which one learns a good\r\ndeal about the necessaries and luxuries required by the Korean, are\r\nexposed for sale on low tables or on mats on the ground, the merchant\r\ngiving the occupant of the house before which he camps a few _cash_ for\r\nthe accommodation.\r\n\r\nOn such tables are sticks of pulled candy as thick as an arm, some of\r\nit stuffed with sesamum seeds, a sweetmeat sold in enormous quantities,\r\nand piece goods, shirtings of Japanese and English make, Victoria\r\nlawns, hempen cloth, Turkey-red cottons, Korean flimsy silks, dyes,\r\nchiefly aniline, which are sold in great quantities, together with\r\nsaffron, indigo, and Chinese Prussian blue. On these also are exposed\r\nlong pipes, contraband in the capital, and Japanese cigarettes, coming\r\ninto great favor with young men and boys, with leather courier bags\r\nand lucifer matches from the same country, wooden combs, hairpins with\r\ntinsel heads, and, such is the march of ideas, purses for silver!\r\nPaper, the best of the Korean manufactures, in its finer qualities\r\nproduced in Chul-la Do, is honored by stalls. Every kind is purchasable\r\nin these markets, from the beautiful, translucent, buff, oiled paper,\r\nnearly equal to vellum in appearance and tenacity, used for the floors\r\nof middle- and upper-class houses, and the stout paper for covering\r\nwalls, to the thin, strong film for writing on, and a beautiful fabric,\r\na sort of frothy gauze, for wrapping up delicate fabrics, as well as\r\nthe coarse fibrous material, used for covering heavy packages, and\r\nintermediate grades, applied to every imaginable purpose, such as the\r\nmaking of string, almost all manufactured from the paper mulberry.\r\n\r\nOn mats on the ground are exposed straw mats, straw and string shoes,\r\nflints for use with steel, black buckram dress hats, coarse, narrow\r\ncotton cloth of Korean manufacture, rope muzzles for horses (much\r\nneeded), sweeping whisks, wooden _sabots_, and straw, reed, and\r\nbamboo hats in endless variety. On these also are rough iron goods,\r\nfamily cooking-pots, horseshoes, spade-shoes, door-rings, nails, and\r\ncarpenter’s tools, when of native manufacture, as rough as they can be;\r\nand Korean roots and fruits, tasteless and untempting, great hard pears\r\nmuch like raw parsnips, chestnuts, peanuts, persimmons which had been\r\nsoaked in water to take the acridity out of them, and ginger. There\r\nwere coops of fowls and piles of pheasants, brought down by falcons,\r\ngorgeous birds, selling at six for a _yen_ (about 4d. each), and torn\r\nand hacked pieces of bull beef.\r\n\r\nOne prominent feature of that special market was the native pottery,\r\nboth coarse and brittle ware, clay, with a pale green glaze rudely\r\napplied, small jars and bowls chiefly, and a coarser ware, nearly black\r\nand slightly iridescent, closely resembling iron. This pottery is of\r\nuniversal use among the poor for cooking-pots, water-jars, refuse-jars,\r\nreceptacles for grain and pulse, and pickle-jars 5 feet high, roomy\r\nenough to hold a man, two of which are a bull’s load. At that season\r\nthese jars were in great request, for the peasant world was occupied,\r\nthe men in digging up a great hard white radish weighing from 2 to 4\r\nlbs., and the women in washing its great head of partially blanched\r\nleaves, which, after being laid aside in these jars in brine, form one\r\ngreat article of a Korean peasant’s winter diet.\r\n\r\nUmbrella hats, oiled paper, hat-covers, pounded capsicums, rice, peas,\r\nand beans, bean curd, and other necessaries of Korean existence,\r\nwere there, but business was very dull, and the crowds of people\r\nwere nearly as quiet as the gentle bulls which stood hour after hour\r\namong them. Late in the afternoon, the pedlars packed up their wares\r\nand departed _en route_ for the next centre, and a good deal of hard\r\ndrinking closed the day. I have been thus minute in my description\r\nbecause the peripatetic merchant really represents the fashion of\r\nKorean trade, and the wares which are brought to market are both the\r\nnecessaries and luxuries of Korean existence.\r\n\r\nThe reader will agree with me that, except for a certain amount of\r\ninsight into Korean customs which can only be gained by mixing freely\r\nwith Koreans, the journey from Seoul to Phyöng-yang tends to monotony,\r\nthough at the time Mr. Yi’s brightness, intelligence, sense of fun, and\r\nunvarying good-nature made it very pleasant. Among the few features\r\nof interest on the road are the “Hill Towns,” of which three are\r\nstriking objects, specially one on the hill opposite to the magistracy\r\nof Pyeng-san, the hilltop being surrounded by a battlemented wall two\r\nmiles in circuit, enclosing a tangled thicket containing a few hovels\r\nand the remains of some granaries. Unwalled towns are supposed to\r\npossess such strongholds, with stores of rice and _soy_, as refuges in\r\ntimes of invasion or rebellion, but as they have not been required for\r\nthree centuries, they are now ruinous. The one on a high hill above\r\nSai-nam, where the last Chinese gate occurs, is imposing from its fine\r\ngateway and the extent of ground it encloses.\r\n\r\nTwo days before reaching Phyöng-yang we crossed the highest pass on\r\nthe road, and by a glen wooded with such deciduous trees, shrubs, and\r\ntrailers as ash, elæagnus, euonymus, hornbeam, oak, lime, _Acanthopanax\r\nricinifolia_, actinidia with scarlet berries, clematis, _Ampelopsis\r\nVeitchii_, etc., descended to the valley of the Nam-chhon, a broad but\r\nshallow stream which joins the Tai-döng. On the right bank, where the\r\nstream, crossed by a dilapidated bridge, is 128 yards wide, the town\r\nof Whang Ju is picturesquely situated, 36 _li_ from the sea, at the\r\nbase of two low fir-crowned hills, which terminate in cliffs above the\r\nNam-chhon.\r\n\r\nA battlemented wall 9 _li_ in circumference, with several fine towers\r\nand gateways, encloses the town, and being carried along the verge of\r\nthe cliff and over the downs and ups of the hills, has a very striking\r\nappearance. It was a singularly attractive view. The Korean sky was\r\nat its bluest, and the winding Nam-chhon was seen in glimpses here\r\nand there through the broad fertile plain in reaches as blue, and the\r\nbroken sparkle of its shallow waters flashed in sapphire gleams against\r\nthe gray rock and the gray walls of the city. On the wall, and grouped\r\nin the handsome Water Gate, were a number of Japanese soldiers watching\r\na crowd of Koreans spearing white fish with three-pronged forks from\r\nrafts made of two bundles of reeds with a cask lashed between them, and\r\nfrom the bridge the ruinous state of the walls and towers could not be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nWhang Ju is memorable to me as being the first place I saw which had\r\nsuffered from the ravages of recent war. There the Japanese came upon\r\nthe Chinese, but there was no fighting at that point. Yet whatever\r\nhappened has been enough to reduce a flourishing town with an estimated\r\npopulation of 30,000 souls to one of between 5,000 and 6,000, and to\r\ndestroy whatever prosperity it had.\r\n\r\nI passed through the Water Gate into a deplorable scene of desolation.\r\nThere were heaps of ruins, some blackened by fire, others where the\r\nhouses had apparently collapsed “all of a heap,” with posts and rafters\r\nsticking out of it. There are large areas of nothing but this and\r\nstreets of deserted houses, sadder yet, with doors and windows gone for\r\nthe bivouac fires of the Japanese, and streets where roofless mud walls\r\nalone were standing. In some parts there were houses with windows gone\r\nand torn paper waving from their walls, and then perhaps an inhabited\r\nhouse stood solitary among the deserted or destroyed, emphasizing the\r\ndesolation. Some of the destruction was wrought by the Chinese, some by\r\nthe Japanese, and much resulted from the terrified flight of more than\r\n20,000 of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNorth of Whang Ju are rich plains of productive, stoneless, red\r\nalluvium, extending towards the Tai-döng for nearly 40 miles. On these\r\nthere were villages partly burned and partly depopulated and ruinous,\r\nand tracts of the superb soil had passed out of cultivation owing to\r\nthe flight of the cultivators, and there was a total absence of beasts,\r\nthe splendid bulls of the region having perished under their loads _en\r\nroute_ for Manchuria.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreary journey that day through partially destroyed villages,\r\nrelapsing plains, and slopes denuded of every stick which could be\r\nburned. There were no wayfarers on the roads, no movement of any kind,\r\nand as it grew dusk the _mapu_ were afraid of tigers and robbers,\r\nand we halted for the night at the wretched hamlet of Ko-moun Tari,\r\nwhere I obtained a room with delay and difficulty, partly owing to the\r\nunwillingness of the people to receive a foreigner. They had suffered\r\nenough from foreigners, truly!\r\n\r\nThe concluding day’s march was through a pleasant country, though\r\ndenuded of trees, and the approach to a great city was denoted by\r\nthe number of villages, dæmon shrines, and refreshment booths on the\r\nroad, the increased traffic, and eventually, by a long avenue of stone\r\ntablets, some of them under highly decorated roofs, recording the\r\nvirtues of Phyöng-yang officials for 250 years!\r\n\r\nThe first view of Phyöng-yang delighted me. The city has a magnificent\r\nsituation, taken advantage of with much skill, and at a distance merits\r\nthe epithet “imposing.” It was a glorious afternoon. All the low ranges\r\nwhich girdle the rich plain through which the Tai-döng winds were blue\r\nand violet, melting into a blue haze, the crystal waters of the river\r\nwere bluer still, brown-sailed boats drifted lazily with the stream,\r\nand above it the gray mass of the city rose into a dome of unclouded\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nIt is built on lofty ground rising abruptly from the river, above which\r\na fine wall climbs picturesquely over irregular, but always ascending\r\naltitudes, till it is lost among the pines of a hill which overhangs\r\nthe Tai-döng. The great double-roofed Tai-döng _Mön_ (river gate),\r\ndecorated pavilions on the walls, the massive curled roofs of the\r\nGovernor’s _yamen_, a large Buddhist monastery and temple on a height,\r\nand a fine temple to the God of War, prominent objects from a distance,\r\nprepare one for something quite apart from the ordinary meanness of a\r\nKorean city.\r\n\r\nCrossing the clear flashing waters of the Tai-döng with our ponies in\r\na crowded ferryboat, we found ourselves in the slush of the dark Water\r\nGate, at all hours of the day crowded with water-carriers. There are no\r\nwells in the city, the reason assigned for the deficiency being that\r\nthe walls enclose a boat-shaped area, and that the digging of wells\r\nwould cause the boat to sink! The water is carried almost entirely in\r\nAmerican kerosene tins. I lodged at the house of a broker, and had nice\r\nclean rooms for myself and Im, quite quiet, and with a separate access\r\nfrom the street. It was truly a luxury to have roof, walls, and floor\r\npapered with thick oiled paper much resembling varnished oak, but there\r\nwas no hot floor, and I had to rely for warmth solely on the “fire\r\nbowl.”\r\n\r\nTaking a most diverting boy as my guide, I went outside the city\r\nwall, through some farming country to a Korean house in a very\r\ntumble-to-pieces compound, which he insisted was the dwelling of the\r\nAmerican missionaries; but I only found a Korean family, and there were\r\nno traces of foreign occupation in glass panes let into the paper of\r\nthe windows and doors. Nothing daunted, the boy pulled me through a\r\nsmaller compound, opened a door, and pushed me into what was manifestly\r\nposing as a foreign room, gave me a chair, took one himself, and\r\noffered me a cigarette!\r\n\r\nI had reached the right place. It was a very rough Korean room, about\r\nthe length and width of a N.W. Railway saloon carriage. It had three\r\ncamp-beds, three chairs, a trunk for a table, and a few books and\r\nwriting materials, as well as a few articles of male apparel hanging on\r\nthe mud walls. I waited more than an hour, every attempt at departure\r\nbeing forcibly as well as volubly resisted by the urchin, imagining\r\nthe devotion which could sustain educated men year after year in such\r\nsurroundings, and then they came in hilariously, and we had a most\r\npleasant evening. I shall say more of them later. It was a weird walk\r\nthrough ruins which looked ghostly in the starlight to my curious\r\nquarters in the densest part of the city by the Water Gate, where at\r\nintervals through the night I heard the beat of the sorcerer’s drum and\r\nthe shrieking chant of the _mu-tang_.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that every Korean winter day is splendid,\r\nbut the following day in Phyöng-yang was heavenly. Three Koreans called\r\non me in the morning, very courteous persons, but as Mr. Yi and I had\r\nparted company for a time on reaching the city, the interpretation was\r\nfeeble, and we bowed and smiled, and smiled and bowed with tedious\r\niteration without coming to much mutual understanding, and I was glad\r\nwhen the time came for seeing the city and battlefield under Mr.\r\nMoffett’s guidance.\r\n\r\nOn such an incomparable day everything looked at its very best, but\r\nalso at its very worst, for the brilliant sunshine lit up desolations\r\nsickening to contemplate,--a prosperous city of 80,000 inhabitants\r\nreduced to decay and 15,000--four-fifths of its houses destroyed,\r\nstreets and alleys choked with ruins, hill slopes and vales once\r\nthick with Korean crowded homesteads, covered with gaunt hideous\r\nremains--fragments of broken walls, _kang_ floors, _kang_ chimneys,\r\nindefinite heaps in which roofs and walls lay in unpicturesque\r\nconfusion--and still worse, roofs and walls standing, but doors and\r\nwindows all gone, suggesting the horror of human faces with their eyes\r\nput out. Everywhere there were the same scenes, miles of them, and very\r\nmuch of the desolation was charred and blackened, shapeless, hideous,\r\nhopeless, under the mocking sunlight.\r\n\r\nPhyöng-yang was not taken by assault; there was no actual fighting in\r\nthe city, both the Chinese who fled and the Japanese who occupied posed\r\nas the friends of Korea, and all this wreck and ruin was brought about\r\nnot by enemies, but by those who professed to be fighting to give her\r\nindependence and reform. It had gradually come to be known that the\r\n“_wojen_ (dwarfs) did not kill Koreans,” hence many had returned. Some\r\nof these unfortunate fugitives were picking their way among the heaps,\r\ntrying to find indications which might lead them to the spots where\r\nall they knew of home once existed; and here and there, where a family\r\nfound their walls and roof standing, they put a door and window into\r\none room and lived in it among the ruins of five or six.\r\n\r\nWhen the Japanese entered and found that the larger part of the\r\npopulation had fled, the soldiers tore out the posts and woodwork, and\r\noften used the roofs also for fuel, or lighted fires on house floors,\r\nleaving them burning, when the houses took fire and perished. They\r\nlooted the property left by the fugitives during three weeks after the\r\nbattle, taking even from Mr. Moffett’s house $700 worth, although his\r\nservant made a written protest, the looting being sanctioned by the\r\npresence of officers. Under these circumstances the prosperity of the\r\nmost prosperous city in Korea was destroyed. If such are the results of\r\nwar in the “green tree,” what must they be in the “dry”?\r\n\r\nDuring the subsequent occupation the Japanese troops behaved well, and\r\nall stores obtained in the town and neighborhood were scrupulously paid\r\nfor. Intensely as the people hated them, they admitted that quiet and\r\ngood order had been preserved, and they were very apprehensive that\r\non their withdrawal they would suffer much from the _Kun-ren-tai_,\r\na regiment of Koreans drilled and armed by the Japanese, and these\r\nhad already begun to rob and beat the people, and to defy the civil\r\nauthorities. The main street on my second visit had assumed a bustling\r\nappearance. There was much building up and pulling down, for Japanese\r\ntraders had obtained all the eligible business sites, and were\r\ntransforming the small, dark, low, Korean shops into large, light,\r\nairy, dainty Japanese erections, well stocked with Japanese goods, and\r\nspecially with kerosene lamps of every pattern and price, the Defries\r\nand Hinckes patents being unblushingly infringed.\r\n\r\nPhyöng-yang has a truly beautiful situation on the right or north bank\r\nof the clear, bright Tai-döng, 400 yards wide at the ferry. It occupies\r\nan undulating plateau, and its wall, parallel for two miles and a half,\r\nrises from the river level at the stately Water Gate, and following its\r\nwindings, mounts escarped hills to a height of over 400 feet, turning\r\nwestwards at the crest of the cliff at a sharp angle marked by a\r\npavilion, one of several, and follows the western ridge of the plateau,\r\nwhere it falls steeply down to a fertile rolling plain where the one\r\nreal battle of the late war was fought.\r\n\r\nThis wall, which is in excellent repair, is a loopholed and\r\nbattlemented structure, 20 feet high, pierced by several gates with\r\ngate towers. The city, large as it was, was once much larger, for the\r\nold wall on the west side encloses a far larger area than the modern\r\none. The walk over the grassy undulations within the wall and up to\r\nthe northern pine-clothed summit is entrancing, and the views, even in\r\nwinter, are exquisite--eastwards over a rich plain to the mountains\r\nthrough which the Tai-döng cuts its way, or northwest to one of its\r\naffluents and the great battlefield over which in 1593 the joint forces\r\nof Chinese and Koreans poured to recover Phyöng-yang from the Japanese,\r\nor seawards where the clear bright waters wind through fertile and\r\npopulous country, or the hilly area within the walls where pine-clothed\r\nknolls conceal the devastations, and the Governor’s _yamen_, temples,\r\nand monasteries make a goodly show.\r\n\r\nBetween the city and the Chinese frontier is the largest and richest\r\nplain in Korea; to the east where the violet shadows lay are the\r\nvalleys of the two branches of the Tai-döng, rich in silk, iron, and\r\ncotton, while within 10 miles there are at least five coal-mines,[37]\r\nand for all produce there is easy communication with the sea, 36\r\nmiles distant, for vessels of light draught, by means of the river\r\nwhich flows below the city wall. Timber is rafted down the Tai-döng\r\nin summer. The Peking road, which I had followed thus far, and which\r\nfor centuries has linked Phyöng-yang with the outer world and the\r\ncapital, is another element in the former prosperity of the city. It\r\nwas to photograph for the widow and family of General Tso of Mukden,\r\nthe commander of the best-disciplined and best-equipped cavalry brigade\r\nin the Chinese army, the scenes connected with his last days and death\r\nthat I visited the hill within the wall.\r\n\r\nThe river wall of Phyöng-yang, after 2 miles of an undulating ascent,\r\nturns sharply at a pavilion, outside of which the ground falls\r\nprecipitously, to rise again in a knife-like ridge, the three highest\r\npoints of which are crowned with Chinese forts. From this pavilion the\r\nwall, following the lie of the hill, slopes rapidly down to a very\r\npicturesque and narrow gate, the _Chil-sung Mön_ or Seven Star Gate,\r\nafter which it trends in a northwesterly direction to the _Potong Mön_.\r\n\r\nIn the pine wood, at the highest part of the angle formed by the\r\nwall, General Tso had built three mud forts or camps with walls 10\r\nfeet high. The ground under the trees is dotted with the stone-lined\r\ncooking holes of his men, blackened with the smoke of their last\r\nfires. On the afternoon of the 15th of September, 1894, General Tso\r\nand his force, which mustered 5,000 men when it left Mukden, but must\r\nhave been greatly diminished by desertion and death, made his fatal\r\nsally, passing through the _Chil-sung Mön_ and down the steep zigzag\r\ndescent below it to the plain, meeting his death probably within 300\r\nyards of the gate. The Koreans say that some of his men took up the\r\nbody, but were shot by the Japanese while removing it, and that it was\r\nlost in the slaughter which ensued. A neat obelisk, railed round, was\r\nerected by the Japanese at the supposed spot, bearing on one face the\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n Tso Pao-kuei, commander-in-chief of the Fengtien division. Place of\r\n death.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other----\r\n\r\n Killed while fighting with the Japanese troops at Phyöng-yang.\r\n\r\nA graceful tribute to their ablest foe.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tso’s troops, demoralized by his death, sought refuge\r\neverywhere from the deadly fire of the Japanese, a part flying back\r\nto their forts within the wall, while many, probably blinded and\r\ndesperate, rode along the pine woods which densely cover the broken\r\nground outside, by a path along a wide dry moat, which, three weeks\r\nlater, when Mr. Moffett returned, was piled with the dead bodies of\r\ntheir horses.\r\n\r\nIn the bright moonlight night which followed that day, the Japanese\r\nstormed and took by assault the three Chinese forts on the three\r\nsummits of the ridge, which were the key of the position, enabling them\r\nto throw their shell into the Chinese forts and camps within the wall.\r\nThe beautiful pavilion at the angle of the wall is much shattered, and\r\nbig fragments of shell are embedded in its pillars and richly carved\r\nwoodwork. So desperately hurried was the flight of the vanquished\r\nfrom the last fort which held out, that they were mown down in numbers\r\nas they ran down the steep hill, falling face foremost with their\r\noutstretched hands clutching the earth.\r\n\r\nAll was then lost, and why that doomed army, numbering then perhaps\r\n12,000 men, did not surrender unconditionally, I cannot imagine.\r\nDuring the night, abandoning guns and all war material, the remains of\r\nTso’s brigade and all the infantry and unwounded men passed through\r\nthe deserted and silent city, surged out of the _Potong Mön_, crossed\r\na shallow stream, and emerged upon a plain girdled by low hills, and\r\nintersected by the Peking road, the eastern extremity being occupied by\r\nsome Chinese forts and breastworks. Tso’s cavalry attempted to cross\r\nthe plain and gain the shelter of some low hills, while great numbers\r\nof the infantry took to the Peking road.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of that night will never be accurately known. The battle of\r\nPhyöng-yang was lost and won when the forts were taken. What remained\r\nwas less of a battle than a massacre. Before the morning, this force,\r\nthe flower of the Chinese army as to drill and equipment, had perished,\r\nthose who escaped never reappearing as an organized body. It is\r\nestimated that from 2,000 to 4,000 men were slain, with thousands of\r\nhorses and bulls, the cavalry being literally mown down in hundreds,\r\nand lying, men and horses, heaped “in mounds.” For the Japanese had\r\ngirdled the plain with a ring of fire. Mr. Moffett, who was there three\r\nweeks later, described the scene even then as one of “indescribable\r\nhorror.” Still, there were “mounds” of men and horses stiffened in the\r\ndeath-agony, many having tried vainly to extricate themselves from the\r\npile above them. There were blackened corpses in hundreds lying along\r\nthe Peking road, ditches filled up with bodies of men and animals,\r\nfields sprinkled with them, and rifles, muskets, paper umbrellas, fans,\r\ncoats, hats, swords belts, scabbards, cartridge boxes, sleeves, and\r\neverything that could be cast away in a desperate flight strewing the\r\nground. Numbers of the wounded crept into the deserted houses and\r\ndied there, some of the bodies showing indications of suicide from\r\nagony, and throughout this mass of human relics which lay blackening\r\nand festering in the hot sun, dogs, left behind by their owners, were\r\nholding high carnival. Even in my walks over the battlefield, though\r\nthe grain of another year had ripened upon it, I saw human skulls,\r\nspines with ribs, spines with the pelvis attached, arms and hands,\r\nhats, belts, and scabbards.\r\n\r\nOn a lofty knoll within the wall, the Japanese have erected a fine\r\nmonolith to the memory of the 168 men they lost. They turned the\r\ntemple of the God of War into a hospital, and there, _cela va sans\r\ndire_, their wounded were admirably treated, and in another building\r\nthe Chinese wounded were carefully attended to, though naturally not\r\ntill many of them had died of their wounds on the battlefield. A\r\nghastly retribution followed the neglect to bury the Chinese dead, for\r\ntyphus fever broke out, and its ravages among the Japanese troops may\r\nbe partially estimated by the long lines of graves in the military\r\ncemetery at Chemulpo.\r\n\r\nOutside the wall, in beautifully broken ground, roughly wooded with\r\nthe _Pinus sinensis_, there are still bullets in the branches, many of\r\nwhich were splintered by the iron hail, and the temple at the tomb of\r\nKit-ze, the founder of Korean civilization, must have been the centre\r\nof a deadly fight, for its woodwork is riddled with bullets and damaged\r\nby shell, and on its floor are great dark stains, where, when the fight\r\nwas over, the Japanese wounded lay in pools of blood.\r\n\r\nAt some points, specially at the mud forts by the ferry, the Chinese\r\nmade a very determined stand for ten hours, so that the Japanese troops\r\nwavered, and were only recovered by a gallant dash made by General\r\nOshima. Probably the battle of Phyöng-yang decided the fate of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTAR AT TOMB OF KIT-ZE.]\r\n\r\nMr. Yi found an old book in eighteen vols. for sale, which gives a\r\nhistory of this city. Most Korean matters are lost in obscurity\r\nafter one or two centuries, but the story of Phyöng-yang takes a\r\nbold backward leap and deals fearlessly with the events of centuries\r\nB.C. Kit-ze, whose fine reputed tomb and temples in the wood are\r\nstill regarded with so much reverence that a stone tablet on the road\r\nbelow warns equestrians to dismount in passing so sacred a place, and\r\nwho is said to have emigrated from China in 1122 B.C., and to have\r\nfounded a dynasty which lasted for seven centuries, made Phyöng-yang\r\nhis capital. The temple at his reputed grave, though full of bullets,\r\nis in admirable repair, and its rich decorations have lately been\r\nrenovated, a phenomenon in Korea. Near the city is the standard of land\r\nmeasurement which he introduced, illustrated by ditches and paths cut,\r\nit is said, by himself.\r\n\r\nThe temple to the God of War at the foot of the hill is perhaps the\r\nfinest in Korea. Frescoes, as in the temple to the same god outside the\r\nSouth Gate of Seoul, but on a far grander scale, cover the walls of the\r\ncorridors of one of the courtyards, and the gigantic figures round the\r\naltar, with the sacrificial utensils, hangings, and dresses, are costly\r\nand magnificent. Not far from this is a large and wealthy Buddhist\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] There are five coal-mines at distances varying from 10 to 30\r\n_li_ from Phyöng-yang, those of Yang-tang, 15 _li_ away, producing\r\nthe best quality. With rich iron ore close to the river bank at Kai\r\nChhön, about 36 _li_ off, the elements of prosperity are ready to hand.\r\nThe “coal-owners” have no proper appliances for working the coal,\r\nrelying chiefly on Korean axes, and the “output” is very small. Much\r\nmoney has been spent in trying to get the coal, and in two mines they\r\ncannot proceed any farther with their present tools. The difficulties\r\nof transport are great, and there is no demand for any quantity in\r\nPhyöng-yang itself, but the mineral is there in abundance and of good\r\nquality, and only awaits capital and enterprise. A tax of 5 per cent.\r\nis levied on all coal sent away from the mines. The total export for\r\n1895 was only 652 tons, valued at 4 dols. 20 cts. per ton (9s.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nNORTHWARD HO!\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the northern journey simple preparations only were needed,\r\nconsisting of the purchase of candles and two blankets for Im, in\r\nhaving two pheasants cooked, in dispensing with one pony, leaving us\r\nthe moderate allowance of two baggage animals, and in depositing most\r\nof my money with Mr. Moffett. For there were rumors of robbers on the\r\nroad, and Mr. Yi left his fine clothes and elegant travelling gear also\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nOn a brilliant morning (and when are Korean mornings not brilliant?),\r\npassing through the gate out of which General Tso made his last sally,\r\nand down the steep declivity on which it opens, we travelled for a\r\ntime along the An Ju road, skirting the base of the hill on which the\r\nChinese cavalry made their desperate attack on an intrenched position,\r\nand near the ruins of two intrenched camps, where they fell in\r\nhundreds before the merciless fire of the enemy, and where human bones\r\nwere still lying about. But where Death reaped that ghastly harvest\r\nmagnificent grain crops had recently been secured, and the mellow\r\nsunlight shone on miles of stubble.\r\n\r\nShortly we turned off on a road untouched by the havoc of war, and\r\nsaw no more of the gaunt ruins or charred remains of cottages. In\r\nthat pleasant region ranges of hills with pines on their lower slopes\r\ngirdle valleys of rich stoneless alluvium, producing abundantly cotton,\r\ntobacco, caster oil, wheat, barley, peas, beans, and most especially,\r\nthe red and white millet. Wherever a lateral valley descends upon the\r\none through which the road passes, there is a village of thatched\r\nhouses, pretty enough at a distance and embowered in fruit trees, while\r\nclumps of pines, oaks, elms, and zelkawas denote the burial-places\r\nof its dead, who are the guardians of the only fine timber which is\r\nsuffered to exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN SETTLER’S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe hamlets along the road were cheerfully busy. Millet was stacked in\r\nthe village roadways, leaving only room for one laden animal to pass at\r\na time, and as all the threshing of rice and grain is done with double\r\nflails also in the village street, one actually rides over the threshed\r\nproduct. The red or large millet is nearly as useful to the Korean as\r\nis the bamboo to the Chinese. Its stalks furnish fuel, material for\r\nmats and thick woven fences, and even for houses, for in Phyöng-an Do\r\nthe walls are formed of bundles of millet stalks 8 feet high for the\r\nuprights, across which single stalks are laid, the interstices being\r\nfilled up with mud.\r\n\r\nAfter two days of somewhat monotonous prettiness, beyond Shou-yang-yi\r\nthe country became really beautiful. Some of the larger valleys were\r\nspecially attractive, with abundance of fruit and other deciduous trees\r\nbelow the dark _Pinus sinensis_ on the hill slopes, and there were\r\nplenty of large villages with a general look of prosperity, everything,\r\nclothing included, being much cleaner than usual. There were fine\r\nviews of lofty dog-tooth peaks, and of serrated ranges running east\r\nand west. Nearly every valley has its bright, rapid stream, on which\r\nthe hills descend on one side in abrupt and much caverned limestone\r\ncliffs, the other side being level and fertile. The people there, and\r\ndoubtless everywhere, were taken up entirely with their own concerns,\r\nthe new system of taxation under which a fixed tax in money is levied\r\non the assessed value of the land meeting with their approval. Events\r\nin Seoul had no interest for them. The recent murder of the Queen and\r\nthe imprisonment of the King did not concern them, as there were no\r\neffects of either on their circumstances. After crossing the pass of\r\nMiriok Yang, 816 feet in altitude, in a romantic region, we entered\r\npoorer country with stony soil, often piled with large shingle by the\r\nviolence of streams then perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nBy misdirection, misunderstanding, or complexity or complete\r\nillegibility of the track, we spent much of the day in losing and\r\nretracing our way, scrambling up steep rock-ladders, etc., and when we\r\nreached Kai-pang after dusk we were for some time refused admission\r\nto the inn. The owner said he could not take in any one travelling\r\nwith so many _mapu_ (four) and a soldier. He was terrified. He said\r\nwe should go away in the morning without paying him, and should beat\r\nhim when he asked to be paid! However, the _mapu_ gave me such an\r\nexcellent character that at last he consented, and I had an excellent\r\nroom,--that is, the walls and roof were cream-washed, which gave it a\r\nlook of cleanliness. The timid innkeeper was old, and this brought out\r\nthe fact that when a local magistrate has aged parents, it is customary\r\nfor him to invite to an entertainment everybody in his district between\r\nthe ages of 60 and 100, and it is usual for the old men to take their\r\noldest grandsons with them as testimonies to their old age. As every\r\nguest has to be accompanied fittingly, the company often numbers 200.\r\n\r\nAt Ka-chang and elsewhere the pigsties are much more solid than the\r\nhouses, being regular log cabins with substantial roofs for the\r\nprotection of their inmates from tigers, or in that neighborhood\r\nfrom wolves (?). These pigs, of which every country family in Korea\r\npossesses some, are of an absurdly small black breed, a full-grown\r\nanimal not weighing more than 26 lbs.\r\n\r\nDuring the two days’ journey from the market-place of Sian-chöng, we\r\npassed the magistracies of Cha-san and Un-san, ferrying the Tai-döng\r\njust beyond Cha-san, where it is a fine stream 317 yards broad,\r\nand is said by the ferrymen to be 47 feet deep. All that region is\r\nwell peopled and fertile. There are no resident _yang-bans_ in the\r\nprovince of Phyöng-an. Gold is obtained by a simple process all round\r\nthe country, specially at Keum-san. At Wol-po, a prettily situated\r\nvillage, and elsewhere, a quantity of the coarser descriptions of paper\r\nis made. Paper and tobacco were the goods that were on the move, bound\r\nfor Phyöng-yang.\r\n\r\nPaper is used for a greater variety of purposes in Korea than anywhere\r\nelse, and its toughness and durability render it invaluable. The\r\ncoarser sorts are made from old rags and paper, the finer from the\r\npaper mulberry. Paper is the one article of Korean manufacture which\r\nis exported in any quantity to China, where it is used for some of the\r\nsame purposes.\r\n\r\nOil paper about a sixth of an inch in thickness is pasted on the\r\nfloors instead of carpets or mats. It bears washing, and takes a\r\nhigh polish from dry rubbing. In the Royal Palaces, where two tints\r\nare used carefully, it resembles oak parquet. It is also used for\r\nwalls. A thinner quality is made into the folding, conical hat-covers\r\nwhich every Korean carries in his sleeve, and into waterproof cloaks,\r\ncoats, and baggage covers. A very thick kind of paper made of several\r\nthicknesses beaten together is used for trunks, which are strong enough\r\nto hold heavy articles. Lanterns, tobacco-pouches, and fans are made\r\nof paper, and the Korean wooden latticed windows from the palace to\r\nthe hovel are “glazed” with a thin, white, tough variety, which is\r\ntranslucent. Much prized, however, were my photographic glass plates\r\nwhen cleaned. Many a joyful householder let one into his window, giving\r\nhimself an opportunity of amusement and _espionage_ denied to his\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe day’s journey from Ka-chang to Tok Chhön is through very\r\nattractive scenery with grand mountain views. After crossing a low\r\nbut severe pass, we came down upon a large affluent of the Tai-döng,\r\nwhich for want of a name I designate as the Ko-mop-so, flowing as\r\na full-watered, green stream between lofty cliffs of much caverned\r\nlimestone, fantastically buttressed, and between hills which throw out\r\nrocky spurs, terminating or thinning down into high limestone walls,\r\nresembling those of ruinous fortifications.\r\n\r\nAgain losing the way and our time, a struggle over a rough pass brought\r\nus in view of the Tai-döng, with the characteristics of its mountain\r\ncourse, long rapids with glints of foam and rocks, long reaches of\r\ndeep, still, slow-gliding jagged translucent green water broad and\r\ndeep, making constant abrupt turns, and by its volume suggesting great\r\npowers of destructiveness when it is liberated from its mountain\r\nbarriers. In about a fortnight it would be frozen for the winter.\r\nDiamond-flashing in the fine breeze, below noble cliffs and cobalt\r\nmountains, across which cloud shadows were sailing in indigo, under\r\na vault of cloud-flecked blue, that view was one of those dreams of\r\nbeauty which become a possession for ever.\r\n\r\nFrom that pass the road, if it can be called such, is shut in with the\r\nTai-döng for 30 _li_. In some places there is not room even for the\r\nnarrowest bridle track, and the ponies scramble as they may over the\r\nrough boulders which margin the water, and climb the worn, steep, and\r\nrocky steps, often as high as their own knees, by which the break-neck\r\ntrack is taken over the rocky spurs which descend on the river. It is\r\none of the worst pieces of road I ever encountered, and it was not\r\nwonderful that we did not meet a single traveller, and that there\r\nshould be only about nine a year! We made by our utmost efforts only\r\na short mile an hour, and it took us five hours of this severe work\r\nto reach the wretched hamlet of Huok Kuri, a few hovels dumped down\r\namong heaps of stones and great boulders, some of which served as backs\r\nfor the huts. Poverty-stricken, filthy, squalid, the few inhabitants\r\nsubsisted entirely on red millet! Poor Mr. Yi, who had had a wakeful\r\nnight owing to vermin, said woefully as he dismounted stiffly, “Sleepy,\r\ntired, cold, hungry,”--and there was nothing to eat, and little for\r\nthe ponies either, which may have been the reason that they got up a\r\ndesperate fight, of which they bore the traces for some days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER TAI-DONG.]\r\n\r\nThe track continued shut in by the high mountains which line the\r\nTai-döng till within a mile of Tok Chhön, forcing the ponies to\r\nclimb worn rock-ladders, or to pick a perilous way among sharp-pointed\r\nrocks. I had not thought that Korea could produce anything so emphatic!\r\nAs the road occasionally broke up in face of some apparently impassable\r\nspur, we occasionally got into impassable places, and lost time so\r\nbadly that we were benighted when little more than halfway, but as\r\nthere were no inhabitants we pushed on as a matter of necessity. When\r\nwe got to better going the _mapu_, inspired by the double terror of\r\nrobbers and wild animals, hurried on the ponies, yelling as they drove,\r\nand by the time we reached the Tok Chhön ferry a young moon had risen,\r\nand the mountains in shadow, and the great ferryboat full of horses,\r\nmen in white, and bulls, in relief against the silvered water, made a\r\nbeautiful night scene. I sent on the ponies, and Im to prepare my room,\r\nfully expecting comfort, as at Phyöng-yang, for though I could never\r\nfind anybody who had been at Tok Chhön, it was always spoken of as a\r\nsort of metropolis.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a magistracy, with a remarkably ruinous _yamen_ and a\r\nmarket-place, and is the chief town of a very large region. It is\r\nentered from the river by stepping-stones, through abominable slush,\r\nby a long narrow street, from which we were directed on and on till we\r\ncame to a wide _place_, where the inns of the town are. There in the\r\nmoonlight a great masculine crowd had collected, and in the middle of\r\nit were our _mapu_, with the loads still on their ponies, raging at\r\nlarge, and Im rushing hither and thither like a madman. For they had\r\nbeen refused accommodation, and every door had been barred against them\r\non the ground that I was a foreigner! They said, truly or falsely, that\r\nno foreigner had ever profaned Tok Chhön by his presence, that they\r\nlived in peace, and did not want to be “implicated with a foreigner”\r\n(all foreigners being Japanese). It is most disagreeable to force\r\noneself in even the slightest degree on any one, but I had been twelve\r\nhours in the saddle, it was 8 P.M., there was snow on the ground, and\r\nit was freezing hard! The yard door of one inn was opened a chink for\r\na moment, our men rushed for it, but it was at once barred, and we were\r\nall again left standing in the street, the centre of a crowd which\r\nincreased every moment.\r\n\r\nOur men eventually forced open the door of one inn and got their ponies\r\nin. Then the paper was torn off two doors, and Im was visible against\r\nthe light from within tearing about like a black dæmon. We had then\r\nstood like statues for two hours with our feet in freezing slush, the\r\ngreat crowd preserving a ring round us, staring stolidly, but not\r\nshowing any hostility. At last Im appeared at an open door, waving my\r\nchair, and we got into a high, dark lumber-room; but the crowd was too\r\nquick for us, and came tumbling in behind us till the place was full.\r\nThen the landlord closed the doors, but they were smashed in, and he\r\nhad no better luck when he weakly besought the people to look at him\r\nand not at the stranger, for his entreaty only produced an ebullition\r\nof Korean wit, by no means complimentary. An official from the _yamen_\r\narrived and inquired if I had any complaint to make, but I had none,\r\nand he sat down and took a prolonged stare on his own account, not\r\nmaking any attempt to disperse the crowd.\r\n\r\nSo I sat facing the door, Mr. Yi not far off smoking endless\r\ncigarettes, while Im battled for a room, after one he had secured had\r\nits doors broken down by the crowd. I sat for two hours longer in that\r\ncold, ruinous, miserable place, two front and three back doorways\r\nfilled up with men, the whole male population of Tok Chhön, and, never\r\nmoved a muscle or showed any sign of dissatisfaction! Some sat on the\r\ndoorsill, little men were on the shoulders of big ones, all, inside and\r\noutside, clamoring at once.\r\n\r\nThe situation might have been serious had a European man been with me,\r\nand the experiences of Mr. Campbell of the Consular Service, at Kapsan\r\nmight have been repeated. No Englishman could have kept his temper in\r\nsuch circumstances from 8 P.M. till midnight. He would certainly have\r\nknocked somebody down, and then there would have been a fight. The\r\nill-bred curiosity tires but does not annoy me, though it exceeded all\r\nbounds that night. Fortunately for me, a Korean gentleman is taught\r\nfrom his earliest boyhood that he must never lose his temper, and that\r\nit is a degradation to him to touch an inferior, therefore he must\r\nnever strike a servant or one of the lower orders.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, probably weary of our passivity, and anxious for sleep,\r\nthe inn people consented to give me a room in the back-yard if I\r\ndid not object to one “prepared for sacrifice,” and containing the\r\nancestral tablets. The crowd then filled the back-yard, and attempted\r\nto pour into my room, when Im’s sorely-tried patience gave way for only\r\nthe second time, and he knocked people down right and left. This, and\r\nthe contents of a fire bowl which was upset in the scrimmage, helped to\r\nscatter the crowd, but it was there again at daylight, attempting to\r\nenter every time Im opened the door!\r\n\r\nThe “room prepared for sacrifice” in aspect was a small barn, fearfully\r\ndirty and littered with rubbish, and bundles of rags, rope, and old\r\nshoes were tucked away among the beams and rafters. My camp-bed cut\r\nit exactly in half. In the inner half there was a dusty table, and\r\nbehind it on a black stand a dusty black shrine, at the back of which\r\nwas a four-leaved screen covered with long strips of paper, on which\r\nwere poems in praise of the deceased. In front, dividing the room, and\r\nfalling from the roof to the floor, was a curtain made of two widths\r\nof very dirty foreign calico. Among the poor, instead of setting food\r\nbefore the ancestral shrine twice or thrice daily during the three\r\nyears of mourning for a parent, it is only placed there twice a month.\r\nIn a small white wooden tablet within the shrine popular belief places\r\nthe residence of the third soul of the deceased, as I have mentioned\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI spent two days at Tok Chhön. Properly speaking, the Tai-döng is never\r\nnavigable to that point, owing to many and dangerous rapids, and any\r\nidea of the possibility of this highly picturesque stream becoming “a\r\ngreat commercial highway” may be utterly dismissed. Small boats can\r\nascend it at all seasons to Mou-chin Tai, about 140 _li_ lower down,\r\nand during two summer months, when the water is high, a few with much\r\ndifficulty get up to Tok Chhön, and even a few _li_ farther, and at the\r\nsame season rafts descend from the forests of the Yung-wön district,\r\nfrom 30 to 40 _li_ higher; but owing to severe rapids, shallows, and\r\nsandbanks which shift continually, the river is not really navigable\r\nhigher than Phyöng-yang, and all commercial theories built upon it\r\nare totally chimerical. For 30 _li_ above Tok Chhön the river scenery\r\nis far grander than below, the perpendicular walls of limestone rock\r\nrising from 800 to 1,000 feet, with lofty mountains above them, the\r\npeaks of which, even so early as the end of November, were crested with\r\nnew-fallen snow. I had been assured in Phyöng-yang that boats could be\r\nhired at Tok Chhön, and I had planned to descend the river; but there\r\nare no boats, except a few ferry scows, higher than Mou-chin Tai.\r\n\r\nTok Chhön and its district are lamentably poor. The people said that\r\nthe war had made the necessaries of life dearer, and that they had only\r\nthe same produce to barter or buy with. The reforms which were being\r\ncarried out farther south had not reached that region, and “squeezing”\r\nwas still carried on by the officials. Rice, the ordinary staff of\r\nKorean life, is brought from An Ju, but is used only by the rich,\r\n_i.e._ the officials. The poor live on large and small millet. Potatoes\r\nand wheat are grown, but the soil is poor and stony. A little trade,\r\nchiefly in dried fish and seaweed, is done with Wön-san. A few silk\r\nlenos and gauzes of very poor quality are made, the industry having\r\nbeen introduced by the Chinese. Piece goods are only a few _cash_\r\ndearer than at Phyöng-yang. Those displayed on the market-day were\r\nnearly all Japanese. It was the dullest market I have seen. The pedlars\r\ncarried away nearly as much as they brought. The country is absolutely\r\ndenuded of wood. There are no deciduous trees, and the region owes its\r\nfew groves of dwarfed and distorted pines to the horseshoe graves on\r\nthe hillsides. A _yamen_ which only hangs together from force of habit,\r\na Confucian temple, and a Buddhist temple on a height are the only\r\nnoteworthy buildings.\r\n\r\nThe district magistrate returned while I was in Tok Chhön, and the\r\npeople showed a degree of interest in the event. Runners lined the\r\nriver bank by the ferry, blowing horns, forty men in black gauze coats\r\nover their white ones, and a few singing girls met his chair and ran\r\nwith it to the _yamen_, and a few men looked on apathetically. A more\r\nsqualid retinue could not be imagined.\r\n\r\nSome magistrates had a thousand of such retainers paid by this\r\nimpoverished country. In a single province, there were at that time\r\n44 district mandarins, with an average staff of 400 men each, whose\r\nsole duties were those of police and tax-collecting, their food\r\nalone, at the rate of two dollars per month, costing $392,400 a\r\nyear.[38] This army of 17,600 men, not receiving a “living wage,”\r\n“squeezed” on its own account the peasant, who in Korea has neither\r\nrights nor privileges, except that of being the ultimate sponge. As\r\nan illustration of the methods of proceeding I give the case of a\r\nvillage in a southern province. Telegraph poles were required, and the\r\nProvincial Governor made a requisition of 100 _cash_ on every house.\r\nThe local magistrate increased it to 200, and his runners to 250,\r\nwhich was actually paid by the people, the runners getting 50 _cash_,\r\nthe magistrate 100, and the Governor 100, a portion of which sum was\r\nexpended on the object for which it was levied. An edict abolishing\r\nthis attendance, and reducing the salaries of magistrates, had recently\r\nbeen promulgated. At Tok Chhön, the ruin and decay of official\r\nbuildings, and the filth and squalor of the private dwellings, could go\r\nno farther.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] My authority for this statement is Mr. W. K. Carles, formerly\r\nH.B.M.’s Vice-Consul in Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nOVER THE AN-KIL YUNG PASS\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding the Tai-döng totally impracticable, and being limited as to\r\ntime by the approach of the closing of the river below Phyöng-yang by\r\nice, I regretfully turned southwards, and journeyed Seoul-wards by\r\nanother route, of much interest, which touches here and there the right\r\nbank of the Tai-döng.\r\n\r\nAs I sat amidst the dirt, squalor, rubbish, and odd and endism of\r\nthe inn yard before starting, surrounded by an apathetic, dirty,\r\nvacant-looking, open-mouthed crowd steeped in poverty, I felt Korea to\r\nbe hopeless, helpless, pitiable, piteous, a mere shuttlecock of certain\r\ngreat powers, and that there is no hope for her population of twelve\r\nor fourteen millions, unless it is taken in hand by Russia, under\r\nwhose rule, giving security for the gains of industry as well as light\r\ntaxation, I had seen Koreans in hundreds transformed into energetic,\r\nthriving, peasant farmers in Eastern Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe road, which was said, and truly, to be a very bad one, crosses\r\na small plain, and passing under a roofed gateway between two hills\r\nwhich are scarred by remains of fortifications running east and west,\r\nenters upon really fine scenery, which becomes magnificent in about 30\r\n_li_, at first a fertile mountain-girdled basin, whose rim is spotted\r\nwith large villages, and then a narrowing valley with stony soil, and\r\na sparse population, walled in by savage mountains of emphatic forms,\r\nswinging apart at times, and revealing loftier peaks and ranges then\r\nglittering with new-fallen snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN OFFICERS, HUN-CHUN.]\r\n\r\nIn crossing the plain at a point where the road was good, I was\r\nremarking to Mr. Yi what a pleasant and prosperous journey we had had,\r\nand hoping our good fortune might continue, when there was a sudden\r\nclash and flurry, I was nearly kicked off my pony, and in a moment we\r\nwere in the midst of disaster. One baggage pony was on his back on his\r\nload, pawing the air in the middle of a ploughed field, his _mapu_\r\nhelpless for the time, lamed by a kick above the knee, sobbing, blood\r\nand tears running down his face; the other baggage animal, having\r\ndivested himself of Im, was kicking off the rest of his load; and\r\nIm, who had been thrown from the top of the pack, was sitting on the\r\nroadside, evidently in intense pain--all the work of a moment. Mr. Yi\r\ncalled to me that the soldier had broken his ankle, and it was a great\r\nrelief when he rose and walked towards me. Everything breakable was\r\nbroken except my photographic camera, which I did not look at for two\r\ndays for fear of what I might find!\r\n\r\nLeaving the men to get the loads and ponies together, we walked on\r\nto a hamlet so destitute as not to be able to provide either wood or\r\nwadding for a splint! I picked up a thick faggot, however, which had\r\nbeen dropped from a load, and it was thinned into being usable with\r\na hatchet, the only tool the village possessed, and after padding it\r\nwith a pair of stockings and making a six-yard bandage out of a cotton\r\ngarment, I put up Im’s right arm, which was broken just above the\r\nwrist, in splints, and made a sling out of one of the two towels which\r\nthe rats had left to me. I should have been glad to know Korean enough\r\nto rate the gossiping _mapu_, three men to two horses, who allowed the\r\naccident to happen.\r\n\r\nThe animals always fight if they are left to themselves, and loads and\r\nriders are nowhere. One day Mr. Yi had a bit of a finger taken off in a\r\nfight, and if a strange brute had not kicked my stirrup iron (which was\r\nbent by the blow) instead of myself, I should have had a broken ankle.\r\nWhen we halted at midday the villagers tried hard to induce Im to have\r\nhis arm “needled” to “let out the bad blood,” a most risky surgical\r\nproceeding, which often destroys the usefulness of a limb for life, and\r\nhe was anxious for it, but yielded to persuasion.\r\n\r\nBeing delayed by this accident, it was late when we started to cross\r\nthe pass of An-kil Yung, regarded as “the most dangerous in Korea,”\r\nowing to its liability to sudden fogs and violent storms, 3,346 feet in\r\naltitude, and said to be 30 _li_ long.\r\n\r\nThe infamous path traverses a wild rocky glen with an impetuous torrent\r\nat its bottom, and only a few wretched hamlets, in which the hovels\r\nare indistinguishable from the millet and brushwood stacks, along its\r\nlength of several miles. Poverty, limiting the people to the barest\r\nnecessaries of life, is the lot of the peasant in that region, but I\r\nbelieve that his dirty and squalid habits give an impression of want\r\nwhich does not actually exist. I doubt much whether any Koreans are\r\nunable to provide themselves with two daily meals of millet, with\r\nclothes sufficient for decency in summer and for warmth in winter,\r\nand with fuel (grass, leaves, twigs, and weeds) enough to keep their\r\nmiserable rooms at a temperature of 70° and more by means of the hot\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nTo the west the valley is absolutely closed in by a wall of peaks.\r\nThe bridle-path, a well-engineered road, when it ascends the very\r\nsteep ridge of the watershed in many zigzags, rests for 100 feet, and\r\ndescends the western side by seventy-five turns. Except in Tibet,\r\nI never saw so apparently insurmountable an obstacle, but it does\r\nnot present any real difficulty. The ascent took seventy minutes.\r\nRain fell very heavily, but the superb view to the northeast was\r\nscarcely obscured. At the top, which is only 100 feet wide, there is a\r\ncelebrated shrine to the dæmon of the past. To him all travellers put\r\nup petitions for deliverance from the many malignant spirits who are\r\nwaiting to injure them, and for a safe descent. The shrine contains\r\nmany strips of paper inscribed with the names of those who have made\r\nspecial payments for special prayers, and a few wreaths and posies of\r\nfaded paper flowers. The woman who lives in the one hovel on the pass\r\nmakes a good living by receiving money from travellers, who offer rice\r\ncakes and desire prayers. The worship is nearly all done by proxy, and\r\nthe rice cakes do duty any number of times.\r\n\r\nBesides the shrine and a one-roomed hovel, there are some open sheds\r\nmade of millet stalks to give shelter during storms. The An-kil Yung\r\npass is blocked by snow for three months of the year, but at other\r\ntimes is much used in spite of its great height. Excellent potatoes are\r\ngrown on the mountain slopes at an altitude exceeding 3,000 feet, and\r\nround Tok Chhön they are largely cultivated and enter into the diet of\r\nthe people, never having had the disease.\r\n\r\nDarkness came on prematurely with the heavy rain, and we asked the\r\nshrine-keeper to give us shelter for the night, but she said that to\r\ntake in six men and a foreign woman was impossible, as she had only\r\none room. But it was equally impossible for us to descend the pass in\r\nthe darkness with tired ponies, and after half an hour’s altercation\r\nthe matter was arranged, Im, who retained his wits, securing for me a\r\ndegree of privacy by hanging some heavy mats from a beam, giving me, I\r\nam sure, the lion’s share of the apartment. Really the accommodation\r\nwas not much worse than usual, but though the mercury fell to the\r\nfreezing point, the hot floor kept the inside temperature up to 83°,\r\nand the dread of tigers on the part of my hostess forbade my having\r\neven a chink of the door open!\r\n\r\nThe rain cleared off in time for the last sunset gleam on the distant\r\nmountains, which, when darkness fell on the pass, burned fiery red\r\nagainst a strip of pale green sky, taking on afterwards one by one the\r\nashy look of death as the light died off from their snows. All about\r\nAn-kil Yung the mountains are wooded to their summits with deciduous\r\ntrees, the ubiquitous _Pinus sinensis_ being rare; but to the northward\r\nin the direction of Paik-tu San the character of the scenery changes,\r\nand peaks and precipices of naked rock, and lofty mountain monoliths,\r\nwith snow-crowned ranges beyond, form by far the grandest view that I\r\nsaw in this land of hill and valley.\r\n\r\nThen Im had to be attended to, and though I was very anxious about him,\r\nI could not be blind to the picturesqueness of the scene in the hovel,\r\nMr. Yi sitting in my chair holding the candle, the soldier, with his\r\nface puckered with pain, squatting on the floor with his swollen arm\r\nlying on a writing board on my lap, and no room to move. I failed there\r\nas elsewhere to get a better piece of wood for the splint, which was\r\ntoo short, and I could only get wadding for padding it by taking some\r\nout of Im’s sleeve, and all the time and afterwards I was very anxious\r\nfor fear that I had put the bandage on too tightly or too loosely,\r\nand that my want of experience would give the poor fellow a useless\r\nright arm. He was in severe pain all that night, but he was very\r\nplucky about it, made no fuss, and never allowed me to suffer in the\r\nslightest degree from his accident. Indeed, he was even more attentive\r\nthan before. He said to Mr. Yi, “The foreign woman looked so sorry, and\r\ntouched my arm as if I had been one of her own people, I shall do my\r\nbest”--and so he did. I had indulged in a long perspective of pheasant\r\ncurries, and I must confess that when the prospect faded I felt a\r\nlittle dismal. To a traveller who carries no “foreign food,” it makes a\r\ngreat difference to get a nice, hot, stimulating dish (even though it\r\nis served in the pot it is cooked in) after a ten hours’ cold ride. To\r\nmy surprise, I was never without curry for dinner, and though before\r\nthe accident I had only cold rice for tiffin, after it I was never\r\nwithout something hot.\r\n\r\nThe descent of An-kil Yung is very grand. The road leads into a wide\r\nvalley with a fine stream, one side of which looks as if the mountains\r\nhad dumped down all their available stones upon it, while the other is\r\nrich alluvial soil. Gold washing is carried on to a great extent along\r\nthis stream, which is a tributary of the Tai-döng, and some of the\r\nworkings show more care and method than usual, being pits neatly lined\r\nwith stone in their upper parts. Eighty cents per day is the average\r\nearning of a gold-seeker there. This valley terminates in pretty,\r\nbroken country, with fine mountain views, and picturesque cliffs along\r\nthe river, on which the dark blue gloom of pines was lighted by the\r\nfading scarlet of the maple, and crimson streaks of the _Ampelopsis\r\nVeitchii_ brightened the russet into which the countless trailers which\r\ndraped the rocks had passed. The increased fertility of the soil was\r\ndenoted by the number of villages and hamlets on the road, and foot\r\npassengers in twos and threes gave something of life and movement.\r\nBut it was remarkable that so soon after the harvest, and when the\r\nroads were in their best condition, there were no goods in transit\r\nexcept such local productions as paper and tobacco--no strings of\r\nporters or ponies carrying goods into the interior from Phyöng-yang, no\r\nevidence of trade but that given by the pedlars going the round of the\r\nmarket-places.\r\n\r\nAlong that road and elsewhere near the villages there are tall poles\r\nbranching at the top into a V, which are erected in the belief that\r\nthey will guard the inhabitants from cholera and other pestilences.\r\nOn that day’s journey, at a crossroad, a small log with several holes\r\nlike those of a mouse-trap, one of them plugged doubly with bungs of\r\nwood, was lying on the path, and the _mapu_ were careful to step over\r\nit and lead their ponies over it, though it might easily have been\r\navoided. Into the bunged hole the _mu-tang_ or sorceress by her arts\r\nhad inveigled a dæmon which was causing sickness in a family, and had\r\ncorked him up! It is proper for passers-by to step over the log. At\r\nnightfall it is buried. That afternoon’s ride was through extremely\r\nattractive country--small valley basins of rich stoneless soil, with\r\nbrown hamlets nestling round them in calm, pine-sheltered folds of\r\nhills, which though not high are shapely, and were etherealized into\r\npurple beauty by the sinking sun, which turned the lake-like expanse of\r\nthe Tai-döng at Mon-chin Tai, the beautifully situated halting-place\r\nfor the night, into a sheet of gold.\r\n\r\nWith a splendid climate, an abundant, but not superabundant, rainfall,\r\na fertile soil, a measure of freedom from civil war and robber bands,\r\nthe Koreans ought to be a happy and fairly prosperous people. If\r\n“squeezing,” _yamen_ runners and their exactions, and certain malign\r\npractices of officials can be put down with a strong hand, and the\r\nland tax is fairly levied and collected, and law becomes an agent for\r\nprotection rather than an instrument of injustice, I see no reason\r\nwhy the Korean peasant should not be as happy and industrious as\r\nthe Japanese peasant. But these are great “ifs”! _Security for the\r\ngains of industry_, from whatever quarter it comes, will, I believe,\r\ntransform the limp, apathetic native. Such ameliorations as have been\r\nmade are owed to Japan, but she had not a free hand, and she was too\r\ninexperienced in the rôle which she undertook (and I believe honestly)\r\nto play, to produce a harmonious working scheme of reform. Besides,\r\nthe men through whom any such scheme must be carried out are nearly\r\nuniversally corrupt both by tradition and habit. Reform was jerky and\r\npiecemeal, and Japan irritated the people by meddlesomeness in small\r\nmatters and suggested interferences with national habits, giving the\r\nimpression, which I found prevailing everywhere, that her object is to\r\ndenationalize the Koreans for purposes of her own.\r\n\r\nTravellers are much impressed with the laziness of the Koreans, but\r\nafter seeing their energy and industry in Russian Manchuria, their\r\nthrift, and the abundant and comfortable furnishings of their houses, I\r\ngreatly doubt whether it is to be regarded as a matter of temperament.\r\nEvery man in Korea knows that poverty is his best security, and that\r\nanything he possesses beyond that which provides himself and his\r\nfamily with food and clothing is certain to be taken from him by\r\nvoracious and corrupt officials. It is only when the exactions of\r\nofficials become absolutely intolerable and encroach upon his means of\r\nproviding the necessaries of life that he resorts to the only method of\r\nredress in his power, which has a sort of counterpart in China. This\r\nconsists in driving out, and occasionally in killing, the obnoxious\r\nand intolerable magistrate, or, as in a case which lately gained much\r\nnotoriety, roasting his favorite secretary on a wood pile. The popular\r\noutburst, though under unusual provocation it may culminate in deeds of\r\nregrettable violence, is usually founded on right, and is an effective\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nAmong the modes of squeezing are forced labor, doubling or trebling the\r\namount of a legitimate tax, exacting bribes in cases of litigation,\r\nforced loans, etc. If a man is reported to have saved a little money,\r\nan official asks for the loan of it. If it is granted, the lender\r\nfrequently never sees principal or interest; if it is refused, he\r\nis arrested, thrown into prison on some charge invented for his\r\ndestruction, and beaten until either he or his relations for him\r\nproduce the sum demanded. To such an extent are these demands carried,\r\nthat in Northern Korea, Where the winters are fairly severe, the\r\npeasants, when the harvest has left them with a few thousand _cash_,\r\nput them in a hole in the ground, and pour water into it, the frozen\r\nmass which results then being earthed over, when it is fairly safe both\r\nfrom officials and thieves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSOCIAL POSITION OF WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nMou-chin Tai is a beautifully situated village, and has something\r\nof a look of comfort. Up to that point small boats can come up at\r\nall seasons, but there is almost no trade. The Tai-döng expands into\r\na broad sheet of water, on which the hills descend abruptly. There\r\nis a ferry, and we drove our ponies into the ferryboat and yelled\r\nfor the ferryman. After a time he appeared on the top of the bank,\r\nbut absolutely declined to take us over “for any money.” He would\r\nhave “nothing so do with a foreigner,” he said, and he would not be\r\n“implicated with a Japanese”! So we put ourselves across, and the\r\n_mapu_ were so angry that they threw his poles into the river.\r\n\r\nPassing through very pretty country, and twice crossing the Tai-döng,\r\nwe halted at the town of Sun-chhön, a magistracy with a deplorably\r\nruinous _yamen_. All these official buildings have seen better days.\r\nTheir courts are spacious, and the double-roofed gateways, with their\r\ndrum towers, as well as the central hall of the _yamen_, still retain\r\na certain look of stateliness, though paint, lacquer, and gilding have\r\nlong ago disappeared from the elaborately arranged beams and carved\r\nwood of the roofs, and the fretwork screening the interiors is always\r\nshabby and broken.\r\n\r\nAbout the Sun-chhön _yamen_, and all others, there are crowds of\r\n“runners,” writers, soldiers in coarse ragged uniforms, young men of\r\nthe _yang-ban_ class in spotless white garments, lounging, or walking\r\nwith the swinging gait befitting their position, while the decayed\r\nand forlorn rooms in the courtyard are filled with petty officials,\r\nsmoking long pipes and playing cards. To judge from the crowds of\r\nattendants, the walking hither and thither, the hurrying in various\r\ndirections with manuscripts, and the din of drums and fifes when the\r\ngreat gate is opened and closed, one would think that nothing less than\r\nthe business of an empire was transacted within the ruinous portals.\r\n\r\nSoldiers, writers, _yamen_ runners, and men of the _yang-ban_ and\r\nliterary classes combined with the loafers of the town to compose a\r\ncrowd which by its buzzing and shouting, and tearing off the paper from\r\nmy latticed door, gave me a fatiguing and hideous two hours, a Korean\r\ncrowd being only _un_bearable when it is led by men of the literary\r\nclass, who, as in China, indulge in every sort of vulgar impertinence.\r\nEventually I was smuggled into the women’s apartments, where I was\r\nvictimized in other ways by insatiable curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe women of the lower classes in Korea are ill-bred and unmannerly,\r\nfar removed from the gracefulness of the same class in Japan or the\r\nreticence and kindliness of the Chinese peasant women. Their clothing\r\nis extremely dirty, as if the men had a monopoly of their ceaseless\r\nlaundry work, which everywhere goes on far into the night. Every\r\nbrookside has its laundresses squatting on flat stones, dipping the\r\nsoiled clothes in the water, laying them on flat stones in tightly\r\nrolled bundles and beating them with flat paddles, a previous process\r\nconsisting of steeping them in a ley made of wood ashes. Bleached\r\nunder the brilliant sun and very slightly glazed with rice starch,\r\nafter being beaten for a length of time with short quick taps on a\r\nwooden roller with club-shaped “laundry sticks,” common white cotton\r\nlooks like dull white satin, and has a dazzling whiteness which\r\nalways reminds me of St. Mark’s words concerning the raiment at the\r\nTransfiguration, “so as no fuller on earth can white them.” This\r\nwearing of white clothes, and especially of white wadded clothes in\r\nwinter, entails very severe and incessant labor on the women. The coats\r\nhave to be unpicked and put together again each time that they are\r\nwashed, and though some of the long seams are often joined with paste,\r\nthere is still much sewing to be done.\r\n\r\nBesides this the Korean peasant woman makes all the clothing of the\r\nhousehold, does all the cooking, husks and cleans rice with a heavy\r\npestle and mortar, carries heavy loads to market on her head, draws\r\nwater, in remote districts works in the fields, rises early and takes\r\nrest late, spins and weaves, and as a rule has many children, who are\r\nnot weaned till the age of three.\r\n\r\nThe peasant woman may be said to have no pleasures. She is nothing\r\nbut a drudge, till she can transfer some of the drudgery to her\r\ndaughter-in-law. At thirty she looks fifty, and at forty is frequently\r\ntoothless. Even the love of personal adornment fades out of her life\r\nat a very early age. Beyond the daily routine of life it is probable\r\nthat her thoughts never stray except to the dæmons, who are supposed to\r\npeople earth and air, and whom it is her special duty to propitiate.\r\n\r\nIt is really difficult to form a general estimate of the position of\r\nwomen in Korea. Absolute seclusion is the inflexible rule among the\r\nupper classes. The ladies have their own courtyards and apartments,\r\ntowards which no windows from the men’s apartments must look. No\r\nallusion must be made by a visitor to the females of the household.\r\nInquiries after their health would be a gross breach of etiquette, and\r\npoliteness requires that they should not be supposed to exist. Women do\r\nnot receive any intellectual training, and in every class are regarded\r\nas beings of a very inferior order. Nature having in the estimation\r\nof the Korean man, who holds a sort of dual philosophy, marked woman\r\nas his inferior, the _Youth’s Primer_, _Historical Summaries_, and\r\nthe _Little Learning_ impress this view upon him in the schools, and\r\nas he begins to mix with men this estimate of women receives daily\r\ncorroboration.\r\n\r\nThe seclusion of women was introduced five centuries ago by the present\r\ndynasty, in a time of great social corruption, for the protection of\r\nthe family, and has probably been continued, not, as a Korean frankly\r\ntold Mr. Heber Jones, because men distrust their wives, but because\r\nthey distrust each other, and with good reason, for the immorality of\r\nthe cities and of the upper classes almost exceeds belief. Thus all\r\nyoung women, and all older women except those of the lowest class, are\r\nsecluded within the inner courts of the houses by a custom which has\r\nmore than the force of law. To go out suitably concealed at night, or\r\non occasions when it is necessary to travel or to make a visit, in a\r\nrigidly closed chair, are the only “outings” of a Korean woman of the\r\nmiddle and upper classes, and the low-class woman only goes out for\r\npurposes of work.\r\n\r\nThe murdered Queen told me, in allusion to my own Korean journeys, that\r\nshe knew nothing of Korea, or even of the capital, except on the route\r\nof the _Kur-dong_.\r\n\r\nDaughters have been put to death by their fathers, wives by their\r\nhusbands, and women have even committed suicide, according to Dallet,\r\nwhen strange men, whether by accident or design, have even touched\r\ntheir hands, and quite lately a serving-woman gave as her reason for\r\nremissness in attempting to save her mistress, who perished in a fire,\r\nthat in the confusion a man had touched the lady, making her not worth\r\nsaving!\r\n\r\nThe law may not enter the women’s apartments. A noble hiding himself\r\nin his wife’s rooms cannot be seized for any crime except that of\r\nrebellion. A man wishing to repair his roof must notify his neighbors,\r\nlest by any chance he should see any of their women. After the age of\r\nseven, boys and girls part company, and the girls are rigidly secluded,\r\nseeing none of the male sex except their fathers and brothers until the\r\ndate of marriage, after which they can only see their own and their\r\nhusband’s near male relations. Girl children, even among the very poor,\r\nare so successfully hidden away, that in somewhat extensive Korean\r\njourneys I never saw one girl who looked above the age of six, except\r\nhanging listlessly about in the women’s rooms, and the brightness\r\nwhich girl life contributes to social existence is unknown in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut I am far from saying that the women fret and groan under this\r\nsystem, or crave for the freedom which European women enjoy. Seclusion\r\nis the custom of centuries. Their idea of liberty is peril, and I quite\r\nbelieve that they think that they are closely guarded because they are\r\nvaluable chattels. One intelligent woman, when I pressed her hard to\r\nsay what they thought of our customs in the matter, replied, “We think\r\nthat your husbands don’t care for you very much”!\r\n\r\nConcubinage is a recognized institution, but not a respected one.\r\nThe wife or mother of a man not infrequently selects the concubine,\r\nwho in many cases is looked upon by the wife as a proper appendage\r\nof her husband’s means or position, much as a carriage or a butler\r\nmight be with us. The offspring in these cases are under a serious\r\nsocial stigma, and until lately have been excluded from some desirable\r\npositions. Legally the Korean is a strict monogamist, and even when a\r\nwidower marries again, and there are children by the second marriage,\r\nthose of the first wife retain special rights.\r\n\r\nThere are no native schools for girls, and though women of the upper\r\nclasses learn to read the native script, the number of Korean women\r\nwho can read is estimated at two in a thousand. It appears that a\r\nphilosophy largely imported from China, superstitions regarding\r\ndæmons, the education of men, illiteracy, a minimum of legal rights,\r\nand inexorable custom have combined to give woman as low a status in\r\ncivilized Korea as in any of the barbarous countries in the world.\r\nYet there is no doubt that the Korean woman, in addition to being a\r\nborn _intrigante_, exercises a certain direct influence, especially as\r\nmother and mother-in-law, and in the arrangement of marriages.\r\n\r\nHer rights are few, and depend on custom rather than law. She now\r\npossesses the right of remarriage, and that of remaining unmarried\r\ntill she is sixteen, and she can refuse permission to her husband for\r\nhis concubines to occupy the same house with herself. She is powerless\r\nto divorce her husband, conjugal fidelity, typified by the goose,\r\nthe symbolic figure at a wedding, being a feminine virtue solely.\r\nHer husband may cast her off for seven reasons--incurable disease,\r\ntheft, childlessness, infidelity, jealousy, incompatibility with her\r\nparents-in-law, and a quarrelsome disposition. She may be sent back\r\nto her father’s house for any one of these causes. It is believed,\r\nhowever, that desertion is far more frequent than divorce. By custom\r\nrather than law she has certain recognized rights, as to the control of\r\nchildren, redress in case of damage, etc. Domestic happiness is a thing\r\nshe does not look for. The Korean has a house, but no home. The husband\r\nhas his life apart; common ties of friendship and external interest are\r\nnot known. His pleasure is taken in company with male acquaintances and\r\n_gesang_; and the marriage relationship is briefly summarized in the\r\nremark of a Korean gentleman in conversation with me on the subject,\r\n“We marry our wives, but we love our concubines.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nEXORCISTS AND DANCING WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Cha-san, a magistracy, we rejoined the road from which we had\r\ndiverged on the northward journey. It is a quiet, decayed place, though\r\nin a good agricultural country. As I had been there before, the edge\r\nof curiosity was blunted, and there was no mobbing. The people gave\r\na distressing account of their sufferings from the Chinese soldiers,\r\nwho robbed them unscrupulously, took what they wanted without paying,\r\nand maltreated the women. The Koreans deserted, through fright, the\r\nadjacent ferry village of Ou-Chin-gang, where we previously crossed the\r\nTai-döng, and it was held by 53 Chinese, being an important post. Two\r\nJapanese scouts appeared on the other side of the river, fired, and the\r\nChinese detachment broke and fled! At Cha-san, as elsewhere, the people\r\nexpressed intense hatred of the Japanese, going so far as to say that\r\nthey would not leave one of them alive; but, as in all other places,\r\nthey bore unwilling testimony to the good conduct of the soldiers, and\r\nthe regularity with which the commissariat paid for supplies.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese detachments were being withdrawn from the posts along that\r\nroad, and we passed several well-equipped detachments, always preceded\r\nby bulls loaded with red blankets. The men were dressed in heavy gray\r\nulsters with deep fur-lined collars, and had very thick felt gloves.\r\nThey marched as if on parade, and their officers were remarkable for\r\ntheir smartness. When they halted for dinner, they found everything\r\nready, and had nothing to do but stack their arms and eat! The peasant\r\nwomen went on with their avocations as usual. In that district and in\r\nthe region about Tok Chhön, the women seclude themselves in monstrous\r\nhats like our wicker garden sentry-boxes, but without bottoms. These\r\nextraordinary coverings are 7 feet long, 5 broad, and 3 deep, and\r\nshroud the figure from head to foot. Heavy rain fell during the\r\nnight, and though the following day was beautiful, the road was a\r\ndeep quagmire, so infamously bad that when only two and a half hours\r\nfrom Phyöng-yang we had to stop at the wayside inn of An-chin-Miriok,\r\nwhere I slept in a granary only screened from the stable by a bamboo\r\nmat, and had the benefit of the squealing and vindictive sounds which\r\naccompanied numerous abortive fights. If possible, the next day\r\nexceeded its predecessors in beauty, and though the drawbacks of Korean\r\ntravelling are many, this journey had been so bright and so singularly\r\nprosperous, except for Im’s accident, which, however, brought out\r\nsome of the best points of Korean character, that I was even sorry to\r\nleave the miserable little hostelry and conclude the expedition, and\r\npart with the _mapu_, who throughout had behaved extremely well. The\r\nnext morning, crossing the battlefield once more and passing through\r\nthe desolations which war had wrought, I reached my old, cold, but\r\ncomparatively comfortable quarters at Phyöng-yang, where I remained for\r\nsix days.\r\n\r\nWhile the river remained open, a small Korean steamer of uncertain\r\nhabits, the _Hariong_, plied nominally between Phyöng-yang and\r\nChemulpo, but actually ran from Po-san, a point about 60 _li_ lower\r\ndown the Tai-döng, which above it is too shallow and full of sandbanks\r\nfor vessels of any draught, necessitating the transhipment of all\r\ngoods not brought up by junks of small tonnage. There was, however, no\r\ntelegraph between Po-san and Phyöng-yang, no one knew when the steamer\r\narrived except by cargo coming up the river, and she only remained a\r\nfew hours; so that my visit to Phyöng-yang was agitated by the fear\r\nof losing her, and having to make a long land journey when time was\r\nprecious. There was no Korean post, and the Japanese military post and\r\ntelegraph office absolutely refused to carry messages or letters for\r\ncivilians. Wild rumors, of which there were a goodly crop every hour,\r\nwere the substitute for news.\r\n\r\nA subject of special interest and inquiry at Phyöng-yang was mission\r\nwork as carried on by American missionaries. At Seoul it is far more\r\ndifficult to get into touch with it, as, being older, it has naturally\r\nmore of religious conventionality. But I will take this opportunity of\r\nsaying that longer and more intimate acquaintance only confirmed the\r\nhigh opinion I early formed of the large body of missionaries in Seoul,\r\nof their earnestness and devotion to their work, of the energetic,\r\nhopeful, and patient spirit in which it is carried on, of the harmony\r\nprevailing among the different denominations, and the cordial and\r\nsympathetic feeling towards the Koreans. The interest of many of the\r\nmissionaries in Korean history, folklore, and customs, as evidenced\r\nby the pages of the valuable monthly, the _Korean Repository_, is\r\nalso very admirable, and a traveller in Korea must apply to them for\r\ninformation vainly sought elsewhere.\r\n\r\nChristian missions were unsuccessful in Phyöng-yang. It was a very\r\nrich and very immoral city. More than once it turned out some of\r\nthe missionaries, and rejected Christianity with much hostility.\r\nStrong antagonism prevailed, the city was thronged with _gesang_,\r\ncourtesans, and sorcerers, and was notorious for its wealth and infamy.\r\nThe Methodist Mission was broken up for a time, and in six years\r\nthe Presbyterians only numbered 28 converts. Then came the war, the\r\ndestruction of Phyöng-yang, its desertion by its inhabitants, the ruin\r\nof its trade, the reduction of its population from 60,000 or 70,000 to\r\n15,000, and the flight of the few Christians.\r\n\r\nSince the war there had been a very great change. There had been 28\r\nbaptisms, and some of the most notorious evil livers among the middle\r\nclasses, men shunned by other men for their exceeding wickedness,\r\nwere leading pure and righteous lives. There were 140 catechumens\r\nunder instruction, and subject to a long period of probation before\r\nreceiving baptism, and the temporary church, though enlarged during\r\nmy absence, was so overcrowded that many of the worshippers were\r\ncompelled to remain outside. The offertories were liberal.[39] In the\r\ndilapidated extra-mural premises occupied by the missionaries, thirty\r\nmen were living for twenty-one days, two from each of fifteen villages,\r\nall convinced of the truth of Christianity, and earnestly receiving\r\ninstruction in Christian fact and doctrine. They were studying for\r\nsix hours daily with teachers, and for a far longer time amongst\r\nthemselves, and had meetings for prayer, singing, and informal talk\r\neach evening. I attended three of these, and as Mr. Moffett interpreted\r\nfor me, I was placed in touch with much of what was unusual and\r\ninteresting, and learned more of missions in their earlier stage than\r\nanywhere else.\r\n\r\nBesides the thirty men from the villages, the Christians and\r\ncatechumens from the city crowded the room and doorways. Two\r\nmissionaries sat on the floor at one end of the room with a kerosene\r\nlamp mounted securely on two wooden pillows in front of them--then\r\nthere were a few candles on the floor, centres of closely-packed\r\ngroups. Hymns were howled in many keys to familiar tunes, several\r\nKoreans prayed, bowing their foreheads to the earth in reverence, after\r\nwhich some gave accounts of how the Gospel reached their villages,\r\nchiefly through visits from the few Phyöng-yang Christians, who were\r\n“scattered abroad,” and then two men, who seemed very eloquent as well\r\nas fluent, and riveted the attention of all, gave narratives of two\r\nother men who they believed were possessed with devils, and said the\r\ndevils had been driven out a few months previously by united prayer,\r\nand that the “foul spirits” were adjured in the name of Jesus to come\r\nout, and that the men trembled and turned cold as the devils left them,\r\nnever to return, and that both became Christians, along with many who\r\nsaw them.\r\n\r\nA good many men came from distant villages one afternoon to ask for\r\nChristian teaching, and in the evening one after another got up and\r\ntold how a refugee from Phyöng-yang had come to his village and had\r\ntold them that they were both wicked and foolish to worship dæmons,\r\nand that they were wrongdoers, and that there is a Lord of Heaven who\r\njudges wrongdoing, but that He is as loving as any father, and that\r\nthey did not know what to think, but that in some places twenty and\r\nmore were meeting daily to worship “the Highest,” and that many of the\r\nwomen had buried the dæmon fetishes, and that they wanted some one to\r\ngo and teach them how to worship the true God.\r\n\r\nA young man told how his father, nearly eighty years old, had met Mr.\r\nMoffett by the roadside, and hearing from him “some good things,” had\r\ngone home saying he had heard “good news,” “great news,” and had got\r\n“the Books,” and that he had become a Christian, and lived a good life,\r\nand had called his neighbors together to hear “the news,” and would not\r\nrest till his son had come to be taught in the “good news,” and take\r\nback a teacher. An elderly man, who had made a good living by sorcery,\r\ncame and gave Mr. Moffett the instruments of his trade, saying he “had\r\nserved devils all his life, but now he knew that they were wicked\r\nspirits, and he was serving the true God.”\r\n\r\nOn the same afternoon four requests for Christian teaching came to\r\nthe missionaries, each signed by from fifteen to forty men. At all\r\nthese evening meetings the room was crammed within and without by\r\nmen, reverent and earnest in manner, some of whom had been shunned for\r\ntheir wickedness even in a city “the smoke of which” in her palmy days\r\nwas said “to go up like the smoke of Sodom,” but who, transformed by a\r\npower outside themselves, were then leading exemplary lives. There were\r\ngroups in the dark, groups round the candles on the floor, groups in\r\nthe doorways, and every face was aglow except that of poor, bewildered\r\nIm. One old man, with his forehead in the dust, prayed like a child\r\nthat, as the letter bearing to New York an earnest request for more\r\nteachers was on its way, “the wind and sea might waft it favorably,”\r\nand that when it was read the eyes of the foreigners[40] might be\r\nopened “to see the sore need of people in a land where no one knows\r\nanything, and where all believe in devils, and are dying in the dark.”\r\n\r\nAs I looked upon those lighted faces, wearing an expression strongly\r\ncontrasting with the dull, dazed look of apathy which is characteristic\r\nof the Korean, it was impossible not to recognize that it was the\r\nteaching of the Apostolic doctrines of sin, judgment to come, and\r\ndivine love which had brought about such results, all the more\r\nremarkable because, according to the missionaries, a large majority of\r\nthose who had renounced dæmon worship, and were living in the fear of\r\nthe true God, had been attracted to Christianity in the first instance\r\nby the hope of gain! This, and almost unvarying testimony to the same\r\neffect, confirm me in the opinion that when people talk of “nations\r\ncraving for the Gospel,” “stretching out pleading hands for it,” or\r\n“athirst for God,” or “longing for the living waters,” they are using\r\nwords which in that connection have no meaning. That there are “seekers\r\nafter righteousness” here and there I do not doubt, but I believe that\r\nthe one “craving” of the far East is for money--that “unrest” is only\r\nin the east a synonym for poverty, and that the spiritual instincts\r\nhave yet to be created.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday I went with Dr. Scranton of Seoul to the first regular\r\nservice ever held for women in Phyöng-yang. There were a number\r\npresent, all dæmon-worshippers, some of them attracted by the sight\r\nof a “foreign woman.” It was impossible to have a formal service with\r\npeople who had not the most elementary ideas of God, of prayer, of\r\nmoral evil, and of good. It was not possible to secure their attention.\r\nThey were destitute of religious ideas. An elderly matron, who acted as\r\na sort of spokeswoman said, “They thought perhaps God is a big dæmon,\r\nand He might help them to get back their lost goods.” That service was\r\n“mission work” in its earliest stage.\r\n\r\nOn returning from a service in the afternoon where there were crowds of\r\nbright intelligent-looking worshippers, we came upon one of the most\r\nimportant ceremonies connected with the popular belief in dæmons--the\r\nexorcism of an evil spirit which was supposed to be the cause of a\r\nsevere illness. Never by night or day on my two visits to Phyöng-yang\r\nhad I been out of hearing of the roll of the sorcerer’s drum, with the\r\nloud vibratory clash of cymbals as an intermittent accompaniment. Such\r\nsounds attracted us to the place of exorcism.\r\n\r\nIn a hovel with an open door a man lay very ill. The space in front was\r\nmatted and enclosed by low screens, within which were Korean tables\r\nloaded with rice cakes, boiled rice, stewed chicken, sprouted beans\r\nand other delicacies. In this open space squatted three old women, two\r\nof whom beat large drums, shaped like hour-glasses, while the third\r\nclashed large cymbals. Facing them was the _mu-tang_ or sorceress,\r\ndressed in rose-pink silk, with a buff gauze robe, with its sleeves\r\ntrailing much on the ground, over it. Pieces of paper resembling the\r\nShinto _gohei_ decorated her hair, and a curious cap of buff gauze with\r\nred patches upon it, completed the not inelegant costume. She carried\r\na fan, but it was only used occasionally in one of the dances. She\r\ncarried over her left shoulder a stick, painted with bands of bright\r\ncolors, from which hung a gong which she beat with a similar stick,\r\nexecuting at the same time a slow rhythmic movement accompanied by a\r\nchant. From time to time one of the ancient drummers gathered on one\r\nplate pieces from all the others and scattered them to the four winds\r\nfor the spirits to eat, invoking them, saying, “Do not trouble this\r\nhouse any more, and we will again appease you by offerings.”\r\n\r\nThe _mu-tang_ is, of course, according to the belief of those who\r\nseek her services, possessed by a powerful dæmon, and by means of\r\nher incantations might induce this dæmon to evict the one which was\r\ncausing the sickness by aiding her exorcisms, but where the latter is\r\nparticularly obstinate, she may require larger fees and more offerings\r\nin order that she may use incantations for bringing to her aid a yet\r\nmore powerful dæmon than her own. The exorcism lasted fourteen hours,\r\nuntil four the next morning, when the patient began to recover. A\r\ncrowd, chiefly composed of women and children, stood round the fence,\r\nthe children imbibing devilry from their infancy.\r\n\r\nI was not at a regular inn in Phyöng-yang but at a broker’s house,\r\nwith a yard to myself nominally, but which was by no means private.\r\nIm generally, and not roughly, requested the people to “move on,” but\r\nhe made two exceptions, one being in favor of a madwoman of superior\r\nappearance and apparel who haunted me on my second visit, hanging about\r\nthe open front of my room, and following me to the mission-house and\r\nelsewhere. She said that I was her grandmother and that she must go\r\nwith me everywhere, and, like many mad people, she had an important\r\nand mysterious communication to make which for obvious reasons never\r\nreached me. She was the concubine of a late governor of the city, and\r\nnot having escaped before its capture, went mad from horror at seeing\r\nthe Chinese spitted on the bayonets of the Japanese. She carried a\r\nlong bodkin, and went through distressing pantomimes of running people\r\nthrough with it!\r\n\r\nThe other exception was in favor of _gesang_, upon whose presence Im\r\nlooked quite approvingly, and evidently thought I did.\r\n\r\nPhyöng-yang has always been famous for the beauty and accomplishments\r\nof its _gesang_, singing and dancing girls, resembling in many respects\r\nthe _geishas_ of Japan, but correctly speaking they mostly belong to\r\nthe Government, and are supported by the Korean Treasury. At the time\r\nof my two first sojourns in Seoul, about seventy of them were attached\r\nto the Royal Palace. They were under the control of the same Government\r\ndepartment as that with which the official musicians are connected.\r\n\r\nAs a poor man gifted with many sons, for whom he cannot provide,\r\nsometimes presents one to the government as a eunuch, so he may give\r\na girl to be a _gesang_. The _gesang_ are trained from a very early\r\nage in such accomplishments as other Korean women lack, and which\r\nwill ensure their attractiveness, such as playing on various musical\r\ninstruments, singing, dancing, reading, reciting, writing, and fancy\r\nwork. As their destiny is to make time pass agreeably for men of the\r\nupper classes, this amount of education is essential, though a Korean\r\ndoes not care how blank and undeveloped the mind of his wife is. The\r\n_gesang_ are always elegantly dressed, as they were when they came to\r\nsee me, even through the mud of the Phyöng-yang streets, and as they\r\nhave not known seclusion, their manners with both sexes have a graceful\r\nease. Their dancing, like that of most Oriental countries, consists\r\nchiefly of posturing, and is said by those foreigners who have seen it,\r\nto be perfectly free from impropriety.\r\n\r\nDr. Allen, Secretary to the U.S. Legation at Seoul, in a paper in\r\nthe _Korean Repository_ for 1886, describes among the dances which\r\nspecially interest foreigners at the entertainments at the Royal\r\nPalace one known as the “Lotus Dance.” In this, he writes, “A tub is\r\nbrought in containing a large lotus flower just ready to burst open.\r\nTwo imitation storks then come in, each one being a man very cleverly\r\ndisguised. These birds flap their wings, snap their beaks, and dance\r\nround in admiration of the beautiful bud which they evidently intend\r\nto pluck as soon as they have enjoyed it sufficiently in anticipation.\r\nTheir movements all this time are very graceful, and they come closer\r\nand closer to the flower keeping time to the soft music. At last the\r\nproper time arrives, the flower is plucked, when, as the pink petals\r\nfall back, out steps a little _gesang_ to the evident amazement of the\r\nbirds, and to the intense delight of the younger spectators.”\r\n\r\nThe Sword and Dragon dances are also extremely popular, and on great\r\noccasions the performance is never complete without “Throwing the\r\nBall,” which consists in a series of graceful arm movements before a\r\npainted arch, after which the _gesang_ march in procession before the\r\nKing, and the successful dancers receive presents.\r\n\r\nThough the most beautiful and attractive _gesang_ come from\r\nPhyöng-yang, they are found throughout the country. From the King\r\ndown to the lowest official who can afford the luxury, the presence\r\nof _gesang_ is regarded at every entertainment as indispensable to\r\nthe enjoyment of the guests. They appear at official dinners at the\r\nForeign Office, and at the palace are the chief entertainers, and sing\r\nand dance at the many parties which are given by Koreans at the picnic\r\nresorts near Seoul, and though attached to the prefectures, and various\r\nother departments, may be hired by gentlemen to give fascination to\r\ntheir feasts.\r\n\r\nTheir training and non-secluded position place them, however, outside\r\nof the reputable classes, and though in Japan _geishas_ often become\r\nthe wives of nobles and even of statesmen, no Korean man would dream of\r\nraising a _gesang_ to such a position.\r\n\r\nDr. Allen, who has had special opportunities of becoming acquainted\r\nwith the inner social life of Korea, says that they are the source of\r\nmuch heartburning to the legal but neglected wife, who in no case is\r\nthe wife of her husband’s choice, and that Korean folklore abounds\r\nwith stories of discord arising in families from attachments to\r\n_gesang_, and of ardent and prolonged devotion on the part of young\r\nnoblemen to these girls, who they are prevented from marrying by rigid\r\ncustom. There is a Korean tale called _The Swallow King’s Rewards_ in\r\nwhich a man is visited with the “ten plagues of Korea,” for maltreating\r\na wounded swallow, and in it _gesang_ are represented along with\r\n_mu-tang_ as “among the ten curses of the land.”\r\n\r\nDr. Allen, to whom I owe this fact writes, “Doubtless they are so\r\nconsidered by many a lonely wife, as well as by the fathers who mourn\r\nto see their sons wasting their substance in riotous living, as they\r\ndoubtless did themselves when they were young.”\r\n\r\nThe house in which I had quarters was much resorted to by merchants for\r\nwhom my host transacted brokerage business, and entertainments were\r\nthe order of the day. Mr. Yi was invited to dinner daily, and on the\r\nlast evening entertained all who had invited him. Such meals cost per\r\nhead as much as a dinner at the St. James’s restaurant! Noise seems\r\nessential to these gatherings. The men shout at the top of their voices.\r\n\r\nThere is an enormous amount of visiting and entertaining among men in\r\nthe cities. Some public men keep open house, giving their servants as\r\nmuch as $60 a day for the entertainment of guests. Men who are in easy\r\ncircumstances go continually from one house to another to kill time.\r\nThey never talk politics, it is too dangerous, but retail the latest\r\ngossip of the court or city and the witticisms attributed to great men,\r\nand tell, hear, and invent news. The front rooms of houses in which\r\nthe men live are open freely to all comers. In some circles, though\r\nit is said to a far less extent than formerly, men meet and talk over\r\nwhat we should call “questions of literary criticism,” compare poetic\r\ncompositions, the ability to compose a page of poetry being the grand\r\nresult of Korean education, and discuss the meaning of celebrated\r\nworks--all literature being in Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe common people meet in the streets, the house fronts, and the inns.\r\nThey ask each other endless questions, of a nature that we should think\r\nmost impertinent, regarding each other’s business, work, and money\r\ntransactions, and for the latest news. It is every man’s business to\r\nhear or create all the news he can. What he hears he embellishes by\r\nlies and exaggerations. Korea is the country of wild rumors. What a\r\nKorean knows, or rather hears, he tells. According to Père Dallet, he\r\ndoes not know the meaning of reserve, though he is utterly devoid of\r\nfrankness. Men live in company in each others’ houses. Domestic life is\r\nunknown. The women in the inner rooms receive female visitors, and the\r\ngirl children are present. The boys at a very early age are removed to\r\nthe men’s apartments, where they learn from the conversation they hear\r\nthat every man who respects himself must regard women with contempt.\r\n\r\nWe left Phyöng-yang for Po-san in a very small boat in which six people\r\nand their luggage were uncomfortably packed and cramped. One of the two\r\nboatmen was literally “down with fever,” but with one and the strong\r\nebb-tide we accomplished 20 miles in six hours, and were well pleased\r\nto find the _Hariong_ lying at anchor, as we had not been able to get\r\nany definite information concerning her, and I never believed in her\r\ntill I saw her. The Tai-döng has some historic interest, for up its\r\nbroad waters sailed Ki-ja or Kit-ze with his army of 5,000 men on the\r\nway to found Phyöng-yang and Korean civilization, and down it fled\r\nKi-jun, the last king of the first dynasty from the forces of Wei-man\r\ndescending from the north. Phyöng-yang impressed me as it did Consul\r\nCarles with its natural suitability for commerce, and this Tai-döng,\r\nnavigable up to the city for small junks, is the natural outlet for\r\nbeans and cotton, some of which find their way to Newchwang for\r\nshipment, for the rich iron ore which lies close to the river banks\r\nat Kai Chhön, for the gold of Keum-san only 20 miles off, for the\r\nabounding coal of the immediate neighborhood; for the hides, which are\r\nnow carried on men’s backs to Chemulpo, and for the products of what is\r\nsaid to be a considerable silk industry.\r\n\r\nIn going down the river something is seen of the original size of\r\nPhyöng-yang, for the “earth wall” on solid masonry, built, it is said,\r\nby Kit-ze 3,000 years ago, follows the right bank of the Tai-döng for\r\nabout four miles before it turns away to the north, to terminate at the\r\nfoot of the hill on which is the reputed grave of its builder. This\r\nextends in that direction possibly three miles beyond the present wall.\r\n\r\nThe plain through which the river runs is fertile and well\r\ncultivated, though the shining mud flats at low tide are anything but\r\nprepossessing. Various rivers, enabling boats of light draught to\r\npenetrate the country, most of them rising in the picturesque mountain\r\nranges which descend on the plain, specially on its western side, join\r\nthe Tai-döng.\r\n\r\nMuch had been said of the _Hariong_. I was told I “should be all right\r\nif I could get the _Hariong_,” that “the _Hariong’s_ a most comfortable\r\nlittle boat--she has ten staterooms,” and as we approached her in the\r\nmist, very wet, and stiff from the length of time spent in a cramped\r\nposition, I conjured up visions of comfort and even luxury which were\r\nnot to be realized.\r\n\r\nShe was surrounded by Japanese junks, Japanese soldiers crowded her\r\ngangways, and Japanese officers were directing the loading. We hooked\r\non to the junks and lay in the rain for an hour, nobody taking the\r\nslightest notice of us. Mr. Yi then scrambled on board and there was\r\nanother half-hour’s delay, which took us into the early darkness. He\r\nreappeared, saying there was no cabin and we must go on shore. But\r\nthere was no place to sleep on shore and it was the last steamer,\r\nso I climbed on board and Im hurried in the baggage. It was raining\r\nand blowing, and we were huddled on the wet deck like steerage\r\npassengers, Japanese soldiers and commissariat officers there as\r\nelsewhere in Korea, masters of the situation. Mr. Yi was frantic that\r\nhe, a Government official, and one from whom “the Japanese had to\r\nask a hundred favors a month” should be treated with such indignity!\r\nThe vessel was hired by the Japanese commissariat department to\r\ngo to Nagasaki, calling at Chemulpo, and we were really, though\r\nunintentionally, interlopers!\r\n\r\nThere was truly no room for me, and the arrangement whereby I received\r\nshelter was essentially Japanese. I lived in a minute saloon with the\r\ncommissariat officers, and fed precariously, Im dealing out to me, at\r\nlong intervals, the remains of a curry which he had had the forethought\r\nto bring. There was a Korean purser, but the poor dazed fellow was\r\n“nowhere,” being totally superseded by a brisk young manikin who, in\r\nthe intervals of business, came to me, notebook in hand, that I might\r\nhelp him to enlarge his English vocabulary. The only sign of vitality\r\nthat the limp, displaced purser showed was to exclaim with energy more\r\nthan once, “I hate these Japanese, they’ve taken our own ships.”\r\n\r\nFortunately the sea was quite still, and the weather was dry and fine;\r\neven Yön-yung Pa-da, a disagreeable stretch of ocean off the Whang Hai\r\ncoast, was quiet, the halt of nearly a day off the new treaty port of\r\nChin-nam-po where the mud flats extend far out from the shore, was\r\nnot disagreeable, and we reached the familiar harbor of Chemulpo by a\r\nglorious sunset on the frosty evening of the third day from Po-san, the\r\nvoyage in a small Asiatic transport having turned out better than could\r\nhave been expected.\r\n\r\nITINERARY\r\n\r\n  Seoul to--\r\n                         _Li._\r\n  Ko-yang                 40\r\n  Pa Ju                   40\r\n  O-mok                   40\r\n  Ohur-chuk Kio           30\r\n  Song-do                 10\r\n  O-hung-suk Ju           30\r\n  Kun-ko Kai              30\r\n  Tol Maru                35\r\n  An-shung-pa Pal         25\r\n  Shur-hung               30\r\n  Hung-shou Wan           30\r\n  Pong-san                40\r\n  Whang Ju                40\r\n  Kur-moun Tari           30\r\n  Chi-dol-pa Pal          40\r\n  Phyöng-yang             30\r\n  Mori-ko Kai             30\r\n  Liang-yang Chang        30\r\n  Cha-san                 30\r\n  Shou-yang Yi            40\r\n  Ha-kai Oil              35\r\n  Ka Chang                35\r\n  Huok Kuri               40\r\n  Tok Chhön               30\r\n  Shur-chong              30\r\n  An-kil Yung             20\r\n  Shil-yi                 40\r\n  Mou-chin Tai            25\r\n  Sun Chhön               35\r\n  Cha-san                 30\r\n  Siang-yang Chhön        40\r\n  An-chin Miriok          30\r\n  Phyöng-yang             20\r\n                        ----\r\n  Total land journey    1060\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] The Seoul _Christian News_, a paper recently started, gave its\r\nreaders an account of the Indian famine, with the result that the\r\nChristians in the magistracy of Chang-yang raised among themselves $84\r\nfor the sufferers in a land they had hardly heard of, some of the women\r\nsending their solid silver rings to be turned into _cash_. In Seoul the\r\nnative Presbyterian churches gave $60 to the same fund, of which $20\r\nwere collected by a new congregation organized entirely by Koreans. I\r\nam under the impression that the liberality of the Korean Christians in\r\nproportion to their means far exceeds our own.\r\n\r\n[40] The American Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE HAIR-CROPPING EDICT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1896 opened for Korea in a gloom as profound as that in\r\nwhich the previous year had closed. There were small insurrections in\r\nall quarters, various officials were killed, and some of the rebels\r\nthreatened to march on the capital. Japanese influence declined,\r\nJapanese troops were gradually withdrawn from the posts they had\r\noccupied, the engagements of many of the Japanese advisers and\r\ncontrollers in departments expired and were not renewed, some of the\r\nreforms instituted by Japan during the period of her ascendency died\r\na natural death, there was a distinctly retrograde movement, and\r\ngovernment was disintegrating all over the land.\r\n\r\nThe general agitation in the country and several of the more serious\r\nof the outbreaks had a cause which, while to our thinking it is\r\nludicrous, shows as much as anything else the intense conservatism of\r\n_pung-kok_ or custom which prevails among the Koreans. The cause was\r\nan attack on the “Top Knot” by a Royal Edict on 30th December, 1895!\r\nThis set the country aflame! The Koreans, who had borne on the whole\r\nquietly the ascendency of a hated power, the murder of their Queen, and\r\nthe practical imprisonment of their King, found the attack on their\r\nhair more than they could stand. The topknot is more to a Korean than\r\nthe queue is to a Chinese. The queue to the latter may be a sign of\r\nsubjugation or of loyalty to the Government and that is all, and the\r\nsmall Chinese boy wears it as soon as his hair is long enough to plait.\r\n\r\nTo the Korean the Top Knot means nationality, antiquity (some say\r\nof five centuries, others of 2,000 years), sanctity derived from\r\nantiquity, entrance on manhood socially and legally, even though he\r\nmay be a child in years, the assumption of two names by which in\r\naddition to his family name he is afterwards known, and by which he\r\nis designated on the ancestral tablets, marriage is intimately bound\r\nup with it, as is ancestral worship, and as has been mentioned in the\r\nchapter on marriage, a Korean without a Top Knot, even if in middle\r\nlife, can only be treated as a nameless and irresponsible boy. In a\r\nfew cases a Korean, to escape from this stage of disrespect, scrapes\r\ntogether enough to pay for the Top Knot ceremonies and the _mang-kun_,\r\nhat, and long coat, which are their sequence, though he is too poor\r\nto support a family, but the Top Knot in ninety-nine cases out of a\r\nhundred is only assumed on marriage, without which the wearer has the\r\ntitle of “a half man” bestowed on him!\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies at the “Investiture of the Top Knot” deserve a brief\r\nnotice as among the most important of the singularities of the\r\nnation. When the father and family have decided that a boy shall be\r\n“invested,” which in nearly all cases is on the verge of his marriage,\r\nmen’s clothes, the hat, _mang-kun_, etc., are provided to the limits\r\nof the family purse, and the astrologers are consulted, who choose a\r\npropitious day and hour for the ceremony, as well as the point of the\r\ncompass which the chief actor is to face during its progress. The fees\r\nof the regular astrologer are very high, and in the case of the poor,\r\nthe blind sorcerer is usually called in to decide on these important\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nWhen the auspicious day and hour arrive the family assembles, but as it\r\nis a family matter only, friends are not invited. Luck and prosperity\r\nand a number of sons are essential for the Master of the Ceremonies. If\r\nthe father has been so blessed he acts as such, if not, an old friend\r\nwho has been more lucky acts for him. The candidate for the distinction\r\nand privileges of manhood is placed in the middle of the room, seated\r\non the floor, great care being taken that he faces the point of the\r\ncompass which has been designated, otherwise he would have bad luck\r\nfrom that day forward. With much ceremony and due deliberation the\r\nMaster of the Ceremonies proceeds to unwind the boy’s massive plait,\r\nshaves a circular spot three inches in diameter on the crown of his\r\nhead, brings the whole hair up to this point, and arranges it with\r\nstrings into a firm twist from two and a half to four inches in length,\r\nwhich stands up from the head slightly forwards like a horn. The\r\n_mang-kun_, fillet, or crownless skullcap of horsehair gauze, coming\r\nwell down over the brow, is then tied on, and so tightly as to produce\r\na permanent groove in the skin, and headaches for some time. The hat,\r\nsecured by its strings, is then put on, and the long wide coat, and\r\nthe boy rises up a man.[41] The new man bows to each of his relations\r\nin regular order, beginning with his grandfather, kneeling and placing\r\nhis hands, palms downward, on the floor, and resting his forehead for a\r\nmoment upon them.\r\n\r\nHe then offers sacrifices to his deceased ancestors before the\r\nancestral tablets, lighted candles in high brass candlesticks being\r\nplaced on each side of the bowls of sacrificial food or fruit, and\r\nbowing profoundly, acquaints them with the important fact that he has\r\nassumed the Top Knot. Afterwards he calls on the adult male friends\r\nof his family, who for the first time receive him as an equal, and at\r\nnight there is a feast in his honor in his father’s house, to which all\r\nthe family friends who have attained to the dignity of Top Knots are\r\ninvited.\r\n\r\nThe hat is made of fine “crinoline” so that the Top Knot may be seen\r\nvery plainly through it, and weighs only an ounce and a half. It is\r\na source of ceaseless anxiety to the Korean. If it gets wet it is\r\nruined, so that he seldom ventures to stir abroad without a waterproof\r\ncover for it in his capacious sleeve, and it is so easily broken and\r\ncrushed, that when not in use it must be kept or carried in a wooden\r\nbox, usually much decorated, as obnoxious in transit as a lady’s\r\nbandbox. The keeping on the hat is a mark of respect. Court officials\r\nappear in the sovereign’s presence with their hats on, and the Korean\r\nonly takes it off in the company of his most intimate friends. The\r\n_mang-kun_ is a fixture. The Top Knot is often decorated with a bead of\r\njade, amber, or turquoise, and some of the young swells wear expensive\r\ntortoise-shell combs as its ornaments. There is no other single article\r\nof male equipment that I am aware of which plays so important a part,\r\nor is regarded with such reverence, or is clung to so tenaciously, as\r\nthe Korean Top Knot.\r\n\r\nOn an “institution” so venerated and time-honored, and so bound up with\r\nKorean nationality (for the Korean, though remarkably destitute of true\r\npatriotism, has a strongly national instinct), the decree of the 30th\r\nof December, 1895, practically abolishing the Top Knot, fell like a\r\nthunderbolt. The measure had been advocated before, chiefly by Koreans\r\nwho had been in America, and was known to have Japanese support, and\r\nhad been discussed by the Cabinet, but the change was regarded with\r\nsuch disgust by the nation at large that the Government was afraid\r\nto enforce it. Only a short time before the decree was issued, three\r\nchief officers of the _Kun-ren-tai_ entered the Council Chamber with\r\ndrawn swords, demanding the instantaneous issue of an edict making\r\nit compulsory on every man in Government employment to have his hair\r\ncropped, and the Ministers, terrified for their lives, all yielded but\r\none, and he succeeded for the time in getting the issue of it delayed\r\ntill after the Queen’s funeral. Very shortly afterwards, however, the\r\nKing, practically a prisoner, was compelled to endorse it, and he, the\r\nCrown Prince, the Tai-Won-Kun, and the Cabinet were divested of their\r\nTop Knots, the soldiers and police following suit.\r\n\r\nThe following day the _Official Gazette_ promulgated a decree, endorsed\r\nby the King, announcing that he had cut his hair short, and calling on\r\nall his subjects, officials and common people alike, to follow his\r\nexample and identify themselves with the spirit of progress which had\r\ninduced His Majesty to take this step, and thus place his country on a\r\nfooting of equality with the other nations of the world!\r\n\r\nThe Home Office notifications were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Translation_\r\n\r\n The present cropping of the hair being a measure both advantageous\r\n to the preservation of health and convenient for the transaction of\r\n business, our sacred Lord the King, having in view both administrative\r\n reform and national aggrandizement, has, by taking the lead in his\r\n own person, set us an example. All the subjects of Great Korea should\r\n respectfully conform to His Majesty’s purpose, and the fashion of\r\n their clothing should be as set forth below:--\r\n\r\n 1. During national mourning the hat and clothing should, until the\r\n expiration of the term of mourning, be white in color as before.\r\n\r\n 2. The fillet (_mang-kun_) should be abandoned.\r\n\r\n 3. There is no objection to the adoption of foreign clothing.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) YU-KIL CHUN,\r\n  _Acting Home Minister_.\r\n\r\n 11th moon, 15th day.\r\n\r\n No. 2\r\n\r\n In the Proclamation which His Majesty graciously issued to-day (11th\r\n moon, 15th day) are words, “We, in cutting Our hair, are setting an\r\n example to Our subjects. Do you, the multitude, identify yourselves\r\n with Our design, and cause to be accomplished the great work of\r\n establishing equality with the nations of the earth.”\r\n\r\n At a time of reform such as this, when we humbly peruse so spirited\r\n a proclamation, among all of us subjects of Great Korea who does not\r\n weep for gratitude, and strive his utmost? Earnestly united in heart\r\n and mind, we earnestly expect a humble conformity with His Majesty’s\r\n purposes of reformation.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) YU-KIL CHUN,\r\n  _Acting Home minister_.\r\n\r\n  504th year since the founding of the Dynasty,\r\n  11th moon, 15th day.\r\n\r\nAmong the reasons which rendered the Top Knot decree detestable to the\r\npeople were, that priests and monks, who, instead of being held in\r\nesteem, are regarded generally as a nuisance to be tolerated, wear\r\ntheir hair closely cropped, and the Edict was believed to be an attempt\r\ninstigated by Japan to compel Koreans to look like Japanese, and adopt\r\nJapanese customs. So strong was the popular belief that it was to Japan\r\nthat Korea owed the denationalizing order, that in the many places\r\nwhere there were Top Knot Riots it was evidenced by overt acts of\r\nhostility to the Japanese, frequently resulting in murder.\r\n\r\nThe rural districts were convulsed. Officials even of the highest rank\r\nfound themselves on the horns of a dilemma. If they cut their hair,\r\nthey were driven from their lucrative posts by an infuriated populace,\r\nand in several instances lost their lives, while if they retained the\r\nTop Knot they were dismissed by the Cabinet. In one province, on the\r\narrival from Seoul of a newly-appointed mandarin with cropped hair,\r\nhe was met by a great concourse of people ready for the worst, who\r\ninformed him that they had hitherto been ruled by a Korean man, and\r\nwould not endure a “Monk Magistrate,” on which he prudently retired to\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nAll through the land there were Top Knot complexities and difficulties.\r\nCountrymen, merchants, Christian catechists, and others, who had come\r\nto Seoul on business, and had been shorn, dared not risk their lives\r\nby returning to their homes. Wood and country produce did not come in,\r\nand the price of the necessaries of life rose seriously. Many men who\r\nprized the honor of entering the Palace gates at the New Year feigned\r\nillness, but were sent for and denuded of their hair. The click of the\r\nshears was heard at every gate in Seoul, at the Palace, and at the\r\nofficial residences; even servants were not exempted, and some of the\r\nForeign Representatives were unable to present themselves at the Palace\r\non New Year’s Day, because their chairmen were unwilling to meet the\r\nshears. A father poisoned himself from grief and humiliation because\r\nhis two sons had submitted to the decree. The foundations of social\r\norder were threatened when the Top Knot fell!\r\n\r\nPeople who had had their hair cropped did not dare to venture far\r\nfrom Seoul lest they should be exposed to the violence of the rural\r\npopulation. At Chun-chön, 50 miles from the capital, when the Governor\r\ntried to enforce the ordinance, the people rose _en masse_ and murdered\r\nhim and his whole establishment, afterwards taking possession of the\r\ntown and surrounding country. As policemen with their shears were at\r\nthe Seoul gates to enforce the decree on incomers, and peasants who had\r\nbeen cropped on arriving did not dare to return to their homes, prices\r\nrose so seriously by the middle of January, 1896, that “trouble” in the\r\ncapital was expected, and another order was issued that “country folk\r\nwere to be let alone at that time.”\r\n\r\nThings went from bad to worse, till on the 11th of February, 1896, the\r\nwhole Far East was electrified by a sensational telegram--“The King of\r\nKorea has escaped from his Palace, and is at the Russian Legation.”\r\n\r\nOn that morning the King and Crown Prince in the dim daybreak left\r\nthe Kyeng-pok Palace in closed box chairs, such as are used by the\r\nPalace waiting-women, passed through the gates without being suspected\r\nby the sentries, and reached the Russian Legation, the King pale and\r\ntrembling as he entered the spacious suite of apartments which for more\r\nthan a year afterwards offered him a secure asylum. The Palace ladies\r\nwho arranged the escape had kept their counsel well, and had caused a\r\nnumber of chairs to go in and out of the gates early and late during\r\nthe previous week, so that the flight failed to attract any attention.\r\nAs the King does much of his work at night and retires to rest in\r\nthe early morning, the ever vigilant Cabinet, his jailers, supposed\r\nhim to be asleep, and it was not until several hours later that his\r\nwhereabouts became known, when the organization of a new Cabinet was\r\nprogressing, and Korean dignitaries began to be summoned into the Royal\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThe King, on gaining security, at once reassumed his long-lost\r\nprerogatives, which have never since been curbed in the slightest\r\ndegree. The irredeemable Orientalism of the two following proclamations\r\nwhich were posted over the city within a few hours of his escape\r\nwarrants their insertion in full:--\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n_Translation_\r\n\r\n Alas! alas! on account of Our unworthiness and mal-administration the\r\n wicked advanced and the wise retired. Of the last ten years, none\r\n has passed without troubles. Some were brought on by those We had\r\n trusted as the members of the body, while others, by those of Our own\r\n bone and flesh. Our dynasty of five centuries has thereby been often\r\n endangered, and millions of Our subjects have thereby been gradually\r\n impoverished. These facts make Us blush and sweat for shame. But these\r\n troubles have been brought about through Our partiality and self-will,\r\n giving rise to rascality and blunders leading to calamities. All have\r\n been Our own fault from the first to the last.\r\n\r\n Fortunately, through loyal and faithful subjects rising up in\r\n righteous efforts to remove the wicked, there is a hope that the\r\n tribulations experienced may invigorate the State, and that calm may\r\n return after the storm. This accords with the principle that human\r\n nature will have freedom after a long pressure, and that the ways of\r\n Heaven bring success after reverses. We shall endeavor to be merciful.\r\n No pardon, however, shall be extended to the principal traitors\r\n concerned in the affairs of July, 1894, and of October, 1895. Capital\r\n punishment should be their due, thus venting the indignation of men\r\n and gods alike. But to all the rest, officials or soldiers, citizens\r\n or coolies, a general amnesty, free and full, is granted, irrespective\r\n of the degree of their offences. Reform your hearts; ease your minds;\r\n go about your business, public or private, as in times past.\r\n\r\n As to the cutting of the Top Knots--what can We say? Is it such an\r\n urgent matter? The traitors, by using force and coercion, brought\r\n about the affair. That this measure was taken against Our will is, no\r\n doubt, well known to all. Nor is it Our wish that the conservative\r\n subjects throughout the country, moved to righteous indignation,\r\n should rise up, as they have, circulating false rumors, causing death\r\n and injury to one another, until the regular troops had to be sent\r\n to suppress the disturbances by force. The traitors indulged their\r\n poisonous nature in everything. Fingers and hairs would fail to count\r\n their crimes. The soldiers are Our children. So are the insurgents.\r\n Cut any of the ten fingers, and one would cause as much pain as\r\n another. Fighting long continued would pour out blood and heap up\r\n corpses, hindering communications and traffic. Alas! if this continues\r\n the people will all die. The mere contemplation of such consequences\r\n provokes Our tears and chills Our heart. We desire that as soon as\r\n orders arrive the soldiers should return to Seoul and the insurgents\r\n to their respective places and occupations.\r\n\r\n As to the cutting of Top Knots, no one shall be forced as to dress and\r\n hats. Do as you please. The evils now afflicting the people shall be\r\n duly attended to by the Government. This is Our own word of honor. Let\r\n all understand.\r\n\r\n  By order of His Majesty,\r\n  (Signed) PAK-CHUNG YANG,\r\n  _Acting Home and Prime Minister_.\r\n\r\n  11th day, 2nd moon, 1st year of Kon-yang.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROCLAMATION TO THE SOLDIERS\r\n\r\n On account of the unhappy fate of Our country, traitors have made\r\n trouble every year. Now We have a document informing us of another\r\n conspiracy. We have therefore come to the Russian Legation. The\r\n Representatives of different countries have all assembled.\r\n\r\n Soldiers! come and protect us. You are Our children. The troubles\r\n of the past were due to the crimes of chief traitors. You are all\r\n pardoned, and shall not be held answerable. Do your duty and be at\r\n ease. When you meet the chief traitors, viz. Cho-hui Yen, Wu-pom Sun,\r\n Yi-tu Hwong, Yi-pom Nai, Yi-chin Ho, and Kon-yong Chin, cut off their\r\n heads at once, and bring them.\r\n\r\n You (soldiers) attend us at the Russian Legation.\r\n\r\n 11th day, 2nd moon, 1st year of Kon-yang.\r\n\r\n  Royal Sign.\r\n\r\nFollowing on this, on the same day, and while thousands of people were\r\nreading the repeal of the hair-cropping order, those of the Cabinet who\r\ncould be caught were arrested and beheaded in the street--the Prime\r\nMinister, who had kept his place in several Cabinets, and the Minister\r\nof Agriculture and Commerce. The mob, infuriated, and regarding the\r\nPremier as the author of the downfall of the Top Knot, gave itself\r\nup to unmitigated savagery, insulting and mutilating the dead bodies\r\nin a manner absolutely fiendish. Another of the Cabinet was rescued\r\nby Japanese soldiers, and the other traitorous members ran away. A\r\nCabinet, chiefly new, was installed, prison doors were opened, and the\r\ninmates, guilty and innocent alike, were released, strict orders were\r\ngiven by the King that the Japanese were to be protected, one having\r\nalready fallen a victim to the fury of the populace, and before night\r\nfell on Seoul much of the work of the previous six months had been\r\nundone, and the Top Knot had triumphed.[42]\r\n\r\nHow the Korean King, freed from the strong influence of the Queen and\r\nthe brutal control of his mutinous officers, used his freedom need\r\nnot be told here. It was supposed just after his escape that he would\r\nbecome “a mere tool in the hands of the Russian Minister,” but so far\r\nwas this from being the case, that before a year had passed it was\r\ngreatly desired by many that Mr. Waeber would influence him against\r\nthe bad in statecraft and in favor of the good, and the cause of his\r\ndetermination not to bias the King in any way remains a mystery to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe roads which led to the Russian Legation were guarded by Korean\r\nsoldiers, but eighty Russian marines were quartered in the compound\r\nand held the gates, while a small piece of artillery was very much _en\r\névidence_ on the terrace below the King’s windows! He had an abundant\r\n_entourage_. For some months the Cabinet occupied the ballroom, and on\r\nthe terrace and round the King’s apartments there were always numbers\r\nof Court officials and servants of all grades, eunuchs, Palace women,\r\netc., while the favorites, the ladies Om and Pak, who assisted in his\r\nescape, were constantly to be seen in his vicinity.\r\n\r\nRevelling in the cheerfulness and security of his surroundings, the\r\nKing shortly built a Palace (to which he removed in the spring of\r\n1897), surrounding the tablet-house of the Queen, and actually in\r\nChong-dong, the European quarter, its grounds adjoining those of the\r\nEnglish and U.S. Legations. To the security of this tablet-house the\r\nremains of the Queen, supposed to consist only of the bones of one\r\nfinger, were removed on a lucky day chosen by the astrologers with much\r\npomp.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion a guard of eighty Russian soldiers occupied a position\r\nclose to the Royal tent, not far from one in which the Foreign\r\nRepresentatives, with the noteworthy exception of the Japanese Envoy,\r\nwere assembled. Rolled-up scroll portraits of the five immediate\r\nancestors of the King, each enclosed in a large oblong palanquin of\r\ngilded fretwork, and preceded by a crowd of officials in old Court\r\ncostume, filed past the Royal tent, where the King did obeisance, and\r\nthe Russian Guard presented arms. This was only the first part of the\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nLater a colossal catafalque, containing the fragmentary remains of the\r\nmurdered Queen, was dragged through the streets from the Kyeng-pok\r\nPalace by 700 men in sackcloth, preceded and followed by a crowd of\r\nCourt functionaries, also in mourning, and escorted by Korean drilled\r\ntroops. The King and Crown Prince received the procession at the gate\r\nof the new Kyeng-wun Palace, and the hearse, after being hauled up to\r\nthe end of a long platform outside the Spirit Shrine, was tracked by\r\nropes (for no hand might touch it) to the interior, where it rested\r\nunder a canopy of white silk, and for more than a year received the\r\ncustomary rites and sacrifices from the bereaved husband and son. The\r\nlarge crowd in the streets was orderly and silent. The ceremony was\r\nremarkable both for the revival of picturesque detail and of practices\r\nwhich it was supposed had become obsolete, such as the supporting of\r\nofficials on their ponies by retainers, or when on foot by having their\r\narms propped up.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1896, Mr. J. M’Leavy Brown, LL.D., Chief Commissioner of\r\nCustoms, received by Royal decree the absolute control of all payments\r\nout of the Treasury, and having gained considerable insight into the\r\ncomplexities of financial corruption, addressed himself in earnest to\r\nthe reform of abuses, and with most beneficial results.\r\n\r\nIn September a Council of State of fourteen members was substituted for\r\nthe Cabinet of Ministers organized under Japanese auspices, a change\r\nwhich was to some extent a return to old methods.\r\n\r\nMany of the attempts made by the Japanese during their ascendency to\r\nreform abuses were allowed to lapse. The country was unsettled, a\r\n“Righteous Army” having replaced the Tong-haks. The Minister of the\r\nHousehold and other Royal favorites resumed the practice of selling\r\nprovincial and other posts in a most unblushing manner after the slight\r\nchecks which had been imposed on this most deleterious custom, and\r\nthe sovereign himself, whose Civil List is ample, appropriated public\r\nmoneys for his own purposes, while, finding himself personally safe,\r\nand free from Japanese or other control, he reverted in many ways to\r\nthe traditions of his dynasty, and in spite of attempted checks upon\r\nhis authority, reigned as an absolute monarch--his edicts law, his\r\nwill absolute. Meanwhile Japan was gradually effacing herself or being\r\neffaced, and whatever influence she lost in Korea, Russia gained, but\r\nthe advantages of the change were not obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] In chapter ix. p. 114, there is a short notice of what is involved\r\nin the transformation.\r\n\r\n[42] When I last saw the King this national adornment seemed to have\r\nresumed its former proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE REORGANIZED KOREAN GOVERNMENT[43]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old system of Government in Korea, which, with but a few\r\nalterations and additions, prevailed from the founding of the present\r\ndynasty until the second half of 1894, was modelled on that of the\r\nMing Emperors of China. The King was absolute as well in practice as\r\nin theory, but to assist him in governing there was a _Eui-chyeng\r\nPu_, commonly translated Cabinet, composed of a so-called Premier,\r\nand Senior and Junior Ministers of State, under whom were Senior and\r\nJunior Chief Secretaries, and Senior and Junior Assistant Secretaries,\r\nwith certain minor functionaries, the Government being conducted\r\nthrough Boards as in China, viz. Civil Office, Revenue, Ceremonies,\r\nWar, Punishment, and Works, to which were added after the opening\r\nof the country to foreigners, Foreign and Home Offices. During the\r\npresent reign the Home Office, under the Presidency of a powerful and\r\nambitious cousin of the Queen, Min Yeng-chyun, began to draw to itself\r\nall administrative power, while Her Majesty’s and his relations, who\r\noccupied the chief positions throughout the country, fleeced the people\r\nwithout restraint. Of the remaining offices which were seated in the\r\nMetropolis the chief were the Correctional Tribunal, an office of the\r\nfirst rank which took cognizance of the offences of officials, and the\r\nPrefecture of Seoul which had charge of all municipal matters.\r\n\r\nKorea was divided into eight Provinces, each under the control of\r\na Governor, aided by a Civil and Military Secretary. Magistrates\r\nof different grades according to the size of the magistracies were\r\nappointed under him, five fortress cities, however, being independent\r\nof provincial jurisdiction. The principal tax, the land-tax, was paid\r\nin kind, and the local governments had very considerable control over\r\nthe local revenues. There were provincial military and naval forces\r\nwith large staffs of officers, and Boards, Offices, and Departments\r\ninnumeral under Government, each with its legion of supernumeraries.\r\n\r\nThe country was eaten up by officialism. It is not only that abuses\r\nwithout number prevailed, but the whole system of Government was an\r\nabuse, a sea of corruption without a bottom or a shore, an engine of\r\nrobbery, crushing the life out of all industry. Offices and justice\r\nwere bought and sold like other commodities, and Government was fast\r\ndecaying, the one principle which survived being its right to prey on\r\nthe governed.\r\n\r\nThe new order of things, called by the Japanese the “Reformation,”\r\ndates from the forcible occupation of the Kyeng-pok Palace by Japanese\r\ntroops on the 23rd of July, 1894. The constitutional changes which have\r\nsubsequently been promulgated (though not always carried out) were\r\ninitiated by the Japanese Minister in Seoul, and reduced to detail by\r\nthe Japanese “advisers” who shortly arrived; and Japan is entitled to\r\nthe credit of having attempted to cope with and remedy the manifold\r\nabuses of the Korean system, and of having bequeathed to the country\r\nthe lines on which reforms are now being carried out. It was natural,\r\nand is certainly not blameworthy, that the Japanese had in view the\r\nassimilation of Korean polity to that of Japan.\r\n\r\nTo bring about the desired reorganization, Mr. Otori, at that time\r\nthe Japanese Minister, induced the King to create an Assembly, which,\r\nwhatever its ultimate destiny, was to form meanwhile a Department for\r\n“the discussion of all matters grave and trivial within the realm.”\r\nThe Prime Minister was its President, and the number of its members\r\nwas limited to twenty Councillors. A noteworthy feature in connection\r\nwith it was that it invited suggestions from outsiders in the form of\r\nwritten memoranda.\r\n\r\nIt met for the first time on the 30th of July, 1894, and for the last\r\non the 29th of October of the same year. It was found impossible,\r\neither by payment or Royal orders, to secure a quorum; and after the\r\nVice-Minister of Justice, one of the few Councillors who took an active\r\npart in the proceedings, was murdered two days after the last meeting,\r\nas was believed, by an agent of the reactionary party, it practically\r\nexpired, and was dissolved by Royal Decree on the 17th of December,\r\n1894, and a reconstituted Privy Council took its place. Those of its\r\nResolutions, however, which had received the Royal assent became law,\r\nand unless repealed or superseded are still binding.\r\n\r\nThese Resolutions appeared in the _Government Gazette_, an institution\r\nof very old standing, imitated, like most things else, from China. This\r\nwas prepared by the Court of Transmission, a Palace Department, the\r\nsenior members of which formed the channel of communication between\r\nthe King and the official body at large, and who, while other high\r\nofficials could only reach the throne by means of personal memorials\r\nor written memoranda, were privileged to address the King _viva voce_,\r\nand through whom as a rule his commands were issued. Each day this\r\nDepartment collected the various memoranda and memorials, the Royal\r\nreplies and the lists of appointments, copies of which when edited\r\nby it formed the _Gazette_, which was furnished in MS. to officials\r\nthroughout the kingdom. The Royal Edicts when published in this paper\r\nbecame law in Korea.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1894, Mr. Otori made the useful innovation of publishing the\r\n_Gazette_ in clear type, and in the following January it appeared in\r\na mixture of Chinese hieroglyphs and _En-mun_, the “vulgar script” of\r\nKorea, and became intelligible to the common people. No special change\r\nwas made at that time, except that the Resolutions of the Deliberative\r\nAssembly were included in it. Later changes have assimilated it farther\r\nto the Government _Gazette_ of Japan, and it has gained rather than\r\nlost in importance. Gradually a diminution of the power of the Court\r\nof Transmission began to show itself. Its name was changed to the\r\nReceiving Office, and members of the Cabinet and the Correctional\r\nTribunal began to enjoy direct access to the King. In April, 1895, a\r\nfarther change in a Japanese direction, and one of great significance\r\nin Korean estimation, was made, the date of the _Gazette_ being given\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n“No. 1.--504th year of the Dynasty, 4th moon, 1st day, Wood-day.”[44]\r\n\r\nTwo months later farther changes in the official _Gazette_ were\r\nannounced, and the programme then put forward has been adhered to,\r\npaving the way for many of the changes which have followed. It is\r\ndifficult to make the importance of the _Gazette_ intelligible, except\r\nto foreigners who have resided in China and Korea. The reason for\r\ndwelling so long upon it is, that for several centuries the publication\r\nin it of Royal Edicts has given them the force of law and the currency\r\nof Acts of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the pages which follow a brief summary is given of the outlines of\r\nthe scheme for the reorganization of the Korean Government, which\r\nwas prepared for the most part by the Japanese advisers, honorary and\r\nsalaried, who have been engaged on the task since 1894, and which has\r\nbeen accepted by the King.\r\n\r\nThe first change raised the status of the King and the Royal Family\r\nto that of the Imperial Family of China. After this, it was enacted,\r\nfollowing on the King’s Oath of January, 1895, that the Queen and\r\nRoyal Family were no longer to interfere in the affairs of State, and\r\nthat His Majesty would govern by the advice of a Cabinet, and sign all\r\nordinances to which his assent is given. The Cabinet, which was, at\r\nleast nominally, located in the Palace, had two aspects--a Council of\r\nState, and a State Department, presided over by the Premier.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--AS THE COUNCIL OF STATE\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cabinet or Ministers of State were the Premier, the\r\nHome Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Finance Minister,\r\nthe War Minister, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Justice,\r\nand the Minister of Agriculture, Trade and Industry. A Foreign Adviser\r\nis supposed to be attached to each of the seven Departments.\r\n\r\nMinisters in Council were empowered to consider--the framing of laws\r\nand ordinances; estimates and balance-sheets of yearly revenue and\r\nexpenditure; public debt, domestic and foreign; international treaties\r\nand important conventions; disputes as to the respective jurisdictions\r\nof Ministers; such personal memorials as His Majesty might send\r\ndown to them; supplies not included in the estimates; appointments\r\nand promotions of high officials, other than legal or military;\r\nthe retention, abolition, or alteration of old customs; abolition\r\nor institution of offices, and, without reference to their special\r\nrelations to any one Ministry, their reconstruction or amendment;\r\nthe imposition of new taxes or their alteration; and the control and\r\nmanagement of public lands, forests, buildings, and vessels. All\r\nordinances after being signed and sealed by the King required the\r\ncountersign of the Premier.\r\n\r\nThe second function of the Cabinet as a Department of State it is\r\nneedless to go into.\r\n\r\nA Privy Council was established at the close of 1894 to take the place\r\nof the Deliberative Assembly which had collapsed, and is now empowered,\r\nwhen consulted by the Cabinet, to inquire into and pass resolutions\r\nconcerning:--\r\n\r\nI. The framing of laws and ordinances.\r\n\r\nII. Questions which may from time to time be referred to it by the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Council consists of a President, Vice-President, not more than\r\nfifty Councillors, two Secretaries, and four Clerks. The Councillors\r\nare appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Premier, and\r\nmust either be men of rank, or those who have done good service to\r\nthe State, or are experts in politics, law, or economics. The Privy\r\nCouncil is prohibited from having any correspondence on public matters\r\nwith private individuals, or with any officials but Ministers and\r\nVice-Ministers. The President presides. Two-thirds of the members must\r\nbe present to form a quorum. Votes are given openly, resolutions are\r\ncarried by a majority, and any Councillor dissenting from a resolution\r\nso carried has a right to have his reasons recorded in the minutes.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1896 some important changes were made. A Decree\r\nof the 24th of September condemned in strong language the action\r\nof “disorderly rebels, who some three years ago revolutionized the\r\nConstitution,” and changed the name of the King’s advising body.\r\nThe decree ordained that the old name, translated Council of State,\r\n“should be restored, and declared that new regulations would be issued,\r\nwhich, while adhering to ancient principles, would confirm such of the\r\nenactments of the previous three years as in the King’s judgment were\r\nfor the public good.” The Council of State was organized by the first\r\nordinance of a new series, and the preamble, as well as one at least\r\nof the sections, marks a distinctly retrograde movement and a reversion\r\nto the absolutism renounced in the King’s Oath of January, 1895.[45]\r\nIt is distinctly stated that “any motion debated at the Council may\r\nreceive His Majesty’s assent, without regard to the number of votes in\r\nits favor, by virtue of the Royal prerogative; or should the debates\r\non any motion not accord with His Majesty’s views, the Council may\r\nbe commanded to reconsider the matter.” Resolutions which the King\r\napproves, on publication in the _Gazette_, become law.\r\n\r\nThus perished the checks which the Japanese sought to impose on the\r\nabsolutism of the Crown, and at the present time the Royal will (or\r\nwhim) can and does override all else.\r\n\r\nThis _Eui-chyeng Pu_ or Council, like the _Nai Kak_, its predecessor,\r\nis both a Council of State, and a State Department presided over by the\r\nChancellor. The members of the Council of State are the Chancellor, the\r\nHome Minister, who is, _ex officio_, Vice-Chancellor, the Ministers\r\nof Foreign Affairs, Finance, War, Justice, and Agriculture, five\r\nCouncillors, and the Chief Secretary. As a State Department under the\r\nChancellor, the staff consists of the “Director of the General Bureau,”\r\nthe Chancellor’s Private Secretary, the Secretary, and eight clerks.\r\n\r\nThe Council of State, as now constituted, is empowered, to pass\r\nresolutions concerning the enactment, abrogation, alteration, or\r\ninterpretation of laws or regulations; peace and war and the making\r\nof treaties; restoration of domestic order; telegraphs, railways,\r\nmines, and other undertakings, and questions of compensation arising\r\ntherefrom; the estimates and special appropriations; taxes, duties,\r\nand excise; matters sent down to the Council by special command of the\r\nSovereign; publication of laws and regulations approved by the King.\r\n\r\nThe King, if he so pleases, is present in person, or may send the\r\nHeir-Apparent to represent him. The Chancellor presides, two-thirds of\r\nthe members from a quorum, motions are carried by a numerical majority,\r\nand finally a memorial stating in outline the debate and its issue is\r\nsubmitted by the Chancellor to the King, who issues such commands as\r\nmay seem to him best, for, as previously stated, His Majesty is not\r\nbound to acquiesce in the decision of the majority.\r\n\r\nThe _Eui-chyeng Pu_ as a Department of State through the “Director\r\nof the General Bureau” has three sections--Archives, Gazette, and\r\nAccounts, and is rather a recording than an initiating office.\r\n\r\nThe scheme for the reconstruction of the Provincial and Metropolitan\r\nGovernments has introduced many important changes and retrenchments.\r\nThe thirteen Provinces are now divided into 339 Prefectures, Seoul\r\nhaving a Government of its own. The vast _entourage_ of provincial\r\nauthorities has been reduced, and a Provincial Governor’s staff is\r\nnow limited, nominally at least, to six clerks, two chief constables,\r\nthirty police, ten writers, four ushers, fifteen messengers, eight\r\ncoolies, and eight boys. Ordinances under the head of “Local\r\nGovernment” define the jurisdiction, powers, duties, period of office,\r\nsalaries, and etiquette[46] of all officials, along with many minor\r\nmatters. It is in this Department that the reforms instituted by the\r\nJapanese are the most sweeping. Very many offices were abolished,\r\nand all Government property belonging to the establishments of the\r\nofficials holding them was ordered to be handed over to officers of\r\nthe new _régime_. A Local Government Bureau was established with\r\nsections, under which local finance in cities and towns and local\r\nexpenditure of every kind were to be dealt with. An Engineering Bureau\r\ndealing with civil engineering and a Land Survey, a Registration Bureau\r\ndealing with an annual census of the population and the registration\r\nof lands, a Sanitary Bureau, and an Accounts Bureau form part of the\r\nvery ambitious Local Government scheme, admirable on paper, and which,\r\nif it were honestly carried out, would strike at the roots of many of\r\nthe abuses which are the curse of Korea. The whole provincial system as\r\nreorganized is under the Home Office.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the new scheme is the definition of the duties and\r\njurisdiction of the Ministers of State. The Cabinet Orders dealing with\r\nthe duties and discipline of officials at large so far issued are:--\r\n\r\n  Order 1. General rules for the conduct of public business.\r\n    “   2. Memorabilia for officials.\r\n    “   3. Resumption of office after mourning.\r\n    “   4. Reprimand and correction.\r\n    “   5. Obligation to purchase the _Gazette_.\r\n    “   6. Memorials to be on ruled paper.\r\n\r\nThe management of public offices under the new system is practically\r\nthe same as the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe _Memorabilia for Officials_ are as follows:--\r\n\r\n (_a_) No official must trespass outside his own jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n (_b_) Where duties have been deputed to a subordinate, the latter must\r\n not be continually interfered with.\r\n\r\n (_c_) A subordinate ordered to do anything which in his opinion is\r\n irregular or irrelevant should expostulate with his senior. If the\r\n latter holds by his opinion, the junior must conform.\r\n\r\n (_d_) Officials must be straightforward and outspoken, and not give\r\n outward acquiescence while privately criticising or hindering their\r\n superiors.\r\n\r\n (_e_) Officials must not listen to suggestions from outsiders or talk\r\n with them on official business.\r\n\r\n (_f_) Officials must be frank with one another, and not form cliques.\r\n\r\n (_g_) No official must wilfully spread false rumors about another or\r\n lightly credit such.\r\n\r\n (_h_) No official must absent himself from office without permission\r\n during office hours, or frequent the houses of others.\r\n\r\nResolution 88, passed some months earlier, was even more explicit:--\r\n\r\n Officials are thereby forbidden to divulge official secrets even when\r\n witnesses in a court of law, unless specially permitted to do so;\r\n or to show despatches to outsiders. They are not allowed to become\r\n directors or managers in a public company; to accept compensation from\r\n private individuals or gifts from their subordinates; to undertake,\r\n without permission, extra work for payment; or to put to private use\r\n Government horses. They may receive honors or presents from foreign\r\n Sovereigns or Governments only with the special sanction of His\r\n Majesty.\r\n\r\nAn ordinance restored the use of the uniforms worn prior to the\r\n“Reformation,” whether Court dress, full dress, half-dress, or undress,\r\nand announced that neither officials nor private persons were to be\r\ncompelled any longer to wear black.\r\n\r\nEach Department is presided over by a Minister, who is empowered to\r\nissue Departmental Orders, as Instructions to the local officials and\r\npolice, and Notifications to the people. His jurisdiction over the\r\npolice and local officials is concurrent with that of his colleagues,\r\nwho must also be consulted by him before recommending to the Throne the\r\npromotion or degradation of the higher officials of his Departmental\r\nStaff.\r\n\r\nUnder the Minister is a Vice-Minister, empowered to act for him\r\non occasion, and, when doing so, possessing equal privileges. The\r\nVice-Minister is usually the head of the Minister’s Secretariat, which\r\ndeals with “confidential matters, promotions, custody of the Minister’s\r\nand Departmental Seals, receipt and despatch of correspondence, and\r\nconsultation of precedents, preparation of statistics, compilation and\r\npreservation of archives.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Secretariats, there are a number of Bureaux, both\r\nSecretariats and Bureaux being, for convenience, subdivided into\r\nsections, each of which has its special duties.\r\n\r\nThe Departments of Government are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME OFFICE\r\n\r\nThe Home Minister has charge of matters concerning local government,\r\npolice, jails, civil engineering, sanitation, shrines and temples,\r\nsurveying, printing census, and public charity, as well as the general\r\nsupervision of the local authorities and the police.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Minister is vested with the control of international\r\naffairs, the protection of Korean commercial interests abroad, and the\r\nsupervision of the Diplomatic and Consular Services.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURY\r\n\r\n“The Minister for Finance, being vested with the control of the\r\nfinances of the Government, will have charge of all matters relating\r\nto accounts, revenue, and expenditure, taxes, national debts, the\r\ncurrency, banks, and the like, and will have supervision over the\r\nfinances of each local administration” (Ord. 54, § I).\r\n\r\nUnder this Minister there is a Taxation Bureau with three\r\nsections--Land Tax, Excise, and Customs.[47] The ordinances connected\r\nwith the remodelled system of taxation and the salaries and expenses of\r\nofficials are very numerous and minute. The appropriation actually in\r\nmoney for the Sovereign’s Privy Purse was fixed at $500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR OFFICE\r\n\r\nThe Minister for War, who must be a general officer, has charge of\r\nthe military administration of an army lately fixed at 6,000 men, and\r\nthe chief control of men and matters in the army, and is to exercise\r\nsupervision over army divisions, and all buildings and forts under his\r\nDepartment. The new military arrangements are very elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINISTRY OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIn this important Department, besides the Minister and Vice-Minister\r\nand heads of Bureaux and Sections, there are three special Secretaries\r\nwho act as Inspectors of Schools, and an official specially deputed to\r\ncompile and select text-books.\r\n\r\nBesides the Minister’s Secretariat, there are the _Education Bureau_,\r\nwhich is concerned with primary, normal, intermediary, foreign\r\nlanguage, technical and industrial schools, and students abroad; and a\r\n_Compilation Bureau_, concerned with the selection, translation, and\r\ncompilation of text-books; the purchase, preservation, and arrangement\r\nof volumes, and the printing of books.\r\n\r\nUnder this Department has been placed the Confucian College, an\r\ninstitution of the old _régime_, the purpose of which was to attend to\r\nthe Temple of Literature, in which, as in China, the Memorial Tablets\r\nof Confucius, Mencius, and the Sages are honored, and to encourage the\r\nstudy of the classical books. The subjects for study are the “Three\r\nClassics,” “Four Books and Popular Commentary,” Chinese Composition,\r\nOutlines of Chinese History--of the Sung, Yüan, and Ming Dynasties.\r\nTo meet the reformed requirements, this College has been reorganized,\r\nand the students, who must be between the ages of twenty and forty,\r\n“of good character, persevering, intelligent, and well acquainted with\r\naffairs,” are in addition put through a course of Korean and foreign\r\nannals, Korean and foreign geography, and arithmetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINISTRY OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Justice has charge of judicial matters, pardons\r\nand restorations to rank, instructions for public prosecution, and\r\nsupervision over Special Courts, High Courts, and District Courts; and\r\nthe Department forms a High Court of Justice for the hearing of certain\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, TRADE, AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Agriculture has charge of all matters relating to\r\nagriculture, commerce, industries, posts, telegraphs, shipping, and\r\nmarine officers.\r\n\r\nIn this Department, besides the Minister’s Secretariat, there are\r\nBureaux of Agriculture, Communications, Trade, Industry, Mining, and\r\nAccounts. The Bureau of Agriculture contains Agricultural, Forest, and\r\nNatural Products sections; that of Communications, Post, Telegraph,\r\nand Marine sections; and that of Trade and Industry deals with\r\nCommerce, Trading Corporations, Weights and Measures, Manufactures, and\r\nFactories. The Mining Bureau has sections for Mines and Geology, and\r\nthe Bureau of Accounts deals with the inventories and expenditure of\r\nthe Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nBesides the Reorganization of these important Departments of State, a\r\ndesign for a “Village System,” organized as follows, is to supersede\r\nthat which had decayed with the general decay of Government in Korea.\r\n\r\nThe country is now divided into districts (_Kun_), each _Kun_\r\ncontaining a number of _myen_ or cantons, each of which includes a\r\nnumber of _ni_ or villages. The old posts and titles are abolished,\r\nand each village is now to be provided with the following officers:--\r\n\r\n1. _Headman._--He must be over thirty years of age, and is elected for\r\none year by the householders. The office is honorary.\r\n\r\n2. _Clerk._--He holds office under the same conditions as the Headman,\r\nunder whom he keeps the books and issues notices.\r\n\r\n3. _Elder._--Nominated by the householders, he acts for the Headman as\r\noccasion demands.\r\n\r\n4. _Bailiff._--Elected at the same time as the Headman he performs the\r\nusual duties of a servant or messenger, and holds office for a year on\r\ngood behavior.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding officers of the canton (commune) are a _Mayor_, a\r\n_Clerk_, a _Bailiff_, and a _Communal Usher_ who is irremovable except\r\nfor cause given, and is, like the other officials, elected by the\r\ncanton.\r\n\r\nA Village Council is composed of the Headman and one man from each\r\nfamily, and is empowered to pass resolutions on matters connected with\r\neducation, registration of households or lands, sanitation, roads and\r\nbridges, communal grain exchanges, agricultural improvements, common\r\nwoods and dykes, payment of taxes, relief in famine or other calamity,\r\nadjustment of the _corvée_, savings associations, and by-laws. The\r\nHeadman, who acts as chairman, has not only a casting vote, but the\r\npower to veto. A resolution passed over the veto of the Headman has\r\nto be referred to the Mayor, and over the veto of the Mayor to the\r\nPrefect. If passed twice over the veto of the Prefect, reference may be\r\nmade to the Governor. All resolutions, however, must be submitted twice\r\na year to the Home Office, through the Prefect and Governor; and it is\r\nincumbent on the Prefectural Council to sit at least twice in the year.\r\n\r\nTaxes are by a law of 13th October, 1895, classified as Land-Tax,\r\nScutage, Mining Dues, Customs Dues, and Excise. Excise is now made to\r\ninclude, besides ginseng dues, what are known as “Miscellaneous Dues,”\r\nviz. rent of glebe lands, tax on rushes used in mat-making, market\r\ndues on firewood and tobacco, tax on kilns, tax on edible seaweed, tax\r\non grindstones, up-river dues, and taxes on fisheries, salterns, and\r\nboats. All other imposts have been declared illegal. The first Korean\r\nBudget under the reformed system was published in January, 1896, and\r\nshowed an estimated revenue from all sources of $4,809,410.\r\n\r\nThe Palace Department underwent reorganization, nominally at least,\r\nand elaborate schemes for the administration of Royal Establishments,\r\nState Temples, and Mausolea were devised, and the relative rank of\r\nmembers of the Royal Clan, including ladies, was fixed--the ladies of\r\nthe King’s Seraglio being divided into eight classes, and those of the\r\nCrown Prince into four. The number of Court officials attached to the\r\ndifferent Royal Households, though diminished, is legion.\r\n\r\nVarious ordinances brought the classification of Korean officials into\r\nline with those of Japan. Every class in the country, private and\r\nofficial, has come into the purview of the Reorganizers, and finds its\r\nposition (_on paper_) more or less altered.\r\n\r\nAmong the more important of the Edicts which have nominally become law\r\nare the following:--\r\n\r\nAgreements with China cancelled. Distinctions between Patrician and\r\nPlebeian abolished. Slavery abolished. Early Marriages prohibited.\r\nRemarriage of widows permitted. Bribery to be strictly forbidden.\r\nNo one to be arrested without warrant for civil offences. Couriers,\r\nmountebanks, and butchers no longer to be under degradation. Local\r\nCouncils to be established. New coinage issued. Organization of Police\r\nforce. No one to be punished without trial. Irregular taxation by\r\nProvincial Governments forbidden. Extortion of money by officials\r\nforbidden. Family of a criminal not to be involved in his doom. Great\r\nmodifications as to torture. Superfluous Paraphernalia abolished.\r\nSchool of Instruction in Vaccination. Hair-cropping Proclamation. Solar\r\nCalendar adopted. “Drilled Troops” (_Kun-ren-tai_) abolished. Legal\r\npunishments defined. Slaughter-Houses licensed. Committee of Legal\r\nRevision appointed. Telegraph Regulations. Postal Regulations. Railways\r\nplaced under Bureau of Communications. These ordinances are a selection\r\nfrom among several hundred promulgated since July, 1894.\r\n\r\nOf the reforms notified during the last three and a half years\r\nseveral have not taken effect; and concerning others there has been a\r\ndistinctly retrograde movement, with a tendency to revert to the abuses\r\nof the old _régime_; and others which were taken in hand earnestly,\r\nhave gradually collapsed, owing in part to the limpness of the Korean\r\ncharacter, and in part to the opposition of all in office and of all\r\nwho hope for office to any measures of reform. Some, admirable in\r\nthemselves, at present exist only on paper; but, on the whole, the\r\nreorganized system, though in many respects fragmentary, is a great\r\nimprovement on the old one; and it may not unreasonably be hoped that\r\nthe young men, who are now being educated in enlightened ideas and\r\nnotions of honor, will not repeat the iniquities of their fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] The chapters on the Reorganized Korean Government--Education,\r\nTrade, and Finance--and Dæmonism are intended to aid in the intelligent\r\nunderstanding of those which precede them. The reader who wishes to\r\ngo into the subject of the old and the reorganized systems of Korean\r\nGovernment will find a mass of curious and deeply interesting detail\r\nin a volume entitled, _Korean Government_, by W. H. Wilkinson, Esq.,\r\nlately H.B.M.’s Acting Vice-Consul at Chemulpo, published by the\r\nStatistical Department of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs at\r\nShanghai in March, 1897. To it I am very greatly indebted.\r\n\r\n[44] Wood-day is the term adopted by the Japanese for Thursday, their\r\nweek, which has now been imposed on the Koreans, being Sun-day,\r\nMoon-day, Fire-day, Water-day, Wood-day, Metal-day, and Earth-day.\r\n\r\n[45] See p. 250.\r\n\r\n[46] _Official Intercourse._ Ord. 45 amends some old practices\r\nregulating the intercourse and correspondence of officials. The\r\netiquette of the official call by a newly-appointed Prefect on the\r\nGovernor, on the whole, is retained, although it is in some respects\r\nsimplified. The old fashion obliged the Magistrate to remain outside\r\nthe _yamen_ gate, while a large folded sheet of white paper inscribed\r\nwith his name, was sent in to the Governor. The latter thereupon gave\r\norders to his personal attendants or ushers to admit the Magistrate.\r\nThe _t’oin_, as they were commonly styled, called out “_Sa-ryeng_,”\r\nto which the servants chanted a reply. The Governor being seated, the\r\nMagistrate knelt outside the room and bowed to the ground. To this\r\nobeisance the Governor replied by raising his arms over his head.\r\nThe Magistrate was asked his name and age, given some stereotyped\r\nadvice, and dismissed. The Governor is for the future to return the\r\nbow of the Prefect, and conversation is to be conducted in terms of\r\nmutual respect, the Magistrate describing himself as _ha-koan_ (“your\r\nsubordinate”), and addressing the Governor by his title.\r\n\r\n[47] The finances of Korea are now practically under British\r\nmanagement, Mr. J. M’Leavy Brown, LL.D., of the Chinese Imperial\r\nMaritime Customs, and Chief Commissioner of Customs for Korea, having\r\nundertaken in addition the post of Financial Adviser to the Treasury,\r\nand a Royal Edict having been issued that every order for a payment out\r\nof the national purse, down to the smallest, should be countersigned by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nEDUCATION AND FOREIGN TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nKorean education has hitherto failed to produce patriots, thinkers, or\r\nhonest men. It has been conducted thus. In an ordinary Korean school\r\nthe pupils, seated on the floor with their Chinese books in front of\r\nthem, the upper parts of their bodies swaying violently from side to\r\nside or backwards and forwards, from daylight till sunset, vociferate\r\nat the highest and loudest pitch of their voices their assigned lessons\r\nfrom the Chinese classics, committing them to memory or reciting them\r\naloud, writing the Chinese characters, filling their receptive memories\r\nwith fragments of the learning of the Chinese sages and passages of\r\nmythical history, the begoggled teacher, erudite and supercilious, rod\r\nin hand and with a book before him, now and then throwing in a word of\r\ncorrection in stentorian tones which rise above the din.\r\n\r\nThis educational mill grinding for ten or more years enabled the\r\naverage youth to aspire to the literary degrees which were conferred\r\nat the _Kwa-ga_ or Royal Examinations held in Seoul up to 1894, and\r\nwhich were regarded as the stepping-stones to official position, the\r\ngreat object of Korean ambition. There is nothing in this education\r\nto develop the thinking powers or to enable the student to understand\r\nthe world he lives in. The effort to acquire a difficult language,\r\nthe knowledge of which gives him a mastery of his own, is in itself a\r\ndesirable mental discipline, and the ethical teachings of Confucius and\r\nMencius, however defective, contain much that is valuable and true, but\r\nbeyond this little that is favorable can be said.\r\n\r\nNarrowness, grooviness, conceit, superciliousness, a false pride which\r\ndespises manual labor, a selfish individualism, destructive of generous\r\npublic spirit and social trustfulness, a slavery in act and thought to\r\ncustoms and traditions 2,000 years old, a narrow intellectual view, a\r\nshallow moral sense, and an estimate of women essentially degrading,\r\nappear to be the products of the Korean educational system.\r\n\r\nWith the abolition of the Royal Examinations; a change as to the\r\nmethods of Government appointments; the working of the Western leaven;\r\nthe increased prominence given to _En-mun_, and the slow entrance of\r\nnew ideas into the country, some of the desire for this purely Chinese\r\neducation has passed away, and it has been found necessary to stimulate\r\nwhat threatened to become a flagging interest in all education by new\r\neducational methods and forces, the influence of which should radiate\r\nfrom the capital.\r\n\r\nThere are now (October, 1897) Government Vernacular Schools, a\r\nGovernment School for the study of English, Foreign Language Schools,\r\nand Mission Schools. Outside the Vernacular and Mission Schools there\r\nis the before-mentioned Royal English School, with 100 students in\r\nuniform, regularly drilled by a British Sergeant of Marines, and\r\ncrazy about football! These young men, in appearance, manners, and\r\nrapid advance in knowledge of English, reflect great credit on their\r\ninstructors. After this come Japanese, French, and Russian Schools,\r\nat present chiefly linguistic. Mr. Birukoff, in charge of the Russian\r\nSchool, was a captain of light artillery in the Russian army, and in\r\nboth the Russian and French schools the students are drilled daily by\r\nRussian drill instructors.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the establishment which has exercised and is exercising\r\nthe most powerful educational, moral, and intellectual influence in\r\nKorea is the Pai Chai College (“Hall for the rearing of Useful Men”),\r\nso named by the King in 1887. This, which belongs to the American\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, has had the advantage of the services\r\nof one Principal, the Rev. H. G. Appenzeller, for eleven years. It\r\nhas a Chinese-_En-mun_ department, for the teaching of the Chinese\r\nclassics, Sheffield’s _Universal History_, etc., a small theological\r\ndepartment, and an English department, in which reading, grammar,\r\ncomposition, spelling, history, geography, arithmetic, and the elements\r\nof chemistry and natural philosophy are taught. Dr. Jaisohn, a Korean\r\neducated in America, has recently lectured once a week at this College\r\non the geographical divisions of the earth and the political and\r\necclesiastical history of Europe, and has awakened much enthusiasm.\r\nA patriotic spirit is being developed among the students, as well as\r\nsomething of the English public school spirit with its traditions of\r\nhonor. This College is undoubtedly making a decided impression, and\r\nis giving, besides a liberal education, a measure of that broader\r\nintellectual view and deepened moral sense which may yet prove the\r\nsalvation of Korea. Christian instruction is given in Korean, and\r\nattendance at chapel is compulsory. The pupils are drilled, and early\r\nin 1897, during the military craze, adopted a neat European military\r\nuniform. There is a flourishing industrial department, which includes a\r\ntri-lingual press and a book-binding establishment, both of which have\r\nfull employment.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1895 the Government, recognizing the importance of the secular\r\neducation given in this College, made an agreement by which it could\r\nplace pupils up to the number of 200 there, paying for their tuition\r\nand the salaries of certain tutors.\r\n\r\nThere are other schools for girls and boys, in which an industrial\r\ntraining is given, conducted with some success by the same Mission, and\r\nthe American Presbyterians have several useful schools, and pay much\r\nattention to the training of girls.\r\n\r\nThe _Société des Missions Etrangères_ has in Seoul an Orphanage and\r\ntwo Boys’ Schools, with a total of 262 children. The principal object\r\nis to train the orphans as good Roman Catholics. In the Boys’ Schools\r\nthe pupils are taught to read and write Chinese and _En-mun_, and\r\nto a limited extent they study the Chinese classics. The religious\r\ninstruction is given in _En-mun_. They aim at providing a primary\r\neducation for the children of Korean converts.\r\n\r\nThe boys in the Orphanage are taught _En-mun_ only, and at thirteen are\r\nadopted by Roman Catholics in Seoul or the country, and learn either\r\nfarming or trades, or, assuming their own support, enter a trade or\r\nbecome servants. The elder girls learn _Em-mun_, sewing, and housework,\r\nand at fifteen are married to the sons of Roman Catholics. At Riong\r\nSan near Seoul there is a Theological Seminary for the training of\r\ncandidates for the priesthood.\r\n\r\nBesides these there is a school established in 1896 by the “Japanese\r\nForeign Educational Society,” which is composed chiefly of “advanced”\r\nJapanese Christians. The course of study embraces the Chinese classics,\r\n_En-mun_, composition, the study of Japanese as a medium for the study\r\nof Western learning, and lectures on science and religion. This school\r\nwas intended by its founders to work as a Christian propaganda.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 there were in Seoul nearly 900 students, chiefly young men,\r\nin Mission and Foreign Schools, inclusive of 100 in the Royal English\r\nSchool, which has English teachers. In the majority of these the\r\nstudents are trained in Christian morality, fundamental science,\r\ngeneral history, and the principles of patriotism. A certain amount of\r\ndenationalization is connected with most of the Boys’ Schools, for the\r\nstudents necessarily receive new ideas, thoughts, and views of life,\r\nwhich cannot be shaken out of them by any local circumstances, changing\r\ntheir standpoints and the texture of their minds for life. When they\r\nreplace the elder generation better things may be expected for Korea.\r\n\r\nThe Korean reformed ideas of education, which had their origin during\r\nthe Japanese reform era, embrace the creation of a primary school\r\nsystem, an efficient Normal College, and Intermediate Schools. Actually\r\nexisting under the Department of Education are a revived Confucian\r\nSchool, the Royal English School, and the Normal College, placed in\r\nMay, 1897, under the very efficient care of the Rev. H. B. Hulbert,\r\nM.A., a capable and scholarly man, some of whose contributions to our\r\nknowledge of Korean poetry and music have enriched earlier chapters\r\nof these volumes. Text-books in _En-mun_ and teachers who can teach\r\nthem have to be created. It is hoped and expected that supply will\r\nfollow demand, and that in a few years the larger provincial towns\r\nwill possess Intermediate or High Schools, and the villages attain\r\nthe advantages of elementary schools, all using a uniform series\r\nof text-books in the vernacular. Chinese finds its place in the\r\ncurriculum, but not as the medium for teaching Korean and general\r\nhistory, or geography and arithmetic, which must be acquired through\r\nthe native tongue.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the somewhat spasmodic and altogether unscientific methods\r\nof the Education Department, it has succeeded in getting the revived\r\nNormal College under way, as well as a fair number of primary schools,\r\nwhere over 1,000 boys are learning the elements of arithmetic,\r\ngeography, and Korean history, with brief outlines of the systems of\r\ngovernment in other civilized countries. Seventy-seven youths are\r\nstudying in Japan at Government expense, and have made fair progress\r\nin languages, but are said to show a lack of mathematical aptitude and\r\nlogical power. Altogether the Korean educational outlook is not without\r\nelements of hopefulness.\r\n\r\nThough the Foreign Trade of Korea only averages something less than\r\n£1,500,000 annually, the potential commerce of a country with not less\r\nthan 12,000,000 of people, all cotton-clad, ought not to be overlooked.\r\nThe amount of foreign trade which exists is the growth of thirteen\r\nyears only, but when we remember that Korea is a purely agricultural\r\ncountry of a very primitive and backward type, that many of her finest\r\nvalleys are practically isolated by mountain ranges, traversed by\r\nnearly impassable roads, that the tyranny of custom is strong, that\r\nthe Korean farmer is only just learning that a profitable and almost\r\nunlimited demand exists for his rice and beans across the sea, that\r\nthe serious cost of his cotton clothing can be kept down by importing\r\nforeign yarn or piece goods, and that his comfort can be increased by\r\nthe introduction of articles of foreign manufacture, and that such\r\nfacts are only slowly entering the secluded valleys of the Hermit\r\nKingdom, the actual bulk of the trade is rather surprising, and its\r\npossibilities are worth considering. The net imports of foreign goods\r\nhave increased from the value of $2,474,189 in 1886 to $6,531,324 in\r\n1896.[48] Measured in dollars, the trade of 1896 exceeds that of any\r\nprevious year except 1895, when the occupation of Korea by Japanese\r\ntroops, with their large following of transport coolies, created an\r\nartificial expansion.\r\n\r\nAmong Korean exports, which chiefly consist of beans, fish (dried\r\nmanure), cow-hides, ginseng, paper, rice, and seaweed, there are none\r\nwhich are likely to find a market elsewhere than in China and Japan,\r\nbut Korea, so far as rice goes, is on the way to become the granary\r\nof the latter country, her export in 1890 having reached the value of\r\n£271,000.\r\n\r\nWith imports, European countries, India, and America are concerned.\r\nWithout, I think, being over sanguine, I anticipate a time when, with\r\nimproved roads, railroads, and enlightenment, together with security\r\nfor the earnings of labor from official and patrician exactions, the\r\nKorean will have no further occasion for protecting himself by an\r\nappearance of squalid poverty, and when he will become on a largely\r\nincreased scale a consumer as well as a producer, and will surround\r\nhimself with comforts and luxuries of foreign manufacture, as his\r\nbrethren are already doing under the happier rule of Russia. Under\r\nthe improved conditions which it is reasonable to expect, I should\r\nnot be surprised if the value of the Foreign Trade of Korea were to\r\nreach £10,000,000 in another quarter of a century, and the share which\r\nEngland is to have of it is an important question.\r\n\r\nOur great competitor in the Korean markets is Japan, and we have to\r\ndeal not only with a rival within twenty hours of Korean shores,\r\nand with nearly a monopoly of the carrying trade, but with the most\r\nnimble-witted, adaptive, persevering, and pushing people of our day. It\r\nis inevitable that British hardware and miscellaneous articles must be\r\nousted by the products of Japanese cheaper labor, and that the Japanese\r\nwill continue to supply the increasing demand for scissors, knives,\r\nmatches, needles, hoes, grass knives, soap, perfumes, kerosene lamps,\r\niron cooking-pots, nails, and the like, but the loss of the trade in\r\ncotton piece goods would be a serious matter, and the possibility of it\r\nhas to be faced.\r\n\r\nThe value of the import trade in 1896 was £708,461 as against £875,816\r\nfor 1895 (an exceptional year), and the larger part of this reduction\r\ntook place in articles of British manufacture, the decrease of £134,304\r\nin the value of cotton imports falling almost entirely on cottons of\r\nBritish origin, the Japanese import not only retaining its position in\r\nspite of adverse circumstances, but showing a slight increase. Japanese\r\nsheetings showed a substantial increase, more than counterbalanced\r\nby the diminished import of the British and American article, and\r\nJapanese cotton yarn continued to arrive in larger quantities, and is\r\ngradually driving British and Indian yarn out of the Korean market. It\r\ncan be sold at a considerably lower price than the British article, and\r\npractically at the same price as the Indian, with which its improved\r\nquality enables it to compete on very favorable terms.\r\n\r\nAs the result of inquiries carried on during my two journeys in the\r\ninterior, as well as at the treaty ports, it does not appear to me\r\nthat Japanese success is even chiefly caused by proximity, and in 1896\r\nshe had to compete with the enterprise and energy of the Chinese, who,\r\nhaving returned after the war to the benefits of British protection,\r\nwere pushing the distribution of Manchester goods imported from\r\nShanghai.\r\n\r\nRather I am inclined to think that the success of our rival is mainly\r\ndue to causes which I have seen in operation in Persia and Central Asia\r\nas well as in Korea, and which embrace not only imperfect knowledge\r\nof the tastes and needs of customers, but the neglect to act upon\r\ninformation supplied by consular and diplomatic agents, a groovy\r\nadherence to British methods of manufacture, and the ignoring of native\r\ndesires as to colors, patterns, and the widths and makes which suit\r\nnative clothing and treatment, and the size of bales best suited to\r\nnative methods of transport. I do not allude to the charge ofttimes\r\nmade against our manufacturers of supplying inferior cottons, because\r\nI have never seen any indications of its correctness, nor have I heard\r\nany complaints on the subject either in Korea or China, but of the\r\nignoring of the requirements of customers there is no doubt. It is\r\neverywhere a grievance and source of loss, and is likely to lose us the\r\nprospective advantages of the Korean market.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese success, putting the advantages of proximity aside, is,\r\nI believe, mainly due to the accuracy of the information obtained by\r\ntheir keen-witted agents, who have visited all the towns and villages\r\nin Korea, and to the carefulness with which their manufacturers are\r\nstudying the tastes and requirements of the Korean market. Their goods\r\nreach the shore in manageable bales, which do not require to be adapted\r\nafter arrival to the minute Korean pony, and their price, width,\r\nlength, and texture commend them to the Korean consumer. The Japanese\r\nunderstand that cotton 18 inches wide is the only cotton from which\r\nKorean garments can be fashioned without very considerable waste, and\r\nthey supply the market with it; and on the report of the agents of the\r\nimporting firms, the weavers of Osaka and other manufacturing towns\r\nwith adroitness and rapidity closely adapted the texture, width, and\r\nlength of their cottons to those of the hand-loom cotton goods made in\r\nSouth Korea, which are deservedly popular for their durability, and\r\nhave succeeded not only in producing an imitation of Korean cotton\r\ncloth, which stands the pounding and beating of Korean washing, but\r\none which actually deceives the Korean weavers themselves as to its\r\norigin, and which has won great popularity with the Korean women. If\r\nKorea is to be a British market in the future, the lost ground must\r\nbe recovered by working on Japanese lines, which are the lines of\r\ncommercial common sense.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I venture to express the opinion that the circumstances of\r\nthe large population of Korea are destined to gradual improvement with\r\nthe aid of either Japan or Russia, that foreign trade must increase\r\nmore or less steadily with increased buying powers and improved means\r\nof transport, and that the amount which falls to the share of Great\r\nBritain will depend largely upon whether British manufacturers are\r\nwilling or not to adapt their goods to Korean tastes and convenience.\r\n\r\nAs instances of the aptitude of the Koreans for taking to foreign\r\narticles which suit their needs, it may be mentioned, on the authority\r\nof a report from the British Consul-General to the British Foreign\r\nOffice on Trade and Finance in Korea for 1896, presented to Parliament\r\nJuly, 1897, that the import of lucifer matches reached the figure of\r\n£11,386,[49] while that of American and Russian kerosene exceeded\r\n£36,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the export of gold increased, and was $1,390,412, one million\r\ndollars’ worth being exported from Wön-san alone. The gold export\r\nincluded, the excess of Korean imports over exports was only about\r\n£50,000, and as it is estimated that only one half of the gold actually\r\nleaving the country is declared, it may be assumed that Korea is able\r\nto pay for a larger supply of foreign goods than she has hitherto\r\ntaken. The statistics of Korean Foreign Trade which are to be found in\r\nthe Appendix are the latest returns, supplied to me by the courtesy\r\nof the Korean Customs’ Department,[50] the returns of shipping and of\r\nprincipal articles of export and import being taken from H.B.M.’s\r\nConsul-General’s Report for 1896, presented to Parliament July,\r\n1897.[51] With reference to the shipping returns, it must be observed\r\nthat the British flag is practically unrepresented in Korean waters,\r\neven a chartered British steamer being rarely seen. The monopoly of the\r\ncarrying trade which Japan has enjoyed has only lately been broken into\r\nby the establishment of a Russian subsidized line as a competitor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the trade of the three ports open to Foreign Trade in\r\n1896, to which the returns given refer exclusively, there is that\r\ncarried on by the non-treaty ports, and on the Chinese and Russian\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this brief notice of the Foreign Trade of Korea, I may\r\nremark that Japanese competition, so far as it consists in the ability\r\nto undersell us owing to cheaper labor, is likely to diminish year by\r\nyear, as the conditions under which goods can be manufactured gradually\r\napproximate to those which exist in England; the rapidly increasing\r\nprice of the necessaries of life in Japan, the demand for more than “a\r\nliving wage,” and an appreciation of the advantages of combination all\r\ntending in this direction.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Finance there is little to be said. The principal\r\nitems of revenue are a land tax of six dollars on a fertile _kyel_, and\r\nfive dollars on a mountain _kyel_, a house tax of 60 cents annually,\r\nfrom which houses in the capital are exempt, the ginseng tax, and\r\nthe gold dues, making up a budget of about 4,000,000 dollars, a sum\r\namply sufficient for the legitimate expenditure of the country.\r\nThe land tax is extremely light. Only about a third of the revenue\r\nactually collected reaches the National Treasury, partly owing to the\r\ninfinite corruption of the officials through whose hands it passes,\r\nand partly because provincial income and expenditure are to a certain\r\nextent left to local management. If the Government is in earnest in\r\nthe all-important matter of educating the people, the increased\r\nexpenditure can readily be met by imposing taxation on such articles of\r\nluxury as wine and tobacco, which are enormously consumed, Seoul alone\r\npossessing 475 wine shops and 1,100 tobacco shops. But even without\r\nresorting to any new source of revenue, with strict supervision and\r\nregular accounts the income of the Central Government is capable of\r\nconsiderable expansion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the awful official corruption which has been revealed,\r\nand the chaos which up to 1896 prevailed in the Treasury, the\r\nKorean financial outlook is a hopeful one. At the close of 1895 the\r\nKing persuaded Mr. M’Leavy Brown, LL.D., the Chief Commissioner of\r\nCustoms, to undertake the thankless office of Adviser to the Treasury,\r\nconfirming his position some months later by the issue of an edict\r\nmaking his signature essential to all orders for payments out of the\r\nnational purse. Korean imagination and ingenuity are chiefly fertile\r\nin devising tricks and devices for getting hold of public money, and\r\nanything more hydra-headed than the dishonesty of Korean official life\r\ncannot be found, so that it is not surprising that as soon as the\r\nforeign adviser blocks one nefarious proceeding another is sprung upon\r\nhim, and that the army of useless drones, deprived of their “vested\r\ninterests” by the judicious retrenchments which have been made, as\r\nwell as thousands who are trembling for their ill-gotten gains, should\r\noppose financial reform by every device of Oriental ingenuity.\r\n\r\nHowever, race, as represented by the honor and capacity of one\r\nEuropean, is carrying the day, and Korean Finance is gradually\r\nbeing placed on a sound basis. With careful management, judicious\r\nretrenchments of expenditure, the reduction of the chaos in the\r\nTreasury to an orderly system of accounts, and a different method of\r\ncollecting the land tax, which is now being remitted with tolerable\r\nregularity to the Treasury, an actual financial equilibrium was\r\nestablished and maintained during the year 1896, which closed with a\r\nconsiderable surplus, and in April, 1897, one million dollars of the\r\nJapanese loan of three millions was repaid to Japan, and there is\r\nevery prospect that the remaining indebtedness might be paid off out\r\nof income in 1899, leaving Korea in the proud position of a country\r\nwithout a national debt, and with a surplus of income over expenditure!\r\n\r\nThe prosperous financial conclusion of 1896 is all the more remarkable\r\nbecause of certain exceptional expenditures. Two new regiments were\r\nadded to the army, the old Arsenal, a disused costly toy, was put\r\ninto working order, with all necessary modern improvements, under the\r\nsupervision of a Russian machinist, the Kyeng-wun Palace was built,\r\ncostly ceremonies and works connected with the late Queen’s prospective\r\nfuneral were paid for, and a considerable area of western Seoul was\r\nrecreated. All civil Government _employés_ (and they are legion),\r\nas well as soldiers and police, are paid regularly every month, and\r\nsinecures are very slowly disappearing.\r\n\r\nA Korean silver, copper, and brass coinage, convenient as well as\r\nornamental, is coming into general circulation, and as it gradually\r\ndisplaces _cash_, is setting trade free from at least one of the\r\nconditions which hampered it, and increased banking facilities are\r\ntending in the same direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] For detailed statistics of Korean Foreign Trade, see Appendix C.\r\n\r\n[49] This seems incredible, and compels one to suppose that £ is a\r\nmisprint for $.\r\n\r\n[50] See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[51] See Appendix C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nDÆMONISM OR _SHAMANISM_\r\n\r\n\r\nKorean cities without priests or temples; houses without “god shelves”;\r\nvillage festivals without a _mikoshi_ or idols carried in festive\r\nprocession; marriage and burial without priestly blessing; an absence\r\nof religious ceremonials and sacred books to which real or assumed\r\nreverence is paid, and nothing to show that religion has any hold on\r\nthe popular mind, constitute a singular Korean characteristic.\r\n\r\nPutting aside Buddhism with its gross superstitions, practised chiefly\r\nin remote places, and the magisterial homage before the Confucian\r\ntablets to the memory of the Great Teacher, the popular cult--I dare\r\nnot call it a religion--consists of a number of observances dictated by\r\nthe dread of bodiless beings created by Korean fancy, and representing\r\nchiefly the mysterious forces of nature. It may be assumed, taking\r\ntradition for a guide, as certain of the litanies used in exorcism and\r\ninvocation were introduced along with Buddhism from China, that Korean\r\nimagination has grafted its own fancies on those which are of foreign\r\norigin, and which are of by no means distant kinship to those of the\r\n_Shamanism_ of northern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe external evidences of this cult are chiefly heaps of stones on the\r\ntops of passes, rude shrines here and there containing tawdry pictures\r\nof mythical beings, with the name in Chinese characters below, strings\r\nfrom which depend small bags of rice, worn-out straw shoes, strips of\r\ndirty rags, and, though rarely, rusty locks of black hair. Outside of\r\nmany villages are high posts (not to be confounded with the distance\r\nposts) with their tops rudely carved into heads and faces half human,\r\nhalf dæmonic, from which straw ropes, with dependent straw tassels,\r\nrecalling the Shintoism of Japan, are stretched across the road. There\r\nare large or distorted trees also, on which rags, rice-bags, and old\r\nshoes are hung, and under which are heaps of stones at which it is\r\nusual for travellers to bow and expectorate. On the ridge poles of\r\nroyal buildings and city gates, there are rows of grotesque bronze\r\nor china figures for the purpose of driving away evil dæmons, and at\r\ncrossroads a log of wood perforated like a mouse-trap, and with one\r\nhole bunged up, over which travellers step carefully, may sometimes\r\nbe seen. In cities the beating of drums accompanied by the clashing\r\nof cymbals vies with the laundry sticks in breaking the otherwise\r\nprofound stillness of night, and in travelling through the country, the\r\n_mu-tang_ or sorceress is constantly to be seen going through various\r\nmusical and dancing performances in the midst of a crowd in front of a\r\nhouse where there is sickness.\r\n\r\nI have referred to these things in earlier chapters, but the subject\r\nis such an important one, and the influence on Korean life of the\r\nbelief in dæmons is so strong and injurious, that I feel justified in\r\nlaying before my readers at some length such details of _Dæmonism_ as\r\nhave hitherto been ascertained. There is an unwillingness to speak to\r\nforeigners on this topic, and inquirers may have been purposely misled,\r\nbut enough has been gained to make it likely that further inquiry will\r\nbe productive of very valuable results.[52] The superstitions already\r\nmentioned, however trivial in themselves, point to that which underlies\r\nall religion, the belief in something outside ourselves which is higher\r\nor more powerful than ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed asserted by many of the so-called educated class that\r\nthe only cult in Korea is ancestor worship, and they profess to\r\nridicule the rags, cairns, shrines, and the other paraphernalia of\r\ndæmon-worship, as the superstition of women and coolies, and it is\r\nprobable that in Seoul, at least, few men of the upper class are\r\nbelievers, or patronize the rites otherwise than as unmeaning customs\r\nwhich it would be impolitic to discontinue, but it is safe to say\r\nthat from the Palace to the hovel all women, and a majority of men,\r\ngo through the forms which, influencing Buddhism, and possibly being\r\nmodified by it, have existed in Korea for more than fifteen centuries.\r\n\r\nWithout claiming any degree of scientific accuracy for the term\r\n_Shamanism_, as applied to this cult in Korea, it is more convenient\r\nto use it, the word dæmon having come to bear a popular meaning which\r\nprohibits its use where good spirits as well as bad are indicated.\r\nSo far as I know, _Shamanism_ exists only in Asia, and flourishes\r\nspecially among the tribes north of the Amur, the Samoyedes, Ostiaks,\r\netc., as well as among hill tribes on the southwestern frontier of\r\nChina. The term _Shaman_ may be applied to all persons, male or\r\nfemale, whose profession it is to have direct dealings with dæmons,\r\nand to possess the power of securing their good-will and averting\r\ntheir malignant influences by various magical rites, charms, and\r\nincantations, to cure diseases by exorcisms, to predict future events,\r\nand to interpret dreams.\r\n\r\nKorean _Shamanism_ or Dæmonism differs from that of northern Asia in\r\nits mildness, possibly the result of early Buddhist influence. It\r\nis the cult of dæmons not necessarily evil, but usually the enemies\r\nof man, and addicted to revenge and caprice. Though the _Shamans_\r\nare neither an order, nor linked by a common organization, they are\r\npractically recognized as a priesthood, in so far as it is through\r\ntheir offices that the dæmons are approached and propitiated on behalf\r\nof the people. It is supposed that the _Shaman_ or wizard was one of\r\nthe figures in the dawn of Korean history, and that Dæmonism in its\r\nearly stage was marked by human sacrifices. _Shamans_ in the train of\r\nroyalty, and as a part of the social organization of the Peninsula,\r\nfigure in very early Korean story, and they appear to have been the\r\nchief, if not the only, “religious” instructors.\r\n\r\nOne class among the _Shamans_ is incorporated into one of those guilds\r\nwhich are the Trades Unions of Korea, and the Government has imposed\r\nregistration on another class.[53] There are now two principal classes\r\nof _Shamans_, the _Pan-su_ and the _mu-tang_. The _Pan-su_ are blind\r\nsorcerers, and those parents are fortunate who have a blind son, for he\r\nis certain to be able to make a good living and support them in their\r\nold age. The _Pan-su_ were formerly persons of much distinction in the\r\nkingdom, but their social position has been lowered during the present\r\ndynasty, though in the present reign their influence in the Palace,\r\nand specially with the late Queen, has wrought much evil. The chief\r\nofficials of the _Pan-su_ Guild in Seoul hold the official titles of\r\n_Cham-pan_[54] and _Seung-ji_ from the Government, which gives prestige\r\nto the whole body. In order to guard their professional interests, the\r\n_Pan-su_ have local guilds, and in the various sections “Clubhouses”\r\nbuilt out of their own funds. The central office of the _Pan-su_ guild\r\nin Seoul was built and maintained by Government, and the two chief\r\nofficials of the guild hold, or held, _quasi_-official rank.\r\n\r\nIt appears that admission into the fraternity is only granted to an\r\napplicant on his giving proof of proficiency in the knowledge of a\r\ncumbrous body of orally transmitted _Shaman_ tradition, wisdom and\r\ncustom, much of it believed by the people to be 4,000 years old, and\r\nembracing scraps of superstition from the darkest arcana of Buddhism,\r\nas well as fragments of Confucianism. The neophyte has to learn of\r\n“the existence, nature, and power of dæmons, their relations with man,\r\nthe efficacy of exorcism through a magic ritual, and the genuine and\r\ncertain character of the results of divination.” He must meditate on\r\n“the customs, habits, and weaknesses of every class in Korean society\r\nin order to deal knowingly with his clients. A slight acquaintance\r\nwith Confucianism must enable him to give a flavor of learning to\r\nhis speech, and he must be well drilled in the methods of exorcisms,\r\nincantations, magic spells, divination, and the manufacture of charms\r\nand amulets.”\r\n\r\nThe services of sorcerers or geomancers are invariably called for in\r\nconnection with the choice of sites for houses and graves, in certain\r\ncontracts, and on the occasion of unusual calamities, sickness,\r\nbirths, marriages, and the purchase of land. The chief functions of\r\nthe _Shaman_ are, the influencing of dæmons by ritual and magical\r\nrites, propitiating them by offerings, exorcisms, and the procuring of\r\noracles. In their methods, dancing, gesticulations, a real or feigned\r\necstasy, and a drum play an important part. The fees of the _Shaman_\r\nare high, and it is believed that at the lowest computation, Dæmonism\r\ncosts Korea two million five hundred thousand dollars annually! In\r\norder to obtain favors or avert calamities, it is necessary to employ\r\nthe _Shamans_ as mediators, and it is their fees, and not the cost of\r\nthe offerings which press so heavily on the people.\r\n\r\nAmong the reasons which render the _Shaman_ a necessity are these. In\r\nKorean belief, earth, air, and sea, are peopled by dæmons. They haunt\r\nevery umbrageous tree, shady ravine, crystal spring, and mountain\r\ncrest. On green hill slopes, in peaceful agricultural valleys, in\r\ngrassy dells, on wooded up-lands, by lake and stream, by road and\r\nriver, in north, south, east, and west they abound, making malignant\r\nsport out of human destinies. They are on every roof, ceiling,\r\nfireplace, _kang_ and beam. They fill the chimney, the shed, the\r\nliving room, the kitchen--they are on every shelf and jar. In thousands\r\nthey waylay the traveller as he leaves his home, beside him, behind\r\nhim, dancing in front of him, whirring over his head, crying out upon\r\nhim from earth, air, and water. They are numbered by _thousands of\r\nbillions_, and it has been well said that their ubiquity is an unholy\r\ntravesty of the Divine Omnipresence.[55] This belief, and it seems\r\nto be the only one he has, keeps the Korean in a perpetual state of\r\nnervous apprehension, it surrounds him with indefinite terrors, and it\r\nmay truly be said of him that he “passes the time of his sojourning\r\nhere in fear.” Every Korean home is subject to dæmons, here, there, and\r\neverywhere. They touch the Korean at every point in life, making his\r\nwell-being depend on a continual series of acts of propitiation, and\r\nthey avenge every omission with merciless severity, keeping him under\r\nthis yoke of bondage from birth to death.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “dæmon-worship” as applied to Korean _Shamanism_ is\r\nsomewhat misleading. These legions of spirits which in Korean belief\r\npeopled the world, are of two classes, the first alone answering to\r\nour conception of dæmons. These are the self-existent spirits, unseen\r\nenemies of man, whose designs are always malignant or malicious, and\r\nspirits of departed persons, who, having died in poverty and manifold\r\ndistresses, are unclothed, hungry, and shivering vagrants, bringing\r\nuntold calamities on those who neglect to supply their wants. It is\r\ntrue, however, that about 80 per cent. of the legions of spirits are\r\nmalignant. The second class consists also of self-existent spirits,\r\nwhose natures are partly kindly, and of departed spirits of prosperous\r\nand good people, but even these are easily offended and act with\r\nextraordinary capriciousness. These, however, by due intercessions and\r\nofferings, may be induced to assist man in obtaining his desires, and\r\nmay aid him to escape from the afflictive power of the evil dæmons.\r\nThe comfort and prosperity of every individual depend on his ability to\r\nwin and keep the favor of the latter class.\r\n\r\nKoreans attribute every ill by which they are afflicted to dæmoniacal\r\ninfluence. Bad luck in any transaction, official malevolence, illness,\r\nwhether sudden or prolonged, pecuniary misfortune, and loss of power or\r\nposition are due to the malignity of dæmons. It is over such evils that\r\nthe _Pan-su_ is supposed to have power, and to be able to terminate\r\nthem by magical rites, he being possessed by a powerful dæmon, whose\r\nstrength he is able to wield.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the _modus operandi_, exorcism in sickness which is\r\nbelieved to be the work of an unclean dæmon may be taken. The _Pan-su_\r\narrives at the house, and boldly undertakes the expulsion of the foul\r\nspirit, the process being divided into four stages.[56]\r\n\r\n1. By a few throws from the tortoise divining box, the sorcerer\r\ndiscovers the dæmon’s nature and character, after which he seeks for an\r\nauspicious hour and makes arrangements for the next stage.\r\n\r\n2. Gaining control of the dæmon follows. The _Pan-su_ equips himself\r\nwith a wand of oak or pine a foot and half long, and a bystander is\r\nasked to hold this in an upright position on an ironing stone. Magic\r\nformulas are recited till the rod begins to shake and even dance on\r\nthe stone, this activity being believed to be the result of the dæmon\r\nhaving entered the wand. At this stage a talk takes place to test the\r\naccuracy of the divination of the dæmon’s name and nature, and of\r\nthe cause of the affliction. The _Pan-su_ manages the questions so\r\ndexterously that a simple yes is indicated by motion in the wand, while\r\nno is expressed by quiescence. At this stage the dæmon is given the\r\nchoice of quietly disappearing; after which, if he is obstinate, the\r\n_Pan-su_ proceeds to dislodge him.\r\n\r\n3. The third stage involves the aid of certain familiars of the\r\n_Pan-su_. A special wand, made of an eastern branch of a peach tree,\r\nwhich has much repute in expelling dæmons, is taken, and is held on\r\na table in a vertical position by an assistant. The _Pan-su_ recites\r\na farther part of his magic ritual, its power being shown by acute\r\nmovements in the wand in spite of attempts to keep it steady. A parley\r\ntakes place with the _Chang-gun_, the spirit who has been summoned\r\nto find out his objects. He promises to catch the _Chang-kun_, the\r\nmalignant dæmon, and after preparations and offerings have been made\r\nhe is asked to search for him. The man who holds the wand is violently\r\ndragged by a supernatural power out of the house to the place where the\r\n_Chang-kun_ is. Then the _Chang-gun_ is supposed to seize him, and the\r\nwand-holder is dragged back to the house.\r\n\r\n4. A bottle with a wide mouth is put on the floor, and alongside it a\r\npiece of paper inscribed with the name of the unclean daemon, which\r\nhas been obtained by divination and parley. The paper being touched\r\nwith the magic wand jumps into the bottle, which is hastily corked and\r\nburied on the hillside or at the crossroads.\r\n\r\nThis singular form of exorcism has a long and unintelligible ritual, in\r\nthe cases of those who can afford to pay for it, occupying some days,\r\nand at greater or lesser length is repeated daily by the _Shamans_\r\nthroughout Korea. It is usually succeeded by a form known as the Ritual\r\nPacification, which takes a whole night. This is for the purpose of\r\nrestoring order among the household dæmons, who have been much upset by\r\nthe previous proceedings, cleaning the house, and committing it and its\r\ninmates to the protection of the most powerful members of the Korean\r\ndæmoniacal hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe instruments of exorcism used by the _Pan-su_ are offerings to be\r\nmade at various stages of the process, a drum, cymbals, a bell, a\r\ndivination box, and a wand or wands.\r\n\r\nThe _Shamans_ claim to have derived many of their very numerous\r\nspells and formulas from Buddhists, who on their side assert that\r\ndæmon-worship was practised in Korea long before the introduction of\r\nBuddhism, and a relic of this worship is pointed out in the custom\r\nwhich prevails in the Korean magistracies of offering to guardian\r\nspirits on stone altars on the hills, pigs, or occasionally sheep,\r\nbefore sowing time and after harvest, as well as in case of drought,\r\nor other general calamity. This sacrifice is offered by the local\r\nmagistrate in the king’s name, and though identical in form with that\r\noffered to _Hananim_ (the Lord of Heaven), is altogether distinct from\r\nit. Most of the formulæ recited by the _Shamans_ have the reputation\r\nof being unsafe for ordinary people to use, but in consideration\r\nof the possibility of a great emergency, one is provided, which is\r\npronounced absolutely safe. This consists of fifty-six characters which\r\nmust be recited forwards, backwards, and sideways, and is called “The\r\ntwenty-eight stars formula.”[57]\r\n\r\nDivination is the second function of the _Pan-su_, and consists in a\r\nforecast of the future by means of rituals, known only to himself,\r\nassociated with the use of certain paraphernalia. This is used also\r\nfor finding out the result of a venture, or the cause of an existing\r\ntrouble, and for casting a man’s horoscope, _i.e._ “The four columns\r\nof a man’s future,” these being the hour, day, month, and year of\r\nhis birth, or rather their four combinations. This horoscope is the\r\ncrowning function of divination. In these “four columns” the secret\r\nof a man’s life is hidden, and their relations must govern him in\r\nall his actions. When a horoscope contains an arrow, which denotes\r\nill-luck, the _Pan-su_ corrects the misfortune by formulæ used with a\r\nbow of peach, with which during the recital he shoots arrows made of a\r\ncertain reed into a “non-prohibited” quarter. One of the great duties\r\nof divination is to cast the horoscope of a bride and bridegroom for\r\nan auspicious day for the wedding, for an unlucky one would introduce\r\ndæmons to the ruin of the new household.\r\n\r\nThe great strongholds of divination are the “Frog-Boxes” and dice\r\nboxes, manufactured for this purpose. The frog box is made like\r\na tortoise, having movable lips, and contains three _cash_, over\r\nwhich the _Pan-su_ repeats a very ancient invocation, which has been\r\ntranslated thus: “Will all you people grant to reveal the symbols.”\r\nThe coins are thrown three times, and the three falls present him\r\nwith the combinations of characters, out of which he manufactures his\r\noracle. The second implement of divination is a bamboo or brass tube\r\nclosed at both ends, but with a small hole in one to allow of the exit\r\nof small bamboo splinters of which it contains eight. The same thing\r\nis to be seen on innumerable altars in China. Each splinter has from\r\none to eight notches on it, and stands for a symbol of certain signs\r\non that divining table 3,000 years old, called the _Ho-pai_, which is\r\nimplicitly believed in by the Chinese. Two of these splinters give two\r\nsets of characters, eight being connected with each symbol. When the\r\n_Pan-su_ has obtained these he is ready to evolve his oracle.\r\n\r\nGreat reliance is placed on the charms which the _Pan-su_ make and\r\nsell. Probably there are few adults or children who do not wear these\r\nas amulets. They are generally made in the form of insects, or consist\r\nof Chinese characters. They are written on specially prepared yellow\r\npaper in red ink, and are regarded as being efficacious against illness\r\nand other calamities. Amulets are made of the wood of trees struck by\r\nlightning, which is supposed to possess magical qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] I desire again to express my indebtedness to the Rev.

C. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nNOTES ON DÆMONISM CONCLUDED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second and larger division of the _Shamans_ consists of the\r\n_mu-tang_. Though the _Pak-su Mu_, who are included among the\r\n_mu-tang_, are men, the female idea prevails so largely that these wear\r\nfemale clothing in performing their functions, and the whole class has\r\nthe name of _mu-tang_, and is spoken of as female.\r\n\r\nThe _mu-tang_ is universally prevalent, and her services are\r\nconstantly and everywhere sought. She enters upon an office regarded\r\nas of high importance with very little ceremonial, requiring only a\r\nlittle instruction from some one who has practised magic, and the\r\n“supernatural call.” This call, of which much is made, consists in the\r\nassurance of dæmoniacal possession, the dæmon being supposed to seize\r\nupon the woman, and to become in fact her _doppelgänger_, so completely\r\nis his personality superimposed on hers. The dæmon is almost invariably\r\na member of the Korean “_Dæmoneon_.” Mr. Jones mentions a woman who\r\nclaims that her indwelling dæmon is known as the spirit _Chil-song\r\nShin_, supposed to come from the constellation of _Ursa Major_, and he\r\nbrought with him a legion of other dæmons, from which the _mu-tang_\r\nderive their honorific title, _Man-shin_, a Legion of Spirits. This\r\nwoman in her early married life was ill for three years, and had\r\nfrequent visions of the spirit, and heard but resisted the “call.” When\r\nat last she yielded she was immediately cured, and was received into\r\nfavor with the spirit!\r\n\r\nOn obeying a dæmon call the woman snaps every tie of custom or\r\nrelationship, deserts parents, husband, or children, and obeys the\r\n“call” alone. Her position from that hour is a peculiar one, for while\r\nshe is regarded as indispensable to the community she is socially an\r\noutcast. In the curious relations of the Shamanate, the _Pan-su_ is\r\nobviously the Master of the Dæmons, gaining power by cabalistic formulæ\r\nor ritual to drive them off, or even bury them, while the _mu-tang_\r\nsupplicates and propitiates them. It is impossible to live in a place\r\nwhich has not a _mu-tang Shaman_.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the _mu-tang_ are more varied than those of the\r\n_Pan-su_, but on a par with his exorcisms may be placed her _Kauts_\r\nor Pacifications and Propitiations of dæmons, which are divided\r\ninto the occasional and periodic, the latter being Dæmon Festivals,\r\none public the other private. The public one is a triennial _festa_\r\ncelebrated either by a large village or by an aggregation of hamlets,\r\nand occupies three or four days. Its object is the tutelary dæmon of\r\nthe neighborhood, and its methods are sacrifice, petition, worship, and\r\nthanksgiving. The villagers choose two of their number to take entire\r\ncharge of the festival, and by them a tax for expenses is levied on\r\nthe vicinity. They also choose the festival day, hire the _mu-tang_,\r\nand arrange for the paraphernalia and the offerings to the dæmons. It\r\nis essential that the festival day should be chosen by divination, by\r\neither a _Sön-li_ or a _Pan-su_ acquainted with magic, and that the\r\nsorcerers should bathe frequently and abstain from animal food for\r\nseven previous days.\r\n\r\nThe village dæmon festival has a resemblance at some points to the\r\nShinto _matsuri_ of Japan. On the _festa_ day a booth, much decorated\r\nwith tags of brilliant color, is erected near the dæmons’ shrine,\r\nand with an accompaniment of _mu-tang_ music, dancing, and lavish\r\nand outlandish gesticulations, the offerings are presented to the\r\nspirits. The popular belief is that the dæmons become incarnate in the\r\n_mu-tang_, who utter oracles called _Kong-su Na-ta_, and the people\r\nbring them bowls of uncooked rice, and plead for a revelation of their\r\nfuture during the following three years. A common “test” at this\r\nfestival is the burning a tube of very thin white paper in a bowl.\r\nIts upper end is lighted by the _mu-tang_, who recites her spells as\r\nit burns. When it reaches the rim of the bowl, if the augury for the\r\nfuture be unfavorable, the paper burns away in the bowl, if favorable,\r\nthe paper lifts itself and is blown away.\r\n\r\nThe private _festa_, the _Chöl-muri Kaut_, one of thanksgiving to the\r\nhousehold dæmons, is necessary to secure a continuance of their good\r\noffices. The expenditure of the family resources on this occasion is so\r\nlavish as frequently to impoverish the household for a whole year. This\r\n_festa_ may be biennial or triennial. At the time a pig is sacrificed,\r\nofferings are made, _mu-tang_ are hired, and the fetishes of the\r\ndæmons are renewed or cleaned. The Ritual for these occasions, if\r\nunabbreviated, lasts several days, but among the poor only a selection\r\nfrom it is used. Its stages consist of rituals of invocation, petition,\r\noffering, and purification. While these are being recited a household\r\nspirit becomes incarnate in the _mu-tang_, and through her makes\r\noracular revelations of the future. At another stage deceased parents\r\nand ancestors appear in the _mu-tang_, and her personation of them is\r\ndescribed by an eyewitness as both “pathetic and ludicrous.” At Seoul\r\nthis festival is observed by families at the dæmon shrines outside the\r\ncity walls, and not in private houses.\r\n\r\nOne of the very common occasions which requires the presence of\r\na _mu-tang_ is the ceremonial known as the Rite of Purification,\r\ndefilement being contracted by a birth or death or any action which\r\nbrings in an unclean dæmon, whose obnoxious entrance moves the guardian\r\nor friendly dæmons to leave the house. A wand cut from a pine tree to\r\nthe _east_ of the house is used to bring about their return. It is\r\nset working by the muttered utterance of special spells or formulæ by\r\nthe _mu-tang_, the _mont-gari_, or tutelary spirit is found, and by\r\nmeans of prayers and offerings is induced to resume his place, and the\r\nunclean dæmon is exorcised and expelled. The beating of a drum and the\r\nfrequent sprinkling of pure water are portions of this rite.\r\n\r\nThe utterance of oracles is another great function of the _mu-tang_.\r\nIn spite of the low opinion of women held by the Koreans, so strong\r\nis the belief in the complete dæmoniacal possession of the _mu-tang_,\r\nand their consequent elevation above their sex, that the Koreans refer\r\nfully as much to them as to the _Pan-su_ for information regarding\r\nthe outcome of commercial ventures, and of projects of personal\r\nadvancement, as well as for the hidden causes of the loss of wealth\r\nor position, or of adversity or illness. The _mu-tang_, by an appeal\r\nto her familiar dæmon, in some cases obtains a direct answer, and in\r\nothers a reply by the divining chime, or the rice divination. The\r\nlatter consists of throwing down some grains of rice on a table and\r\nnoting the combinations which result. The “divining chime” is a hazel\r\nwand with a circle of bells at one end. These are shaken violently by\r\nthe _mu-tang_, and in the din thus created she hears the utterance of\r\nthe dæmon.\r\n\r\nThe arranging for the sale of children to dæmons is a farther function\r\nof the _mu-tang_, and is carried on to a very great extent. The Korean\r\nfather desires prosperity and long life for his boy (a girl being of\r\nlittle account), and the sale of the child to a spirit is he believes\r\nthe best way of attaining his object. When the so-called sale has been\r\ndecided on, the father consults the sorceress as to when and where it\r\nshall be made. The place chosen is usually a boulder near home, and\r\nthe child is there “consecrated” to the dæmon by the _mu-tang_ with\r\nfitting rites. Thenceforward, on the 15th day of the 1st moon, and\r\nthe 3rd day of the 3rd moon, worship and sacrifice are offered to the\r\nboulder. After this act of sale the name of the dæmon becomes part of\r\nthe boy’s name. It is not an unusual thing for the sale to be made to\r\nthe _mu-tang_ herself, who as the proxy of her dæmon accepts the child\r\nin case she learns by a magic rite that she may do so. She takes in its\r\nstead one of its rice bowls and a spoon, and these, together with\r\na piece of cotton cloth on which the facts concerning the sale of the\r\nchild are written, are laid up in her own house in the room devoted\r\nto her dæmon. There is a famous _mu-tang_, whose house I have been in\r\njust outside the south gate of Seoul, who has many of these, which\r\nare placed on tables below the painted daubs of dæmons ordinarily,\r\nbut which, on great occasions, are used as banners. At the Periodic\r\nFestivals offerings are made on behalf of these children, who, though\r\nthey live with their parents, know the sorceress or _mu-tang_ as\r\n_Shin_, and are considered her children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH GATE.]\r\n\r\nThe _mu-tang_ rites are specially linked with the house dæmon and with\r\n_Mama_ the smallpox dæmon. The house dæmon is on the whole a good one,\r\nbeing supposed to bring health and happiness, and if invited with due\r\nceremony he is willing to take up his abode under every roof. He cannot\r\nalways keep off disease, and in the case of contagious fevers, etc.,\r\nhe disappears until the rite of purification has been accomplished\r\nand he has been asked to return. The ceremonies attending his recall\r\ndeserve notice. On this great occasion the _mu-tang_ in office ties a\r\nlarge sheet of paper round a rod of oak, holds it upright, and goes\r\nout to hunt him. She may find him near, as if waiting to be invited\r\nback, or at a considerable distance, but in either case he makes his\r\npresence known by shaking the rod so violently that several men cannot\r\nhold it still, and then returns with the _mu-tang_ to the house, where\r\nhe is received with lively demonstrations of joy. The paper which was\r\nround the stick is folded, a few _cash_ are put into it, it is soaked\r\nin wine, and is then thrown up against a beam in the house to which it\r\nsticks, and is followed by some rice which adheres to it. That special\r\nspot is the abiding place of the dæmon. This ceremony involves a family\r\nin very considerable expense.\r\n\r\nThe universal belief that illness is the work of dæmons renders the\r\nservices of a _Pan-su_ or _mu-tang_ necessary wherever it enters a\r\nhouse, and in the case of smallpox, the universal scourge of Korean\r\nchildhood, the dæmon, instead of being exorcised, bottled, or buried,\r\nis treated with the utmost respect. The name by which the disease is\r\ncalled, “_Mama_,” is the dæmon’s name. It is said that he came from\r\nSouth China, and has only infested Korea for 1,000 years. On the\r\ndisease appearing, the _mu-tang_ is called in to honor the arrival\r\nof the spirit with a feast and fitting ceremonial. Little or no work\r\nis done, and if there are neighbors whose children have not had the\r\nmalady, they rest likewise, lest, displeased with their want of\r\nrespect, he should deal hardly with them. The parents do obeisance\r\n(worship) to the suffering child, and address it at all times in\r\nhonorific terms. Danger is supposed to be over after the 12th day,\r\nwhen the _mu-tang_ is again summoned, and a farewell banquet is given.\r\nA miniature wooden horse is prepared, and is loaded for the Spirit’s\r\njourney with small bags of food and money, fervent and respectful\r\nadieus are spoken, and he receives hearty good wishes for his\r\nprosperous return to his own place!\r\n\r\nIn the course of many centuries the office of the _mu-tang_ has\r\nundergone considerable modification. Formerly her power consisted\r\nin the foretelling of events by the movements of a turtle on the\r\napplication of hot iron to his back, and by the falling of a leaf of\r\ncertain trees. Her present vocation is chiefly mediatorial. It is also\r\nbecoming partially hereditary, her daughter or even daughter-in-law\r\ntaking up her work. The “call” is considered a grave calamity.\r\nOrdinarily these women are of the lower class. They are frequently\r\nworshippers of Buddha, after the gross and debased cult which exists\r\nin Korea, and place his picture along with those of the dæmons in the\r\nsmall temples in their houses.\r\n\r\nTaking the male and female Shamanate together, the _Shamans_ possess\r\nimmense power over the people, from the clever and ambitious Korean\r\nqueen, who resorted constantly to the _Pan-su_ on behalf of the future\r\nof the Crown Prince, down to the humblest peasant family. They are\r\nin intimate contact with the people in all times of difficulty and\r\naffliction, their largest claims are conceded, and they are seldom out\r\nof employment.\r\n\r\nThe dæmons whose professed servants the _Shamans_ are, and whose\r\nyoke lies heavy on Korea, are rarely even mythical beings, who\r\nmight possibly have existed in human shape. They are legion. They\r\ndwell in all matter and pervade all space. They are a horde without\r\norganization, destitute of genus, species, and classification, created\r\nout of Korean superstitions, debased Buddhism, and Chinese mythical\r\nlegend. There have been no native attempts at their arrangement, and\r\nwhatever has been done in this direction is due to the labors of Mr.\r\nG. H. Jones and Dr. Landis, from whose lists a few may be chosen as\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nThe _O-bang-chang-kun_ are five, and some of the more important preside\r\nover East Heaven, South, West, North, and Middle. In _Shaman’s_ houses\r\nshrines are frequently erected to them, bearing their collective\r\nname to which worship is paid. They are held in high honor and are\r\nprominent in _Pan-su_ rites. At the entrance of many villages on the\r\nsouth branch of the Han the villagers represent them by posts with tops\r\nrudely carved into hideous caricatures of humanity, which are ofttimes\r\ndecorated with straw tassels, and receive offerings of rice and fruit\r\nas village protectors.\r\n\r\nThe _Shin-chang_ are dæmon generals said to number 80,000, each one\r\nat the head of a dæmon host. They fill the earth and air, and are\r\nspecially associated with the _Pan-su_, who are capable of summoning\r\nthem by magic formulæ to aid in divination and exorcism. Shrines to\r\nsingle members of this militant host occur frequently in Central Korea,\r\neach one containing a highly-colored daub of a gigantic mediæval\r\nwarrior, and the words, “I, the Spirit--dwell in this place.”\r\n\r\nThe Tok-gabi are the most dreaded and detested, as well as the best\r\nknown of all the dæmon _horde_. Yet they seem nondescripts, and careful\r\nand patient examination has only succeeded in relegating them to the\r\nclass of such myths as the Will o’ the Wisp, and Jack o’ Lantern,\r\nelevated, however, in Korea to the status of genuine devils with\r\nfetishes of their own. They are regarded as having human originals in\r\nthe souls of those who have come to sudden or violent ends. They are\r\nbred on execution grounds and battlefields, and wherever men perish in\r\nnumbers. They go in overwhelming legions, and not only dwell in empty\r\nhouses but in inhabited villages, terrifying the inhabitants. They it\r\nwas who, by taking possession of the fine Audience Hall of the Mulberry\r\nPalace in Seoul, rendered the buildings untenable, frightful tales\r\nbeing told and believed of nocturnal dæmon orgies amidst those doleful\r\nsplendors. People leave their houses and build new ones because of\r\nthem. Their fetishes may be such things as a _mapu’s_ hat or the cloak\r\nof a _yamen_ clerk, rotten with age and dirt, enshrined under a small\r\nstraw booth. Besides the devilry attributed to the _Tok-gabi_ they are\r\naccused of many pranks, such as placing the covers of iron pots inside\r\nthem, and pounding doors and windows all night, till it seems as if\r\nthey would be smashed, yet leaving no trace of their work.\r\n\r\nThe actually unclean spirits, the _Sagem_, the criminal class of the\r\nvast “_Dæmoneon_,” infest Korean life like vermin, wandering about\r\nembracing every opportunity of hurting and molesting man. Against these\r\nboth _Pan-su_ and _mu-tang_ wage continual war by their enchantments,\r\nthe _Pan-su_ by their exorcisms, either driving them off or catching\r\nthem and burying them in disgrace, while the _mu-tang_ propitiate them\r\nand send them off in honor.\r\n\r\nAnother great group of dæmons is the _San-Shin Ryöng_--the spirits of\r\nthe mountains. I found their shrines in all the hilly country, along\r\nboth branches of the Han, by springs and streams, and specially under\r\nthe shade of big trees, and on _ampelopsis_ covered rocks, a flat rock\r\nbeing a specially appropriate site from its suitability for an altar,\r\nand thus specially “fortunate.” The dæmon who is the tutelary spirit of\r\n_ginseng_, the most valuable export of Korea, is greatly honored. So\r\nalso is the patron dæmon of deer hunters, who is invariably represented\r\nin his shrine as a fierce looking elderly man in official dress riding\r\na tiger. Surrounding him are altars to his harem, and there are also\r\nfemale dæmons, mountain spirits, who are pictured as women, frequently\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nThe tiger which abounds in Central and Northern Korea is understood\r\nto be the confidential servant of these mountain dæmons, and when he\r\ncommits depredations, the people, believing the dæmon of the vicinity\r\nto be angry, hurry with offerings to his nearest shrine. The Koreans\r\nconsider it a good omen when they see in their dreams the mountain\r\ndæmon, either as represented in his shrine, or under the form of his\r\nrepresentative, the tiger. These mountain dæmons are specially sought\r\nby recluses, and people ofttimes retire into solitary mountain glens,\r\nwhere by bathing, fasting, and offerings they strive to gain their\r\nfavor. These spirits, believed to be very powerful, are much feared\r\nby farmers, and by villagers living near high mountains. They think\r\nthat if when they are out on the hillsides cutting wood they forgot to\r\ncast the first spoonful of rice from the bowl to the dæmon, they will\r\nbe punished by a severe fall or cut, or some other accident. These\r\nspirits are capricious and exacting, and for every little neglect take\r\nvengeance on the members of a farmer’s household or on his crops or\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nThe _Long-shin_, or Dragon dæmons, are water spirits. They have no\r\nshrines, but the _Shamans_ conduct a somewhat expensive ceremony by the\r\nsea and riversides in which they present them with offerings for the\r\nrepose of the souls of drowned persons.\r\n\r\nThe phase of Dæmonolatry which is the most common and the first to\r\narrest a traveller’s attention is also the most obscure. The _Söng\r\nWhoang Dan_ (altar of the Holy Prince), the great Korean altar, rudely\r\nbuilt of loose stones under the shade of a tree, from the branches of\r\nwhich are suspended such worthless _ex votos_ as strips of paper,\r\nrags, small bags of rice, old clouts, and worn-out shoes, look less\r\nlike an altar than a decaying cairn of large size.[58] A peculiarity\r\nof the _Söng Whoang Dan_ is that they are generally supposed to be\r\nfrequented by various dæmons, though occasionally they are crowned\r\nby a shrine to a single spirit. Korean travellers make their special\r\nplea to a travellers’ dæmon who is supposed to be found there, and\r\nhang up strips of their goods in the overhanging branches, and the\r\nsailor likewise regards the altar as the shrine of his guardian dæmon,\r\nand bestows a bit of old rope upon it. Further than this, when some\r\nspecial bird or beast has destroyed insects injurious to agriculture,\r\nthe people erect a shrine to it on these altars or cairns, on which may\r\nfrequently be seen the rude daub of a bird or animal.\r\n\r\nTwo spirits, the _To-ti-chi Shin_ and the _Chon-Shin_, are regarded\r\nas local dæmons, and occupy spots on the mountain sides. They receive\r\nworship at funerals, and a sacrifice similar to that offered in\r\nancestral worship is made to them before the body is laid in the earth.\r\nTwo _Shamans_ preside over this, and one of them intones a ritual\r\nbelonging to the occasion. The shrine of _Chon-Shin_ is a local temple,\r\na small decayed erection usually found outside villages. In Seoul he\r\nhas a mud or plaster shrine in which his picture is enshrined with much\r\nceremony, but in the country his fetish is usually a straw booth set up\r\nover a pair of old shoes under a tree. For the observances connected\r\nwith him all the residents in a neighborhood are taxed. He may be\r\nregarded as the chief dæmon in every district, and it is in his honor\r\nthat the _mu-tang_ celebrate the triennial festival formerly described.\r\n\r\nThe Household Spirits are the last division of the Korean _Dæmoneon_.\r\nSöng Ju, the spirit of the ridge pole who presides over the home,\r\noccupies a sort of imperial position with regard to the other household\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nHis fetish consists of some sheets of paper and a paper bag containing\r\nas many spoonfuls of rice as the household is years old on the day when\r\nthe _mu-tang_ suspends it to the crossbeam of the house.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of his inauguration was conducted as follows in the case\r\nof a householder who was at once a scholar, a noble, a rich man, and\r\nthe headman of a large village. A lucky day having been chosen by\r\ndivination, the noble, after grading the site for his house, erected\r\nthe framework, and with great ceremony attached such a fetish,\r\nduly prepared by the _Pan-su_, to the crossbeam. Prostrations and\r\ninvocations marked this stage. When the building of the house was\r\ncompleted, an auspicious day was again chosen by divination, and a\r\ngreat ceremony was performed by the _mu-tang_ for the enshrining of\r\nthe dæmon in the home. The _mu-tang_ arranged the ceremonial and\r\nprepared the offerings, and then with a special wand only used on\r\nthese occasions, called the spirit who is supposed to be under her\r\ncontrol, and returning to the house solemnly enshrined him in the\r\nfetish, to which it is correct to add a fresh sheet of paper every\r\nyear. After _Söng Ju_ was supposed to have had time to feed spiritually\r\non the offerings, they were placed before the guests, and a great\r\nentertainment followed.\r\n\r\n_Ti Ju_, or the lord of the site, is the next great dæmon, but\r\ninvestigations regarding him have been very resultless. Little is\r\nknown, except that offerings are presented to him at some spot on the\r\npremises, but not inside the house. These offerings, which are of food,\r\nare made on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 15th of each month. This food is\r\nafterwards eaten by the family, and a continual offering is represented\r\nby a bit of cloth or a scrap of old rope. His fetish is a bundle of\r\nstraw, empty inside, placed on three sticks, but in some circumstances\r\na flower pot with some rice inside is substituted.\r\n\r\n_Op Ju_, the kitchen dæmon, is the third of the trio which is\r\npermanently attached to the house. His fetish is a piece of cloth or\r\npaper nailed to the wall above the cooking place.\r\n\r\nAfter these come the dæmons who are attached to the family and not\r\nthe house, the first of them being _Cho Wang_, a spirit of the\r\nconstellation of the Great Bear, a very popular spirit. His shrine is\r\noutside the wall, and his fetish, to which worship is paid, is a gourd\r\nfull of cloth and paper. _Cho Wang_ is often the dæmon familiar of a\r\n_mu-tang_.\r\n\r\n_Ti Ju_, No. 2, is the fate or luck of the family, and every household\r\nis ambitions to secure him. His fetish is a straw booth three feet\r\nhigh, in which is a flower pot containing some rice covered with a\r\nstone and paper.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the family dæmons is an ancient and historical dæmon,\r\n_Chöi Sok_, who is regarded as the grandfather of _San Chin-chöi Sök_,\r\nthe dæmon of nativity. His fetish, unless it becomes rotten or is\r\naccidentally destroyed, descends from father to son. He has several\r\nfetishes, and when he receives homage at the Triennial Festival, the\r\n_mu-tang_ puts on the dress of an official. He is the dæmon of nativity\r\nand the giver of posterity, and is a triple dæmon. Korean women hearing\r\nof the Christian Trinity have been known to say that _San chin_ enables\r\nthem to understand the mystery! He is believed to have the control of\r\nall children up to the age of four. He avenges ceremonial defilement\r\nsuch as the sight by an expectant mother of a mourner or a dead object,\r\nand outside a house where there has been a recent birth, a notice\r\nwarning visitors not to enter is often put up on his behalf. He imposes\r\non plebeian mothers a period of seclusion for twenty-one days after a\r\nbirth, but for noble mothers one hundred days, for which period the\r\nrays of the sun are rigidly excluded from both mother and child.\r\n\r\n_Pa-mul_, the dæmon of riches, is the Japanese _Daikoku_ and the\r\nBritish _Mammon_. He is worshipped in the granary, and thanks are\r\noffered to him as well as petitions. His fetish is a paste jar set up\r\non two decorated bags of rice. A man in Chemulpo, now a Christian,\r\nhad a very famous fetish, which was originally a jar of beans, but\r\nthese were changed into clear water, and a mysterious improvement in\r\nthe fortunes of the family set in from that date, the jar becoming an\r\nobject of grateful worship. One day it was found broken and the water\r\nlost, and from that time his fortunes declined.\r\n\r\nKol-lip is the dæmon who takes charge of the external fortunes of the\r\nfamily, and is also the mercury of the household dæmons. His fetish is\r\nenshrined over the gate-house, and consists of a mass of rubbish, old\r\nstraw shoes for wearing on his travels, _cash_ for spiritual funds,\r\nand a fragment of grass cloth for travelling outfit. There is also the\r\ndæmon of the gate whose fetish hangs over the entrance.\r\n\r\nDr. Landis has classified the Korean dæmons as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spirits high in rank_\r\n\r\n  1. Spirits of the Heavens.\r\n  2. Spirits of the Earth.\r\n  3. Spirits of the Mountains and Hills.\r\n  4. Spirits of the Dragons.\r\n  5. Guardian Spirits of the District.\r\n  6.

Spirits which\r\n cause persons to meet either a violent death or to die young. Any one\r\n who has died before reaching a cycle (_i.e._ 60 years) is supposed\r\n to have died owing to the influence of one of these spirits. It is\r\n needless to say that they are all evil.\r\n\r\n 23. Spirits which cause tigers to eat men.\r\n\r\n 24. Spirits which cause men to die on the road.\r\n\r\n 25. Spirits which roam about the house causing all sorts of calamities.\r\n\r\n 26. Spirits which cause a man to die away from home.\r\n\r\n 27.

Spirits which cause men to die by cholera.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the efficacy of the performances of the _mu-tang_ is\r\nenormous. In sickness the very poor half starve themselves and pawn\r\ntheir clothing to pay for her exorcisms. Her power has been riveted\r\nupon the country for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. The order is\r\nsaid to date back 4,000 years, to have been called in China, where it\r\nwas under official regulations, _mu-ham_. Five hundred years ago the\r\nfounder of the present dynasty prohibited _mu-tang_ from living within\r\nthe walls of Seoul--hence their houses and temples are found outside\r\nthe city walls.\r\n\r\nWomen are not _mu-tang_ by birth, but of late years it has become\r\ncustomary for the girl children of a sorceress to go out with her and\r\nlearn her arts, which is tending to give the profession a hereditary\r\naspect. It is now recruited partly in this fashion, partly from among\r\nhysterical girls, and partly for a livelihood, but outside of these\r\nsources, a dæmon may take possession of any woman, wife, maid, or\r\nwidow, rich or poor, plebeian or patrician, and compel her to serve\r\nhim. At the beginning of the possession she becomes either slightly\r\nor seriously ill, and her illness may last four weeks or three years,\r\nduring which time she dreams of a dragon, a rainbow, peach trees in\r\nblossom, or of a man in armor who is suddenly metamorphosed into an\r\nanimal. Under the influence of these dreams she becomes like an insane\r\nperson, and when awake sees many curious things, and before long speaks\r\nas an oracle of the spirits.\r\n\r\nShe then informs her family that messengers from Heaven, Earth, and\r\nthe Lightning have informed her that if she is not allowed to practise\r\nexorcism, they or their domestic animals will die. Should they insist\r\non secluding her, her illness shortly terminates fatally. If a daughter\r\nof a noble family becomes possessed, they probably make away with her,\r\nin the idea that if madness takes this turn, the disgrace would be\r\nindelible.\r\n\r\nBut things usually go smoothly, and on being allowed to have her own\r\nway the first thing she does is to go into a vacant room and fill it\r\nwith flowers as an offering to the dæmons. Then she must obtain the\r\nclothing and professional paraphernalia of a deceased _mu-tang_. The\r\nclothing may be destroyed after the dæmon has taken full possession of\r\nhis new recruit, but the drums and other instruments must be retained.\r\nAfter the possessions of the deceased _mu-tang_ have been bestowed on\r\nthe new one who claims them, she proceeds to exorcise such bad spirits\r\nas may be infesting the donor’s house, so as to enable his family to\r\nlive in peace, after which she writes his name on a tablet, and placing\r\nit in a small room invokes blessings on him for three years.\r\n\r\nAfter this ceremonial has been observed the _mu-tang_, fully possessed\r\nby a dæmon, begins to exercise her very important and lucrative\r\nprofession. Her equipment consists of a number of dresses, some of them\r\nvery costly, a drum shaped like an hour-glass, four feet in length,\r\ncopper cymbals, a copper rod, with tinklers suspended from it by copper\r\nchains, strips of silk and paper banners which float round her as she\r\ndances, fans, umbrellas, wands, images of men and animals, brass or\r\ncopper gongs, and a pair of telescope-shaped baskets for scratching,\r\nchiefly used in cases of cholera, which disease is supposed to result\r\nfrom rats climbing about in the human interior. The scratching sound\r\nmade by a peculiar use of these baskets, which resembles the noise made\r\nby cats, is expected to scare and drive away these rodents.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of exorcism are that the _mu-tang_ must subject\r\nherself to certain restraints varying from a month to three days,\r\nduring which time she must abstain from flesh and fish, and must\r\npartially fast. Before an exorcism ashes are steeped in water and the\r\nsorceress takes of this, and sprinkles it as she walks round the house,\r\nafterwards taking pure water and going through the same ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe almost fabulous sums squeezed by the _mu-tang_ out of the people\r\nof Seoul are given in a previous chapter. It will be observed that\r\nin Korea sickness is always associated with dæmoniacal possession,\r\nand that the services of the _Pan-su_, or _mu-tang_, are always\r\nrequisitioned. European medicine and surgery are the most successful\r\nassailants of this barbarous and degrading system which holds the\r\nwhole nation, in many respects highly civilized, in bondage, and the\r\ninfluence of both as practised in connection with “Medical Missions” is\r\ntending increasingly in the direction of emancipation.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to say how far the _mu-tang_ is self-deceived.\r\nIn some of her dances, especially in one in which she exorcises “The\r\ndæmon of the Yi family,” one of the most powerful and malignant of the\r\ndæmon hierarchy, she works herself into such a delirious frenzy that\r\nshe falls down foaming at the mouth, and death is occasionally the\r\nresult of the frantic excitement.\r\n\r\nThe “Dæmon of the Yi Family” is invoked in every district once in\r\nthree years by the _mu-tang_ in a formula which has been translated\r\nthus--“Oh Master and Mistress of our Kingdom, may you ever exist in\r\npeace. Once in every three years we invoke you with music and dancing.\r\nOh make this house to be peaceful.” If this malignant spirit arrives\r\nat a house he can only be appeased by the death of a man, an ox, or a\r\npig. Therefore when the _mu-tang_ becomes aware that he has come to a\r\nhouse or neighborhood, a pig is at once killed, boiled, and offered\r\nup entire--the exorcist takes two knives and dances a sword dance,\r\nworking herself into a “fine frenzy,” after which a box is made and a\r\nKorean official hat and robes are placed within it, as well as a dress\r\nsuitable for a palace lady. The box is then placed on the top of the\r\nfamily clothes chest, and sacrifices are frequently offered there. This\r\ndæmon is regarded as the spirit of a rebellious Crown Prince, the sole\r\nobject of whose dæmon existence is to injure all with whom he can come\r\ninto contact.\r\n\r\nA man sometimes marries a _mu-tang_, but he is invariably “a fellow of\r\nthe baser sort,” who desires to live in idleness on the earnings of his\r\nwife. If, as is occasionally the case, the _mu-tang_ belongs to a noble\r\nfamily, she is only allowed to exorcise spirits in her own house, and\r\nwhen she dies she is buried in a hole in a mountain-side with the whole\r\nparaphernalia of her profession. Some _mu-tang_ do not go abroad for\r\npurposes of exorcism. These may be regarded as the aristocracy of their\r\nprofession, and many of them are of much repute and live in the suburbs\r\nof Seoul. Those who desire their services send the necessary money and\r\nofferings, and the _mu-tang_ exorcise the spirits in their own houses.\r\n\r\nThe use of straw, ropes, and of pieces of paper resembling the Shinto\r\n_gohei_, during incantations, with a certain similarity between the\r\nShinto and the _Shaman_ ceremonies, might suggest a common origin, but\r\nour knowledge of the Dæmonism of Korea is so completely in its infancy,\r\nthat any speculations as to its kinships can be of little value, and\r\nit is only as a very slight contribution to the sum of knowledge of an\r\nobscure but very interesting subject, that I venture to present these\r\nchapters to my readers.\r\n\r\nThe Koreans, it must be remarked, have no single word for Dæmonism or\r\nShamanism. The only phrase in use to express their belief in dæmons who\r\nrequire to be propitiated is, _Kursin wi han-nan Köt_ (the worship of\r\nSpirits). _Pulto_ is Buddhism, _Yuto_ Confucianism, and _Sönto_ Taoism,\r\nbut the termination _To_, “doctrine,” has not yet been affixed to\r\nDæmonism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] Mr. G. H. Jones suggests the idea that these uncouth heap of\r\nstones were originally munitions of war over which tutelary dæmons were\r\nsupposed to brood, and thinks that the transition to an altar would be\r\na very natural one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nSEOUL IN 1897[59]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when, by the glory of an October full moon, I arrived\r\nfrom Chemulpo at the foot of the rugged slope crowned with the\r\nirregular, lofty, battlemented city wall and picturesque double-roofed\r\ngateway of the Gate of Staunch Loyalty which make the western entrance\r\nto the Korean capital so unique and attractive. An arrangement had\r\nbeen made for the opening of the gate, and after a long parley between\r\nthe faithful Im and the guard, the heavy iron-bolted door creaked\r\nback before the united efforts of ten men, and I entered Seoul, then\r\nunder the authority of Ye Cha Yun, an energetic and enlightened\r\nGovernor, under whose auspices the western part of the city has lost\r\nthe refuse heaps and foulness, with their concomitant odors, which\r\nwere its chief characteristic. In the streets and lanes not a man,\r\ndog, or cat stirred, and not a light glimmered from any casement; but\r\nwhen I reached Chong-dong, the foreign quarter, I observed that the\r\nlower extremity of every road leading in the direction of the Russian\r\nLegation was irregularly guarded by several slouching Korean sentries,\r\ngossiping in knots as they leaned on their rifles.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of my host’s house open on those of the King’s new palace,\r\nand the King and Crown Prince, attended by large retinues, were\r\nconstantly carried through them on their way from their asylum in\r\nthe Russian Legation to perform the customary rites at the spirit\r\nshrine, to which the fragmentary remains of the murdered Queen\r\nhad been removed, to wait until the geomancers could decide on an\r\n“auspicious” site for her grave, the one which had been prepared for\r\nher at an enormous expense some miles outside the city having just been\r\npronounced “unlucky.”\r\n\r\nA few days after my arrival the King went to the Kyeng-wun Palace\r\nto receive a Japanese prince, and courteously arranged to give me\r\nan audience afterwards, to which I went, attended, as on the last\r\noccasion, by the British Legation interpreter. The entrances were\r\nguarded by a number of slouching sentries in Japanese uniforms. Their\r\nhair, which had been cropped at the time of the abolition of the\r\n“topknot,” had grown again, and hung in heavy shocks behind their ears,\r\ngiving them a semi-barbarous appearance. At the second gate I alighted,\r\nno chair being permitted to enter, and walked to a very simple audience\r\nhall, then used for the first time, about 20 feet by 12 feet, of white\r\nwood, with lattice doors and windows, both covered with fine white\r\npaper, and with fine white mats on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe King and Crown Prince, both of whom were in deep mourning, _i.e._\r\nin pure white robes with sleeveless dresses of exquisitely fine buff\r\ngrass-cloth over them, and fine buff crinoline hats, stood together\r\nat the upper end of the room, surrounded by eunuchs, court ladies,\r\nincluding the reigning favorites, the ladies _Pak_ and _Om_, and Court\r\nfunctionaries, all in mourning, the whole giving one an impression of\r\nabsolute spotlessness. The waists of the voluminous white skirts of the\r\nladies, which are a yard too long for them all round, were as high up\r\nas it is possible to place them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEOUL AND PALACE ENCLOSURE.]\r\n\r\nThe King and Crown Prince bowed and smiled. I made the required three\r\ncurtseys to each, and the interpreter adopted the deportment required\r\nby Court etiquette, crouching, looking down, and speaking in an\r\nawe-struck whisper. I had not seen the King for two years, a period of\r\ngreat anxiety and vicissitude to him, but he was not looking worn or\r\nolder, and when I congratulated him on his personal security and the\r\nassumption of his regal functions he expressed himself cordially in\r\nreply, with an air of genuine cheerfulness. In the brief conversation\r\nwhich followed the Crown Prince took part, and showed a fair degree of\r\nintelligence, as well as a much improved physique.\r\n\r\nLater I had two informal audiences of the King in his house in the\r\ncentre of the mass of the new buildings of the Kyeng-wun Palace. It\r\nis a detached Korean dwelling of the best Korean workmanship, with\r\na deep-eaved, tiled roof, the carved beams of which are elaborately\r\npainted, and their terminals decorated with the five-petalled plum\r\nblossom, the dynastic emblem. The house consists of a hall with a\r\n_kang_ floor, divided into one large and two small rooms by sliding and\r\nremovable partitions of fretwork, filled in with fine tissue paper,\r\nthe windows which occupy the greater part of both sides being of the\r\nsame construction. The very small rooms at each end are indicated as\r\nthe sleeping apartments of the King and his son by pale blue silk\r\nmattresses laid upon the fine white mats which cover the whole floor.\r\nThe only furniture was two ten-leaved white screens. The fastenings\r\nof the windows and partitions are of very fine Korean brasswork.\r\nSimplicity could not go further.\r\n\r\nOpposite is the much-adorned spirit shrine of the late Queen, connected\r\nwith the house by a decorated gallery. The inner palace enclosure,\r\nwhere these buildings are, is very small, and behind the King’s house\r\nrises into a stone terrace. Numerous as is the King’s guard, it is\r\nevident that he fears to rely upon it solely, for of two gates leading\r\nfrom his house one opens into quarters occupied by Russian officers,\r\nwho arrived in Seoul in the autumn of 1890, at the King’s request, for\r\npurposes of military organization; and the other into small barracks\r\noccupied by the Russian drill instructors of the Korean army. Through\r\nthe former he could reach the grounds of the English Legation in one\r\nminute, and after his former experiences possibilities of escape must\r\nbe his first consideration. The small buildings of this new palace\r\nwere already crowded like a rabbit warren, and when completed will\r\ncontain over 1,000 people, including the bodyguard, eunuchs, and Court\r\nofficials innumerable, writers, readers, palace ladies, palace women,\r\nand an immense establishment of cooks, runners, servants, and all the\r\nsuperabundant and useless _entourage_ of an Eastern Sovereign, to whom\r\ncrowds and movement represent power. This congeries of buildings was\r\ncarefully guarded, and even the Korean soldier who attended on me was\r\nnot allowed to pass the gate.\r\n\r\nThe King had given me permission to take his photograph for Queen\r\nVictoria, and I was arranging the room for the purpose when the\r\ninterpreter shouted “His Majesty,” and almost before I could step\r\nback and curtsey, the King and Crown Prince entered, followed by the\r\nOfficers of the Household and several of the Ministers, a _posse_ of\r\nthe newfangled police crowding the veranda outside. The Sovereign,\r\nalways courteous, asked if I would like to take one of the portraits\r\nin his royal robes. The rich crimson brocade and the gold embroidered\r\nplastrons on his breast and shoulders became him well, and his pose was\r\nnot deficient in dignity. He took some trouble to arrange the Crown\r\nPrince to the best advantage but the result was unsuccessful. After the\r\noperation was over he examined the different parts of the camera with\r\ninterest, and seemed specially cheerful.\r\n\r\nAt a farewell audience some weeks later the King reverted to the\r\nsubject of a British Minister, accredited solely to Korea; and the\r\ninterpreter added, as an aside, “His Majesty is very anxious about\r\nthis.” He hardly seemed to realize that even if a change in the\r\nrepresentation were contemplated, it could scarcely be carried out\r\nwhile Sir Claude Macdonald, who is accredited to both Courts, remains\r\nMinister at Peking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KING OF KOREA.]\r\n\r\nThe King was for more than a year the guest of the Russian Legation, an\r\narrangement most distasteful to a large number of his subjects, who\r\nnaturally regarded it as a national humiliation that their Sovereign\r\nshould be under the protection of a foreign flag. Rumors of plots for\r\nremoving him to the Palace from which he escaped were rife, and there\r\nwere days on which he feared to visit the Queen’s tablet-house unless\r\nRussian officers walked beside his chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Waeber, the Russian Minister, had then been in Korea twelve\r\nyears. He is an able and faithful servant of Russia. He was trusted\r\nby the King and the whole foreign community, and up to the time of\r\nthe _Hegira_ had been a warm and judicious friend of the Koreans.\r\nHis guidance might have prevented the King from making infamous\r\nappointments and arbitrary arrests, from causelessly removing officials\r\nwho were working well, and from such reckless extravagances as a\r\ncostly Embassy to the European Courts and a foolish increase of the\r\narmy and police force. But he remained passive, allowing the Koreans\r\nto “stew in their own juice,” acting possibly under orders from home\r\nto give Korea “rope enough to hang herself,” a proceeding which might\r\nhereafter give Russia a legitimate excuse for interference. Apart\r\nfrom such instructions, it must remain an inscrutable mystery why so\r\nexcellent a man and so capable a diplomatist when absolutely master of\r\nthe situation neglected to aid the Sovereign with his valuable advice,\r\na course which would have met with the cordial approval of all his\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the liberty which the King has enjoyed at the\r\nRussian Legation and since has not been for the advantage of Korea, and\r\nrecent policy contrasts unfavorably with that pursued during the period\r\nof Japanese ascendency, which, on the whole, was in the direction of\r\nprogress and righteousness.\r\n\r\nOld abuses cropped up daily, Ministers and other favorites sold offices\r\nunblushingly, and when specific charges were made against one of the\r\nKing’s chief favorites, the formal demand for his prosecution was met\r\nby making him Vice-Minister of Education! The King, freed from the\r\ncontrol of the mutinous officers and usurping Cabinet of 8th October,\r\n1895, from the Queen’s strong though often unscrupulous guidance, and\r\nfrom Japanese ascendency, and finding himself personally safe, has\r\nreverted to some of the worst traditions of his dynasty, and in spite\r\nof certain checks his edicts are again law and his will absolute.\r\nAnd it is a will at the mercy of any designing person who gets hold\r\nof him and can work upon his fears and his desire for money--of the\r\nladies _Pak_ and _Om_, who assisted him in his flight, and of favorites\r\nand sycophants low and many, who sell or bestow on members of their\r\nfamilies offices they have little difficulty in obtaining from his\r\npliable good nature. With an ample Civil List and large perquisites he\r\nis the most impecunious person in his dominions, for in common with all\r\nwho occupy official positions in Korea he is surrounded by hosts of\r\ngrasping parasites and hangers-on, for ever clamoring “Give, Give.”\r\n\r\nMen were thrown into prison without reason, some of the worst of the\r\n_canaille_ were made Ministers of State, the murderer of _Kim Ok-yun_\r\nwas appointed Master of Ceremony, and a convicted criminal, a man whose\r\nlife has been one career of sordid crime, was made Minister of Justice.\r\nConsequent upon the surreptitious sale of offices, the seizure of\r\nrevenue on its way to the Treasury, the appointment of men to office\r\nfor a few days, to give them “rank” and to enable them to quarter on\r\nthe public purse a host of impecunious relations and friends, and the\r\ncustom among high officials of resigning office on the occasion of\r\nthe smallest criticism, the administration is in a state of constant\r\nchaos, and the ofttimes well-meaning but always vacillating Sovereign,\r\nabsolute without an idea of how to rule, the sport of favorites usually\r\nunworthy, who work upon his amiability, the prey of greedy parasites,\r\nand occasionally the tool of foreign adventurers, paralyzes all good\r\ngovernment by destroying the elements of permanence, and renders\r\neconomy and financial reform difficult and spasmodic by consenting to\r\nschemes of reckless extravagance urged upon him by interested schemers.\r\nNever has the King made such havoc of reigning as since he regained his\r\nfreedom under the roof of the Russian Embassy.\r\n\r\nI regret to have to write anything to the King’s disadvantage.\r\nPersonally I have found him truly courteous and kind, as he is to all\r\nforeigners. He has amiable characteristics, and I believe a certain\r\namount of patriotic feeling. But as he is an all-important element\r\nof the present and future condition of Korea, it would be misleading\r\nand dishonest to pass over without remark such characteristics of\r\nhis character and rule as are disastrous to Korea, bearing in mind\r\nin extenuation of them that he is the product of five centuries of a\r\ndynastic tradition which has practically taught that public business\r\nand the interests of the country mean for the Sovereign simply getting\r\noffices and pay for favorites, and that statesmanship consists in\r\nplaying off one Minister against another.\r\n\r\nNovelties in the Seoul streets were the fine physique and long gray\r\nuniforms of Colonel Putiata and his subordinates, three officers and\r\nten drill-instructors, who arrived to drill and discipline the Korean\r\narmy, the American military adviser having proved a failure, while the\r\ntroops drilled by the Japanese were mutinous and rapacious, and the\r\nJapanese drill-instructors had retired with the rest of the _régime_.\r\nThis “Military Commission” was doing its work with characteristic\r\nvigor and thoroughness, and the flat-faced, pleasant-looking,\r\nnon-commissioned officers, with their drilled slouch, serviceable\r\nuniforms, and long boots were always an attraction to the crowd. A\r\nnovelty, too, was the sight of the Korean cadet _corps_ of thirty-seven\r\nyoung men of good families and seven officers, marching twice daily\r\nbetween the drill ground of the Korean troops close to the Kyeng-pok\r\nPalace and their own barracks behind the Russian Legation, with drums\r\nbeating and colors flying. These young men, who are to receive a two\r\nyears’ military education from Russian officers, are under severe\r\ndiscipline, and were greatly surprised to find that servants were a\r\nprohibited luxury, and that their training involved the cleaning and\r\nkeeping bright of their own rifles and accoutrements, and hard work for\r\nmany hours of the day. The army now consists of 4,300 men in Seoul,\r\n800 of whom are drilled as a bodyguard for the King, and 1,200 in the\r\nprovinces, in Japanese uniforms, and equipped (so far as they go) with\r\n3,000 Berdan rifles presented by Russia to Korea. The drill and words\r\nof command are Russian.\r\n\r\nA standing army of 2,000 men would have been sufficient for all\r\npurposes in Korea, and as far as her need goes an army of 6,000 is an\r\nunblushing extravagance and a heavy drain on her resources. It is most\r\nprobable that a force drilled and armed by Russia, accustomed to obey\r\nRussian orders and animated by an intense hereditary hatred of Japan,\r\nwould prove a valuable _corps d’armée_ to Russia in the event of war\r\nwith that ambitious and restless empire.\r\n\r\nThe old _kesu_ or _gens d’armes_ with their picturesque dresses and\r\nlong red plumes are now only to be seen, and that rarely, in attendance\r\non officials of the Korean Government. Seoul is now policed, much\r\noverpoliced, for it has a force of 1,200 men, when a quarter of that\r\nnumber would be sufficient for its orderly population. Everywhere\r\nnumbers of slouching men on and off duty, in Japanese semi-military\r\nuniforms, with shocks of hair behind their ears and swords in\r\nnickel-plated scabbards by their sides, suggest useless and extravagant\r\nexpenditure. The soldiers and police, by an unwise arrangement made\r\nby the Japanese, and now scarcely possible to alter, are enormously\r\noverpaid, the soldiers receiving five dollars and a half a month, “all\r\nfound,” and the police from eight to ten, only finding their food. The\r\nKorean army is about the most highly paid in the world. The average\r\nKorean in his great baggy trousers, high, perishable, broad-brimmed\r\nhat, capacious sleeves, and long flapping white coat, is usually a\r\ndocile and harmless man; but European clothes and arms transform him\r\ninto a truculent, insubordinate, and ofttimes brutal person, without\r\ncivic sympathies or patriotism, greedy of power and spoil. Detachments\r\nof soldiers scattered through the country were a terror to the people\r\nfrom their brutality and marauding propensities early in 1897, and\r\nunless Russian officers are more successful than their predecessors\r\nin disciplining the raw material, an overpaid army, too large for\r\nthe requirements of the country, may prove a source of weakness and\r\nfrequent disorder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOREAN CADET CORPS AND RUSSIAN DRILL INSTRUCTORS.]\r\n\r\nSeoul in many parts, specially in the direction of the south and west\r\ngates, was literally not recognizable. Streets, with a minimum width of\r\n55 feet, with deep stone-lined channels on both sides, bridged by stone\r\nslabs, had replaced the foul alleys, which were breeding-grounds of\r\ncholera. Narrow lanes had been widened, slimy runlets had been paved,\r\nroadways were no longer “free coups” for refuse, bicyclists “scorched”\r\nalong broad, level streets, “express wagons” were looming in the near\r\nfuture, preparations were being made for the building of a French\r\nhotel in a fine situation, shops with glass fronts had been erected in\r\nnumbers, an order forbidding the throwing of refuse into the streets\r\nwas enforced,--refuse matter is now removed from the city by official\r\nscavengers, and Seoul, from having been the foulest is now on its way\r\nto being the cleanest city of the Far East!\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary metamorphosis was the work of four months, and is\r\ndue to the energy and capacity of the Chief Commissioner of Customs,\r\nably seconded by the capable and intelligent Governor of the city,\r\nYe Cha Yun, who had acquainted himself with the working of municipal\r\naffairs in Washington, and who with a rare modesty refused to take any\r\ncredit to himself for the city improvements, saying that it was all due\r\nto Mr. M’Leavy Brown.\r\n\r\nOld Seoul, with its festering alleys, its winter accumulations of every\r\nspecies of filth, its ankle-deep mud and its foulness, which lacked,\r\nthe redeeming element of picturesqueness, is being fast improved off\r\nthe face of the earth. Yet it is chiefly a restoration, for the dark,\r\nnarrow alleys which lingered on till the autumn of 1896 were but the\r\nresult of gradual encroachments on broad roadways, the remains of the\r\nmarginal channels of which were discovered.\r\n\r\nWhat was done (and is being done) was to pull down the houses,\r\ncompensate their owners, restore the old channels, and insist that the\r\nhouses should be rebuilt at a uniform distance behind them. Along the\r\nfine broad streets thus restored tiled roofs have largely replaced\r\nthatch, in many cases the lower parts of the walls have been rebuilt\r\nof stone instead of wattle, and attempts at decoration and neatness\r\nare apparent in many of the house and shop fronts, while many of the\r\nsmoke-holes, which vomit forth the smoke of the _kang_ fires directly\r\ninto the street, are now fitted with glittering chimneys, constructed\r\nout of American kerosene tins.\r\n\r\nSome miles of broad streets are now available as promenades, and\r\nare largely taken advantage of; business looked much brisker than\r\nformerly, the shops made more display, and there was an air of greater\r\nprosperity, which has been taken advantage of by the Hong-Kong and\r\nShanghai Bank, which has opened a branch at Chemulpo, and will probably\r\nerelong appear in the capital.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, only in the making of broad thoroughfares that the\r\nimprovement consists. Very many of the narrow lanes have been widened,\r\ntheir roadways curved and gravelled, and stone gutters have been built\r\nalong the sides, in some cases by the people themselves. Along with\r\nmuch else the pungent, peculiar odor of Seoul has vanished. Sanitary\r\nregulations are enforced, and civilization has reached such a height\r\nthat the removal of the snow from the front of the houses is compulsory\r\non all householders. So great is the change that I searched in vain for\r\nany remaining representative slum which I might photograph for this\r\nchapter as an illustration of Seoul in 1894. It must be remarked,\r\nhowever, that the capital is being reconstructed on Korean lines, and\r\nis not being Europeanized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH STREET, SEOUL.]\r\n\r\nChong-dong, however, the quarter devoted to Foreign Legations,\r\nConsulates, and Mission agencies, would have nearly ceased to be\r\nKorean had not the King set down the Kyeng-won Palace with its crowded\r\noutbuildings in the midst of the foreign residences. Most of the\r\nnative inhabitants have been bought out. Wide roads with foreign shops\r\nhave been constructed. The French have built a Legation on a height,\r\nwhich vies in grandeur with that of Russia, and the American Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Mission has finished a large red brick church, which, like\r\nthe Roman Cathedral, can be seen from all quarters.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque Peking Pass, up and down whose narrow, rugged pathway\r\ngenerations of burdened baggage animals toiled and suffered, and which\r\nhad seen the splendors of successive Chinese Imperial Envoys at the\r\naccession of the Korean Kings, has lost its identity. Its rock ledges,\r\nholes, and boulders have disappeared--the rocky gash has been widened,\r\nand the sides chiselled into smoothness, and under the auspices of the\r\nRussian Minister a broad road, with retaining walls and fine culverts,\r\nnow carries the traffic over the lowered height.\r\n\r\nMany other changes were noticeable. The Tai-won Kun, for so many\r\nyears one of the chief figures in Korean politics, was practically a\r\nprisoner in his own palace. The Eastern and Western Palaces, with their\r\nenormous accommodation and immense pleasure-grounds, were deserted,\r\nand were already beginning to decay. The Japanese soldiers had vacated\r\nthe barracks so long occupied by them close to the Kyeng-pok Palace,\r\nand, reduced to the modest numbers of a Legation guard, were quartered\r\nin the Japanese settlement; parties of missionaries who had hived off\r\nfrom Chong-dong were occupying groups of houses in various parts of the\r\ncapital, and there was a singular “boom” in schools, accompanied by a\r\nmilitary craze, which affected not the scholars only, but the boys of\r\nSeoul generally.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remarked in connection with education in Korea that so\r\nlately as the close of 1896 a book, called _Confucianist Scholars’\r\nHandbook of the Latitudes and Longitudes_, had been edited by Sin\r\nKi Sun, Minister of Education, prefaced by two Councillors of the\r\nEducation Department, and published at Government expense, in which the\r\nfollowing sentences occur:--\r\n\r\nP. 52: “Europe is too far away from the centre of civilization, _i.e._\r\nthe Middle Kingdom; hence Russians, Turks, English, French, Germans,\r\nand Belgians look more like birds and beasts than men, and their\r\nlanguages sound like the chirping of fowls.”\r\n\r\nAgain: “According to the views of recent generations, what westerners\r\ncall the Christian Religion is vulgar, shallow, and erroneous, and is\r\nan instance of the vileness of Barbarian customs, which are not worthy\r\nof serious discussion.... They worship the heavenly spirits, but do not\r\nsacrifice to parents, they insult heaven in every way, and overturn the\r\nsocial relations. This is truly a type of Barbarian vileness, and is\r\nnot worthy of treatment in our review of foreign customs, especially as\r\nat this time the religion is somewhat on the wane.\r\n\r\n“Europeans have planted their spawn in every country of the globe\r\nexcept China. All of them honor this religion (!), but we are surprised\r\nto find that the Chinese scholars and people have not escaped\r\ncontamination by it.”\r\n\r\nOn p. 42 it is said: “Of late the so-called _Ye Su Kyo_ (Christianity)\r\nhas been trying to contaminate the world with its barbarous teachings.\r\nIt deceives the masses by its stories of Heaven and Hell: it interferes\r\nwith the rites of ancestral worship, and interdicts the custom of\r\nbowing before the gods of Heaven and Earth. These are the ravings of a\r\ndisordered intellect, and are not worth discussing.”\r\n\r\nP. 50: “How grand and glorious is the Empire of China, the Middle\r\nKingdom! She is the largest and richest in the world. The grandest men\r\nof the world have all come from the Middle Empire.”\r\n\r\nThis tirade from an official pen was thought worthy of a remonstrance\r\nfrom the foreign representatives.\r\n\r\nThe graceful _Pai-low_, near the Peking Pass, at which generations of\r\nKorean kings had publicly acknowledged Chinese suzerainty by awaiting\r\nthere the Imperial Envoy who came to invest them with regal rights, was\r\nremoved, and during my sojourn the foundation of an arch to commemorate\r\nthe assumption of Independence by Korea in January, 1895, was laid near\r\nthe same spot, in presence of a vast concourse of white-robed men. An\r\nIndependence Club, with a disused Royal Pavilion near the stumps of the\r\n_Pai-low_ for its Club House, had been established to commemorate and\r\nconserve the national autonomy, and though the entrance fee is high,\r\nhad already a membership of 2,000.\r\n\r\nAfter a number of patriotic speeches had been made on the occasion\r\nof the laying of the foundation of the independence arch, the Club\r\nentertained the Foreign Legations and all the foreign residents at\r\na _récherché_ “collation” in this building; speeches were made both\r\nby Koreans and the Foreign Representatives, and an extraordinary\r\ninnovation was introduced. Waiters were dispensed with, and the\r\nCommittee of the Club, the Governor of Seoul, and several of the\r\nMinisters of State themselves attended upon the guests with much grace\r\nand courtesy.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important events in Seoul was the establishment in\r\nApril, 1896, by Dr. Jaisohn of the _Independent_, a two-page tri-weekly\r\nnewspaper in English and the Korean script, enlarged early in 1897\r\nto four pages, and published separately in each language. Only those\r\nwho have formed some idea of the besotted ignorance of the Korean\r\nconcerning current events in his own country, and of the credulity\r\nwhich makes him the victim of every rumor set afloat in the capital,\r\ncan appreciate the significance of this step and its probable effect\r\nin enlightening the people, and in creating a public opinion which\r\nshall sit in judgment on regal and official misdeeds. It is already\r\nfulfilling an important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them\r\ninto daylight, and is creating a desire for rational education and\r\nreasonable reform, and is becoming something of a terror to evil-doers.\r\nDr. Jaisohn (So Chia P’il) is a Korean gentleman educated in America,\r\nand has the welfare of his country thoroughly at heart.\r\n\r\nThe sight of newsboys passing through the streets with bundles of a\r\nnewspaper in _En-mum_ under their arms, and of men reading them in\r\ntheir shops, is among the novelties of 1897. Besides the _Independent_,\r\nthere are now in Seoul two weeklies in _En-mun_ the _Korean Christian\r\nAdvocate_, and the _Christian News_; and the Korean Independence Club\r\npublishes a monthly magazine, _The Chosen_, dealing with politics,\r\nscience, and foreign news, which has 2,000 subscribers. Seoul has also\r\na paper, the _Kanjo Shimbo_, or _Seoul News_, in mixed Japanese and\r\nKorean script, published on alternate days, and there are newspapers in\r\nthe Japanese language, both in Fusan and Chemulpo. All these, and the\r\nadmirable _Korean Repository_, are the growth of the last three years.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of combination, by which in Korea as in China the weak\r\nfind some measure of protection against the strong, is being turned\r\nto useful account. This _Kyei_, or principle of association, which\r\nrepresents one of the most noteworthy features of Korea, develops\r\ninto insurance companies, mutual benefit associations, money-lending\r\nsyndicates, tontines, marriage and burial clubs, great trading guilds,\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\nWith its innumerable associations, only a few of which I have alluded\r\nto, Korean life is singularly complex; and the Korean business world\r\nis far more fully organized than ours, nearly all the traders in the\r\ncountry being members of guilds, powerfully bound together, and having\r\nthe common feature of mutual helpfulness in time of need. This habit\r\nof united action, and the measure of honesty which is essential to the\r\nsuccess of combined undertakings, supply the framework on which various\r\njoint-stock companies are being erected, among which one of the most\r\nimportant is a tannery. Korean hides have hitherto been sent to Japan\r\nto be manufactured, owing to caste and superstitious prejudices against\r\nworking in leather. The establishment of this company, which brought\r\nover Japanese instructors to teach the methods of manufacture, has not\r\nonly made an end of a foolish prejudice, in the capital at least, but\r\nis opening a very lucrative industry, and others are following.\r\n\r\nAs may be expected in an Oriental country, the administration of law\r\nin Korea is on the whole infamous. It may be said that a body of law\r\nhas yet to be created, as well as the judges who shall administer it\r\nequably. A mixed Committee of Revision has been appointed, but the\r\nKorean members show a marked tendency to drop off, and no legal reform,\r\nsolely the work of foreigners, would carry weight with the people. Mr.\r\nGreathouse, a capable lawyer and legal adviser to the Law Department,\r\nhas been able to prevent some infamous transactions, but on the whole\r\nthe Seoul Law Court does little more than administer injustice and\r\nreceive bribes. Of the two Law Courts of the capital the Supreme Court,\r\nunder the supervision of the Minister and Vice-Minister of Justice,\r\nand in which the foreign adviser sits with the judges to advise in\r\nimportant cases, is the most hopeful; yet one of the most disgraceful\r\nof late appointments has been in connection with this department. The\r\noutrageous decisions, the gross bribery, and the actual atrocities of\r\nthe Seoul Court are likely to bring about its abolition, and I will not\r\nenlarge upon them.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking changes introduced into the Seoul of 1897 is\r\nthe improvement in the prison, which is greatly owing to Mr. A. B.\r\nStripling, formerly of the Shanghai Police, who, occupying a position\r\nas adviser to the Police Department, is carrying out prison reforms,\r\noriginally suggested by the Japanese, in a humane and enlightened\r\nmanner. Torture has disappeared from the great city prison, but there\r\nwere dark rumors that some of the political prisoners, so lately as\r\nJanuary, 1897, were subjected to it elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMy experience of Eastern prisons, chiefly in Asia Minor, China,\r\nPersia, and a glimpse of a former prison in Seoul, have given me a\r\nvivid impression of the contrast presented by the present system.\r\nSurrounding a large quadrangle, with the chief jailer’s house in the\r\ncentre, the rooms, not to be called cells, are large, airy, light, and\r\nwell-ventilated, with boarded floors covered with mats, and plenty of\r\nair space below. It is true that on the day I visited them some of the\r\nprisoners were shivering, and shivered more vigorously as an appeal\r\nto my compassion, but then the mercury was at 18° F., and this is not\r\na usual temperature. They have a large bathroom with a stove on the\r\nJapanese plan. Their diet consists of a pint of excellent soup twice\r\na day, with a large bowl of rice, and those who go out to work get a\r\nthird meal. This ample diet cost 1¹⁄₄d. per day.\r\n\r\nThere were from twelve to eighteen prisoners in each ordinary room, and\r\nfifty were awaiting trial in one roomy hall. A few under sentence, two\r\nof them to death, wore long wooden _cangues_, but I did not see any\r\nfetters. They are allowed to bring in their own mattresses, mats, and\r\npillows for extra comfort. On the whole they were clean, cleaner than\r\nthe ordinary coolies outside. A perforated wooden bar attached to the\r\nfloor, with another with corresponding perforations above it, secures\r\nthe legs of the prisoners at night. The sick were lying thickly on the\r\nhot floor of a room very imperfectly lighted, but probably the well\r\nwould have been glad to change with them.\r\n\r\nThere were 225 prisoners altogether, all men. Classification is still\r\nin the future. Murderers and pilferers occupied the same room, and\r\ncolonels of regiments accused of a serious conspiracy were with\r\nconvicted felons, who might or might not be acting as spies and\r\ninformers; a very fine-looking man, sentenced for life, the first\r\nmagistrate in Korea ever convicted and punished for bribery, and that\r\non the complaint of a simple citizen, was in a “cell” with criminals\r\nwearing _cangues_. Some of the sentences seemed out of proportion\r\nto the offences, as, for instance, a feeble old man was immured for\r\nthree years for cutting and carrying off pine brush for fuel, and an\r\nold blind man of some position was incarcerated for ten years for the\r\nviolation of a grave under circumstances of provocation.\r\n\r\nMuch has been done in the way of prison reform, and much remains to\r\nbe done, specially in the direction of classification, but still the\r\ngreat Seoul prison contrasts most favorably with the prisons of China\r\nand other unreformed Oriental countries. Torture is at least nominally\r\nabolished, and brutal exposures of severed heads and headless trunks,\r\nand beating and slicing to death, were made an end of during the\r\nascendency of Japan. After an afternoon in the prison of Seoul, I\r\ncould hardly believe it possible that only two years before I had seen\r\nseveral human heads hanging from tripod stands and lying on the ground\r\nin the throng of a business street, and headless bodies lying in their\r\nblood on the road outside the East Gate.\r\n\r\nTo mention the changes in Seoul would take another chapter. Dr. Allen,\r\nnow U.S. Minister to Korea, said that the last four months of 1896 had\r\nseen more alterations than the previous twelve years of his residence\r\nin the country, and the three months of my last visit brought something\r\nnew every week.\r\n\r\nAs a foil to so much that is indicative of progress, I conclude this\r\nchapter by mentioning, on the authority of the Governor of Seoul, that\r\nin January, 1897, there were in the capital a thousand _mu-tang_,\r\nor sorceresses, earning on an average fifteen dollars a month each,\r\nrepresenting an annual expenditure by that single city of a hundred and\r\neighty thousand dollars on dealings with the spirits, exclusive of the\r\nlarge sums paid to the blind sorcerers for their services, and to the\r\ngeomancers, whose claims on the occasion of the interment of any one of\r\nrank and wealth are simply monstrous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOREAN POLICEMEN\r\n\r\n  Old _Régime_      New _Régime_]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] I left Korea for China at Christmas, 1895, and after spending six\r\nmonths in travelling in the Chinese Far West, and three months among\r\nthe Nan-tai San mountains in Japan, returned in the middle of October,\r\n1896, and remained in Seoul until late in the winter of 1896-97.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nLAST WORDS ON KOREA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patient reader has now learned with me something of Korean history\r\nduring the last three years, as well as of the reorganized methods\r\nof Government, and the education, trade, and finance of the country.\r\nHe has also by proxy travelled in the interior, and has lived among\r\nthe peasant farmers, seeing their industries, the huckstering which\r\npasses for trade, something of their domestic life and habits, and\r\nthe superstitions by which they are enslaved, and has acquired some\r\nknowledge of the official and patrician exactions under which they\r\nsuffer. He has seen the Koreans at home, with their limpness, laziness,\r\ndependence, and poverty, and Koreans under Russian rule raised into\r\na thrifty and prosperous population. He can to some extent judge for\r\nhimself of the prospects of a country which is incapable of standing\r\nalone, and which could support double its present population, and of\r\nthe value of a territory which is possibly coveted by two Powers.\r\nHaving acted as his guide so far, I should like to conclude with a few\r\nwords on some of the subjects which have been glanced at in the course\r\nof these volumes.\r\n\r\nKorea is not _necessarily_ a poor country. Her resources are\r\nundeveloped, not exhausted. Her capacities for successful agriculture\r\nare scarcely exploited. Her climate is superb, her rainfall abundant,\r\nand her soil productive. Her hills and valleys contain coal, iron,\r\ncopper, lead, and gold. The fisheries along her coast-line of 1,740\r\nmiles might be a source of untold wealth. She is inhabited by a hardy\r\nand hospitable race, and she has no beggar class.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the energies of her people lie dormant. The\r\nupper classes, paralyzed by the most absurd of social obligations,\r\nspend their lives in inactivity. To the middle class no careers are\r\nopen; there are no skilled occupations to which they can turn their\r\nenergies. The lower classes work no harder than is necessary to keep\r\nthe wolf from the door, for very sufficient reasons. Even in Seoul,\r\nthe largest mercantile establishments have hardly risen to the level\r\nof shops. Everything in Korea has been on a low, poor, mean level.\r\nClass privileges, class and official exactions, a total absence of\r\njustice, the insecurity of all earnings, a Government which has carried\r\nout the worst traditions on which all unreformed Oriental Governments\r\nare based, a class of official robbers steeped in intrigue, a monarch\r\nenfeebled by the seclusion of the palace and the pettinesses of the\r\nSeraglio, a close alliance with one of the most corrupt of empires, the\r\nmutual jealousies of interested foreigners, and an all-pervading and\r\nterrorizing superstition have done their best to reduce Korea to that\r\ncondition of resourcelessness and dreary squalor in which I formed my\r\nfirst impression of her.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the resources are there, in her seas, her soil, and her\r\nhardy population.\r\n\r\nA great and universal curse in Korea is the habit in which thousands\r\nof able-bodied men indulge of hanging, or “sorning,” on relations or\r\nfriends who are better off than themselves. There is no shame in the\r\ntransaction, and there is no public opinion to condemn it. A man who\r\nhas a certain income, however small, has to support many of his own\r\nkindred, his wife’s relations, many of his own friends, and the friends\r\nof his relatives. This partly explains the rush for Government offices,\r\nand their position as marketable commodities. To a man burdened with a\r\nhorde of hangers-on, the one avenue of escape is official life, which,\r\nwhether high or low, enables him to provide for them out of the public\r\npurse. This accounts for the continual creation of offices, with no\r\nother real object than the pensioning of the relatives and friends of\r\nthe men who rule the country. Above all, this explains the frequency\r\nof conspiracies and small revolutions in Korea. Principle is rarely at\r\nstake, and no Korean revolutionist intends to risk his life in support\r\nof any conviction.\r\n\r\nHundreds of men, strong in health and of average intelligence, are at\r\nthis moment hanging on for everything, even their tobacco, to high\r\nofficials in Seoul, eating three meals a day, gossiping and plotting\r\nmisdeeds, the feeling of honorable independence being unknown. When\r\nit is desirable to get rid of them, or it is impossible to keep them\r\nlonger, offices are created or obtained for them. Hence Government\r\nemployment is scarcely better than a “free coup” for this class of\r\nrubbish. The factious political disturbances which have disgraced Korea\r\nfor many years have not been conflicts of principle at all, but fights\r\nfor the Government position which gives its holder the disposal of\r\noffices and money. The suspiciousness which prevents high officials\r\nfrom working together is also partly due to the desire of every\r\nMinister to get more influence with the King than his colleagues, and\r\nso secure more appointments for his relations and friends. The author\r\nof the Korean Dictionary states that the word for _work_ in Korean is\r\nsynonymous with “loss,” “evil,” “misfortune,” and the man who leads an\r\nidle life proves his right to a place among the gentry. The strongest\r\nclaim for office which an official puts forward for a _protégé_ is that\r\nhe cannot make a living. Such persons when appointed do little, and\r\noften nothing, except draw their salaries and “squeeze” where they can!\r\n\r\nI have repeated almost _ad nauseam_ that the cultivator of the soil is\r\nthe _ultimate sponge_. The farmers work harder than any other class,\r\nand could easily double the production of the land, their methods,\r\nthough somewhat primitive, being fairly well adapted to the soil and\r\nclimate. But having no security for their gains, they are content to\r\nproduce only what will feed and clothe their families, and are afraid\r\nto build better houses or to dress respectably. There are innumerable\r\npeasant farmers who have gone on reducing their acreage of culture year\r\nby year, owing to the exactions and forced loans of magistrates and\r\n_yang-bans_, and who now only raise what will enable them to procure\r\nthree meals a day. It is not wonderful that classes whose manifest\r\ndestiny is to be squeezed, should have sunk down to a dead level of\r\nindifference, inertia, apathy, and listlessness.\r\n\r\nIn spite of reforms, the Korean nation still consists of but two\r\nclasses, the Robbers and the Robbed,--the official class recruited from\r\nthe _yang-bans_, the licensed vampires of the country, and the _Ha-in_,\r\nliterally “low men,” a residuum of fully four-fifths of the population,\r\nwhose _raison d’être_ is to supply the blood for the vampires to suck.\r\n\r\nOut of such unpromising materials the new nation has to be constructed,\r\nby education, by protecting the producing classes, by punishing\r\ndishonest officials, and by the imposition of a labor test in all\r\nGovernment offices, _i.e._ by paying only for work actually done.\r\n\r\nThat reforms are not hopeless, if carried out under firm and capable\r\nforeign supervision, is shown by what has been accomplished in the\r\nTreasury Department in one year. No Korean office was in a more chaotic\r\nand corrupt condition, and the ramifications of its corruption were\r\nspread all through the Provinces. Much was hoped when Mr. M’Leavy Brown\r\naccepted the thankless position of Financial Adviser, from his known\r\nforce of character and remarkable financial capacity, but no one would\r\nhave ventured to predict what has actually occurred.\r\n\r\nAlthough his efforts at financial reform have been thwarted at\r\nevery turn, not alone by the rapacity of the King’s male and female\r\nfavorites, and the measureless cunning and craft of corrupt officials,\r\nwho incite the Sovereign to actions concerning money which are\r\nsubversive of the fairest schemes of financial rectitude, but by\r\nchicane, fraud, and corruption in every department; by the absence of\r\ntrustworthy subordinates; by infamous traditional customs; and the fact\r\nthat every man in office, and every man hoping for office, is pledged\r\nby his personal interest to oppose every effort at reform actively or\r\npassively, Korean finance stands thus at the close of 1897.\r\n\r\nIn a few months the Augean stable of the Treasury Department in Seoul\r\nhas been cleansed; the accounts are kept on a uniform system, and with\r\nthe utmost exactitude; “value received” precedes payments for work; an\r\narmy of drones, hanging on to all departments and subsisting on public\r\nmoney, has been disbanded; a partial estimate has been formed of the\r\nrevenue which the Provinces ought to produce; superfluous officials\r\nunworthily appointed find that their salaries are not forthcoming;\r\nevery man entitled to receive payment is paid at the end of every\r\nmonth; nothing is in arrears; great public improvements are carried out\r\nwith a careful supervision which ensures rigid economy; the accounts\r\nof every Department undergo strict scrutiny; no detail is thought\r\nunworthy of attention, and instead of Korea being bankrupt, as both her\r\nfriends and enemies supposed she would be in July, 1896, she closed the\r\nfinancial year in April, 1897, with every account paid and a million\r\nand a half in the Treasury, out of which she has repaid one million of\r\nthe Japanese loan of three millions. If foreign advisers of similar\r\ncalibre and capacity were attached to all the departments of State\r\nsimilar results might in time be obtained.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, that the war and the period of the energetic\r\nascendency of Japan have given Korea so rude a shake, and have so\r\nthoroughly discredited various customs and institutions previously\r\nvenerated for their antiquity, that no retrograde movements, such as\r\nhave been to some extent in progress in 1897, can replace her in the\r\nold grooves.\r\n\r\nSeoul is Korea for most practical purposes, and the working of the\r\nWestern leaven, the new impulses and modes of thought introduced\r\nby Western education, the inevitable contact with foreigners, and\r\nthe influence of a free Press are through Seoul slowly affecting the\r\nnation. Under the shadow of Chinese suzerainty the Korean _yang-ban_\r\nenjoyed practically unlimited opportunities for the extortions and\r\ntyrannies which were the atmosphere of patrician life. Japan introduced\r\na new theory on this subject, and practically gave the masses to\r\nunderstand that they possess rights which the classes are bound to\r\nrespect, and the Press takes the same line.\r\n\r\nIt is slowly dawning upon the Korean peasant farmer through the medium\r\nof Japanese and Western teaching, that to be an ultimate sponge is not\r\nhis inevitable destiny, that he is entitled to civil rights, equality\r\nbefore the eye of the law, and protection for his earnings.\r\n\r\nThe more important of the changes during the last three years which are\r\nbeneficial to Korea may be summarized thus: The connection with China\r\nis at an end, and with the victories of Japan the Korean belief in the\r\nunconquerable military power of the Middle Kingdom has been exploded,\r\nand the alliance between two political systems essentially corrupt\r\nhas been severed. The distinction between patrician and plebeian has\r\nbeen abolished, on paper at least, along with domestic slavery, and\r\nthe disabilities which rendered the sons of concubines ineligible\r\nfor high office. Brutal punishments and torture are done away with,\r\na convenient coinage has replaced _cash_, an improved educational\r\nsystem has been launched, a disciplined army and police force has been\r\ncreated, the Chinese literary examinations are no longer the test of\r\nfitness for official employment, a small measure of judicial reform\r\nhas been granted, a railroad from Chemulpo to the capital is being\r\nrapidly pushed to completion, the pressure of the Trades Guilds is\r\nrelaxed, a postal system efficiently worked and commanding confidence\r\nhas been introduced into all the Provinces, the finances of the country\r\nare being placed on a sound basis, the change from a land-tax paid in\r\nkind to one which is an assessment in money on the value of the land\r\ngreatly diminishes the opportunities for official “squeezing,” and\r\nlarge and judicious retrenchments have been carried out in most of the\r\nmetropolitan and provincial departments.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Government _Gazette_ of the 12th of August, 1897,\r\ncontains the following Royal Edicts:--\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\n We have been looking into the condition of the country. We have\r\n realized the imminent danger which threatens the maintenance of\r\n the nation. But the people of both high and low classes do not\r\n seem to mind the coming calamity and act indifferently. Under the\r\n circumstances the country cannot prosper. We are depending upon Our\r\n Ministers for their advice and help, but they do not respond to\r\n our trust. How are we going to bring the nation out of its chaotic\r\n condition? We desire them to pause and to think that they cannot\r\n enjoy their homes unless the integrity of the nation is preserved.\r\n We confess that We have not performed our part properly, but Our\r\n Ministers and other officials ought to have advised Us to refrain from\r\n wrongdoing as their ancestors had done to Our forefathers. We will\r\n endeavor to do what is right and proper for our country hereafter,\r\n and We trust Our subjects will renew their loyalty and patriotism in\r\n helping Us to carry out Our aim. Our hope is that every citizen in the\r\n land will consider the country’s interest first before thinking of his\r\n private affairs. Let Us all join Our hearts to preserve the integrity\r\n of Our country.\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\n The welfare of Our people is our constant thought. We realize that\r\n since last year’s disturbance Our people have been suffering greatly\r\n on account of lack of peace and order. The dead suffers as much as the\r\n living, but the Government has not done anything to ameliorate the\r\n existing condition. This thought makes Us worry to such an extent that\r\n the affluence by which We are surrounded is rather uncomfortable. If\r\n this fact is known to Our provincial officials they will do their best\r\n to ameliorate the condition of the people. Compulsory collection of\r\n unjust taxes and thousands of lawless officials and Government agents\r\n rob the helpless masses upon one pretence or another. Why do they\r\n treat Our people so cruelly? We hereby order the provincial officials\r\n to look into the various items of illegal taxes now being collected,\r\n and abolish them all without reservation. Whoever does not heed this\r\n edict will be punished according to the law.[60]\r\n\r\nThough the Koreans of to-day are the product of centuries of\r\ndisadvantages, yet after nearly a year spent in the country, during\r\nwhich I made its people my chief study, I am by no means hopeless of\r\ntheir future, in spite of the distinctly retrograde movements of 1897.\r\nTwo things, however, are essential.\r\n\r\nI. As Korea is incapable of reforming herself from within, that she\r\nmust be reformed from without.\r\n\r\nII. That the power of the Sovereign must be placed under stringent and\r\npermanent constitutional checks.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have written exclusively on Korean internal affairs, her\r\nactual condition, and the prospects of the social and commercial\r\nadvancement of the people. I conclude with a few remarks on the\r\npolitical possibilities of the Korean future, and the relations of\r\nKorea with certain other powers.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of Korea, with a frontier conterminous with\r\nthose of China and Russia, and divided from Japan by only a narrow sea,\r\nhas done much to determine her political relationships. The ascendency\r\nof China grew naturally out of territorial connection, and its duration\r\nfor many centuries was at once the cause and effect of a community in\r\nphilosophy, customs, and to a great extent in language and religion.\r\nBut Chinese control is at an end, and China can scarcely be regarded as\r\na factor in the Korean situation.\r\n\r\nJapan having skilfully asserted her claim to an equality of rights\r\nin Korea, after several diplomatic triumphs and marked success in\r\nobtaining fiscal and commercial ascendency, eventually, by the\r\noverthrow of her rival in the late war, secured political ascendency\r\nlikewise; and the long strife between the two empires, of which Korea\r\nhad been the unhappy stage, came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe nominal reason for the war, to which the Japanese Government has\r\nbeen careful to adhere, was the absolute necessity for the reform of\r\nthe internal administration of a State too near the shores of Japan\r\nto be suffered to sink annually deeper into an abyss of misgovernment\r\nand ruin. It is needless to speculate upon the ultimate object which\r\nJapan had in view in undertaking this unusual task. It is enough to\r\nsay that she entered upon it with great energy; and that, while the\r\nsuggestions she enforced introduced a new _régime_, struck at the heart\r\nof privilege and prerogative, revolutionized social order, and reduced\r\nthe Sovereign to the position of a “salaried automaton,” the remarkable\r\nability with which her demands were formulated gave them the appearance\r\nof simple and natural administrative reforms.\r\n\r\nI believe that Japan was thoroughly honest in her efforts; and though\r\nshe lacked experience, and was ofttimes rough and tactless, and aroused\r\nhostile feeling needlessly, that she had no intention to subjugate, but\r\nrather to play the _rôle_ of the protector of Korea and the guarantor\r\nof her independence.\r\n\r\nFor more than a year, in spite of certain mistakes, she made fair\r\nheadway, accomplished some useful and important reforms, and initiated\r\nothers; and it is only just to her to repeat that those which are\r\nnow being carried out are on the lines which she laid down. Then\r\ncame Viscount Miura’s savage _coup_, which discredited Japan and\r\nher diplomacy in the eyes of the civilized world. This was followed\r\nby the withdrawal of her garrisons, and of her numerous advisers,\r\ncontrollers, and drill instructors, and the substitution of an\r\napparently _laissez-faire_ policy for an active dictatorship. I write\r\n“apparently,” because it cannot for a moment be supposed that this\r\nsagacious and ambitious Empire recognized the unfortunate circumstances\r\nin Korea as a finality, and retired in despair!\r\n\r\nThe landing of Japanese armies in Korea, and the subsequent\r\ndeclaration of war with China, while they gave the world the shock\r\nof a surprise, were, as I endeavored to point out briefly in chapter\r\nxiii., neither the result of a sudden impulse, nor of the shakiness of\r\na Ministry which had to choose between its own downfall and a foreign\r\nwar. The latter view could only occur to the most superficial student\r\nof Far Eastern history and politics.\r\n\r\nJapan for several centuries has regarded herself as possessing vested\r\nrights to commercial ascendency in Korea. The harvest of the Korean\r\nseas has been reaped by her fishermen, and for 300 years her colonies\r\nhave sustained a more or less prosperous existence at Fusan. Her\r\nresentment of the pretensions of China in Korea, though debarred for\r\na considerable time from active exercise, first by the policy of\r\nseclusion pursued by the Tokugawa House, and next by the necessity of\r\nconsolidating her own internal polity after the restoration, has never\r\nslumbered.\r\n\r\nTo deprive China of a suzerainty which, it must be admitted, was not\r\nexercised for the advantage of Korea; to consolidate her own commercial\r\nsupremacy; to ensure for herself free access and special privileges; to\r\nestablish a virtual protectorate under which no foreign dictation would\r\nbe tolerated; to reform Korea on Japanese lines, and to substitute\r\nher own liberal and enlightened civilization for the antique Oriental\r\nconservatism of the Peninsula, are aims which have been kept steadily\r\nin view for forty years, replacing in part the designs which had\r\nexisted for several previous centuries.\r\n\r\nIn order to judge correctly of the action or inaction of Japan during\r\n1896 and 1897, it must be borne in mind not only that her diplomacy is\r\nsecret and reticent, but that it is steady; that it has not hitherto\r\nbeen affected by any great political cataclysms at home; that it has\r\nless of opportunism than that of almost any other nation, and that the\r\nJapanese have as much tenacity and fixity of purpose as any other race.\r\nAlso, Japanese policy in Korea is still shaped by the same remarkable\r\nstatesmen, who from the day that Japan emerged upon the international\r\narena have been recognized by the people as their natural leaders, and\r\nwho have guided the country through the manifold complications which\r\nbeset the path of her enlightened progress with a celerity and freedom\r\nfrom disaster which have compelled the admiration of the world.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of the Korean Queen under the auspices of Viscount\r\nMiura, and the universal horror excited by the act, rendered it politic\r\nfor Japan to keep out of sight till the storm which threatened to wreck\r\nher _prestige_ in Korea had blown over. This temporary retirement was\r\narranged with consummate skill. There were no violent dislocations.\r\nThe garrisons which were to be withdrawn quietly slipped away, and\r\nwere replaced by guards only sufficient for the protection of the\r\nJapanese Legation, the Japanese telegraph, and other property. The\r\ngreater number of the Japanese in Korean Government employment fell\r\nnaturally out of it as their contracts expired, and quietly retired\r\nfrom the country. Ministers of experience, proved ability, and courtesy\r\nof demeanor, have succeeded to the post once occupied by Mr. Otori\r\nand Viscount Miura. There has been scarcely any recent interference\r\nwith Korean affairs, and the Japanese colonists who were much given\r\nto bullying and blustering are on greatly improved behavior, the most\r\nobjectionable among them having been recalled by orders from home.\r\nDiplomatically, Japan has carefully avoided friction with the Korean\r\nGovernment and the representatives of the other Powers. But to infer\r\nfrom this that she has abandoned her claims, or has swerved from her\r\ndetermination to make her patronage essential to the well-being of\r\nKorea would be a grave mistake.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that whatever Japan lost in Korea Russia gained. It is\r\ntrue that the King in his terror and apprehension threw himself upon\r\nthe protection of the Russian Minister, and remained for more than a\r\nyear under the shelter of the Russian flag, and that at his request\r\na Russian Military Commission arrived to reorganize and drill the\r\nKorean army, that Russia presented 3,000 Berdan rifles to Korea, that a\r\nRussian financier spent the autumn of 1896 in Seoul investigating the\r\nfinancial resources and prospects of the country, and that the King,\r\nwarned by disastrous experiences of betrayal, prefers to trust his\r\npersonal safety to his proximity to the Russian military quarters.\r\n\r\nBut “Russian Ascendency,” in the sense of “_Control_” in which Japanese\r\nascendency is to be understood, has never existed. The Russian Minister\r\nused the undoubtedly influential position which circumstances gave him\r\nwith unexampled moderation, and only brought his influence to bear on\r\nthe King in cases of grave misrule. The influence of Russia, however,\r\ngrew quietly and naturally, with little of external manifestation, up\r\nto March, 1897, when the publication of a treaty, concluded ten months\r\nbefore between Russia and Japan,[61] caused something of a revulsion\r\nof feeling in favor of the latter country, and Russia has been slowly\r\nlosing ground. Her policy is too pacific to allow of a quarrel with\r\nJapan, and a quarrel would be the inevitable result of any present\r\nattempt at dictatorship in Korea. So far, she has pursued a strictly\r\nopportunist policy, taking no steps except those which have been forced\r\nupon her; and even if the Korean pear were ready to drop into her\r\nmouth, I greatly doubt if she would shake the tree.\r\n\r\nAt all events, Russia let the opportunity of obtaining ascendency\r\nin Korea go by. It is very likely that she never desired it. It may\r\nbe quite incompatible with other aims, at which we can only guess.\r\nAt the same time, the influence of Japan is quietly and steadily\r\nincreasing. Certainly the great object of the triple intervention\r\nin the treaty negotiations in Shimonoseki was to prevent Japan from\r\ngaining a foothold on the mainland of the Asiatic Continent; but it\r\ndoes not seem altogether impossible that, by playing a waiting game\r\nand profiting by previous mistakes, she, without assuming a formal\r\nprotectorate, may be able to add, for all practical purposes of\r\ncommerce and emigration, a mainland province to her Empire. Forecasts\r\nare dangerous things,[62] but it is safe to say that if Russia, not\r\ncontent with such quiet, military developments as may be in prospect,\r\nwere to manifest any aggressive designs on Korea, Japan is powerful\r\nenough to put a brake on the wheel! Korea, however, is incapable\r\nof standing alone, and unless so difficult a matter as a joint\r\nprotectorate could be arranged, she must be under the tutelage of\r\neither Japan or Russia.\r\n\r\nIf Russia were to acquire an actual supremacy, the usual result would\r\nfollow. Preferential duties and other imposts would practically make an\r\nend of British trade in Korea with all its large potentialities. The\r\neffacement of British political influence has been effected chiefly by\r\na policy of _laissez-faire_, which has produced on the Korean mind the\r\ndouble impression of indifference and feebleness, to which the dubious\r\nand hazy diplomatic relationship naturally contributes. If England has\r\nno contingent interest in the political future of a country rich in\r\nundeveloped resources and valuable harbors, and whose possession by\r\na hostile Power might be a serious peril to her interests in the Far\r\nEast, her policy during the last few years has been a sure method of\r\nevidencing her unconcern.\r\n\r\nThough we may have abandoned any political interest in Korea, the\r\nfuture of British trade in the country remains an important question.\r\nSuch influence as England possesses, being exercised through a\r\nnon-official channel, and therefore necessarily indirect, is owing to\r\nthe abilities, force, and diplomatic tact of Mr. M’Leavy Brown, the\r\nChief Commissioner of Customs, formerly of H.B.M.’s Chinese Consular\r\nService. So long as he is in control at the capital, and such upright\r\nand able men as Mr. Hunt, Mr. Oiesen, and Mr. Osborne are Commissioners\r\nat the treaty ports (Appendix D), so long will England be commercially\r\nimportant in Korean estimation.\r\n\r\nThe Customs revenue, always increasing, and collected at a cost of 10\r\nper cent. only, is the backbone of Korean finance; and everywhere the\r\nability and integrity of the administration give the Commissioners an\r\ninfluence which is necessarily in favor of England, and which produces\r\nan impression even on corrupt Korean officialism. That this service\r\nshould remain in our hands is of the utmost practical importance. In\r\nthe days of Japanese ascendency there was a great desire to upset the\r\npresent arrangement, but it was frustrated by the tact and firmness\r\nof the Chief Commissioner. The next danger is that it should pass\r\ninto Russian hands, which would be a severe blow to our _prestige_\r\nand interests. Some of the leading Russian papers are agitating this\r\nquestion, and the _Novoie Vremia_ of 9th September, 1897, in writing\r\nof the opening of the ports of Mok-po and Chi-nam-po to foreign\r\ntrade, says:--“These encroachments are chiefly due to the cleverness\r\nof the British officials who are at the head of the Financial and\r\nCustoms Departments of the Korean administration.” It adds, “If Russia\r\ntolerates any further increase in this policy ... Great Britain will\r\nconvert the country into one of her best markets.” The _Novoie Vremia_\r\ngoes on to urge “the Russian Government to exercise, before it is too\r\nlate, a more searching surveillance than at present, to take steps to\r\nreduce the number of British officials in the Korean Government (the\r\nCustoms), and to compel Japan to withdraw what are practically the\r\nmilitary garrisons which she has established in Korea.”\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief outline, is the position of political affairs in Korea\r\nat the close of 1897. Her long and close political connection with\r\nChina is severed; she has received from Japan a gift of independence\r\nwhich she knows not how to use; England, for reasons which may be\r\nguessed at, has withdrawn from any active participation in her affairs;\r\nthe other European Powers have no interests to safeguard in that\r\nquarter; and her integrity and independence are at the mercy of the\r\nmost patient and the most ambitious of Empires, whose interests in the\r\nFar East are conflicting, if not hostile.\r\n\r\nIt is with great regret that I take leave of Korea, with Russia and\r\nJapan facing each other across her destinies. The distaste I felt for\r\nthe country at first passed into an interest which is almost affection,\r\nand on no previous journey have I made dearer and kinder friends, or\r\nthose from whom I parted more regretfully. I saw the last of Seoul\r\nin snow in the blue and violet atmosphere of one of the loveliest of\r\nher winter mornings, and the following day left Chemulpo in a north\r\nwind of merciless severity in the little Government steamer _Hyenik_\r\nfor Shanghai, where the quaint Korean flag excited much interest and\r\nquestioning as she steamed slowly up the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] The good intentions of the Korean Sovereign, as well as the\r\nweakness which renders them ineffective, are typically illustrated in\r\nthese two pathetic documents.\r\n\r\n[61] See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[62] As “it is the unexpected which happens,” it would not be\r\nsurprising if certain moves, ostensibly with the object of placing the\r\nindependence of Korea on a firm basis, were made even before these\r\nvolumes are published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIXES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSION STATISTICS FOR KOREA, 1896.\r\n\r\n  KEY:\r\n  1: Year of beginning work in Korea.\r\n  2: Number of married male Missionaries.\r\n  3: Number of unmarried male Missionaries.\r\n  4: Number of unmarried female Missionaries.\r\n  5: Number of stations where Missionaries reside.\r\n  6: Number of out stations where no Missionaries reside.\r\n\r\n +-------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n |      NAME OF MISSION.   |  1   |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |\r\n +-------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n | American Presbyterian   |      |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n |   Mission (North)       | 1884 |  11 |  2  |  5  |  4  | 25} |\r\n |                         |      |     |     |     |     |   } |\r\n | American Presbyterian   |      |     |     |     |     |   } |\r\n |   Mission (South)       | 1892 |  4  |  2  |  2  |  3  |   } |\r\n |                         |      |     |     |     |     |   } |\r\n | Australian Presbyterian |      |     |     |     |     |   } |\r\n |   Mission               | 1891 |  1  |     |  3  |  1  |   } |\r\n |                         |      |     |     |     |     |   } |\r\n | Y.M.C.A.

It is generally stated that side by side\r\n with the trade in foreign vessels at the Treaty Ports a considerable\r\n traffic has been carried on by junk between non-Treaty ports in Korea\r\n and ports in China and Japan. This junk trade was probably much larger\r\n in the earlier years of the period the figures of which are compared,\r\n and the rapid development shown in the table may be partly due to\r\n the increasing transfer of traffic from native craft to foreign-type\r\n vessels which offer greater regularity and safety and less delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE TABLE OF THE NET DUES AND DUTIES COLLECTED

WITH REPLY OF H.E. THE KOREAN MINISTER\r\nFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nThe Representatives of Russia and Japan at Seoul, having conferred\r\nunder the identical instructions from their respective Governments,\r\nhave arrived at the following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n While leaving the matter of His Majesty’s, the King of Korea,\r\n return to the Palace entirely to his own discretion and judgment,\r\n the Representatives of Russia and Japan will friendly advise His\r\n Majesty to return to that place, when no doubts could be entertained\r\n concerning his safety.\r\n\r\n The Japanese Representative, on his part, gives the assurance, that\r\n the most complete and effective measures will be taken for the control\r\n of Japanese _soshi_.\r\n\r\n The present Cabinet Ministers have been appointed by His Majesty by\r\n his own free will, and most of them have held ministerial or other\r\n high offices during the last two years and are known to be liberal and\r\n moderate men.\r\n\r\n The two Representatives will always aim at recommending His Majesty to\r\n appoint liberal and moderate men as Ministers, and to show clemency to\r\n his subjects.\r\n\r\n The Representative of Russia quite agrees with the Representative\r\n of Japan that at the present state of affairs in Korea it may be\r\n necessary to have Japanese guards stationed at some places for the\r\n protection of the Japanese telegraph line between Fusan and Seoul,\r\n and that these guards, now consisting of three companies of soldiers,\r\n should be withdrawn as soon as possible and replaced by gendarmes,\r\n who will be distributed as follows: fifty men at Fusan, fifty men at\r\n Ka-heung, and ten men each at ten intermediate posts between Fusan and\r\n Seoul.\r\n\r\n This distribution may be liable to some changes, but the total number\r\n of the gendarme force shall never exceed two hundred men, who will\r\n afterwards gradually be withdrawn from such places, where peace and\r\n order have been restored by the Korean Government.\r\n\r\n For the protection of the Japanese settlements at Seoul and the open\r\n ports against possible attacks by the Korean populace, two companies\r\n of Japanese troops may be stationed at Seoul, one company at Fusan\r\n and one at Wön-san, each company not to exceed two hundred men. These\r\n troops will be quartered near the settlements, and shall be withdrawn\r\n as soon as no apprehension of such attacks could be entertained.\r\n\r\n For the protection of the Russian Legation and Consulates the Russian\r\n Government may also keep guards not exceeding the number of Japanese\r\n troops at those places, and which will be withdrawn as soon as\r\n tranquillity in the interior is completely restored.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)     C. WAEBER,\r\n  _Representative of Russia_.\r\n\r\n  J. KOMURA,\r\n  _Representative of Japan_.\r\n\r\n SEOUL, _14th May, 1896_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTOCOL\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, Prince Lobanow-Rostovskey, Foreign Minister of\r\nRussia, and the Marshal Marquis Yamagata, Ambassador Extraordinary of\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor of Japan, having exchanged their views on the\r\nsituation of Korea, agreed upon the following articles:--\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\n For the remedy of the financial difficulties of Korea, the Governments\r\n of Russia and Japan will advise the Korean Government to retrench all\r\n superfluous expenditure, and to establish a balance between expenses\r\n and revenues. If, in consequence of reforms deemed indispensable, it\r\n may be necessary to have recourse to foreign loans, both Governments\r\n shall by mutual consent give their support to Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\n The Governments of Russia and Japan shall endeavor to leave to Korea,\r\n as far as the financial and economical situation of that country will\r\n permit, the formation and maintenance of a national armed force and\r\n police of such proportions as will be sufficient for the preservation\r\n of the internal peace, without foreign support.\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\n With a view to facilitate communications with Korea, the Japanese\r\n Government may continue (_continuera_) to administer the telegraph\r\n lines which are at present in its hands.\r\n\r\n It is reserved to Russia (the rights) of building a telegraph line\r\n between Seoul and her frontiers.\r\n\r\n These different lines can be repurchased by the Korean Government, so\r\n soon as it has the means to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n IV\r\n\r\n In case the above matters should require a more exact or detailed\r\n explanation, or if subsequently some other points should present\r\n themselves upon which it may be necessary to confer, the\r\n Representatives of both Governments shall be authorized to negotiate\r\n in a spirit of friendship.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)    LOBANOW.\r\n  YAMAGATA.\r\n\r\n MOSCOW, _9th_ June, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe following is the exact translation of the reply sent to the\r\nJapanese Minister by the Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, concerning\r\nthe Russo-Japanese Convention:--\r\n\r\n  MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS,\r\n  _Mar. 9th, 2nd year of Kun-yang_ (1897).\r\n\r\n SIR--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch\r\n of the 2nd instant, informing me that, on the 14th day of May last,\r\n a memorandum was signed at Seoul by H.E. Mr. Komura, the former\r\n Japanese Minister Resident, and the Russian Minister, and that, on the\r\n 4th of June of the same year, an Agreement was signed at Moscow, by\r\n H.E. Marshal Yamagata, the Japanese Ambassador, and the Minister for\r\n Foreign Affairs of Russia; and that these two documents have been laid\r\n publicly before the Imperial Diet. You further inform me that on the\r\n 26th ultimo you received a telegram from your Government, pointing out\r\n that the above-mentioned Agreement and memorandum in no way reflect\r\n upon, but, on the contrary, are meant to strengthen, the independence\r\n of Korea,--this being the object which the Governments of Japan and\r\n Russia had in view,--and you cherish the confident hope that my\r\n Government will not fail to appreciate this intention. In accordance\r\n with telegraphic instructions received from the Imperial Minister of\r\n Foreign Affairs you enclose copies of the Agreements referred to.\r\n\r\n I beg to express my sincere thanks for your despatch and the\r\n information it conveys. I would observe, however, that as my\r\n Government has not joined in concluding these two Agreements, its\r\n freedom of action as an independent Power cannot be restricted by\r\n their provisions.--I have, etc.,\r\n\r\n  (Signed)     YE WANYONG,\r\n  _Minister of State for Foreign Affairs_.\r\n  H.E.
