I have none\r\nfrom you of later date than November the 25th, 1788, and of consequence,\r\nno acknowledgment of the receipt of any of mine, since that of August\r\nthe 11th, 1788. Since that period, I have written to you of the\r\nfollowing dates. 1788. August the 20th, September the 3rd, 5th, 24th,\r\nNovember the 14th, 19th, 29th. 1789. January the 11th, 14th, 21st,\r\nFebruary the 4th, March the 1st, 12th, 14th, 15th, May the 9th, 11th,\r\n12th, June the 17th, 24th, 29th. I know, through another person, that\r\nyou have received mine of November the 29th, and that you have written\r\nan answer; but I have never received the answer, and it is this which\r\nsuggests to me the fear of some general source of miscarriage.\r\n\r\nThe capture of three French merchant ships by the Algerines, under\r\ndifferent pretexts, has produced great sensation in the seaports of this\r\ncountry, and some in its government. They have ordered some frigates\r\nto be armed at Toulon to punish them. There is a possibility that\r\nthis circumstance, if not too soon set to rights by the Algerines, may\r\nfurnish occasion to the States General, when they shall have leisure to\r\nattend to matters of this kind, to disavow any future tributary treaty\r\nwith them. These pirates respect still less their treaty with Spain, and\r\ntreat the Spaniards with an insolence greater than was usual before the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of bread begins to lessen in the southern parts of France,\r\nwhere the harvest has commenced. Here it is still threatening, because\r\nwe have yet three weeks to the beginning of harvest, and I think there\r\nhas not been three days’ provision beforehand in Paris, for two or three\r\nweeks past. Monsieur de Mirabeau, who is very hostile to Mr. Necker,\r\nwished to find a ground for censuring him, in a proposition to have\r\na great quantity of flour furnished from the United States, which he\r\nsupposed me to have made to Mr. Necker, and to have been refused by him;\r\nand he asked time of the States General to furnish proofs. The Marquis\r\nde la Fayette immediately gave me notice of this matter, and I wrote him\r\na letter to disavow having ever made any such proposition to Mr. Necker,\r\nwhich I desired him to communicate to the States. I waited immediately\r\non Mr. Necker and Monsieur de Montmorin, satisfied them that what had\r\nbeen suggested was absolutely without foundation from me; and indeed\r\nthey had not needed this testimony. I gave them copies of my letter to\r\nthe Marquis de la Fayette, which was afterwards printed. The Marquis,\r\non the receipt of my letter, showed it to Mirabeau. who turned then to a\r\npaper from which he had drawn his information, and found he had totally\r\nmistaken it. He promised immediately that he would himself declare his\r\nerror to the States General, and read to them my letter, which he did.\r\nI state this matter to you, though of little consequence in itself,\r\nbecause it might go to you misstated in the English papers.\r\n\r\nOur supplies to the Atlantic ports of France, during the months of\r\nMarch, April, and May, were only twelve thousand two hundred and twenty\r\nquintals, thirty-three pounds of flour, and forty-four thousand one\r\nhundred and fifteen quintals, forty pounds of wheat, in twenty-one\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 29th of June, brought down the proceedings of the\r\nStates and government to the re-union of the orders, which took place\r\non the 27th. Within the Assembly, matters went on well. But it was soon\r\nobserved, that troops, and particularly the foreign troops, were on\r\ntheir march towards Paris from various quarters, and that this was\r\nagainst the opinion of Mr. Necker. The King was probably advised to\r\nthis, under pretext of preserving peace in Paris and Versailles, and saw\r\nnothing else in the measure. That his advisers are supposed to have had\r\nin view, when he should be secured and inspirited by the presence of the\r\ntroops to take advantage of some favorable moment, and surprise him\r\ninto an act of authority for establishing the declaration of the 23rd\r\nof June, and perhaps dispersing the States General, is probable. The\r\nMarshal de Broglio was appointed to command all the troops within\r\nthe Isle of France, a high-flying aristocrat, cool and capable of\r\neverything. Some of the French guards were soon arrested under other\r\npretexts, but in reality, on account of their dispositions in favor\r\nof the national cause. The people of Paris forced the prison, released\r\nthem, and sent a deputation to the States General, to solicit a pardon.\r\nThe States, by a most moderate and prudent _Arrêtè_, recommended these\r\nprisoners to the King, and peace to the people of Paris. Addresses\r\ncame in to them from several of the great cities, expressing sincere\r\nallegiance to the King, but a determined resolution to support the\r\nStates General. On the 8th of July, they voted an address to the King\r\nto remove the troops. This piece of masculine eloquence,* written by\r\nMonsieur de Mirabeau, is worth attention on account of the bold matter\r\nit expresses and discovers through the whole. The King refused to remove\r\nthe troops, and said they might remove themselves, if they pleased, to\r\nNoyon or Soissons. They proceeded to fix the order in which they will\r\ntake up the several branches of their future constitution, from which it\r\nappears, they mean to build it from the bottom, confining themselves\r\nto nothing in their ancient form, but a King. A declaration of rights,\r\nwhich forms the first chapter of their work, was then proposed by the\r\nMarquis de la Fayette. This was on the 11th. In the mean time troops,\r\nto the number of about twenty-five or thirty thousand, had arrived, and\r\nwere posted in and between Paris and Versailles. The bridges and passes\r\nwere guarded. At three o’clock in the afternoon, the Count de la Luzerne\r\nwas sent to notify Mr. Necker of his dismission, and to enjoin him to\r\nretire instantly, without saying a word of it to any body. He went home,\r\ndined, proposed to his wife a visit to a friend, but went in fact to his\r\ncountry-house at St. Ouen, and at midnight set out from thence, as is\r\nsupposed, for Brussels. This was not known till the next day, when\r\nthe whole ministry was changed, except Villedeuil, of the domestic\r\ndepartment, and Barentin, _Garde des Sceaux_. These changes were as\r\nfollows. The Baron de Breteuil, president of the council of finance;\r\nand De la Galaisière, Comptroller General in the room of Mr. Necker; the\r\nMarshal de Broglio, minister of war, and Foulon under him, in the room\r\nof Puy-Ségur; Monsieur de la Vauguyon, minister of foreign affairs,\r\ninstead of Monsieur de Montmorin; De la Porte, minister of marine, in\r\nplace of the Count de la Luzerne; St. Priest was also removed from\r\nthe Council. It is to be observed, that Luzerne and Puy-Ségur had been\r\nstrongly of the aristocratical party in Council; but they were not\r\nconsidered as equal to bear their shares in the work now to be done. For\r\nthis change, however sudden it may have been in the mind of the King,\r\nwas, in that of his advisers, only one chapter of a great plan, of which\r\nthe bringing together the foreign troops had been the first. He was now\r\ncompletely in the hands of men, the principal among whom had been noted\r\nthrough their lives for the Turkish despotism of their characters, and\r\nwho were associated about the King, as proper instruments for what was\r\nto be executed. The news of this change began to be known in Paris about\r\none or two o’clock. In the afternoon, a body of about one hundred German\r\ncavalry were advanced and drawn up in the Place Louis XV., and about two\r\nhundred Swiss posted at a little distance in their rear. This drew the\r\npeople to that spot, who naturally formed themselves in front of the\r\ntroops, at first merely to look at them. But as their numbers increased,\r\ntheir indignation arose; they retired a few steps, posted themselves\r\non and behind large piles of loose stone, collected in that place for\r\na bridge adjacent to it, and attacked the horse with stones. The horse\r\ncharged, but the advantageous position of the people, and the showers of\r\nstones, obliged them to retire, and even to quit the field altogether,\r\nleaving one of their number on the ground. The Swiss in their rear were\r\nobserved never to stir. This was the signal for universal insurrection,\r\nand this body of cavalry, to avoid being massacred, retired towards\r\nVersailles. The people now armed themselves with such weapons as they\r\ncould find in armorers’ shops and private houses, and with bludgeons,\r\nand were roaming all night through all parts of the city, without any\r\ndecided practicable object. The next day, the States pressed on the King\r\nto send away the troops, to permit the _Bourgeois_ of Paris to arm for\r\nthe preservation of order in the city, and offered to send a deputation\r\nfrom their body to tranquillize them. He refused all their propositions.\r\nA committee of magistrates and electors of the city were appointed by\r\ntheir bodies, to take upon them its government. The mob, now openly\r\njoined by the French guards, forced the prison of St. Lazare, released\r\nall the prisoners, and took a great store of corn, which they carried to\r\nthe corn market. Here they got some arms, and the French guards began\r\nto form and train them. The committee determined to raise forty-eight\r\nthousand _Bourgeois_, or rather to restrain their numbers to forty-eight\r\nthousand. On the 14th, they sent one of their members (Monsieur de\r\nCorny, whom we knew in America) to the _Hôtel des Invalides_, to ask\r\narms for their _Garde Bourgeoise_. He was followed by, or he found\r\nthere, a great mob. The Governor of the _Invalides_ came out, and\r\nrepresented the impossibility of his delivering arms, without the orders\r\nof those from whom he received them. De Corny advised the people then to\r\nretire, and retired himself; and the people took possession of the arms.\r\nIt was remarkable, that not only the _Invalides_ themselves made no\r\nopposition, but that a body of five thousand foreign troops, encamped\r\nwithin four hundred yards, never stirred. Monsieur de Corny and five\r\nothers were then sent to ask arms of Monsieur de Launai, Governor of\r\nthe Bastile. They found a great collection of people already before the\r\nplace, and they immediately planted a flag of truce, which was answered\r\nby a like flag hoisted on the parapet. The deputation prevailed on the\r\npeople to fall back a little, advanced themselves to make their demand\r\nof the Governor, and in that instant a discharge from the Bastile killed\r\nfour people of those nearest to the deputies. The deputies retired:\r\nthe people rushed against the place, and almost in an instant were in\r\npossession of a fortification, defended by one hundred men, of infinite\r\nstrength, which in other times had stood several regular sieges, and\r\nhad never been taken. How they got in, has as yet been impossible to\r\ndiscover. Those who pretend to have been of the party tell so many\r\ndifferent stories, as to destroy the credit of them all. They took all\r\nthe arms, discharged the prisoners, and such of the garrison as were not\r\nkilled in the first moment of fury, carried the Governor and Lieutenant\r\nGovernor to the Greve (the place of public execution), cut off their\r\nheads, and sent them through the city in triumph to the _Palais Royal_.\r\nAbout the same instant, a treacherous correspondence having been\r\ndiscovered in Monsieur de Flesselles, _Prévôt des Marchands_, they\r\nseized him in the _Hotel de Ville_, where he was in the exercise of\r\nhis office, and cut off his head. These events, carried imperfectly\r\nto Versailles, were the subject of two successive deputations from the\r\nStates to the King, to both of which he gave dry and hard answers; for\r\nit has transpired, that it had been proposed and agitated in Council, to\r\nseize on the principal members of the States General, to march the whole\r\narmy down upon Paris, and to suppress its tumults by the sword. But, at\r\nnight, the Duke de Liancourt forced his way into the King’s bed-chamber,\r\nand obliged him to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of\r\nthe day in Paris. He went to bed deeply impressed. The decapitation\r\nof De Launai worked powerfully through the night on the whole\r\naristocratical party, insomuch that, in the morning, those of the\r\ngreatest influence on the Count d’Artois, represented to him the\r\nabsolute necessity that the King should give up every thing to the\r\nStates. This according well enough with the dispositions of the King,\r\nhe went about eleven o’clock, accompanied only by his brothers, to the\r\nStates General, and there read to them a speech, in which he asked their\r\ninterposition to re-establish order. Though this be couched in terms of\r\nsome caution, yet the manner in which it was delivered, made it evident\r\nthat it was meant as a surrender at discretion. He returned to the\r\n_Chateau_ afoot, accompanied by the States. They sent off a deputation,\r\nthe Marquis de la Fayette at their head, to quiet Paris. He had, the\r\nsame morning, been named Commandant in Chief of the _Milice Bourgeoise_,\r\nand Monsieur Bailly, former President of the States General, was called\r\nfor as _Prévôt des Marchands_. The demolition of the Bastile was now\r\nordered, and begun. A body of the Swiss guards of the regiment of\r\nVentimille, and the city horse-guards joined the people. The alarm\r\nat Versailles increased instead of abating. They believed that the\r\naristocrats of Paris were under pillage and carnage, that one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand men were in arms, coming to Versailles to massacre\r\nthe royal family, the court, the ministers, and all connected with\r\nthem, their practices, and principles. The aristocrats of the Nobles\r\nand Clergy in the States General, vied with each other in declaring how\r\nsincerely they were converted to the justice of voting by persons, and\r\nhow determined to go with the nation all its lengths. The foreign troops\r\nwere ordered off instantly. Every minister resigned. The King confirmed\r\nBailly as _Prévôt des Marchands_, wrote to Mr. Necker to recall him,\r\nsent his letter open to the States General, to be forwarded by them, and\r\ninvited them to go with him to Paris the next day, to satisfy the city\r\nof his dispositions: and that night and the next morning, the Count\r\nd’Artois, and Monsieur de Montisson (a deputy connected with him),\r\nMadame de Polignac, Madame de Guiche, and the Count de Vaudreuil,\r\nfavorites of the Queen, the Abbe de Vermont, her confessor, the Prince\r\nof Conde, and Duke de Bourbon, all fled; we know not whither. The\r\nKing came to Paris, leaving the Queen in consternation for his return.\r\nOmitting the less important figures of the procession, I will only\r\nobserve, that the King’s carriage was in the centre, on each side of it\r\nthe States General, in two rank, afoot, and at their head the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, as Commander in Chief, on horseback, and _Bourgeois_ guards\r\nbefore and behind. About sixty thousand citizens of all forms and\r\ncolors, armed with the muskets of the Bastile and Invalids, as far as\r\nthey would go, the rest with pistols, swords, pikes, pruning-hooks,\r\nscythes, &c. lined all the streets through which the procession passed,\r\nand, with the crowds of people in the streets, doors, and windows,\r\nsaluted them every where with cries of _‘Vive la Nation;_’ but not a\r\nsingle _‘Vive le Roy_’ was heard. The King stopped at the _Hôtel de\r\nVille_. There Monsieur Bailly presented and put into his hat the popular\r\ncockade, and addressed him. The King being unprepared and unable to\r\nanswer, Bailly went to him, gathered from him some scraps of sentences,\r\nand made out an answer, which he delivered to the audience as from\r\nthe King. On their return, the popular cries were _‘Vive le Roy et la\r\nNation.’_ He was conducted by a _Garde Bourgeoise_ to his palace\r\nat Versailles, and thus concluded such an _amende honorable_, as no\r\nsovereign ever made, and no people ever received. Letters written with\r\nhis own hand to the Marquis de la Fayette remove the scruples of his\r\nposition. Tranquillity is now restored to the capital: the shops are\r\nagain opened; the people resuming their labors, and if the want of\r\nbread does not disturb our peace, we may hope a continuance of it.\r\nThe demolition of the Bastile is going on, and the _Milice Bourgeoise_\r\norganizing and training. The ancient police of the city is abolished by\r\nthe authority of the people, the introduction of the King’s troops will\r\nprobably be proscribed, and a watch or city guards substituted, which\r\nshall depend on the city alone. But we cannot suppose this paroxysm\r\nconfined to Paris alone. The whole country must pass successively\r\nthrough it, and happy if they get through it as soon and as well as\r\nParis has done.\r\n\r\nI went yesterday to Versailles, to satisfy myself what had passed\r\nthere; for nothing can be believed but what one sees, or has from an\r\neye-witness. They believe there still, that three thousand people have\r\nfallen victims to the tumults of Paris. Mr. Short and myself have been\r\nevery day among them, in order to be sure of what was passing. We cannot\r\nfind, with certainty, that any body has been killed but the three before\r\nmentioned, and those who fell in the assault or defence of the Bastile.\r\nHow many of the garrison were killed, nobody pretends to have ever\r\nheard. Of the assailants, accounts vary from six to six hundred. The\r\nmost general belief is, that there fell about thirty. There have been\r\nmany reports of instantaneous executions by the mob, on such of their\r\nbody as they caught in acts of theft or robbery. Some of these may\r\nperhaps be true. There was a severity of honesty observed, of which\r\nno example has been known. Bags of money offered on various occasions\r\nthrough fear or guilt, have been uniformly refused by the mobs. The\r\nchurches are now occupied in singing ‘_De projundis_’ and ‘_Requiems,_’\r\n‘for the repose of the souls of the brave and valiant citizens who\r\nhave sealed with their blood the liberty of the nation.’ Monsieur de\r\nMontmorin is this day replaced in the department of foreign affairs, and\r\nMonsieur de St. Priest is named to the home department. The gazettes of\r\nFrance and Leyden accompany this. I send also a paper (called the\r\n_Point du Jour_) which will give you some idea of the proceedings of the\r\nNational Assembly. It is but an indifferent thing; however, it is the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. July 21. Mr. Necker had left Brussels for Frankfort, before the\r\ncourier got there. We expect, however, to hear of him in a day or two.\r\nMonsieur le Comte de la Luzerne has resumed the department of the marine\r\nthis day. Either this is an office of friendship effected by Monsieur de\r\nMontmorin (for though they had taken different sides, their friendship\r\ncontinued), or he comes in as a stop-gap, till somebody else can be\r\nfound. Though very unequal to his office, all agree that he is an honest\r\nman. The Count d’Artois was at Valenciennes. The Prince of Conde and\r\nDuke de Bourbon had passed that place. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.--TO M. L’ABBE ARNOND, July 19, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. L’ABBE ARNOND.\r\n\r\nParis, July 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe annexed is a catalogue of all the books I recollect, on the subject\r\nof juries. With respect to the value of this institution, I must make\r\na general observation. We think, in America, that it is necessary to\r\nintroduce the people into every department of government, as far as they\r\nare capable of exercising it: and that this is the only way to insure a\r\nlong continued and honest administration of its powers.\r\n\r\n1. They are not qualified to exercise themselves the executive\r\ndepartment, but they are qualified to name the person who shall exercise\r\nit. With us, therefore, they choose this officer every four years.\r\n2. They are not qualified to legislate. With us, therefore, they only\r\nchoose the legislators. 3. They are not qualified to judge questions of\r\nlaw, but they are very capable of judging questions of fact. In the form\r\nof juries, therefore, they determine all matters of fact, leaving to the\r\npermanent judges to decide the law resulting from those facts. But we\r\nall know, that permanent judges acquire an _esprit de corps_; that being\r\nknown, they are liable to be tempted by bribery; that they are misled\r\nby favor, by relationship, by a spirit of party, by a devotion to the\r\nexecutive or legislative power; that it is better to leave a cause to\r\nthe decision of cross and pile, than to that of a judge biassed to one\r\nside; and that the opinion of twelve honest jurymen gives still a better\r\nhope of right, than cross and pile does. It is in the power, therefore,\r\nof the juries, if they think the permanent judges are under any bias\r\nwhatever, in any cause, to take on themselves to judge the law as\r\nwell as the fact. They never exercise this power but when they suspect\r\npartiality in the judges; and by the exercise of this power, they have\r\nbeen the firmest bulwarks of English liberty. Were I called upon to\r\ndecide, whether the people had best be omitted in the legislative or\r\njudiciary department, I would say it is better to leave them out of the\r\nlegislative. The execution of the laws is more important than the\r\nmaking them. However, it is best to have the people in all the three\r\ndepartments, where that is possible.\r\n\r\nI write in great haste, my Dear Sir, and have, therefore, only time to\r\nadd wishes for the happiness of your country, to which a new order of\r\nthings is opening; and assurances of the sincere esteem with which 1\r\nhave the honor to be, Dear Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books, on the subject of Juries_.\r\n\r\nComplete Juryman, or a Compendium of the Laws relating to Jurors.\r\n\r\nGuide to English Juries.\r\n\r\nHawles’s Englishman’s Right.\r\n\r\nJurors Judges both of Law and Fact, by Jones.\r\n\r\nSecurity of Englishmen’s Lives, or the Duty of Grand Juries.\r\n\r\nWalwin’s Juries Justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.--TO JOHN JAY, July 23, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, July 23, 1789.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe bearer of my letters (a servant of Mr. Morris) not going off till\r\nto-day, I am enabled to add to their contents. The spirit of tumult\r\nseemed to have subsided, when, yesterday, it was excited again, by a\r\nparticular incident. Monsieur Foulon, one of the obnoxious ministry,\r\nwho, as well as his brethren, had absconded, was taken in the country,\r\nand, as is said, by his own tenants, and brought to Paris. Great efforts\r\nwere exerted by popular characters, to save him. He was at length forced\r\nout of the hands of the Garde. Bourgeoise, hung immediately, his head\r\ncut off, and his body drawn through the principal streets of the city.\r\nThe Intendant of Paris, Monsieur de Chauvigny, accused of having entered\r\ninto the designs of the same ministry, has been taken at Compiegne,\r\nand a body of two hundred men on horseback have gone for him. If he be\r\nbrought here, it will be difficult to save him. Indeed, it is hard to\r\nsay, at what distance of time the presence of one of those ministers,\r\nor of any of the most obnoxious of the fugitive courtiers, will not\r\nrekindle the same blood-thirsty spirit. I hope it is extinguished as to\r\nevery body else, and yesterday’s example will teach them to keep out of\r\nits way. I add two other sheets of the _Point du Jour_, and am, with the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. I just now learn that Bertier de Chauvigny was brought to town\r\nlast night, and massacred immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.--TO JOHN JAY, July 29, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, July 29, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have written you lately, on the 24th of June, with a postscript of the\r\n25th; on the 29th of the same month; the 19th of July, with a postscript\r\nof the 21st; and again on the 23rd. Yesterday I received yours of the\r\n9th of March, by the way of Holland.\r\n\r\nMr. Necker has accepted his appointment, and will arrive today from\r\nSwitzerland, where he had taken refuge. No other ministers have been\r\nnamed since my last. It is thought that Mr. Necker will choose his own\r\nassociates. The tranquillity of Paris has not been disturbed, since the\r\ndeath of Foulon and Bertier, mentioned in my last. Their militia is in a\r\ncourse of organization. It is impossible to know the exact state of the\r\nsupplies of bread. We suppose them low and precarious, because, some\r\ndays, we are allowed to buy but half or three fourths of the daily\r\nallowance of our families. Yet as the wheat harvest must begin within\r\nten days or a fortnight, we are in hopes there will be subsistence\r\nfound till that time. This is the only source from which I should fear\r\na renewal of the late disorders; for I take for granted, the fugitives\r\nfrom the wrath of their country, are all safe in foreign countries.\r\nAmong these are numbered seven Princes of the house of Bourbon, and six\r\nministers; the seventh (the Marshal de Broglio) being shut up in the\r\nfortified town of Metz, strongly garrisoned with foreign soldiers. I\r\nobserved to you, in a preceding letter, that the storm which had begun\r\nin Paris, on the change of the ministry, would have to pass over the\r\nwhole country, and consequently, would, for a short time, occasion us\r\nterrible details from the different parts of it. Among these, you\r\nwill find a horrid one retailed from Vesoul, in Franche Compte. The\r\natrociousness of the fact would dispose us rather to doubt the truth of\r\nthe evidence on which it rests, however regular that appears. There\r\nis no question, that a number of people were blown up; but there are\r\nreasons for suspecting that it was by accident and not design. It is\r\nsaid the owner of the chateau sold powder by the pound, which was kept\r\nin the cellar of the house blown up; and it is possible, some one of\r\nthe guests may have taken this occasion to supply himself, and been\r\ntoo careless in approaching the mass. Many idle stories have also been\r\npropagated and believed here, against the English, as that they have\r\ninstigated the late tumults with money, that they had taken or were\r\npreparing to take Cherbourg, Brest, &c.; and even reasonable men have\r\nbelieved, or pretended to believe, all these. The British ambassador has\r\nthought it necessary to disavow them in a public letter, which you will\r\nfind in one of the papers accompanying this.\r\n\r\nI have lately had an opportunity of knowing with certainty the present\r\nstate of the King of England. His recovery was slow; he passed through a\r\nstage of profound melancholy; but this has at length dissipated, and he\r\nis at present perfectly re-established. He talks now as much as ever,\r\non the same trifling subjects, and has recovered even his habitual\r\ninquisitiveness into the small news of the families about him. His\r\nhealth is also good, though he is not as fleshy as he used to be. I have\r\nmultiplied my letters to you lately, because the scene has been truly\r\ninteresting; so much so, that had I received my permission to pay my\r\nprojected visit to my own country, I should have thought, and should\r\nstill think it my duty to defer it a while. I presume it cannot now\r\nbe long, before I receive your definitive answer to my request. I send\r\nherewith the public papers, as usual; and have the honor to be, with the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.--TO JOHN JAY, August 5, 1789\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 5, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 19th of the last month, with a postscript of the\r\n21st; and again on the 23rd and 29th. Those letters went by private\r\nconveyances. This goes by the London post. Since my last, some small and\r\nmomentary tumults have taken place in this city, in one of which a\r\nfew of the rioters were killed by the city militia. No more popular\r\nexecutions have taken place. The capture of the Baron de Besenval,\r\ncommandant of the Swiss troops, as he was flying to Switzerland, and of\r\nthe Duke de la Vauguyon, endeavoring to escape by sea, would endanger\r\nnew interpositions of the popular arm, were they to be brought to Paris.\r\nThey are, therefore, confined where they were taken. The former of\r\nthese being unpopular with the troops under his command, on account of\r\noppressions, occasioned a deputation from their body, to demand justice\r\nto be done on him, and to avow the devotion of the Swiss troops to\r\nthe cause of the nation. They had before taken side in part only. Mr.\r\nNecker’s return contributed much to re-establish tranquillity, though\r\nnot quite as much as was expected. His just intercessions for the Baron\r\nde Besenval and other fugitives, damped very sensibly the popular ardor\r\ntowards him. Their hatred is stronger than their love.\r\n\r\nYesterday, the other ministers were named. The Archbishop of Bordeaux\r\nis _Garde des Sceaux_, Monsieur de la Tour du Pin, minister of war,\r\nthe Prince of Beauvou is taken into the Council, and the _feuille\r\ndes bénéfices_ given to the Archbishop of Bordeaux. These are all the\r\npopular party; so that the ministry (M. de la Luzerne excepted) and the\r\nCouncil, being all in reformation principles, no further opposition may\r\nbe expected from that quarter. The National Assembly now seriously set\r\ntheir hands to the work of the constitution. They decided, a day or two\r\nago, the question, whether they should begin by a declaration of rights,\r\nby a great majority in the affirmative. The negatives were of the\r\nClergy, who fear to trust the people with the whole truth. The\r\ndeclaration itself is now on the carpet. By way of corollary to it, they\r\nlast night mowed down a whole legion of abuses, as you will see by\r\nthe _Arrêté_ which I have the honor to inclose you. This will stop the\r\nburning of chateaux, and tranquillize the country more than all the\r\naddresses they could send them. I expressed to you my fears of the\r\nimpractibility of debate and decision in a room of one thousand and\r\ntwo hundred persons, as soon as Mr. Necker’s determination to call\r\nthat number, was known. The inconveniences of their number have been\r\ndistressing to the last degree, though, as yet, they have been employed\r\nin work which could be done in the lump. They are now proceeding\r\nto instruments, every word of which must be weighed with precision.\r\nHeretofore, too, they were hooped together by a common enemy. This is no\r\nlonger the case. Yet a thorough view of the wisdom and rectitude of\r\nthis assembly disposes me more to hope they will find some means of\r\nsurmounting the difficulty of their numbers, than to fear that yielding\r\nto the unmanageableness of debate in such a crowd, and to the fatigue of\r\nthe experiment, they may be driven to adopt, in the gross, some one of\r\nthe many projects which will be proposed.\r\n\r\nThere is a germ of schism in the pretensions of Paris to form its\r\nmunicipal establishment independently of the authority of the nation. It\r\nhas not yet proceeded so far, as to threaten danger. The occasion does\r\nnot permit me to send the public papers; but nothing remarkable has\r\ntaken place in the other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and esteem, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.--TO MR. CARMICHAEL, August 9, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, August 9, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince your last of March the 27th, I have only written that of May\r\nthe 3th. The cause of this long silence, on both parts has been the\r\nexpectation I communicated to you of embarking for America. In fact, I\r\nhave expected permission for this, every hour since the month of March,\r\nand therefore always thought that by putting off writing to you a few\r\ndays, my letter, while it should communicate the occurrences of the day,\r\nmight be a letter of adieu. Should my permission now arrive, I should\r\nput off my departure till after the equinox. They write me that my not\r\nreceiving it, has proceeded from the ceasing of the old government in\r\nOctober last, and the organization of the higher departments in the new,\r\nwhich had not yet taken place when my last letters came away. Bills\r\nhad been brought in, for establishing departments of Foreign Affairs,\r\nFinance, and War. The last would certainly be given to General Knox. Mr.\r\nJay would probably have his choice of the first and second; and it was\r\nsupposed Hamilton would have that which Mr. Jay declined. Some thought\r\nMr. Jay would prefer and obtain the head of the law department, for\r\nwhich Wilson would be a competitor. In such a case, some have supposed\r\nC. Thomson would ask the Foreign Affairs. The Senate and Representatives\r\ndiffered about the title of the President. The former wanted to style\r\nhim ‘His Highness George Washington, President of the United States,\r\nand Protector of their Liberties.’ The latter insisted and prevailed, to\r\ngive no title but that of office, to wit, ‘George Washington, President\r\nof the United States.’ I hope the terms of Excellency, Honor, Worship,\r\nEsquire, for ever disappear from among us, from that moment: I wish that\r\nof Mr. would follow them. In the impost bill, the Representatives had,\r\nby almost an unanimous concurrence, made a difference between nations in\r\ntreaty with us, and those not in treaty. The Senate had struck out\r\nthis difference, and lowered all the duties. _Quære_, whether the\r\nRepresentatives would yield? Congress were to proceed, about the 1st of\r\nJune, to propose amendments to the new constitution. The principal would\r\nbe the annexing a declaration of rights to satisfy the minds of all,\r\non the subject of their liberties. They waited the arrival of Brown,\r\nDelegate from Kentucky, to take up the receiving that district as\r\na fourteenth State. The only objections apprehended, were from the\r\npartisans of Vermont, who might insist on both coming in together. This\r\nwould produce a delay, though probably not a long one.\r\n\r\nTo detail to you the events of this country, would require a volume. It\r\nwould be useless too; because those given in the Leyden gazette, though\r\nnot universally true, have so few and such unimportant errors mixed with\r\nthem, that you may give a general faith to them. I will rather give\r\nyou, therefore, what that paper cannot give, the views of the prevailing\r\npower, as far as they can be collected from conversation and writings.\r\nThey will distribute the powers of government into three parts,\r\nlegislative, judiciary, and executive. The legislative will certainly\r\nhave no hereditary branch, probably not even a select one, (like our\r\nSenate). If they divide it into two chambers at all, it will be by\r\nbreaking the representative body into two equal halves by lot. But\r\nvery many are for a single House, and particularly the Turgotists. The\r\nimperfection of their legislative body, I think, will be, that not a\r\nmember of it will be chosen by the people directly. Their representation\r\nwill be an equal one, in which every man will elect and be elected as\r\na citizen, not as of a distinct order. _Quære_, whether they will elect\r\nplacemen and pensioners? Their legislature will meet periodically,\r\nand sit at their own will, with a power in the executive to call\r\nthem extraordinarily, in case of emergencies. There is a considerable\r\ndivision of sentiment whether the executive shall have a negative on\r\nthe laws. I think they will determine to give such a negative, either\r\nabsolute or qualified. In the judiciary, the parliaments will be\r\nsuppressed, less numerous judiciary bodies instituted, and trial by jury\r\nestablished in criminal, if not in civil cases. The executive power\r\nwill be left entire in the hands of the King. They will establish the\r\nresponsibility of ministers, gifts and appropriations of money by the\r\nNational Assembly alone; consequently a civil list, freedom of the\r\npress, freedom of religion, freedom of commerce and industry, freedom\r\nof person against arbitrary arrests, and modifications, if not a total\r\nprohibition, of military agency in civil cases. I do not see how they\r\ncan prohibit, altogether, the aid of the military in cases of riot,\r\nand yet I doubt whether they can descend from the sublimity of ancient\r\nmilitary pride, to let a Marechal of France, with his troops, be\r\ncommanded by a magistrate. They cannot conceive that General Washington,\r\nat the head of his army, during the late war, could have been commanded\r\nby a common constable to go as his _posse comitates_, to suppress a mob,\r\nand that Count Rochambeau, when he was arrested at the head of his army\r\nby a sheriff, must have gone to jail if he had not given bail to appear\r\nin court. Though they have gone astonishing lengths, they are not yet\r\nthus far. It is probable, therefore, that not knowing how to use the\r\nmilitary as a civil weapon, they will do too much or too little with it.\r\n\r\nI have said that things will be so and so. Understand by this, that\r\nthese are only my conjectures, the plan of the constitution not\r\nbeing proposed yet, much less agreed to. Tranquillity is pretty well\r\nestablished in the capital; though the appearance of any of the refugees\r\nhere would endanger it. The Baron de Besenval is kept away: so is M. de\r\nla Vauguyon. The latter was so short a time a member of the obnoxious\r\nadministration, that probably he might not be touched were he here.\r\nSeven Princes of the house of Bourbon, and seven ministers, fled into\r\nforeign countries, is a wonderful event indeed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and attachment, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.--TO JOHN JAY, August 12, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 19th, 23rd, 29th of the last, and 5th of the present\r\nmonth. The last occasions not having admitted the forwarding to you the\r\npublic papers, I avail myself of the present, by a gentleman going to\r\nLondon, to furnish you with them to the present date. It is the only\r\nuse I can prudently make of the conveyance. I shall, therefore, only\r\nobserve, that the National Assembly has been entirely occupied since\r\nmy last, in developing the particulars which were the subject of their\r\nresolutions of the 4th instant, of which I send you the general heads.\r\n\r\nThe city is as yet not entirely quieted. Every now and then summary\r\nexecution is done on individuals, by individuals, and nobody is in\r\ncondition to ask for what, or by whom. We look forward to the completion\r\nof the establishment of the city militia, as that which is to restore\r\nprotection to the inhabitants. The details from the country are as\r\ndistressing as I had apprehended they would be. Most of them are\r\ndoubtless false, but many must still be true. Abundance of chateaux are\r\ncertainly burnt and burning, and not a few lives sacrificed. The worst\r\nis probably over in this city; but I do not know whether it is so in the\r\ncountry. Nothing important has taken place in the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.--TO COLONEL GOUVION, August 15,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL GOUVION.\r\n\r\nParis, August 15,1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you, that money is now deposited in the\r\nhands of Messrs. Grand and company, for paying the arrears of interest\r\ndue to the foreign officers who served in the American army. I will\r\nbeg the favor of you to notify thereof as many of them as you find\r\nconvenient; and if you can furnish the addresses of any others to\r\nMessrs. Grand and company, they will undertake to give notice to them.\r\nThe delays which have attended the completion of this object, have been\r\ngreater than I expected. This has not proceeded from any inattention of\r\nCongress or any of their servants to the justice due to those officers.\r\nThis has been sufficiently felt. But it was not till the present moment,\r\nthat their efforts to furnish such a sum of money have been successful.\r\nThe whole amount of arrears to the beginning of the present year, is\r\nabout ten thousand louis d’ors.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nattachment, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.--TO JOHN JAY, August 27, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 27, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am honored with your favor of June the 19th, informing me that\r\npermission is given me to make a short visit to my native country, for\r\nwhich indulgence I beg leave to return my thanks to the President, and\r\nto yourself, Sir, for the expedition with which you were so good as to\r\nforward it, after it was obtained. Being advised that October is the\r\nbest month of the autumn for a passage to America, I shall wish to sail\r\nabout the first of that month and as I have a family with me, and their\r\nbaggage is considerable I must endeavor to find a vessel bound directly\r\nfor Virginia if possible.\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you have been of the 5th and 12th instant. Since\r\nthese, I received information from our bankers in Holland, that they had\r\nmoney in hand sufficient to answer the demands for the foreign officers,\r\nand for the captives; and that, moreover, the residue of the bonds of\r\nthe last loan were engaged. I hereupon wrote to Mr. Grand for an exact\r\nestimate of the sum necessary for the officers. He had stated it to me\r\nas being forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty-two livres eleven\r\nsous six deniers a year, when I was going to Holland to propose the\r\nloan to Mr. Adams, and at that sum, you will see it was stated in the\r\nestimate we sent you from Amsterdam. He now informed me it was sixty\r\nthousand three hundred and ninety-three livres seventeen sous ten\r\ndeniers a year. I called on him for an explanation. He showed me that\r\nhis first information agreed with the only list of the officers and sums\r\nthen in his possession, and his last with a new list lately sent from\r\nthe treasury board, in which other officers were set down, who had been\r\nomitted in the first. I wrote to our bankers on account of this error,\r\nand desired to know whether, after receiving the money necessary for the\r\ncaptives, they were in condition to furnish two hundred and fifty-four\r\nthousand,livres for the officers. They answered me by sending the money,\r\nand the additional sum of twenty-six thousand livres, to complete the\r\nbusiness of the medals. I delivered the bills to Messrs. Grand and\r\ncompany, to negotiate and pay away; and the arrears to the officers, to\r\nthe first day of the present year, are now in a course of payment.\r\nWhile on this subject, I will ask that an order may be forwarded to the\r\nbankers in Holland to furnish, and to Mr. Grand to pay, the arrearages\r\nwhich may be due on the first of January next. The money being in hand,\r\nit would be a pity that we should fail in payment a single day, merely\r\nfor want of an order. The bankers further give it as their opinion, that\r\nour credit is so much advanced on the exchange of Amsterdam, that we\r\nmay probably execute any money arrangements we may have occasion for,\r\non this side the water. I have the honor to send you a copy of their\r\nletter. They have communicated to me apprehensions, that another house\r\nwas endeavoring to obtain the business of our government. Knowing of no\r\nsuch endeavors myself, I have assured them that I am a stranger to any\r\napplications on the subject. At the same time, I cannot but suspect\r\nthat this jealousy has been one of the spurs, at least, to the prompt\r\ncompletion of our loan. The spirited proceedings of the new Congress in\r\nthe business of revenue, has doubtless been the principal one.\r\n\r\nAn engagement has taken place between the Russian and Swedish fleets in\r\nthe Baltic, which has been not at all decisive, no ship having been lost\r\non either side. The Swedes claim a victory, because they remained in the\r\nfield till the Russians quitted it. The latter effected a junction soon\r\nafter with another part of their fleet, and being now about ten ships\r\nstrongest, the Swedes retired into port, and it is imagined they will\r\nnot appear again under so great disparity; so that the campaign by sea\r\nis supposed to be finished. Their commerce will be at the mercy of their\r\nenemies: but they have put it out of the power of the Russians to send\r\nany fleet to the Mediterranean this year.\r\n\r\nA revolution has been effected very suddenly in the bishoprick of Liege.\r\nTheir constitution had been changed by force, by the reigning sovereign,\r\nabout one hundred years ago. This subject had been lately revived\r\nand discussed in print. The people were at length excited to assemble\r\ntumultuously. They sent for their Prince, who was at his country-seat,\r\nand required him to come to the town-house to hear their grievances.\r\nThough in the night, he came instantly, and was obliged to sign a\r\nrestitution of their ancient constitution, which took place on the spot,\r\nand all became quiet without a drop of blood spilt. This fact is worthy\r\nnotice, only as it shows the progress of the spirit of revolution.\r\n\r\nNo act of violence has taken place in Paris since my last, except on\r\naccount of the difference between the French and Swiss guards, which\r\ngave rise to occasional single combats, in which five or six were\r\nkilled. The difference is made up. Some misunderstandings had arisen\r\nbetween the committees of the different districts of Paris, as to the\r\nform of the future municipal government. These gave uneasiness for a\r\nwhile, but have been also reconciled. Still there is such a leaven of\r\nfermentation remaining in the body of the people, that acts of violence\r\nare always possible, and are quite unpunishable; there being, as yet, no\r\njudicature which can venture to act in any case, however small or great.\r\nThe country is becoming more calm. The embarrassments of the government,\r\nfor want of money, are extreme. The loan of thirty millions, proposed\r\nby Mr. Necker, has not succeeded at all. No taxes are paid. A total\r\nstoppage of all payment to the creditors of the State is possible every\r\nmoment. These form a great mass in the city as well as country, and\r\namong the lower class of people too, who have been used to carry their\r\nlittle savings of their service into the public funds, upon life rents\r\nof five, ten, twenty guineas a year, and many of whom have no other\r\ndependence for daily subsistence. A prodigious number of servants are\r\nnow also thrown out of employ by domestic reforms, rendered necessary\r\nby the late events. Add to this the want of bread, which is extreme.\r\nFor several days past, a considerable proportion of the people have been\r\nwithout bread altogether; for though the new harvest is begun, there is\r\nneither water nor wind to grind the grain. For some days past the people\r\nhave besieged the doors of the bakers, scrambled with one another for\r\nbread, collected in squads all over the city, and need only some slight\r\nincident to lead them to excesses which may end in, nobody can tell\r\nwhat. The danger from the want of bread, however, which is the most\r\nimminent, will certainly lessen in a few days. What turn that may take\r\nwhich arises from the want of money, is difficult to be foreseen. Mr.\r\nNecker is totally without influence in the National Assembly, and is, I\r\nbelieve, not satisfied with this want of importance. That Assembly has\r\njust finished their bill of rights. The question will then be, whether\r\nto take up first the constitution or the business of finance.\r\n\r\nNo plan of a constitution has been yet given in. But I can state to\r\nyou the outlines of what the leading members have in contemplation.\r\nThe executive power in a hereditary King, with power of dissolving\r\nthe legislature and a negative on their laws; his authority in forming\r\ntreaties to be greatly restrained. The legislative to be a single House\r\nof Representatives, chosen for two or three years. They propose a body\r\nwhom they call a Senate, to be chosen by the Provincial Assemblies, as\r\nour federal Senate is, but with no power of negativing or amending\r\nlaws; they may only remonstrate on them to the representatives, who will\r\ndecide by a simple majority the ultimate event of the law. This body\r\nwill therefore be a mere council of revision. It is proposed that they\r\nshall be of a certain age and property, and be for life. They may\r\nmake them also their court of impeachment. They will suppress the\r\nparliaments, and establish a system of judicature somewhat like that of\r\nEngland, with trial by jury in criminal cases, perhaps also in civil.\r\nEach province will have a subordinate provincial government, and the\r\ngreat cities, a municipal one on a free basis. These are the ideas\r\nand views of the most distinguished members. But they may suffer great\r\nmodifications from the Assembly, and the longer the delay, the greater\r\nwill be the modifications. Considerable interval having taken place\r\nsince any popular execution, the aristocratic party is raising its head.\r\nThey are strengthened by a considerable defection from the patriots,\r\nin consequence of the general suppression of the abuses of the 4th of\r\nAugust, in which many were interested. Another faction too, of the most\r\ndesperate views, has acquired strength in the Assembly, as well as out\r\nof it. These wish to dethrone the reigning branch, and transfer the\r\ncrown to the Duke d’Orleans. The members of this faction are mostly\r\npersons of wicked and desperate fortunes, who have nothing at heart\r\nbut to pillage from the wreck of their country. The Duke himself is as\r\nunprincipled as his followers; sunk in debaucheries of the lowest kind,\r\nand incapable of quitting them for business; not a fool, yet not head\r\nenough to conduct any thing. In fact, I suppose him used merely as a\r\ntool, because of his immense wealth, and that he acquired a certain\r\ndegree of popularity by his first opposition to the government, then\r\ncredited to him as upon virtuous motives. He is certainly borrowing\r\nmoney on a large scale. He is in understanding with the court of London,\r\nwhere he had been long in habits of intimacy. The ministry here are\r\napprehensive, that that ministry will support his designs by war. I have\r\nno idea of this, but no doubt, at the same time, that they will furnish\r\nhim money liberally to aliment a civil war, and prevent the regeneration\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to me, some days ago, that the court of Versailles\r\nwere treating with that of London, for a surrender of their West India\r\npossessions, in consideration of a great sum of money to relieve their\r\npresent distress. Every principle of common sense was in opposition\r\nto this fact; yet it was so affirmed as to merit inquiry. I became\r\nsatisfied the government had never such an idea; but that the story\r\nwas not without foundation altogether; that something like this was in\r\ncontemplation between the faction of Orleans and the court of London, as\r\na means of obtaining money from that court. In a conversation with\r\nthe Count de Montmorin, two days ago, he told me their colonies were\r\nspeaking a language which gave them uneasiness, and for which there\r\nwas no foundation. I asked him if he knew any thing of what I have just\r\nmentioned. He appeared unapprized of it, but to see at once that it\r\nwould be a probable speculation between two parties circumstanced and\r\nprincipled as those two are. I apologized to him for the inquiries I had\r\nmade into this business, by observing that it would be much against\r\nour interest, that any one power should monopolize all the West India\r\nislands. ‘_Parde, assurément_,’ was his answer.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of their islands is an idea prevailing in the minds\r\nof several members of the National Assembly, particularly those most\r\nenlightened and most liberal in their views. Such a step by this country\r\nwould lead to other emancipations or revolutions in the same quarter.\r\nI enclose you some papers received from Mr. Carmichael, relative to the\r\ncapture of one of our vessels by a Morocco cruiser, and restitution\r\nby the Emperor. I shall immediately write to M. Chiappe, to express a\r\nproper sense of the Emperor’s friendly dispositions to us. I forward\r\nalso the public papers to the present date; and have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.--TO JAMES MADISON, August 28,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, August 28,1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of July the 22nd. Since that, I have received yours\r\nof May the 27th, June 13th and 30th. The tranquillity of the city has\r\nnot been disturbed since my last. Dissensions between the French and\r\nSwiss guards occasioned some private combats, in which five or six were\r\nkilled. These dissensions are made up. The want of bread for some days\r\npast has greatly endangered the peace of the city. Some get a little,\r\nsome none at all. The poor are the best served, because they besiege\r\nperpetually the doors of the bakers. Notwithstanding this distress, and\r\nthe palpable impotence of the city administration to furnish bread to\r\nthe city, it was not till yesterday, that general leave was given to the\r\nbakers to go into the country and buy flour for themselves, as they can.\r\nThis will soon relieve us, because the wheat harvest is well advanced.’\r\nNever was there a country where the practice of governing too much, had\r\ntaken deeper root and done more mischief. Their declaration of rights\r\nis finished. If printed in time, I will enclose a copy with this. It is\r\ndoubtful whether they will now take up the finance or the constitution\r\nfirst. The distress for money endangers every thing. No taxes are paid,\r\nand no money can be borrowed. Mr. Necker was yesterday to give in a\r\nmemoir to the Assembly, on this subject. I think they will give him\r\nleave to put into execution any plan he pleases, so as to debarrass\r\nthemselves of this, and take up that of the constitution. No plan is\r\nyet reported; but the leading members (with some small difference of\r\nopinion) have in contemplation the following. The executive power in\r\na hereditary King, with a negative on laws, and power to dissolve the\r\nlegislature; to be considerably restrained in the making of\r\ntreaties, and limited in his expenses. The legislative in a House of\r\nRepresentatives. They propose a Senate also, chosen on the plan of our\r\nfederal Senate, by the Provincial Assemblies, but to be for life, of\r\na certain age, (they talk of forty years), and certain wealth (four or\r\nfive hundred guineas a year), but to have no other power as to laws\r\nbut to remonstrate against them to the representatives, who will\r\nthen determine their fate by a simple majority. This you will readily\r\nperceive is a mere council of revision, like that of New York, which,\r\nin order to be something, must form an alliance with the King, to avail\r\nthemselves of his veto. The alliance will be useful to both, and to the\r\nnation. The representatives to be chosen every two or three years.\r\nThe judiciary system is less prepared than any other part of the plan;\r\nhowever, they will abolish the parliaments, and establish an order of\r\njudges and justices, general and provincial, a good deal like ours, with\r\ntrial by jury in criminal cases certainly, perhaps also in civil. The\r\nprovinces will have Assemblies for their provincial government, and the\r\ncities a municipal body for municipal government, all founded on\r\nthe basis of popular election. These subordinate governments, though\r\ncompletely dependent on the general one, will be intrusted with almost\r\nthe whole of the details which our State governments exercise. They will\r\nhave their own judiciary, final in all but great cases, the executive\r\nbusiness will principally pass through their hands, and a certain local\r\nlegislature will be allowed them. In short, ours has been professedly\r\ntheir model, in which such changes are made as a difference of\r\ncircumstances rendered necessary, and some others neither necessary nor\r\nadvantageous, but into which men will ever run, when versed in theory\r\nand new in the practice of government, when acquainted with man only\r\nas they see him in their books and not in the world. This plan will\r\nundoubtedly undergo changes in the Assembly, and the longer it is\r\ndelayed, the greater will be the changes; for that Assembly, or rather\r\nthe patriotic part of it, hooped together heretofore by a common\r\nenemy, are less compact since their victory. That enemy (the civil and\r\necclesiastical aristocracy) begins to raise its head. The lees, too, of\r\nthe patriotic party, of wicked principles and desperate fortunes,\r\nhoping to pillage something in the wreck of their country, are attaching\r\nthemselves to the faction of the Duke of Orleans: that faction is\r\ncaballing with the populace, and intriguing at London, the Hague, and\r\nBerlin, and have evidently in view the transfer of the crown to the\r\nDuke of Orleans. He is a man of moderate understanding, of no principle,\r\nabsorbed in low vice, and incapable of abstracting himself from the\r\nfilth of that, to direct any thing else. His name and his money,\r\ntherefore, are mere tools in the hands of those who are duping him.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThey may produce a temporary confusion, and even a temporary civil war,\r\nsupported, as they will be, by the money of England; but they cannot\r\nhave success ultimately. The King, the mass of the substantial people\r\nof the whole country, the army, and the influential part of the clergy,\r\nform a firm phalanx which must prevail. Should those delays which\r\nnecessarily attend the deliberations of a body of one thousand two\r\nhundred men, give time to this plot to ripen and burst, so as to break\r\nup the Assembly before any thing definitive is done, a constitution,\r\nthe principles of which are pretty well settled in the minds of the\r\nAssembly, will be proposed by the national militia, (*****) urged by the\r\nindividual members of the Assembly, signed by the King and supported by\r\nthe nation, to prevail till circumstances shall permit its revision and\r\nmore regular sanction. This I suppose the _pis aller_ of their affairs,\r\nwhile their probable event is a peaceable settlement of them. They fear\r\na war from England, Holland, and Prussia. I think England will give\r\nmoney, but not make war. Holland would soon be afire, internally, were\r\nshe to be embroiled in external difficulties. Prussia must know this,\r\nand act accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to desire better dispositions towards us, than prevail\r\nin this Assembly. Our proceedings have been viewed as a model for them\r\non every occasion; and though in the heat of debate men are generally\r\ndisposed to contradict every authority urged by their opponents, ours\r\nhas been treated like that of the Bible, open to explanation, but not to\r\nquestion. I am sorry that in the moment of such a disposition, any thing\r\nshould come from us to check it. The placing them on a mere footing with\r\nthe English, will have this effect. When of two nations, the one has\r\nengaged herself in a ruinous war for us, has spent her blood and money\r\nto save us, has opened her bosom to us in peace, and received us almost\r\non the footing of her own citizens, while the other has moved heaven,\r\nearth, and hell to exterminate us in war, has insulted us in all\r\nher councils in peace, shut her doors to us in every part where her\r\ninterests would admit it, libelled us in foreign nations, endeavored to\r\npoison them against the reception of our most precious commodities; to\r\nplace these two nations on a footing, is to give a great deal more\r\nto one than to the other, if the maxim be true, that to make unequal\r\nquantities equal, you must add more to one than the other. To say, in\r\nexcuse, that gratitude is never to enter into the motives of national\r\nconduct, is to revive a principle which has been buried for centuries\r\nwith its kindred principles of the lawfulness of assassination, poison,\r\nperjury, &c. All of these were legitimate principles in the dark ages\r\nwhich intervened between ancient and modern civilization, but exploded\r\nand held in just horror in the eighteenth century. I know but one code\r\nof morality for men, whether acting singly or collectively. He who says\r\nI will be a rogue when I act in company with a hundred others, but an\r\nhonest man when I act alone, will be believed in the former assertion,\r\nbut not in the latter. I would say with the poet, ‘_Hie niger est; hunc\r\ntu, Romane, caveto_.’ If the morality of one man produces a just line of\r\nconduct in him, acting individually, why should not the morality of one\r\nhundred men produce a just line of conduct in them, acting together?\r\nBut I indulge myself in these reflections because my own feelings run me\r\ninto them; with you they were always acknowledged. Let us hope that our\r\nnew government will take some other occasion to show, that they mean to\r\nproscribe no virtue from the canons of their conduct with other nations.\r\nIn every other instance, the new government has ushered itself to the\r\nworld as honest, masculine, and dignified. It has shown genuine dignity,\r\nin my opinion, in exploding adulatory titles; they are the offerings of\r\nabject baseness, and nourish that degrading vice in the people.\r\n\r\nI must now say a word on the declaration of rights, you have been so\r\ngood as to send me. I like it, as far as it goes; but I should have been\r\nfor going further. For instance, the following alterations and additions\r\nwould have pleased me. Article 4. The people shall not be deprived of\r\ntheir right to speak, to write, or otherwise to publish any thing\r\nbut false facts affecting injuriously the life, liberty, property, or\r\nreputation of others, or affecting the peace of the confederacy\r\nwith foreign nations. Article 7. All facts put in issue before any\r\njudicature, shall be tried by jury, except, 1. in cases of admiralty\r\njurisdiction, wherein a foreigner shall be interested; 2. in cases\r\ncognizable before a court martial, concerning only the regular-officers\r\nand soldiers of the United States, or members of the militia in actual\r\nservice in time of war or insurrection; and 3. in impeachments allowed\r\nby the constitution. Article 8. No person shall be held in confinement\r\nmore than ------ days after he shall have demanded and been refused\r\na writ of habeas corpus by the judge appointed by law, nor more than\r\n------ days after such a writ shall have been served on the person\r\nholding him in confinement, and no order given on due examination for\r\nhis remandment or discharge, nor more than ------ hours in any place at\r\na greater distance than ------ miles from the usual residence of some\r\njudge authorized to issue the writ of habeas corpus; nor shall that writ\r\nbe suspended for any term exceeding one year, nor in any place more\r\nthan ------ miles distant from the State or encampment of enemies or of\r\ninsurgents. Article 9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their\r\nown productions in literature, and their own inventions in the arts, for\r\na term not exceeding ------ years, but for no longer term, and no other\r\npurpose. Article 10. All troops of the United States shall stand _ipso\r\nfacto_ disbanded, at the expiration of the term for which their pay and\r\nsubsistence shall have been last voted by Congress, and all officers\r\nand soldiers, not natives of the United States, shall be incapable of\r\nserving in their armies by land, except during a foreign war. These\r\nrestrictions I think are so guarded, as to hinder evil only. However, if\r\nwe do not have them now, I have so much confidence in my countrymen, as\r\nto be satisfied that we shall have them as soon as the degeneracy of our\r\ngovernment shall render them necessary.\r\n\r\nI have no certain news of Paul Jones. I understand only, in a general\r\nway, that some persecution on the part of his officers occasioned his\r\nbeing called to Petersburg, and that though protected against them\r\nby the Empress, he is not yet restored to his station. Silas Deane\r\nis coming over to finish his days in America, not having one sous to\r\nsubsist on, elsewhere. He is a wretched monument of the consequences of\r\na departure from right. I will, before my departure, write Colonel Lee\r\nfully the measures I pursued to procure success in his business, and\r\nwhich as yet offer little hope; and I shall leave it in the hands of\r\nMr. Short to be pursued, if any prospect opens on him. I propose to sail\r\nfrom Havre as soon after the first of October as I can get a vessel;\r\nand shall consequently leave this place a week earlier than that. As my\r\ndaughters will be with me, and their baggage somewhat more than that of\r\nmere voyageures, I shall endeavor, if possible, to obtain a passage for\r\nVirginia directly. Probably I shall be there by the last of November. If\r\nmy immediate attendance at New York should be requisite for any purpose,\r\nI will leave them with a relation near Richmond, and proceed immediately\r\nto New York. But as I do not foresee any pressing purpose for that\r\njourney immediately on my arrival, and as it will be a great saving of\r\ntime, to finish at once in Virginia, so as to have no occasion to return\r\nthere after having once gone on to the northward, I expect to proceed to\r\nmy own house directly. Staying there two months (which I believe will be\r\nnecessary), and allowing for the time I am on the road, I may expect to\r\nbe at New York in February, and to embark from thence or some eastern\r\nport. You ask me if I would accept any appointment on that side of the\r\nwater? You know the circumstances which led me from retirement, step by\r\nstep, and from one nomination to another, up to the present. My object\r\nis a return to the same retirement. Whenever, therefore, I quit\r\nthe present, it will not be to engage in any other office, and most\r\nespecially any one which would require a constant residence from home.\r\nThe books I have collected for you will go off for Havre in three or\r\nfour days, with my baggage. From that port, I shall try to send them by\r\na direct occasion to New York.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend\r\nand servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. I just now learn that Mr. Necker proposed yesterday to the\r\nNational Assembly a loan of eighty millions, on terms more tempting to\r\nthe lender than the former, and that they approved it, leaving him to\r\narrange the details, in order that they might occupy themselves at once\r\nabout the constitution. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.--TO JAMES MADISON, September 6, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, September 6, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI sit down to write to you, without knowing by what occasion I shall\r\nsend my letter. I do it, because a subject comes into my head, which I\r\nwrould wish to develope[sp.] a little more than is practicable in the\r\nhurry of the moment of making up general despatches.\r\n\r\nThe question, whether one generation of men has a right to bind another,\r\nseems never to have been started either on this, or our side of the\r\nwater. Yet it is a question of such consequences as not only to merit\r\ndecision, but place also among the fundamental principles of every\r\ngovernment. The course of reflection in which we are immersed here, on\r\nthe elementary principles of society, has presented this question to my\r\nmind; and that no such obligation can be so transmitted, I think very\r\ncapable of proof. I set out on this ground, which I suppose to be\r\nself-evident, that _the earth belongs in usufruct to the living_: that\r\nthe dead have neither powers nor rights over it. The portion occupied by\r\nany individual ceases to be his when himself ceases to be, and reverts\r\nto the society. If the society has formed no rules for the appropriation\r\nof its lands in severalty, it will be taken by the first occupants, and\r\nthese will generally be the wife and children of the decedent. If they\r\nhave formed rules of appropriation, those rules may give it to the wife\r\nand children, or to some one of them, or to the legatee of the deceased.\r\nSo they may give it to his creditor.\r\n\r\nBut the child, the legatee, or creditor, takes it not by natural right,\r\nbut by a law of the society of which he is a member, and to which he\r\nis subject. Then, no man can, by natural right, oblige the lands he\r\noccupied, or the persons who succeed him in that occupation, to the\r\npayment of debts contracted by him. For if he could, he might, during\r\nhis own life, eat up the usufruct of the lands for several generations\r\nto come; and then the lands would belong to the dead, and not to the\r\nliving, which is the reverse of our principle.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of every member of the society individually, is true of\r\nthem all collectively; since the rights of the whole can be no more than\r\nthe sum of the rights of the individuals. To keep our ideas clear when\r\napplying them to a multitude, let us suppose a whole generation of men\r\nto be born on the same day, to attain mature age on the same day, and\r\nto die on the same day, leaving a succeeding generation in the moment of\r\nattaining their mature age, all together. Let the ripe age be supposed\r\nof twenty-one years, and their period of life thirty-four years more,\r\nthat being the average term given by the bills of mortality to persons\r\nof twenty-one years of age. Each successive generation would, in this\r\nway, come and go off the stage at a fixed moment, as individuals do now.\r\nThen I say, the earth belongs to each of these generations during its\r\ncourse, fully and in its own right. The second generation receives\r\nit clear of the debts and incumbrances of the first, the third of the\r\nsecond, and so on. For if the first could charge it with a debt, then\r\nthe earth would belong to the dead and not to the living generation.\r\nThen no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during\r\nthe course of its own existence. At twenty-one years of age, they\r\nmay bind themselves and their lands for thirty-four years to come; at\r\ntwenty-two, for thirty-three; at twenty-three, for thirty-two; and at\r\nfifty-four, for one year only; because these are the terms of life which\r\nremain to them at the respective epochs. But a material difference must\r\nbe noted, between the succession of an individual and that of a whole\r\ngeneration. Individuals are parts only of a society, subject to the laws\r\nof the whole. These laws may appropriate the portion of land occupied by\r\na decedent, to his creditor rather than to any other, or to his child,\r\non condition he satisfies the creditor. But when a whole generation,\r\nthat is, the whole society, dies, as in the case we have supposed, and\r\nanother generation or society succeeds, this forms a whole, and there\r\nis no superior who can give their territory to a third society, who may\r\nhave lent money to their predecessors, beyond their faculties of paying.\r\nWhat is true of generations succeeding one another at fixed epochs,\r\nas has been supposed for clearer conception, is true for those\r\nrenewed daily, as in the actual course of nature. As a majority of the\r\ncontracting generation will continue in being thirty-four years, and a\r\nnew majority will then come into possession, the former may extend their\r\nengagements to that term, and no longer. The conclusion, then, is, that\r\nneither the representatives of a nation, nor the whole nation itself\r\nassembled, can validly engage debts beyond what they may pay in their\r\nown time, that is to say, within thirty-four years from the date of the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nTo render this conclusion palpable, suppose that Louis the XIV. and XV.\r\nhad contracted debts in the name of the French nation, to the amount\r\nof ten thousand milliards, and that the whole had been contracted in\r\nHolland. The interest of this sum would be five hundred milliards, which\r\nis the whole rent-roll or nett[sp.] proceeds of the territory of France.\r\nMust the present generation of men have retired from the territory in\r\nwhich nature produces them, and ceded it to the Dutch creditors? No;\r\nthey have the same rights over the soil on which they were produced, as\r\nthe preceding generations had. They derive these rights not from them,\r\nbut from nature. They, then, and their soil are, by nature, clear of the\r\ndebts of their predecessors. To present this in another point of\r\nview, suppose Louis XV. and his cotemporary generation had said to the\r\nmoney-lenders of Holland, Give us money, that we may eat, drink, and be\r\nmerry in our day; and on condition you will demand no interest till the\r\nend of thirty-four years, you shall then, for ever after, receive\r\nan annual interest of fifteen per cent. The money is lent on these\r\nconditions, is divided among the people, eaten, drunk, and squandered.\r\nWould the present generation be obliged to apply the produce of the\r\nearth and of their labor, to replace their dissipations? Not at all.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the received opinion, that the public debts of one\r\ngeneration devolve on the next, has been suggested by our seeing,\r\nhabitually, in private life, that he who succeeds to lands is required\r\nto pay the debts of his predecessor; without considering that this\r\nrequisition is municipal only, not moral, flowing from the will of the\r\nsociety, which has found it convenient to appropriate the lands of a\r\ndecedent on the condition of a payment of his debts: but that between\r\nsociety and society, or generation and generation, there is no municipal\r\nobligation, no umpire, but the law of nature.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the national debt of France being, in fact, but a two\r\nthousandth part of its rent-roll, the payment of it is practicable\r\nenough; and so becomes a question merely of honor or of expediency. But\r\nwith respect to future debts, would it not be wise and just for that\r\nnation to declare in the constitution they are forming, that neither the\r\nlegislature nor the nation itself, can validly contract more debt than\r\nthey may pay within their own age, or within the term of thirty-four\r\nyears? And that all future contracts shall be deemed void, as to what\r\nshall remain unpaid at the end of thirty-four years from their date?\r\nThis would put the lenders, and the borrowers also, on their guard. By\r\nreducing, too, the faculty of borrowing within its natural limits, it\r\nwould bridle the spirit of war, to which too free a course has been\r\nprocured by the inattention of money-lenders to this law of nature, that\r\nsucceeding generations are not responsible for the preceding.\r\n\r\nOn similar ground it may be proved, that no society can make a perpetual\r\nconstitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the\r\nliving generation: they may manage it, then, and what proceeds from it,\r\nas they please, during their usufruct. They are masters, too, of their\r\nown persons, and consequently may govern them as they please. But\r\npersons and property make the sum of the objects of government. The\r\nconstitution and the laws of their predecessors are extinguished then,\r\nin their natural course, with those whose will gave them being. This\r\ncould preserve that being, till it ceased to be itself, and no longer.\r\nEvery constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of\r\nthirty-four years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force and\r\nnot of right. It may be said that the succeeding generation exercising,\r\nin fact, the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the\r\nconstitution or law had been expressly limited to thirty-four years\r\nonly. In the first place, this objection admits the right, in proposing\r\nan equivalent. But the power of repeal is not an equivalent. It might\r\nbe, indeed, if every form of government were so perfectly contrived,\r\nthat the will of the majority could always be obtained, fairly and\r\nwithout impediment. But this is true of no form. The people cannot\r\nassemble themselves; their representation is unequal and vicious.\r\nVarious checks are opposed to every legislative proposition. Factions\r\nget possession of the public councils, bribery corrupts them, personal\r\ninterests lead them astray from the general interests of their\r\nconstituents; and other impediments arise, so as to prove to every\r\npractical man, that a law of limited duration is much more manageable\r\nthan one which needs a repeal.\r\n\r\nThis principle, that the earth belongs to the living and not to the\r\ndead, is of very extensive application and consequences in every\r\ncountry, and most especially in France. It enters into the resolution of\r\nthe questions, whether the nation may change the descent of lands\r\nholden in tail; whether they may change the appropriation of lands given\r\nanciently to the church, to hospitals, colleges, orders of chivalry,\r\nand otherwise in perpetuity whether they may abolish the charges\r\nand privileges attached on lands, including the whole catalogue,\r\necclesiastical and feudal; it goes to hereditary offices, authorities,\r\nand jurisdictions, to hereditary orders, distinctions, and appellations,\r\nto perpetual monopolies in commerce, the arts, or sciences, with a long\r\ntrain of _et ceteras_; and it renders the question of reimbursement,\r\na question of generosity and not of right. In all these cases,\r\nthe legislature of the day could authorize such appropriations and\r\nestablishments for their own time, but no longer; and the present\r\nholders, even where they or their ancestors have purchased, are in\r\nthe case of _bonâ fide_ purchasers of what the seller had no right to\r\nconvey.\r\n\r\nTurn the subject in your mind, my Dear Sir, and particularly as to the\r\npower of contracting debts, and develope it with that cogent logic which\r\nis so peculiarly yours. Your station in the councils of our country\r\ngives you an opportunity of producing it to public consideration, of\r\nforcing it into discussion. At first blush it may be laughed at, as\r\nthe dream of a theorist; but examination will prove it to be solid and\r\nsalutary. It would furnish matter for a fine preamble to our first\r\nlaw for appropriating the public revenue: and it will exclude, at the\r\nthreshold of our new government, the ruinous and contagious errors of\r\nthis quarter of the globe, which have armed despots with means which\r\nnature does not sanction, for binding in chains their fellow-men. We\r\nhave already given, in example, one effectual check to the dog of war,\r\nby transferring the power of declaring war from the executive to the\r\nlegislative body, from those who are to spend, to those who are to pay.\r\nI should be pleased to see this second obstacle held out by us also,\r\nin the first instance. No nation can make a declaration against the\r\nvalidity of long contracted debts, so disinterestedly as we, since we\r\ndo not owe a shilling which will not be paid, principal and interest, by\r\nthe measures you have taken, within the time of our own lives. I write\r\nyou no news, because when an occasion occurs, I shall write a separate\r\nletter for that.\r\n\r\nI am always, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.--TO DR. GEM\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO DR. GEM.\r\n\r\nThe hurry in which I wrote my letter to Mr. Madison, which is in your\r\nhands, occasioned an inattention to the difference between generations\r\nsucceeding each other at fixed epochs, and generations renewed daily\r\nand hourly. It is true that in the former case, the generation when\r\nat twenty-one years of age, may contract a debt for thirty-four\r\nyours, because a majority of them will live so long. But a generation\r\nconsisting of all ages, and which legislates by all its members above\r\nthe age of twenty-one years, cannot contract for so long a time, because\r\ntheir majority will be dead much sooner. Buffon gives us a table of\r\ntwenty-three thousand nine hundred and ninety-four deaths, stating\r\nthe ages at which they happened. To draw from these the result I have\r\noccasion for, I suppose a society in which twenty-three thousand nine\r\nhundred and ninety-four persons are born every year, and live to the age\r\nstated in Buffon’s table. Then, the following inferences may be drawn.\r\nSuch a society will consist constantly of six hundred and seventeen\r\nthousand seven hundred and three persons, of all ages. Of those living\r\nat any one instant of time, one half will be dead in twenty-four years\r\nand eight months. In such a society, ten thousand six hundred and\r\nseventy-five will arrive every year at the age of twenty-one years\r\ncomplete. It will constantly have three hundred and forty-eight thousand\r\nfour hundred and seventeen persons of all ages above twenty-one years,\r\nand the half of those of twenty-one years and upwards living at any one\r\ninstant of time, will be dead in eighteen years and eight months, or say\r\nnineteen years.\r\n\r\nThen, the contracts, constitutions, and laws of every such society\r\nbecome void in nineteen years from their date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.--TO GENERAL KNOX, September 12,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KNOX.\r\n\r\nParis, September 12,1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn a letter which I had the honor of writing to the Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs, some three or four years ago, I informed him that a\r\nworkman here had undertaken by the help of moulds and other means,\r\nto make all the parts of the musket so exactly alike, as that, mixed\r\ntogether promiscuously, any one part should serve equally for every\r\nmusket. He had then succeeded as to the lock both of the officer’s fusil\r\nand the soldier’s musket. From a promiscuous collection of parts, I put\r\ntogether myself half a dozen locks, taking the first pieces which came\r\nto hand. He has now completed the barrel, stock, and mounting of the\r\nofficer’s fusil, and is proceeding on those of the soldier’s musket.\r\nThis method of forming the fire-arm appears to me so advantageous when\r\nrepairs become necessary, that I thought it my duty not only to mention\r\nto you the progress of this artist, but to purchase and send you half a\r\ndozen of his officer’s fusils. They are packed in a box marked T. J. No.\r\n36, and are sent to Havre, from whence they shall be forwarded to New\r\nYork. The barrels and furniture are to their stocks, to prevent the\r\nwarping of the wood. The locks are in pieces. You will find with them\r\ntools for putting them together, also a single specimen of his soldier’s\r\nlock. He formerly told me, and still tells me, that he shall be able,\r\nafter a while, to furnish them cheaper than the common musket of the\r\nsame quality, but at first, they will not be so cheap in the first cost,\r\nthough the economy in repairs will make them so in the end. He cannot\r\ntell me exactly, at what price he can furnish them. Nor will he be able,\r\nimmediately, to furnish any great quantity annually; but with the aid of\r\nthe government, he expects to enlarge his establishment greatly. If the\r\nsituation of the finances of this country should oblige the government\r\nto abandon him, he would prefer removing with all his people and\r\nimplements to America, if we should desire to establish such a\r\nmanufacture, and he would expect our government to take all his\r\nimplements, on their own account, at what they have cost him. He talked\r\nof about three thousand guineas. I trouble you with these details, and\r\nwith the samples, 1. That you may give the idea of such an improvement\r\nto our own workmen, if you think it might answer any good end. 2. That\r\nall the arms he shall have for sale, may be engaged for our government,\r\nif he continues here, and you think it important to engage them. 3.\r\nThat you may consider, and do me the honor of communicating your\r\ndetermination, whether in the event of his establishment being abandoned\r\nby this government, it might be thought worth while to transfer it to\r\nthe United States, on conditions somewhat like those he has talked of.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.--TO E. RUTLEDGE, September 18, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nParis, September 18, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor by Mr. Cutting, enclosing the paper\r\nfrom Doctor Trumbull, for which I am very thankful. The conjecture that\r\ninhabitants may have been carried from the coast of Africa to that of\r\nAmerica, by the trade winds, is possible enough; and its probability\r\nwould be greatly strengthened by ascertaining a similarity of language,\r\nwhich I consider as the strongest of all proofs of consanguinity among\r\nnations. Still a question would remain between the red men of the\r\neastern and western sides of the Atlantic, which is the stock, and which\r\nthe shoot. If a fact be true, which I suspect to be true, that there is\r\na much greater number of radical languages among those of America than\r\namong those of the other hemisphere, it would be a proof of superior\r\nantiquity, which I can conceive no arguments strong enough to overrule.\r\n\r\nWhen I received your letter, the time of my departure was too near to\r\npermit me to obtain information from Constantinople, relative to the\r\ndemand and price of rice there. I therefore wrote to a merchant at\r\nMarseilles, concerned in the Levant trade, for the prices current of\r\nrice at Constantinople and at Marseilles for several years past. He has\r\nsent me only the present price at Marseilles, and that of a particular\r\ncargo at Constantinople. I send you a copy of his letter. The Algerines\r\nform an obstacle; but the object of our commerce in the Mediterranean\r\nis so immense, that we ought to surmount that obstacle, and I believe\r\nit could be done by means in our power, and which, instead of fouling us\r\nwith the dishonorable and criminal baseness of France and England, will\r\nplace us in the road to respect with all the world.\r\n\r\nI have obtained, and enclose to you, a state of all the rice imported\r\ninto this country in the course of one year, which shows its annual\r\nconsumption to be between eighty-one and eighty-two thousand quintals.\r\nI think you may supplant all the other furnishing States, except as to\r\nwhat is consumed at Marseilles and its neighborhood. In fact, Paris is\r\nthe place of main consumption. Havre, therefore, is the port of deposit,\r\nwhere you ought to have one or two honest, intelligent, and active\r\nconsignees. The ill success of a first or second experiment should not\r\ndamp the endeavors to open this market fully, but the obstacles should\r\nbe forced by perseverance. I have obtained, from different quarters,\r\nseeds of the dry rice; but having had time to try them, I find they\r\nwill not vegetate, having been too long kept. I have still several other\r\nexpectations from the East Indies. If this rice be as good, the object\r\nof health will render it worth experiment with you. Cotton is a precious\r\nresource, and which cannot fail with you. I wish the cargo of olive\r\nplants sent by the way of Baltimore, and that which you will perceive my\r\ncorrespondent is preparing now to send, may arrive to you in good order.\r\nThis is the object for the patriots of your country; for that tree\r\nonce established there, will be the source of the greatest wealth and\r\nhappiness. But to insure success, perseverance may be necessary. An\r\nessay or two may fail. I think, therefore, that an annual sum should\r\nbe subscribed, and it need not be a great one. A common country laborer\r\nshould be engaged to make it his sole occupation, to prepare and pack\r\nplants and berries at Marseilles, and in the autumn to go with them\r\nhimself through the canal of Languedoc to Bordeaux, and there to stay\r\nwith them till he can put them on board a vessel bound directly to\r\nCharleston; and this repeated annually, till you have a sufficient stock\r\ninsured, to propagate from, without further importation. I should guess\r\nthat fifty guineas a year would do this, and if you think proper to set\r\nsuch a subscription afoot, write me down for ten guineas of the money,\r\nyearly, during my stay in France, and offer my superintendence of the\r\nbusiness on this side the water if no better can be had.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutting does full justice to the honorable dispositions of the\r\nlegislature of South Carolina towards their foreign creditors. None have\r\nyet come into the propositions sent to me, except the Van Staphorsts.\r\n\r\nThe clanger of famine here has not ceased with a plentiful harvest.\r\nA new and unskilful administration has not yet got into the way of\r\nbringing regular supplies to the capital. We are in danger of hourly\r\ninsurrection for the want of bread; and an insurrection once begun\r\nfor that cause, may associate itself with those discontented for other\r\ncauses, and produce incalculable events. But if the want of bread\r\ndoes not produce a commencement of disorder, I am of opinion the\r\nother discontents will be stifled, and a good and free constitution\r\nestablished without opposition. In fact, the mass of the people, the\r\nclergy, and army, (excepting the higher orders of the three bodies) are\r\nin as compact an union as can be. The National Assembly have decided\r\nthat their executive shall be hereditary, and shall have a suspensive\r\nnegative on the laws; that the legislature shall be of one House, annual\r\nin its sessions and biennial in its elections. Their declaration\r\nof rights will give you their other general views. I am just on my\r\ndeparture for Virginia, where the arrangement of my affairs will detain\r\nme the winter; after which (say in February) I shall go on to New York,\r\nto embark from some northern port for France. In the mean while and\r\nalways, I am with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.--TO JOHN JAY, September 19, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, September 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you on the 30th of the last month.\r\nSince that, I have taken the liberty of consigning to you a box of\r\nofficers’ muskets, containing half a dozen, made by the person and on the\r\nplan which I mentioned to you in a letter which I cannot turn to at this\r\nmoment, but I think it was of the year 1785. A more particular account\r\nof them you will find in the enclosed copy of a letter which I have\r\nwritten to General Knox. The box is marked T. J. No. 36, is gone to\r\nHavre, and will be forwarded to you by the first vessel bound to New\r\nYork, by Mr. Nathaniel Cutting, an American gentleman establishing\r\nhimself there.\r\n\r\nRecalling to your mind the account I gave you of the number and size\r\nof ships fitted out by the English last year, for the northern\r\nwhale-fishery, and comparing with it what they have fitted out this\r\nyear, for the same fishery, the comparison will stand thus:\r\n\r\n     Years.    Vessels.  Tons.     Men.\r\n\r\n     1788.       255    75,436    10,710\r\n\r\n     1789.       178    51,473     7,476\r\n\r\n     Difference.  77    23,963     3,234\r\n\r\nBy which you will perceive, that they have lost a third of that fishery\r\nin one year, which I think almost entirely, if not quite, ascribable to\r\nthe shutting the French ports against their oil. I have no account of\r\ntheir southern fishery of the present year.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was informed that our bankers had the money ready for the\r\nredemption of our captives, I went to the General of the order of\r\nthe Holy Trinity, who retained all his dispositions to aid us in\r\nthat business. Having a very confidential agent at Marseilles, better\r\nacquainted than himself with the details, he wrote to him for his\r\nopinion and information on the subject. I enclose you a copy of his\r\nanswer, the original of which was communicated to me. I thereupon have\r\nauthorized the General to go as far as three thousand livres a head\r\nfor our captives, and for this purpose to adopt the plan proposed, of\r\nsending one of his own religion at our expense (which will be small), or\r\nany other plan he thinks best. The honesty and goodness of his character\r\nplaces us in safety in his hands. To leave him without any hesitation in\r\nengaging himself for such a sum of money, it was necessary to deposit it\r\nin a banker’s hands here. Mr. Grand’s were agreeable to him, and I have\r\ntherefore desired our banker at Amsterdam to remit it here. I do not\r\napprehend, in the progress of the present revolution, any thing like a\r\ngeneral bankruptcy which should pervade the whole class of bankers. Were\r\nsuch an event to appear imminent, the excessive caution of the house of\r\nGrand and Company establishes it in the general opinion as the last that\r\nwould give way, and consequently would give time to withdraw this money\r\nfrom their hands. Mr. Short will attend to this, and will withdraw the\r\nmoney on the first well-founded appearance of danger. He has asked me\r\nwhat he shall do with it. Because it is evident, that when Grand cannot\r\nbe trusted, no other individual at Paris can, and a general bankruptcy\r\ncan only be the effect of such disorders, as would render every private\r\nhouse an insecure deposit, I have not hesitated to say to him, in such\r\nan event, ‘Pay it to the government.’ In this case, it becomes only a\r\nchange of destination and no loss at all. But this has passed between us\r\nfor greater caution only, and on the worst case supposable: for though a\r\nsuspension of payment by government might affect the bankers a little, I\r\ndoubt if any of them have embarked so much in the hands of government as\r\nto endanger failure, and especially as they have had such long warning.\r\n\r\nYou will have known, that the ordinance passed by M. de Chillon in St.\r\nDomingo, for opening ports to our importations in another part of the\r\nisland, was protested against by Marbois. He had always led the Count\r\nde la Luzerne by the nose, while Governor of that island.\r\nMarbois’ representations, and Luzerne’s prepossessions against our trade\r\nwith their colonies, occasioned him, as minister of that department,\r\nnot only to reverse the ordinance, but to recall Chillon and send out\r\na successor. Chillon has arrived here, and having rendered himself very\r\npopular in the islands, their deputies in the National Assembly have\r\nbrought the question before them. The Assembly has done nothing more,\r\nas yet, than to appoint a committee of inquiry. So much of Chillon’s\r\nordinance as admitted the importation of our provisions, is continued\r\nfor a time. M. de Marbois, too, is recalled, I know not why or how. M.\r\nde la Luzerne’s conduct will probably come under view only incidentally\r\nto the general question urged by the colony deputies, whether they shall\r\nnot be free in future, to procure provisions where they can procure\r\nthem cheapest. But the deputies are disposed to treat M. de la Luzerne\r\nroughly. This, with the disgrace of his brother, the Bishop de Langres,\r\nturned out of the presidentship of the National Assembly, for partiality\r\nin office to the aristocratic principles, and the disfavor of the\r\nAssembly towards M. de la Luzerne himself, as having been formerly of\r\nthe plot (as they call it) with Breteuil and Broglio, will probably\r\noccasion him to be out of office soon.\r\n\r\nThe treasury board have no doubt attended to the necessity of giving\r\ntimely orders for the payment of the February interest at Amsterdam.\r\nI am well informed that our credit is now the first at that exchange,\r\n(England not borrowing at present.) Our five per cent, bonds have\r\nrisen to ninety-seven and ninety-nine. They have been heretofore at\r\nninety-three. There are, at this time, several companies and individuals\r\nhere, in England, and Holland, negotiating to sell large parcels of our\r\nliquidated debt. A bargain was concluded by one of these the other day,\r\nfor six hundred thousand dollars. In the present state of our credit,\r\nevery dollar of this debt will probably be transferred to Europe within\r\na short time.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 20th. The combination of bankers and other ministerial\r\ntools had led me into the error (when I wrote my last letter), into\r\nwhich they had led most people, that the loan lately opened here went on\r\nwell. The truth is, that very little has been borrowed, perhaps not more\r\nthan six or eight millions. The King and his ministers were yesterday to\r\ncarry their plate to the mint. The ladies are giving up their jewels to\r\nthe National Assembly. A contribution of plate in the time of Louis XV.\r\nis said to have carried about eight millions to the treasury. Plate is\r\nmuch more common now, and therefore, if the example prevail now in\r\nthe same degree it did then, it will produce more. The contribution of\r\njewels will hardly be general, and will be unproductive. Mr. Necker\r\nis, on the 25th, to go to the Assembly, to make some proposition. The\r\nhundreth penny is talked of.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly proceeds slowly in the forming their constitution. The\r\noriginal vice of their numbers causes this, as well as a tumultuous\r\nmanner of doing business. They have voted that the elections of the\r\nlegislature shall be biennial; that it shall be of a single body; but\r\nthey have not yet decided what shall be its number, or whether they\r\nshall be all in one room, or in two (which they call a division into\r\nsections). They have determined that the King shall have a suspensive\r\nand iterative veto: that is, that after negativing a law, it cannot be\r\npresented again till after a new election. If he negatives it then, it\r\ncannot be presented a third time till after another new election. If\r\nit be then presented, he is obliged to pass it. This is perhaps justly\r\nconsidered as a more useful negative than an absolute one, which a King\r\nwould be afraid to use. Mr. Necker’s influence with the Assembly is\r\nnothing at all. Having written to them, by order of the King, on the\r\nsubject of the veto, before it was decided, they refused to let his\r\nletter be read. Again, lately, when they desired the sanction of the\r\nKing to their proceedings of the fourth of August, he wrote in the\r\nKing’s name a letter to them, remonstrating against an immediate sanction\r\nto the whole; but they persisted, and the sanction was given. His\r\ndisgust at this want of influence, together with the great difficulties\r\nof his situation, make it believed that he is desirous of resigning. The\r\npublic stocks were extremely low the day before yesterday. The _caisse\r\nd’escompte_ at three thousand six hundred and forty, and the loan of\r\none hundred and twenty-five millions, of 1784, was at fifteen per\r\ncent. loss. Yesterday they rose a little. The sloth of the assembly\r\n(unavoidable from their number) has done the most sensible injury to the\r\npublic cause. The patience of a people, who have less of that quality\r\nthan any other nation in the world, is worn thread-bare. Time has been\r\ngiven to the aristocrats to recover from their panic, to cabal, to\r\nsow dissensions in the Assembly, and distrust out of it. It has been a\r\nmisfortune, that the King and aristocracy together have not been able\r\nto make a sufficient resistance, to hoop the patriots in a compact body.\r\nHaving no common enemy of such force as to render their union necessary,\r\nthey have suffered themselves to divide. The Assembly now consists of\r\nfour distinct parties. 1. The aristocrats, comprehending the higher\r\nmembers of the clergy, military, nobility, and the parliaments of\r\nthe whole kingdom. This forms a head without a body. 2. The moderate\r\nroyalists, who wish for a constitution nearly similar to that of\r\nEngland. 3. The republicans, who are willing to let their first\r\nmagistracy be hereditary, but to make it very subordinate to the\r\nlegislature, and to have that legislature consist of a single chamber.\r\n4. The faction of Orleans. The second and third descriptions are\r\ncomposed of honest, well meaning men, differing in opinion only, but\r\nboth wishing the establishment of as great a degree of liberty as can\r\nbe preserved. They are considered together as constituting the patriotic\r\npart of the Assembly, and they are supported by the soldiery of the\r\narmy, the soldiery of the clergy, that is to say, the Cures and monks,\r\nthe dissenters, and part of the nobility which is small, and the\r\nsubstantial Bourgeoisie of the whole nation. The part of these collected\r\nin the cities, have formed themselves into municipal bodies, have\r\nchosen municipal representatives, and have organized an armed corps,\r\nconsiderably more numerous in the whole than the regular army. They have\r\nalso the ministry, such as it is, and as yet, the King. Were the second\r\nand third parties, or rather these sections of the same party, to\r\nseparate entirely, this great mass of power and wealth would be split,\r\nno body knows how. But I do not think they will separate; because\r\nthey have the same honest views; because, each being confident of the\r\nrectitude of the other, there is no rancor between them; because they\r\nretain the desire of coalescing. In order to effect this, they not long\r\nago proposed a conference, and desired it might be at my house, which\r\ngave me an opportunity of judging of their views. They discussed\r\ntogether their points of difference for six hours, and in the course of\r\ndiscussion agreed on mutual sacrifices. The effect of this agreement\r\nhas been considerably defeated by the subsequent proceedings of the\r\nAssembly, but I do not know that it has been through any infidelity of\r\nthe leaders to the compromise they had agreed on. Another powerful bond\r\nof union between these two parties, is our friend the Marquis de la\r\nFayette. He left the Assembly while they as yet formed but one party.\r\nHis attachment to both is equal, and he labors incessantly to keep them\r\ntogether. Should he be obliged to take part against either, it will be\r\nagainst that which shall first pass the Rubicon of reconciliation\r\nwith the other. I should hope, in this event, that his weight would\r\nbe sufficient to turn the scale decidedly in favor of the other. His\r\ncommand of the armed militia of Paris (thirty thousand in number, and\r\ncomprehending the French guards, who are five thousand regulars), and\r\nhis influence with the municipality, would secure their city: and though\r\nthe armed militia and municipalities of the other cities are in no wise\r\nsubordinate to those of Paris, yet they look up to them with respect,\r\nand look particularly to the Marquis de la Fayette, as leading always to\r\nthe rights of the people. This turn of things is so probable, that I do\r\nnot think either section of the patriots will venture on any act, which\r\nwill place themselves in opposition to him.\r\n\r\nThis being the face of things, troubled as you will perceive, civil\r\nwar is much talked of and expected; and this talk and expectation has a\r\ntendency to beget it. What are the events which may produce it? 1. The\r\nwant of bread, were it to produce a commencement of disorder, might ally\r\nitself to more permanent causes of discontent, and thus continue the\r\neffect beyond its first cause. The scarcity of bread, which continues\r\nvery great amidst a plenty of corn, is an enigma which can be\r\nsolved only by observing, that the furnishing the city is in the new\r\nmunicipality, not yet masters of their trade. 2. A public bankruptcy.\r\nGreat numbers of the lower as well as higher classes of the citizens,\r\ndepend for subsistence on their property in the public funds. 3. The\r\nabsconding of the King from Versailles. This has for some time been\r\napprehended as possible. In consequence of this apprehension, a person,\r\nwhose information would have weight, wrote to the Count de Montmorin,\r\nadjuring him to prevent it by every possible means, and assuring him\r\nthat the flight of the King would be the signal of a St. Barthelemi\r\nagainst the aristocrats in Paris, and perhaps through the kingdom. M. de\r\nMontmorin showed the letter to the Queen, who assured him solemnly that\r\nno such thing was in contemplation. His showing it to the Queen, proves\r\nhe entertained the same mistrust with the public. It may be asked, What\r\nis the Queen disposed to do in the present situation of things? Whatever\r\nrage, pride, and fear can dictate in a breast which never knew the\r\npresence of one moral restraint.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I do not see it as yet probable that any actual\r\ncommotion will take place; and if it does take place, I have strong\r\nconfidence that the patriotic party will hold together, and their party\r\nin the nation be what I have described it. In this case, there would be\r\nagainst them the aristocracy and the faction of Orleans. This consists,\r\nat this time, of only the Catilines of the Assembly, and some of the\r\nlowest descriptions of the mob. Its force, within the kingdom, must\r\ndepend on how much of this last kind of people it can debauch with money\r\nfrom its present bias to the right cause. This bias is as strong as any\r\none can be, in a class which must accept its bread from him who will\r\ngive it. Its resources out of the kingdom are not known. Without doubt,\r\nEngland will give money to produce and to feed the fire which should\r\nconsume this country; but it is not probable she will engage in open\r\nwar for that. If foreign troops should be furnished, it would be most\r\nprobably by the King of Prussia, who seems to offer himself as the\r\nbull-dog of tyranny to all his neighbors. He might, too, be disturbed by\r\nthe contagion of the same principles gaining his own subjects, as\r\nthey have done those of the Austrian Netherlands, Liege, Cologne, and\r\nHesse-Cassel. The army of the latter Prince, joining with his subjects,\r\nare said to have possessed themselves of the treasures he had amassed\r\nby hiring troops to conquer us, and by other iniquities. Fifty-four\r\nmillions of livres is the sum mentioned. But all these means, external\r\nand internal must prove inadequate to their ultimate object, if the\r\nnation be united as it is at present. Expecting within a few days to\r\nleave Paris, and that this is my last letter on public subjects, I have\r\nindulged myself in giving you a general view of things, as they appear\r\nto me at the time of my leaving them. Mr. Short will have the honor\r\nof continuing the narration, and of correcting it, where circumstances\r\nunknown or unforseen may give a different turn to events.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI.--TO MR. NECKER, September 26,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NECKER.\r\n\r\nParis, September 26,1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of waiting on you at Versailles, the day before\r\nyesterday, in order to present my respects on my departure to America. I\r\nwas unlucky in the moment, as it was one in which you were gone out.\r\n\r\nI wished to have put into your hands, at the same time, the enclosed\r\nstate of the British northern fishery for the years 1788 and 1789, by\r\nwhich you will see that they have lost in one year, one third of that\r\nfishery, the effect, almost solely, of the _Arrêt_ which shut the ports\r\nof France to their oils.\r\n\r\nI wished also to know, whether, while in America, I could be useful\r\ntowards encouraging supplies of provision to be brought to this country\r\nthe ensuing year. I am persuaded a considerable relief to the city\r\nof Paris might be obtained, by permitting the importation of salted\r\nprovisions from the United States. Our salted beef, particularly,\r\n(which, since the war, we have learned to prepare in the Irish manner,\r\nso as to be as good as the best of that country) could be sold out to\r\nthe people of Paris, for the half of what they pay for fresh meat. It\r\nwould seem then, that the laborer paying but half the usual price\r\nfor his meat, might pay the full price of his bread, and so relieve\r\ngovernment from its loss on that article. The interest of the\r\n_gabelles_ has been an objection, hitherto, to the importation of salted\r\nprovisions. But that objection is lessened by the reduction of the price\r\nof salt, and done away entirely, by the desire of the present government\r\nto consider the ease and happiness of the people as the first object. In\r\nevery country as fully peopled as France, it would seem good policy to\r\nencourage the employment of its lands in the cultivation of corn, rather\r\nthan in pasturage, and consequently to encourage the use of all kinds of\r\nsalted provisions, because they can be imported from other countries.\r\nIt may be apprehended, that the Parisian, habituated to fresh provision,\r\nwould not use salted. Then he would not buy them, and of course they\r\nwould not be brought, so that no harm can be done by the permission.\r\nOn the contrary, if the people of Paris should readily adopt the use of\r\nsalted provisions, the good would result which is before mentioned. Salt\r\nmeat is not as good as fresh for soups, but it gives an higher flavor\r\nto the vegetables boiled with it. The experience of a great part\r\nof America, which is fed almost entirely on it, proves it to be as\r\nwholesome as fresh meat. The sea scurvy, ascribed by some to the use of\r\nsalt meat, is equally unknown in America as in Europe. It is the want\r\nof vegetables at sea which produces the scurvy. I have thus hastily\r\nmentioned reasons and objections, to save you the time and trouble of\r\nrecollecting them. To you, Sir, it suffices barely to mention them. Mr.\r\nShort, _chargé des affaires_ of the United States, will have the honor\r\nof delivering you this, and of giving you any further details which you\r\nmay be pleased to require.\r\n\r\nI shall hope, on my return in the spring, to find your health\r\nreestablished, and your mind relieved by a perfect settlement of the\r\naffairs of the nation; and with my felicitations on those accounts, to\r\nexpress to you those sentiments of profound respect and attachment, with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, your Excellency’s most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.--TO JOHN JAY, September 30, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nHavre, September 30, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nNo convenient ship having offered from any port of France, I have\r\nengaged one from London to take me up at Cowes, and am so far on my way\r\nthither. She will land me at Norfolk, and as I do not know any service\r\nthat would be rendered by my repairing immediately to New York, I\r\npropose, in order to economize time, to go directly to my own house, get\r\nthrough the business which calls me there, and then repair to New York,\r\nwhere I shall be ready to re-embark for Europe. But should there be\r\nany occasion for government to receive any information I can give,\r\nimmediately on my arrival, I will go to New York on receiving your\r\norders at Richmond. They may probably be there before me, as this goes\r\nby Mr. Trumbull, bound directly for New York.\r\n\r\nI enclose you herewith the proceedings of the National Assembly on\r\nSaturday last, wherein you will perceive that the committee had approved\r\nthe plan of Mr. Necker. I can add from other sure information received\r\nhere, that the Assembly adopted it the same evening. This plan may\r\npossibly keep their payments alive till their new government gets into\r\nmotion; though I do not think it very certain. The public stocks lowered\r\nso exceedingly the last days of my stay at Paris, that I wrote to our\r\nbankers at Amsterdam, to desire they would retain till further orders\r\nthe thirty thousand guilders, or so much of it as had not yet come on.\r\nAnd as to what might be already coming on, I recommended to Mr. Short to\r\ngo and take the acceptance himself, and keep the bill in his own hands\r\ntill the time of payment. He will by that time see what is best to be\r\ndone with the money.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of Monsieur de Montmorin, I asked him whether their West\r\nIndia ports would continue open to us a while. He said they would be\r\nimmediately declared, open till February, and we may be sure they will\r\nbe so till the next harvest. He agreed with me, that there would be two\r\nor three months’ provision for the whole kingdom wanting for the ensuing\r\nyear. The consumption of bread for the whole kingdom, is two millions\r\nof livres tournois, a day. The people pay the real price of their bread\r\nevery where, except at Paris and Versailles. There the price is suffered\r\nto vary very little as to them, and government pays the difference. It\r\nhas been supposed that this difference for some time past has cost a\r\nmillion a week. I thought the occasion favorable to propose to Monsieur\r\nde Montmorin the free admission of our salted provisions, observing to\r\nhim, particularly, that our salted beef from the eastern States could be\r\ndealt out to the people of Paris for five or six sols the pound, which\r\nis but half the common price they pay for fresh beef; that the Parisian\r\npaying less for his meat, might pay more for his bread, and so relieve\r\ngovernment from its enormous loss on that article. His idea of this\r\nresource seemed unfavorable. We talked over the objections of the\r\nsupposed unhealthiness of that food, its tendency to produce scurvy,\r\nthe chance of its taking with a people habituated to fresh meat, their\r\ncomparative qualities of rendering vegetables eatable, and the interests\r\nof the _gabelles_. He concluded with saying the experiment might be\r\ntried, and with desiring me to speak with Mr. Necker. I went to Mr.\r\nNecker, but he had gone to the National Assembly. On my return to Paris,\r\ntherefore, I wrote to him on the subject, going over the objections\r\nwhich Monsieur de Montmorin had started. Mr. Short was to carry the\r\nletter himself, and to pursue the subject.\r\n\r\nHaving observed that our commerce to Havre is considerably on the\r\nincrease, and that most of our vessels coming there, and especially\r\nthose from the eastward, are obliged to make a voyage round to the\r\nneighborhood of the Loire and Garonne for salt, a voyage attended with\r\nexpense, delay, and more risk, I have obtained from the Farmers General,\r\nthat they shall be supplied from their magazines at Honfleur, opposite\r\nto Havre, at a mercantile price. They fix it at present at sixty livres\r\nthe _muid_, which comes to about, fifteen sous, or seven and a half\r\npence sterling our bushel; but it will vary as the price varies at the\r\nplace from which they bring it. As this will be a great relief to such\r\nof our vessels coming to Havre, as might wish to take back salt, it may\r\nperhaps be proper to notify it to our merchants. I enclose herewith Mr.\r\nNecker’s discourse to the Assembly, which was not printed till I left\r\nParis: and have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect\r\nesteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.--TO THE PRESIDENT, December 15,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nChesterfield, December 15,1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received at this place the honor of your letters of October the\r\n13th and November the 30th, and am truly flattered by your nomination of\r\nme to the very dignified office of Secretary of State; for which permit\r\nme here to return you my humble thanks. Could any circumstance seduce\r\nme to overlook the disproportion between its duties and my talents, it\r\nwould be the encouragement of your choice. But when I contemplate\r\nthe extent of that office, embracing as it does the principal mass\r\nof domestic administration, together with the foreign, I cannot be\r\ninsensible of my inequality to it; and I should enter on it with gloomy\r\nforebodings from the criticisms and censures of a public, just indeed in\r\ntheir intentions, but sometimes misinformed and misled, and always too\r\nrespectable to be neglected. T cannot but foresee the possibility\r\nthat this may end disagreeably for me, who, having no motive to public\r\nservice but the public satisfaction, would certainly retire the moment\r\nthat satisfaction should appear to languish. On the other hand, I feel\r\na degree of familiarity with the duties of my present office, as far\r\nat least as I am capable of understanding its duties. The ground I have\r\nalready passed over, enables me to see my way into that which is before\r\nme. The change of government too, taking place in the country where\r\nit is exercised, seems to open a possibility of procuring from the new\r\nrulers some new advantages in commerce, which may be agreeable to our\r\ncountrymen. So that as far as my fears, my hopes, or my inclination\r\nmight enter into this question, I confess they would not lead me to\r\nprefer a change.\r\n\r\nBut it is not for an individual to choose his post. You are to marshal\r\nus as may best be for the public good; and it is only in the case of its\r\nbeing indifferent to you, that I would avail myself of the option\r\nyou have so kindly offered in your letter. If you think it better to\r\ntransfer me to another post, my inclination must be no obstacle; nor\r\nshall it be, if there is any desire to suppress the office I now hold,\r\nor to reduce its grade. In either of these cases, be so good only as to\r\nsignify to me by another line your ultimate wish, and I shall conform\r\nto it cordially. If it should be to remain at New York, my chief comfort\r\nwill be to work under your eye, my only shelter the authority of your\r\nname, and the wisdom of measures to be dictated by you and implicitly\r\nexecuted by me. Whatever you may be pleased to decide, I do not see that\r\nthe matters which have called me hither, will permit me to shorten\r\nthe stay I originally asked; that is to say, to set out on my journey\r\nnorthward till the month of March. As early as possible in that month,\r\nI shall have the honor of paying my respects to you in New York. In the\r\nmean time, I have that of tendering you the homage of those sentiments\r\nof respectful attachment, with which I am, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.--TO HENRY LAURENS, ESQUIRE, March 31, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY LAURENS, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\nNew York, March 31, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nEncroachments being made on the eastern limits of the United States, by\r\nsettlers under the British government, pretending that it is the\r\nwestern and not the eastern river of the bay of Passamaquoddy, which\r\nwas designated by the name of St. Croix in the treaty of peace with that\r\nnation, I have to beg the favor of you to communicate any facts which\r\nyour memory or papers may enable you to recollect, and which may\r\nindicate the true river, the commissioners on both sides had in their\r\nview to establish as the boundary between the two nations. It will be of\r\nsome consequence to be informed by what map they traced the boundary.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.--TO MR. VANDERKEMP, March 31, 1799\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VANDERKEMP.\r\n\r\nNew York, March 31, 1799.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe letter has been duly received which you addressed to th© President\r\nof the United States, praying his interference with the government of\r\nthe United Netherlands, on the subject of property you left there on\r\ncoming to America. I have it in charge to inform you that the United\r\nStates have at present no minister at the Hague, and consequently\r\nno channel through which they could express their concern for your\r\ninterests. However willing, too, we are to receive and protect all\r\npersons who come hither, with the property they bring, perhaps it may be\r\ndoubted, how far it would be expedient to engage ourselves for what they\r\nleave behind, or for any other matter retrospective to their becoming\r\ncitizens. In the present instance, we hope, that no confiscation of the\r\nresiduum of your property left in the United Netherlands having taken\r\nplace, the justice of that government will leave you no occasion for\r\nthat interference which you have been pleased to ask from this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.--TO GEORGE JOY, March 31, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE JOY.\r\n\r\nNew York, March 31, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have considered your application for sea-letters for the ship Eliza,\r\nand examined into the precedents which you supposed might influence the\r\ndetermination. The resolution of Congress, which imposes this duty on\r\nthe Secretary for Foreign Affairs, provides expressly, ‘that it be made\r\nto appear to him by oath or affirmation, or by such other evidence as\r\nshall by him be deemed satisfactory, that the vessel is commanded by\r\nofficers, citizens of the United States.’ Your affidavit satisfies me\r\nthat one of the officers is a citizen of the United States; but you are\r\nunacquainted with the others, and without evidence as to them, and even\r\nwithout a presumption that they are citizens, except so far as arises\r\non the circumstances of the captain’s being an American, and the ship\r\nsailing from an American port. Now, I cannot in my conscience say, that\r\nthis is evidence of the fact, satisfactory to my mind. The precedents\r\nof relaxation by Mr. Jay, were all between the date of the resolution\r\nof Congress (February the 12th, 1788) and his public advertisement,\r\nannouncing the evidence which must be produced. Since this last, the\r\nproceedings have been uniform and exact. Having perfect confidence in\r\nyour good faith, and therefore without a suspicion of any fraud\r\nintended in the present case, I could have wished sincerely to grant the\r\nsea-letter; but besides the letter of the law which ties me down, the\r\npublic security against a partial dispensation of justice, depends on\r\nits being dispensed by certain rules. The slightest deviation in one\r\ncircumstance, becomes a precedent for another, that for a third, and so\r\non without bounds. A relaxation in a case where it is certain no fraud\r\nis intended, is laid hold of by others, afterwards, to cover fraud. I\r\nhope, therefore, you will be sensible of the necessity of my adhering to\r\nthe rules which have been published and practised by my predecessor; and\r\nthat I am with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, April 6, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 6, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States having thought proper to assign to\r\nme other functions than those of their Minister Plenipotentiary near the\r\nKing, I have the honor of addressing to your Excellency my letters of\r\nrecall, and of beseeching you to be so good as to present them, with the\r\nhomage of my respectful adieus, to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that I find myself authorized to conclude,\r\nas I had begun my mission, with assurances of the attachment of our\r\ngovernment to the King and his people, and of its desire to preserve\r\nand strengthen the harmony and good understanding, which has hitherto so\r\nhappily subsisted between the two nations.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to place here, also, my acknowledgments to your\r\nExcellency, personally, for the facilities you have been pleased always\r\nto give in the negotiation of the several matters I have had occasion to\r\ntreat with you during my residence at your court. They were ever such as\r\nto evince, that the friendly dispositions towards our republic which you\r\nmanifested even from its birth, were still found consistent with\r\nthat patriotism of which you have continued to give such constant\r\nand disinterested proofs. May this union of interests for ever be the\r\npatriot’s creed in both countries. Accept my sincere prayers that the\r\nKing, with life and health, may be long blessed with so faithful and\r\nable a servant, and you with a Prince, the model of royal excellence;\r\nand permit me to retain, to my latest hours, those sentiments of\r\naffectionate respect and attachment, with which I have the honor to be\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, April 6,1790\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 6,1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States having been pleased, in the month of\r\nJune last, to give me leave of absence for some time from the court of\r\nFrance, and to appoint Mr. William Short _chargé des affaires_ for the\r\nUnited States during my absence, and having since thought proper to call\r\nme to the office of Secretary of State, comprehending that of Foreign\r\nAffairs, I have now the honor of requesting you to give credence to\r\nwhatever Mr. Short shall say to you on my part. He knows the interest\r\nwhich our republic takes in the prosperity of France, our strong desire\r\nto cultivate its friendship, and my zeal to promote it by whatever may\r\ndepend on my ministry, and I have no doubt he will so conduct himself as\r\nto merit your confidence. I avail myself of this occasion of tendering\r\nyou assurances of the sentiments of respect and esteem, with which I\r\nhave the honor to be your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIV.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, April 6, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 6, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of March the 28th. Since that, yours of the 2nd and\r\n6th of January have come to hand, together with the ratification of the\r\nconsular convention.\r\n\r\nI send you herewith a letter from the President to the King, notifying\r\nmy recall, with a letter of leave to Monsieur de Montmorin, and another\r\nof credence for you to the same, all of which you will be pleased to\r\ndeliver to him. Copies of them are enclosed for your information.\r\n\r\nWe are extremely mortified at the prospect there is, that the act of\r\njustice and gratitude to the court of France, which Congress, in the\r\nfirst moment it ever was in their power, have been, and still are\r\npreparing, may arrive too late, to save that court from the necessity of\r\nparting with our debt to a disadvantage. The Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nhaving by order of Congress reported a plan for funding both our foreign\r\nand domestic debts, they thought it necessary, by a re-commitment, to\r\nsubject that part of it which concerned the domestic debt, to maturer\r\ndiscussion. But the clause ‘for making such adequate provision for\r\nfulfilling our engagements in respect to our foreign debt,’ was not\r\nre-committed, because not susceptible of any abridgment or modification.\r\nOn the contrary, it was passed without a dissenting voice, and only\r\nwaits till the residue of that system of which it makes a part, can\r\nbe digested and put into the form of a law. I send you a copy of the\r\nresolution, to be communicated to Monsieur de Montmorin and Monsieur\r\nNecker, and anxiously wish it may arrive in time to prevent a\r\ndisadvantageous alienation, by satisfying these ministers that we are\r\nexerting ourselves to repay to that country, in her hour of difficulty,\r\nwhat she generously advanced for us, in ours.\r\n\r\nYou may remember, I purchased some officer’s fusils, had them packed in\r\nmy presence, and sent with my own baggage to Havre. When they arrived\r\nhere, the plates and other principal parts of the locks were no longer\r\nin the box. It is necessary, therefore, that the workman send you six\r\nnew locks, which may be applied to the stocks and barrels we have, and\r\nthat you be so good as to forward these by the first safe conveyance.\r\n\r\nPress the negotiation for our captives, in the line and on the terms I\r\nhad fixed, not binding us further without further advice, and be pleased\r\nto apprize us of its present situation and future progress, as being a\r\nsubject we have at heart.\r\n\r\nThe Leyden gazettes furnishing so good information of the interesting\r\nscenes now passing in Europe, I must ask your particular attention to\r\nthe forwarding them as frequently as it is possible to find conveyances.\r\nThe English papers bring their lies very fresh, and it is very desirable\r\nto be provided with an authentic contradiction in the first moment.\r\n\r\nYou will receive, herewith, the newspapers and other interesting papers,\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.--TO THE COUNT DE FLORIDA BLANCA, April 11, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE FLORIDA BLANCA.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 11, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States having thought proper to name Mr.\r\nWilliam Carmichael their _chargé des affaires_, near his Catholic\r\nMajesty, I have now the honor of announcing the same to your Excellency,\r\nand of praying you to give credence to whatever he shall say to you on\r\nmy part. He knows the concern our republic takes in the interest and\r\nprosperity of Spain, our strong desire to cultivate its friendship, and\r\nto deserve it by all the good offices which esteem and neighborhood may\r\ndictate; he knows also my zeal to promote these by whatever may depend\r\non my ministry. I have no doubt that Mr. Carmichael will so conduct\r\nhimself as to merit your confidence; and I avail myself with pleasure\r\nof this occasion of tendering to you assurances of those sentiments of\r\nrespect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency’s\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, April 11, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nA vessel being about sail from this port for Cadiz, I avail myself of it\r\nto inform you, that under the appointment of the President of the\r\nUnited States, I have entered on the duties of Secretary of State,\r\ncomprehending the department of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Jay’s letter of\r\nOctober the 2nd acknowledged the receipt of the last of yours which\r\nhave come to hand. Since that date he wrote you on the 7th of December,\r\nenclosing a letter for Mr. Chiappe.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of his letter of September the 9 th, 1788, having never been\r\nacknowledged, the contents of which were important and an answer wished\r\nfor, I send you herewith a duplicate, lest it should have miscarried.\r\n\r\nYou will also receive, herewith, a letter of credence for yourself, to\r\nbe delivered to the Count de Florida Blanca, after putting thereon the\r\nproper address, with which I am unacquainted. A copy of it is enclosed\r\nfor your information.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to recommend the case of Don Blas Gonzalez to your good\r\noffices with the court of Spain, enclosing you the documents necessary\r\nfor its illustration. You will perceive, that two vessels were sent\r\nfrom Boston in the year 1787, on a voyage of discovery and commercial\r\nexperiment in general, but more particularly to try a fur-trade with the\r\nRussian settlements, on the northwest coast of our continent, of which\r\nsuch wonders have been published in Captain Cook’s voyages, that it\r\nexcited similar expeditions from other countries also; and that the\r\nAmerican vessels were expressly forbidden to touch at any Spanish port,\r\nbut in cases of extreme distress. Accordingly, through the whole of\r\ntheir voyage through the extensive latitudes held by that crown, they\r\nnever put into any port but in a single instance. In passing near the\r\nisland of Juan Fernandez, one of them was damaged by a storm, her rudder\r\nbroken, her mast disabled, and herself separated from her companion. She\r\nput into the island to refit, and at the same time, to wood and water,\r\nof which she began to be in want. Don Blas Gonzalez, after examining\r\nher, and finding she had nothing on board but provisions and charts, and\r\nthat her distress was real, permitted her to stay a few days, to refit\r\nand take in fresh supplies of wood and water. For this act of common\r\nhospitality, he was immediately deprived of his government, unheard, by\r\nsuperior order, and remains still under disgrace. We pretend not to\r\nknow the regulations of the Spanish government, as to the admission\r\nof foreign vessels into the ports of their colonies; but the generous\r\ncharacter of the nation is a security to us, that their regulations can,\r\nin no instance, run counter to the laws of nature; and among the first\r\nof her laws, is that which bids us to succor those in distress. For an\r\nobedience to this law, Don Blas appears to have suffered; and we are\r\nsatisfied, it is because his case has not been able to penetrate to his\r\nMajesty’s ministers, at least, in its true colors. We would not choose\r\nto be committed by a formal solicitation, but we would wish you to avail\r\nyourself of any good opportunity of introducing the truth to the ear of\r\nthe minister, and of satisfying him, that a redress of this hardship on\r\nthe Governor would be received here with pleasure, as a proof of respect\r\nto those laws of hospitality which we would certainly observe in a like\r\ncase, as a mark of attention towards us, and of justice to an individual\r\nfor whose sufferings we cannot but feel.\r\n\r\nWith the present letter, you will receive the public and other papers as\r\nusual, and I shall thank you in return, for a regular communication of\r\nthe best gazettes published in Madrid.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII.--TO MR. GRAND, April 23, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GRAND.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 23, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou may remember that we were together at the Hôtel de la Monnoye, to\r\nsee Mr. Drost strike coins in his new manner, and that you were so kind\r\nas to speak with him afterwards on the subject of his coming to America.\r\nWe are now in a condition to establish a mint, and should be desirous\r\nof engaging him in it. I suppose him to be at present in the service\r\nof Watt and Bolton, the latter of whom you may remember to have been\r\npresent with us at the Monnoye. I know no means of communicating our\r\ndispositions to Drost so effectually as through your friendly agency,\r\nand therefore take the liberty of asking you to write to him, to know\r\nwhat emoluments he receives from Watts and Bolton, and whether he would\r\nbe willing to come to us for the same? If he will, you may give him an\r\nexpectation, but without an absolute engagement, that we will call for\r\nhim immediately, and that with himself, we may probably take and pay him\r\nfor all the implements of coinage he may have, suited to our purpose. If\r\nhe asks higher terms, he will naturally tell you so, and what they are;\r\nand we must reserve a right to consider of them. In either case, I will\r\nask your answer as soon as possible. I need not observe to you, that\r\nthis negotiation should be known to nobody but yourself, Drost, and Mr.\r\nShort. The good old Dr. Franklin, so long the ornament of our country,\r\nand, I may say, of the world, has at length closed his eminent career.\r\nHe died on the 17th instant, of an imposthume of his lungs, which having\r\nsuppurated and burst, he had not strength to throw off the matter, and\r\nwas suffocated by it. His illness from this imposthume was of sixteen\r\ndays. Congress wear mourning for him, by a resolve of their body.\r\n\r\nI beg you to present my friendly respects to Madame Grand, the elder and\r\nyounger, and to your son, and believe me to be, with sentiments of great\r\nesteem and attachment, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA LUZERNE, April 30,1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA LUZERNE.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 30,1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nWhen in the course of your legation to the United States, your affairs\r\nrendered it necessary that you should absent yourself a while from that\r\nstation, we flattered ourselves with the hope that that absence was not\r\nfinal. It turned out, in event, that the interests of your sovereign\r\ncalled for your talents and the exercise of your functions, in another\r\nquarter. You were pleased to announce this to the former Congress\r\nthrough their Secretary for Foreign Affairs, at a time when, that body\r\nwas closing its administration, in order to hand it over to a government\r\nthen preparing on a different model. This government is now formed,\r\norganized, and in action; and it considers among its earliest duties,\r\nand assuredly among its most cordial, to testify to you the regret which\r\nthe people and government of the United States felt at your removal from\r\namong them; a very general and sincere regret, and tempered only by the\r\nconsolation of your personal advancement, which accompanied it. You will\r\nreceive, Sir, by order of the President of the United States, as soon\r\nas they can be prepared, a medal and chain of gold, of which he desires\r\nyour acceptance, in token of their esteem, and of the sensibility with\r\nwhich they will ever recall your legation to their memory.\r\n\r\nBut as this compliment may hereafter be rendered to other missions, from\r\nwhich yours was distinguished by eminent circumstances, the President\r\nof the United States wishes to pay you the distinguished tribute of an\r\nexpress acknowledgment of your services, and our sense of them. You came\r\nto us, Sir, through all the perils which encompassed us on all sides.\r\nYou found us struggling and suffering under difficulties, as singular\r\nand trying as our situation was new and unprecedented. Your magnanimous\r\nnation had taken side with us in the conflict, and yourself became\r\nthe centre of our common councils, the link which connected our common\r\noperations. In that position you labored without ceasing, till all our\r\nlabors were crowned with glory to your nation, freedom to ours, and\r\nbenefit to both. During the whole, we had constant evidence of your\r\nzeal, your abilities, and your good faith. We desire to convey this\r\ntestimony of it home to your own breast, and to that of your sovereign,\r\nour best and greatest friend; and this I do, Sir, in the name, and by\r\nthe express instruction of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nI feel how flattering it is to me, Sir, to be the organ of the public\r\nsense on this occasion, and to be justified, by that office, in adding\r\nto theirs, the homage of those sentiments of respect and esteem, with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be your Excellency’s most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIX.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, April 30, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNew York, April 30, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was of the 6th instant, acknowledging the receipt\r\nof your favors of the 2nd and 6th of January. Since that, Mr. Jay has\r\nput into my hands yours of the 12th of January, and I have received your\r\nnote of February the 10th, accompanying some newspapers.\r\n\r\nMine of the 6th covered the President’s letter to the King for my\r\nrecall, and my letters of leave for myself and of credence to you,\r\nfor the Count de Montmorin, with copies of them for your information.\r\nDuplicates of all these accompany the present; and an original\r\ncommission for you as _chargé des affaires_, signed by the President.\r\nAt the date of my former letters, I had not had time to examine with\r\nminuteness the proper form of credentials under our new constitution: I\r\ngoverned myself, therefore, by foreign precedents, according to which a\r\n_chargé des affaires_ is furnished with only a letter of credence from\r\none minister of Foreign Affairs to the other. Further researches have\r\nshown me, that under our new constitution, all commissions (or papers\r\namounting to that) must be signed by the President. You will judge\r\nwhether any explanation on this subject to M. de Montmorin be necessary.\r\nI enclose you also the copy of a letter written to the Marquis de la\r\nLuzerne, to be communicated to the Count de Montmorin, and by him to the\r\nKing, if he thinks proper.\r\n\r\nIt has become necessary to determine on a present proper to be given to\r\ndiplomatic characters on their taking leave of us; and it is concluded\r\nthat a medal and chain of gold will be the most convenient. I have,\r\ntherefore, to ask the favor of you to order the dies to be engraved with\r\nall the despatch practicable.\r\n\r\nThe medal must be of thirty lines diameter, with a loop on the edge to\r\nreceive the chain. On one side, must be the arms of the United States,\r\nof which I send you a written description, and several impressions in\r\nwax to render that more intelligible; round them, as a legend, must be\r\n‘The United States of America.’ The device of the other side we do not\r\ndecide on. One suggestion has been a Columbia (a fine female figure),\r\ndelivering the emblems of peace and commerce to a Mercury, with a legend\r\n‘Peace and Commerce’ circumscribed, and the date of our republic, to\r\nwit, IV July ‘MDCCLXXVI,’ subscribed as an exergum: but having little\r\nconfidence in our own ideas in an art not familiar here, they are only\r\nsuggested to you, to be altered, or altogether postponed to such better\r\ndevice as you may approve, on consulting with those who are in the habit\r\nand study of medals. Duvivier and Dupre seem to be the best workmen;\r\nperhaps the last is the best of the two.\r\n\r\nThe public papers, which accompany this, will give you fully the news of\r\nthis quarter.\r\n\r\nI am with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.--TO MR. DUMAS, June 23, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nNew York, June 23, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI arrived at this place the letter[sp.] end of March, and undertook\r\nthe office to which the President had been pleased to appoint me, of\r\nSecretary of State, which comprehends that of Foreign Affairs. Before I\r\nhad got through the most pressing matters which had been accumulating, a\r\nlong illness came upon me, and put it out of my power for many weeks to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of your letters.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWe are much pleased to learn the credit of our paper at Amsterdam. We\r\nconsider it as of the first importance, to possess the first credit\r\nthere, and to use it little. Our distance from the wars of Europe, and\r\nour disposition to take no part in them, will, we hope, enable us to\r\nkeep clear of the debts which they occasion to other powers. It will be\r\nwell for yourself and our bankers, to keep in mind always, that a great\r\ndistinction is made here, between our foreign and domestic paper. As to\r\nthe foreign, Congress is considered as the representative of one party\r\nonly, and I think I can say with truth, that there is not one single\r\nindividual in the United States, either in or out of office, who\r\nsupposes they can ever do any thing which might impair their foreign\r\ncontracts. But with respect to domestic paper, it is thought that\r\nCongress, being the representative of both parties, may shape their\r\ncontracts so as to render them practicable, only seeing that substantial\r\njustice be done. This distinction will explain to you their proceedings\r\non the subject of their debts. The funding their foreign debts,\r\naccording to express contract, passed without a debate and without a\r\ndissenting voice. The modeling and funding the domestic debt occasions\r\ngreat debates and great difficulty. The bill of ways and means was\r\nlately thrown out, because an excise was interwoven into its texture;\r\nand another ordered to be brought in, which will be clear of that. The\r\nassumption of the debts contracted by the States to individuals,\r\nfor services rendered the Union, is a measure which divides Congress\r\ngreatly. Some think that the States could much more conveniently levy\r\ntaxes themselves to pay off these, and thus save Congress from the odium\r\nof imposing too heavy burthens in their name. This appears to have\r\nbeen the sentiment of the majority hitherto. But it is possible that\r\nmodifications may be proposed, which may bring the measure yet into an\r\nacceptable form. We shall receive with gratitude the copy of Rymer’s\r\nFoedera, which you are so good as to propose for the use of our offices\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.--TO MR. DUMAS, July 13,1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nNew York, July 13,1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 23rd of June, since which I have received yours\r\nof March the 24th to the 30th.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nCongress are still engaged in their funding bills. The foreign debts did\r\nnot admit of any difference of opinion. They were settled by a single\r\nand unanimous vote: but the domestic debt requiring modifications and\r\nsettlements, these produce great difference of opinion, and consequently\r\nretard the passage of the funding bill. The States had individually\r\ncontracted considerable debts for their particular defence, in addition\r\nto what was done by Congress. Some of the States have so exerted\r\nthemselves since the war, as to have paid off near the half of their\r\nindividual debts. Others have done nothing. The State creditors urge,\r\nthat these debts were as much for general purposes as those contracted\r\nby Congress, and insist that Congress shall assume and pay such of\r\nthem as have not been yet paid by their own States. The States who have\r\nexerted themselves most, find, that notwithstanding the great payments\r\nthey have made, they shall by this assumption, still have nearly as much\r\nto pay as if they had never paid any thing. They are therfore opposed\r\nto it. I am in hopes a compromise will be effected by a proportional\r\nassumption, which may reach a great part of the debts, and leave still\r\na part of them to be paid by those States who have paid few or none\r\nof their creditors. This being once settled, Congress will probably\r\nadjourn, and meet again in December, at Philadelphia. The appearance of\r\nwar between our two neighbors, Spain and England, would render a longer\r\nadjournment inexpedient.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII--TO WILLIAM SHORT, July 26, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNew York, July 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy public letters to you have been of the 28th of March, the 6th and\r\n30th of April. Yours, which remain to be acknowledged, are of March the\r\n9th, 17th, 29th, April the 4th, 12th, 23rd, and May the 1st; being from\r\nNo. 21 to 28, inclusive, except No. 23, which had come to hand before. I\r\nwill state to you the dates of all your letters received by me, with the\r\ntimes they have been received, and length of their passage.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nYou will perceive that they average eleven weeks and a half; that the\r\nquickest are of nine weeks, and the longest are of near eighteen weeks\r\ncoming. Our information through the English papers is of about five\r\nor six weeks, and we generally remain as long afterwards in anxious\r\nsuspense, till the receipt of your letters may enable us to decide what\r\narticles of those papers have been true. As these come principally\r\nby the English packet, I will take the liberty of asking you to write\r\nalways by that packet, giving a full detail of such events as may be\r\ncommunicated through that channel; and indeed most may. If your letters\r\nleave Paris nine or ten days before the sailing of the packet, we shall\r\nbe able to decide, on the moment, on the facts true or false, with which\r\nshe comes charged. For communications of a secret nature, you will avail\r\nyourself of other conveyances, and you will be enabled to judge\r\nwhich are best, by the preceding statement. News from Europe is very\r\ninteresting at this moment, when it is so doubtful whether a war will\r\ntake place between our two neighbors.\r\n\r\nCongress have passed an act for establishing the seat of government\r\nat Georgetown, from the year 1800, and in the mean time to remove to\r\nPhiladelphia. It is to that place, therefore, that your future letters\r\nhad better be addressed. They have still before them the bill for\r\nfunding the public debts. That has been hitherto delayed by a question,\r\nwhether the debts contracted by the particular Slates for general\r\npurposes should, at once, be assumed by the General Government. A\r\ndevelopement of circumstances, and more mature consideration, seem to\r\nhave produced some change of opinion on the subject. When it was first\r\nproposed, a majority was against it. There is reason to believe, by\r\nthe complexion of some later votes, that the majority will now be for\r\nassuming these debts to a fixed amount. Twenty-one millions of dollars\r\nare proposed. As soon as this point is settled, the funding bill will\r\npass, and Congress will adjourn. That adjournment will probably be\r\nbetween the 6th and 13th of August. They expect it sooner. I shall then\r\nbe enabled to inform you, ultimately, on the subject of the French\r\ndebt, the negotiations for the payment of which will be referred to the\r\nexecutive, and will not be retarded by them an unnecessary moment. A\r\nbill has passed, authorizing the President to raise the salary of a\r\n_Chargé des Affaires_ to four thousand five hundred dollars, from the\r\nfirst day of July last. I am authorized by him to inform you, that\r\nyours will accordingly be at that rate, and that you will be allowed for\r\ngazettes, translating or printing papers, where that shall be necessary,\r\npostage, couriers, and necessary aids to poor American sailors, in\r\naddition to the salary, and no charge of any other description, except\r\nwhere you may be directed to incur it expressly. I have thought it would\r\nbe most agreeable to you to give you precise information, that you may\r\nbe in no doubt in what manner to state your accounts. Be pleased to\r\nsettle your account down to the 1st of July last, and state the balance\r\nthen due, which will be to be paid out of the former fund. From that\r\nday downwards, a new account must be opened, because a new fund is\r\nappropriated to it, from that time. The expenses for the medals,\r\ndirected in my letter of April the 30th, must enter into the new\r\naccount. As I presume the die will be finished by the time you receive\r\nthis, I have to desire you will have a medal of gold struck for the\r\nMarquis de la Luzerne, and have put to it a chain of three hundred and\r\nsixty-five links, each link containing gold to the value of two dollars\r\nand a half, or thirteen livres and ten sous. The links to be of plain\r\nwire, so that their workmanship may cost as it were nothing. The whole\r\nwill make a present of little more than one thousand dollars, including\r\nthe medal and chain. As soon as done, be pleased to forward them by a\r\nsafe hand to the Marquis de la Luzerne, in the name of the President\r\nof the United States, informing him that it is the one spoken of in my\r\nletter to him of April the 30th, 1790. Say nothing to any body of the\r\nvalue of the present, because that will not always be the same, in all\r\ncases. Be so good as to have a second medal of gold struck in the same\r\ndie, and to send this second, together with the dies, to Philadelphia,\r\nby the first safe person who shall be passing; no chain to be sent with\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWe are impatient to learn the progress and prospect of the Algerine\r\nbusiness. Do not let it languish a moment, nor leave us a moment\r\nuninformed of any thing relative to it. It is in truth a tender\r\nbusiness, and more felt as such in this, than in any other country. The\r\nsuppression of the Farms of tobacco, and the free importation of our\r\nsalted provisions, will merit all your attention. They are both of them\r\nobjects of first rate importance.\r\n\r\nThe following appointments of Consuls have taken place.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nTheir jurisdictions, in general, extend to all places within the same\r\nallegiance, which are nearer to them than to the residence of any other\r\nConsul or Vice-Consul. As yet, only their commissions have been made\r\nout. General instructions await the passage of a bill now depending.\r\nMr. La Forest, at this place, remarked our appointment of Consuls in\r\nthe French islands. In the first project of a convention proposed on\r\nthe part of France, the expressions reached expressly to the kingdom of\r\nFrance only. I objected to this in writing, as being narrower than the\r\ntwenty-ninth article of the treaty of amity, which was the basis of the\r\nconsular convention, and which had granted the appointment of Consuls\r\nand Vice-Consuls, in their respective ‘States and ports,’ generally, and\r\nwithout restriction. On this, the word ‘France’ was struck out, and the\r\n‘dominions of the M. C. K.’ inserted every where. See the fifth, ninth,\r\ntwelfth, thirteenth, and fifteenth articles particularly, of the copy of\r\nthe draughts of 1784 and 1788, as I had them printed side by side. The\r\nobject of this alteration was, the appointment of Consuls in the free\r\nports allowed us in the French West Indies, where our commerce has\r\ngreater need of protection than any where. I mention these things, that\r\nyou may be prepared, should any thing be said to you on the subject.\r\nI am persuaded the appointment will contribute eminently to the\r\npreservation of harmony between us. These Consuls will be able to\r\nprevent the misunderstandings which arise frequently now between the\r\nofficers there and our traders, and which are doubtless much exaggerated\r\nand misrepresented to us by the latter.\r\n\r\nI duly received the copy you were so kind as to send me of the Bishop of\r\nAutun’s proposition, on the subject of weights and measures. It happened\r\nto arrive in the moment I was about giving in to Congress a report on\r\nthe same subject, which they had referred to me. In consequence of\r\nthe Bishop of Autun’s proposition, I made an alteration in my report,\r\nsubstituting forty-five degrees instead of thirty-eight degrees, which\r\nI had at first proposed as a standard latitude. I send you a copy of my\r\nreport for the Bishop, and another for M. Condorcet, Secretary of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences. By taking the second pendulum or rod of the same\r\nlatitude for the basis of our measures, it will at least furnish a\r\ncommon measure to which both our systems will refer, provided our\r\nexperiments on the pendulum or rod of forty-five degrees should yield\r\nexactly the same result with theirs.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, as usual, will accompany the present, which is to go by\r\nMr. Barrett.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and attachment, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIII.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, August 2, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThis letter will be delivered to you by Colonel Humphreys, whose\r\ncharacter is so well known to you as to need no recommendations from\r\nme. The present appearances of war between our two neighbors Spain, and\r\nEngland, cannot but excite all our attention. The part we are to act\r\nis uncertain, and will be difficult. The unsettled state of our dispute\r\nwith Spain may give a turn to it, very different from what we would\r\nwish. As it is important that you should be fully apprized of our way\r\nof thinking on this subject, I have sketched, in the enclosed paper,\r\ngeneral heads of consideration arising from present circumstances. These\r\nwill be readily developed by your own reflections and in conversations\r\nwith Colonel Humphreys; who, possessing the sentiments of the executive\r\non this subject, being well acquainted with the circumstances of the\r\nwestern country in particular, and of the state of our affairs in\r\ngeneral, comes to Madrid expressly for the purpose of giving you a\r\nthorough communication of them. He will, therefore, remain there as\r\nmany days or weeks, as may be necessary for this purpose. With this\r\ninformation, written and oral, you will be enabled to meet the minister\r\nin conversations on the subject of the navigation of the Mississippi,\r\nto which we wish you to lead his attention immediately. Impress him\r\nthoroughly with the necessity of an early, and even an immediate\r\nsettlement of this matter, and of a return to the field of negotiation\r\nfor this purpose: and though it must be done delicately, yet he must be\r\nmade to understand unequivocally, that a resumption of the negotiation\r\nis not desired on our part, unless he can determine, in the first\r\nopening of it, to yield the immediate and full enjoyment of that\r\nnavigation. (I say nothing of the claims of Spain to our territory north\r\nof the thirty-first degree, and east of the Mississippi. They never\r\nmerited the respect of an answer; and you know it has been admitted at\r\nMadrid, that they were not to be maintained.) It may be asked, what need\r\nof negotiation, if the navigation is to be ceded at all events? You know\r\nthat the navigation cannot be practised without a port, where the sea\r\nand river vessels may meet and exchange loads, and where those employed\r\nabout them may be safe and unmolested. The right to use a thing,\r\ncomprehends a right to the means necessary to its use, and without which\r\nit would be useless. The fixing on a proper port, and the degree of\r\nfreedom it is to enjoy in its operations, will require negotiation, and\r\nbe governed by events. There is danger indeed, that even the unavoidable\r\ndelay of sending a negotiator here, may render the mission too late\r\nfor the preservation of peace. It is impossible to answer for the\r\nforbearance of our western citizens. We endeavor to quiet them with the\r\nexpectation of an attainment of their rights by peaceable means. But\r\nshould they, in a moment of impatience, hazard others, there is no\r\nsaying how far we may be led: for neither themselves nor their rights\r\nwill ever be abandoned by us.\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased to observe, that we press these matters warmly and\r\nfirmly, under this idea, that the war between Spain and Great Britain\r\nwill be begun before you receive this; and such a moment must not be\r\nlost. But should an accommodation take place, we retain, indeed, the\r\nsame object and the same resolutions unalterably; but your discretion\r\nwill suggest, that in that event, they must be pressed more softly, and\r\nthat patience and persuasion must temper your conferences, till either\r\nthese may prevail, or some other circumstance turn up, which may enable\r\nus to use other means for the attainment of an object, which we are\r\ndetermined, in the end, to obtain at every risk.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIV.--TO M. DE PINTO, August 7, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE PINTO.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 7, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir, Under cover of the acquaintance I had the honor of contracting with\r\nyou, during the negotiations we transacted together in London, I\r\ntake the liberty of addressing you the present letter. The friendly\r\ndispositions you were then pleased to express towards this country,\r\nwhich were sincerely and reciprocally felt on my part towards yours,\r\nflatter me with the hope you will assist in maturing a subject for their\r\ncommon good. As yet, we have not the information necessary to present\r\nit to you formally, as the minister of her Most Faithful Majesty. I beg,\r\ntherefore, that this letter may be considered as between two individual\r\nfriends of their respective countries, preliminary to a formal\r\nproposition, and meant to give an acceptable shape to that.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, with your Excellency, to go through the history of\r\nour first experiment in government, the result of which was, a want of\r\nsuch tone in the governing powers, as might effect the good of those\r\ncommitted to their care. The nation, become sensible of this, have\r\nchanged its organization, made a better distribution of its powers, and\r\ngiven to them more energy and independence. The new government has now,\r\nfor some time, been under way; and, so far, gives a confidence that it\r\nwill answer its purposes. Abuses under the old forms have led us to lay\r\nthe basis of the new in a rigorous economy of the public contributions.\r\nThis principle will show itself in our diplomatic establishments; and\r\nthe rather, as at such a distance from Europe, and with such an ocean\r\nbetween us, we hope to meddle little in its quarrels or combinations.\r\nIts peace and its commerce are what we shall court, and to cultivate\r\nthese, we propose to place at the courts of Europe most interesting\r\nto us, diplomatic characters of economical grade, and shall be glad to\r\nreceive like ones in exchange. The important commerce carried on between\r\nyour country and ours, and the proofs of friendly disposition towards us\r\nwhich her Majesty has manifested, induce us to wish for such an exchange\r\nwith her, to express our sensibility at the intimations heretofore\r\nreceived of her readiness to meet our wish in this point, and our regret\r\nat the delay which has proceeded from the circumstances before touched\r\non. The grade to be exchanged is the present question, and that on which\r\nI ask a friendly and informal consultation with you. That of _Chargé des\r\nAffaires_ is the one we would prefer. It is that we employ at the court\r\nof Madrid. But it has been said, that by the etiquette of your court,\r\nthat grade cannot be received there under a favorable countenance.\r\nSomething like this existed at the court of Madrid. But his most\r\nCatholic Majesty, in consideration of our peculiar circumstances,\r\ndispensed with a general rule in our favor and in our particular case;\r\nand our _Chargé des Affaires_ there enjoys at court the privileges, the\r\nrespect, and favor due to a friendly nation, to a nation whom distance\r\nand difference of circumstances liberate in some degree, from an\r\netiquette, to which it is a stranger at home as well as abroad.\r\nThe representative of her Majesty here, under whatever name mutual\r\nconvenience may designate him, shall be received in the plenitude of\r\nfriendship and favor. May we not ask a reciprocal treatment of ours\r\nwith you? The nations of Europe have already seen the necessity of\r\ndistinguishing America from Europe, even in their treaties; and a\r\ndifference of commerce, of government, of condition and character, must\r\nevery day evince more and more the impracticability of involving them\r\nunder common regulations. Nor ought a difference of arrangement with\r\nrespect to us to excite claims from others, whose circumstances bear no\r\nsimilitude to ours.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to submit these considerations to your Excellency’s wisdom\r\nand goodness. You will see them to be such as could not be offered\r\nformally. They must shield themselves under the protection of those\r\nsentiments of veneration and esteem, with which your character\r\nheretofore inspired me, and which I flattered myself were not merely\r\nindifferent to you. Be so good as to honor with a conference hereon, the\r\nbearer, Colonel Humphreys (who was known to you in London), a gentleman\r\nwho has long been of the President’s family, and whose worth has\r\nacquired so much of our confidence, that whatever shall be arranged\r\nwith him, on this subject, may be considered as settled. Presuming on a\r\ncontinuance of her Majesty’s dispositions, accept this private assurance\r\nthat a proper person shall be appointed in due form to reside with you,\r\nas soon as we shall know the result of your deliberations with Colonel\r\nHumphreys, whom I beg leave to present to your notice; adding the homage\r\nof those sentiments of respect and attachment, with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXV.--TO JOSHUA JOHNSON, August 7,1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 7,1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, desirous of availing his country of\r\nthe talents of its best citizens in their respective lines, has thought\r\nproper to nominate you consul for the United States, at the port of\r\nLondon. The extent of our commercial and political connections with that\r\ncountry, marks the importance of the trust he confides to you, and the\r\nmore, as we have no diplomatic character at that court. I shall say more\r\nto you in a future letter on the extent of the consular functions, which\r\nare, in general, to be confined to the superintendence and patronage of\r\ncommerce and navigation: but in your position, we must desire somewhat\r\nmore. Political intelligence from that country is interesting to us in a\r\nhigh degree. We must, therefore, ask you to furnish us with this as\r\nfar as you shall be able; to send us moreover the gazette of the court,\r\nWoodfall’s parliamentary paper, Debrett’s parliamentary register; and to\r\nserve sometimes as a centre for our correspondences with other parts\r\nof Europe, by receiving and forwarding letters sent to your care. It\r\nis desirable that we be annually informed of the extent to which the\r\nBritish fisheries are carried on within each year, stating the number\r\nand tonnage of the vessels, and the number of men employed in the\r\nrespective fisheries, to wit, the northern and southern whale-fisheries,\r\nand the cod-fishery. I have as yet no statement of them for the year\r\n1789, with which, therefore, I will thank you to begin. While the press\r\nof seamen continues, our seamen in ports nearer to you than to Liverpool\r\n(where Mr. Maury is consul), will need your protection. The liberation\r\nof those impressed should be desired of the proper authority, with due\r\nfirmness, yet always in temperate and respectful terms, in which way,\r\nindeed, all applications to government should be made.\r\n\r\nThe public papers herein desired may come regularly, once a month, by\r\nthe British packet, and intermediately, by any vessels bound directly\r\neither to Philadelphia or New York. All expenses incurred for papers and\r\npostages shall be paid at such intervals as you choose, either here,\r\non your order, or by bill on London, whenever you transmit to me an\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThere was a bill brought into the legislature for the establishment of\r\nsome regulations in the consular offices: but it is postponed to the\r\nnext session. That bill proposed some particular fees for particular\r\nservices. They were, however, so small, as to be no object. As there\r\nwill be little or no legal emolument annexed to the office of consul, it\r\nis, of course, not expected that it shall render any expense incumbent\r\non him.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVI.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, August 10,1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 10,1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThis letter, with the very confidential papers it encloses, will be\r\ndelivered to you by Mr. Barrett with his own hands. If there be no war\r\nbetween Spain and England, they need be known to yourself alone. But\r\nif that war be began, or whenever it shall begin, we wish you to\r\ncommunicate them to the Marquis de la Fayette, on whose assistance we\r\nknow we can count in matters which interest both our countries. He\r\nand you will consider how far the contents of these papers may be\r\ncommunicated to the Count de Montmorin, and his influence be asked with\r\nthe court of Madrid. France will be called into the war, as an ally, and\r\nnot on any pretence of the quarrel being in any degree her own. She may\r\nreasonably require, then, that Spain should do every thing which depends\r\non her, to lessen the number of her enemies. She cannot doubt that we\r\nshall be of that number, if she does not yield our right to the common\r\nuse of the Mississippi, and the means of using and securing it. You will\r\nobserve, we state in general the necessity, not only of our having a\r\nport near the mouth of the river (without which we could make no use\r\nof the navigation at all), but of its being so well separated from the\r\nterritories of Spain and her jurisdiction, as not to engender daily\r\ndisputes and broils between us. It is certain, that if Spain were to\r\nretain any jurisdiction over our entrepot, her officers would abuse that\r\njurisdiction, and our people would abuse their privileges in it. Both\r\nparties must foresee this, and that it will end in war. Hence the\r\nnecessity of a well defined separation. Nature has decided what shall be\r\nthe geography of that in the end, whatever it might be in the beginning,\r\nby cutting off from the adjacent countries of Florida and Louisiana, and\r\nenclosing between two of its channels, a long and narrow slip of land,\r\ncalled the Island of New Orleans. The idea of ceding this could not be\r\nhazarded to Spain, in the first step: it would be too disagreeable at\r\nfirst view; because this island, with its town, constitutes, at present,\r\ntheir principal settlement in that part of their dominions, containing\r\nabout ten thousand white inhabitants of every age and sex. Reason and\r\nevents, however, may, by little and little, familiarize them to it. That\r\nwe have a right to some spot as an entrepot for our commerce, may be at\r\nonce affirmed. The expediency, too, may be expressed, of so locating it\r\nas to cut off the source of future quarrels and wars. A disinterested\r\neye looking on a map, will remark how conveniently this tongue of land\r\nis formed for the purpose; the Iberville and Amite channel offering a\r\ngood boundary and convenient outlet, on the one side, for Florida, and\r\nthe main channel an equally good boundary and outlet, on the other side,\r\nfor Louisiana; while the slip of land between is almost entirely morass\r\nor sandbank; the whole of it lower than the water of the river, in\r\nits highest floods, and only its western margin (which is the highest\r\nground) secured by banks and inhabited. I suppose this idea too much\r\neven for the Count de Montmorin at first, and that, therefore, you will\r\nfind it prudent to urge, and get him to recommend to the Spanish court,\r\nonly in general terms, ‘a port near the mouth of the river, with a\r\ncircumjacent territory sufficient for its support, well defined, and\r\nextra-territorial to Spain,’ leaving the idea to future growth.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the copy of a paper distributed by the Spanish commandant\r\non the west side of the Mississippi, which may justify us to M. de\r\nMontmorin, for pushing this matter to an immediate conclusion. It cannot\r\nbe expected we shall give Spain time, to be used by her for dismembering\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to apprize you of a circumstance, which may show the\r\nexpediency of being in some degree on your guard, even in your\r\ncommunications to the court of France. It is believed here, that the\r\nCount de Moustier, during his residence with us, conceived a project\r\nof again engaging France in a colony upon our continent, and that\r\nhe directed his views to some of the country on the Mississippi, and\r\nobtained and communicated a good deal of matter on the subject to his\r\ncourt. He saw the immediate advantage of selling some yards of French\r\ncloths and silks to the inhabitants of New Orleans. But he did not take\r\ninto account what it would cost France to nurse and protect a colony\r\nthere, till it should be able to join its neighbors, or to stand by\r\nitself; and then what it would cost her to get rid of it. I hardly\r\nsuspect that the court of France could be seduced by so partial a view\r\nof the subject as was presented to them, and I suspect it the less,\r\nsince the National Assembly has constitutionally excluded conquest from\r\nthe objects of their government. It may be added too, that the place\r\nbeing ours, their yards of cloth and silk would be as freely sold as if\r\nit were theirs.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by this letter, and the papers it encloses, what part\r\nof the ideas of the Count d’Estain coincide with our views. The answer\r\nto him must be a compound of civility and reserve, expressing our\r\nthankfulness for his attentions; that we consider them as proofs of the\r\ncontinuance of his friendly dispositions, and that though it might be\r\nout of our system to implicate ourselves in trans-Atlantic guarantees,\r\nyet other parts of his plans are capable of being improved to the common\r\nbenefit of the parties. Be so good as to say to him something of this\r\nkind, verbally, and so that the matter may be ended as between him and\r\nus.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, in the event of war, it is left to the judgment of the\r\nMarquis de la Fayette and yourself, how far you will develope the ideas\r\nnow communicated, to the Count de Montmorin, and how far you will suffer\r\nthem to be developed to the Spanish court.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a pamphlet by Hutchins for your further information on the\r\nsubject of the Mississippi; and am, with sentiments of perfect esteem\r\nand attachment, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVII.--TO COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS, August 11, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 11, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President having thought proper to confide several special matters\r\nin Europe to your care, it will be expedient that you take your passage\r\nin the first convenient vessel bound to the port of London.\r\n\r\nWhen there, you will be pleased to deliver to Mr. G. Morris and to Mr.\r\nJohnson, the letters and papers you will have in charge for them, to\r\ncommunicate to us from thence any interesting public intelligence you\r\nmay be able to obtain, and then to take as early a passage as possible\r\nto Lisbon.\r\n\r\nAt Lisbon you will deliver the letter with which you are charged for\r\nthe Chevalier Pinto, putting on it the address proper to his present\r\nsituation. You know the contents of this letter, and will make it the\r\nsubject of such conferences with him as may be necessary to obtain our\r\npoint of establishing there the diplomatic grade, which alone coincides\r\nwith our system, and of insuring its reception and treatment with the\r\nrequisite respect. Communicate to us the result of your conferences, and\r\nthen proceed to Madrid.\r\n\r\nThere you will deliver the letters and papers which you have in charge\r\nfor Mr. Carmichael, the contents of all which are known to you. Be so\r\ngood as to multiply, as much as possible, your conferences with him, in\r\norder to possess him fully of the special matters sketched out in those\r\npapers, and of the state of our affairs in general.\r\n\r\nYour stay there will be as long as its objects may require, only taking\r\ncare to return to Lisbon by the time you may reasonably expect that our\r\nanswers to your letters to be written from Lisbon, may reach that place.\r\nThis cannot be earlier than the first or second week of January. These\r\nanswers will convey to you the President’s further pleasure.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of this business, it will be best that you avoid all\r\nsuspicion of being on any public business. This need be known only to\r\nthe Chevalier Pinto and Mr. Carmichael. The former need not know of your\r\njourney to Madrid, or if it be necessary, he may be made to understand\r\nthat it is a journey of curiosity, to fill up the interval between\r\nwriting your letters and receiving the answers. To every other person,\r\nit will be best that you appear as a private traveller.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States allows you from this date, at the\r\nrate of two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars a year, for your\r\nservices and expenses, and moreover, what you may incur for the postage\r\nof letters; until he shall otherwise order.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVIII.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, August 12, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 12, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of May the 29th to the President of the United States has\r\nbeen duly received. You have placed their proposition of exchanging a\r\nminister on proper ground. It must certainly come from them, and come in\r\nunequivocal form. With those who respect their own dignity so much,\r\nours must not be counted at nought. On their own proposal, formally,\r\nto exchange a minister, we sent them one. They have taken no notice of\r\nthat, and talk of agreeing to exchange one now, as if the idea were new.\r\nBesides, what they are saying to you, they are talking to us through\r\nQuebec; but so informally, that they may disavow it when they please. It\r\nwould only oblige them to make the fortune of the poor Major, whom they\r\nwould pretend to sacrifice. Through him, they talk of a minister,\r\na treaty of commerce and alliance. If the object of the latter\r\nbe honorable, it is useless; if dishonorable, inadmissible. These\r\ntamperings prove, they view a war as very possible; and some symptoms\r\nindicate designs against the Spanish possessions adjoining us. The\r\nconsequences of their acquiring all the country on our frontier,\r\nfrom the St. Croix to the St. Mary’s, are too obvious to you, to need\r\ndevelopement. You will readily see the dangers which would then environ\r\nus. We wish you, therefore, to intimate to them, that we cannot be\r\nindifferent to enterprises of this kind. That we should contemplate a\r\nchange of neighbors with extreme uneasiness; and that a due balance\r\non our borders is not less desirable to us, than a balance of power in\r\nEurope has always appeared to them. We wish to be neutral, and we will\r\nbe so, if they will execute the treaty fairly, and attempt no conquests\r\nadjoining us. The first condition is just; the second imposes no\r\nhardship on them. They cannot complain that the other dominions of Spain\r\nwould be so narrow as not to leave them room enough for conquest. If the\r\nwar takes place, we would really wish to be quieted on these two points,\r\noffering in return an honorable neutrality. More than this, they are not\r\nto expect. It will be proper that these ideas be conveyed in delicate\r\nand friendly terms; but that they be conveyed, if the war takes place:\r\nfor it is in that case alone, and not till it be begun, that we would\r\nwish our dispositions to be known. But in no case, need they think of\r\nour accepting any equivalent for the posts.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIX.--TO GOVERNOR HANCOCK, August 24, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HANCOCK.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 24, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the United States have been pleased to refer to\r\nme the representation from the General Court of Massachusetts, on the\r\nsubject of the whale and cod fisheries, which had been transmitted by\r\nyour Excellency, with an instruction to examine the matter thereof, and\r\nreport my opinion thereupon to the next session of Congress. To prepare\r\nsuch a report as may convey to them the information necessary to lead to\r\nan adequate remedy, it is indispensable that I obtain a statement of the\r\nfisheries, comprehending such a period before and since the war, as\r\nmay show the extent to which they were and are carried on. With such\r\na statement under their view, Congress may be able, by comparing the\r\ncircumstances which existed when the fisheries flourished, with those\r\nwhich exist at this moment of their decline, to discover the cause of\r\nthat decline, and provide either a remedy for it, or something which may\r\ncountervail its effect. This information can be obtained no where but\r\nin the State over which your Excellency presides, and under no other\r\nauspices so likely to produce it. May I, therefore, take the liberty of\r\nsoliciting your Excellency to charge with the collecting and furnishing\r\nme this information, some person or persons who may be competent to the\r\nobject. Taking a point of commencement at a proper interval before the\r\nyear of greatest prosperity, there should be stated in a table, year by\r\nyear, under different columns as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The number of vessels fitted out each year for the cod-fishery. 2.\r\nTheir tonnage. 3. The number of seamen employed. 4. The quantity of fish\r\ntaken; (I.) of superior quality; (2.) of inferior. 5. The quantity of\r\neach kind exported; (1.) to Europe, and to what countries there; (2.) to\r\nother, and what parts of America. C. The average prices at the markets,\r\n(1.) of Europe; (2.) of America. With respect to the whale-fishery,\r\nafter the three first articles the following should be substituted.\r\n4. Whether to the northern or southern fishery. 5. The quantity of oil\r\ntaken; (1.) of the spermaceti whale; (2.) of the other kinds. 6. To what\r\nmarket each kind was sent. 7. The average prices of each. As the ports\r\nfrom which the equipments were made could not be stated in the same\r\ntable conveniently, they might form a separate one. It would be\r\nvery material that I should receive this information by the first of\r\nNovember, as I might be able to bestow a more undisturbed attention to\r\nthe subject before than after the meeting of Congress, and it would be\r\nbetter to present it to them at the beginning, than towards the close of\r\nthe session.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar degree of interest with which this subject must affect\r\nthe State of Massachusetts, the impossibility of obtaining necessary\r\ninformation from any other quarter, and the slender means I should have\r\nof acquiring it from thence, without the aid of your Excellency, will,\r\nI hope, be a sufficient apology for the trouble I take the liberty of\r\ngiving you: and I am happy in every occasion of repeating assurances\r\nof the respect and attachment with which I have the honor to be your\r\nExcellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XL.--TO SYLVANUS BOURNE, August 25, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SYLVANUS BOURNE, _Consul at Hispaniola_.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 25, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI enclose you herein sundry papers containing a representation from\r\nMessrs. Updike and Earle of Providence, who complain that their sloop\r\nNancy was seized in the island of Hispaniola, and though without\r\nfoundation, as her acquittal proved, yet they were subjected to the\r\npayment of very heavy expenses. It is to be observed, that in no country\r\ndoes government pay the costs of a defendant in any prosecution, and\r\nthat often, though the party be acquitted, there may have been colorable\r\ncause for the prosecution. However this may have been in the present\r\ncase, should the parties think proper to endeavor, by their own agent,\r\nto obtain a reimbursement from the government or from individuals of\r\nHispaniola, I take the liberty of recommending their cause to your\r\npatronage, so far as evidence and law shall be in their favor. If they\r\naddress the government, you will support their demands on the ground\r\nof right and amity; if they institute process against individuals,\r\ncounterpoise by the patronage and weight of your public character, any\r\nweight of character which may be opposed to their obtaining of justice.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLI.--CIRCULAR TO THE CONSULS, August 26, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circular to the Consuls and Vice-Consuls of the United States_.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI expected ere this, to have been able to send you an act of Congress\r\nprescribing some special duties and regulations for the exercise of the\r\nconsular offices of the United States: but Congress not having been able\r\nto mature the act sufficiently, it lies over to the next session. In\r\nthe mean while, I beg leave to draw your attention to some matters of\r\ninformation, which it is interesting to receive.\r\n\r\nI must beg the favor of you to communicate to me every six months, a\r\nreport of the vessels of the United States which enter at the ports of\r\nyour district, specifying the name and burthen of each vessel, of what\r\ndescription she is (to wit, ship, snow, brig, &c), the names of the\r\nmaster and owners, and number of seamen, the port of the United States\r\nfrom which she cleared, places touched at, her cargo outward and inward,\r\nand the owners thereof, the port to which she is bound, and times of\r\narrival and departure; the whole arranged in a table under different\r\ncolumns, and the reports closing on the last days of June and December.\r\n\r\nWe wish you to use your endeavors that no vessel enter as an American in\r\nthe ports of your district, which shall not be truly such, and that none\r\nbe sold under that name, which are not really of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat you give to me, from time to time, information of all military\r\npreparations, and other indications of war which may take place in your\r\nports; and when a war shall appear imminent, that you notify thereof the\r\nmerchants and vessels of the United States within your district, that\r\nthey may be duly on their guard; and in general, that you communicate\r\nto me such political and commercial intelligence, as you may think\r\ninteresting to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Consuls and Vice-Consuls of the United States are free to wear the\r\nuniform of their navy, if they choose to do so. This is a deep-blue coat\r\nwith red facings, lining, and cuffs, the cuffs slashed and a standing\r\ncollar; a red waistcoat (laced or not at the election of the wearer) and\r\nblue breeches; yellow buttons with a foul anchor, and black cockades and\r\nsmall swords.\r\n\r\nBe pleased to observe, that the Vice-Consul of one district is not at\r\nall subordinate to the Consul of another. They are equally independent\r\nof each other.\r\n\r\nThe ground of distinction between these two officers is this. Our\r\ngovernment thinks, that to whatever there may be either of honor or\r\nprofit resulting from the consular office, native citizens are first\r\nentitled, where such, of proper character, will undertake the duties;\r\nbut where none such offer, a Vice-Consul is appointed of any other\r\nnation. Should a proper native come forward at any future time, he will\r\nbe named Consul; but this nomination will not revoke the commission of\r\nVice-Consul: it will only suspend his functions during the continuance\r\nof the Consul within the limits of his jurisdiction, and on his\r\ndeparture therefrom, it is meant that the vice-consular authority shall\r\nrevive of course, without the necessity of a re-appointment.\r\n\r\nIt is understood, that Consuls and Vice-Consuls have authority, of\r\ncourse, to appoint their own agents in the several ports of their\r\ndistrict, and that it is with themselves alone those agents are to\r\ncorrespond.\r\n\r\nIt will be best not fatigue the government in which you reside, or those\r\nin authority under it, with applications in unimportant cases. Husband\r\ntheir good dispositions for occasions of some moment, and let all\r\nrepresentations to them be couched in the most temperate and friendly\r\nterms, never indulging in any case whatever a single expression which\r\nmay irritate.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLII.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, August 26, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear. Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you have been of the 26th of July, and 10th instant.\r\nYours of May the 16th, No. 31, has come to hand.\r\n\r\nI enclose you sundry papers, by which you will perceive, that the\r\nexpression in the eleventh article of our treaty of amity and commerce\r\nwith France, viz. ‘that the subjects of the United States shall not be\r\nreputed _Aubaines in France_, and consequently shall be exempted from\r\nthe _Droit d’Aubaine_, or other similar duty, under what name soever,’\r\nhas been construed so rigorously to the letter, as to consider us\r\nas _Aubaines_ in the colonies of France. Our intercourse with those\r\ncolonies is so great, that frequent and important losses will accrue to\r\nindividuals, if this construction be continued. The death of the\r\nmaster or supercargo of a vessel, rendered a more common event by the\r\nunhealthiness of the climate, throws all the property which was either\r\nhis, or under his care, into contest. I presume that the enlightened\r\nAssembly now, engaged in reforming the remains of feudal abuse among\r\nthem, will not leave so inhospitable an one as the _Droit d’Aubaine_\r\nexisting in France, or any of its dominions. If this may be hoped,\r\nit will be better that you should not trouble the minister with any\r\napplication for its abolition in the colonies as to us. This would be\r\nerecting into a special favor to us, the extinction of a general abuse,\r\nwhich will, I presume, extinguish of itself. Only be so good as to\r\nsee, that in abolishing this odious law in France, its abolition in\r\nthe colonies also be not omitted by mere oversight; but if, contrary to\r\nexpectations, this fragment of barbarism be suffered to remain, then\r\nit will become necessary that you bring forward the enclosed case, and\r\npress a liberal and just exposition of our treaty, so as to relieve our\r\ncitizens from this species of risk and ruin hereafter. Supposing the\r\nmatter to rest on the eleventh article only, it is inconceivable, that\r\nhe, who with respect to his personal goods is as a native citizen in\r\nthe mother country, should be deemed a foreigner in its colonies.\r\nAccordingly, you will perceive by the opinions of Doctor Franklin and\r\nDoctor Lee, two of our ministers who negotiated and signed the treaty,\r\nthat they considered that rights stipulated for us in France, were meant\r\nto exist in all the dominions of France.\r\n\r\nConsidering this question under the second article of the treaty also,\r\nwe are exempted from the _Droit d’Aubaine_ in all the dominions of\r\nFrance: for by that article, no particular favor is to be granted to\r\nany other nation which shall not immediately become common to the other\r\nparty. Now, by the forty-fourth article of the treaty between France and\r\nEngland, which was subsequent to ours, it is stipulated, ‘_que dans tout\r\nce qui concerne--les successions des biens mobiliers--les sujets des\r\ndeux hautes parties contractantes auront dans les Etais respectifs les\r\nmemes privilèges, libertés et droits, que la nation la plus favorisée_.’\r\nThis gave to the English the general abolition of the _Droit d’Aubaine_,\r\nenjoyed by the Hollanders under the first article of their treaty with\r\nFrance of July the 23rd, 1773, which is in these words. ‘_Les sujets\r\ndes E. G. des P. U. des Pays-Bas ne seront point assujettis au Droit\r\nd’Aubaine dans les Etats de S. M. T. C._ This favor, then, being granted\r\nto the English subsequent to our treaty, we become entitled to it of\r\ncourse by the article in question. I have it not in my power at this\r\nmoment to turn to the treaty between France and Russia, which was also\r\nposterior to ours. If by that, the Russians are exempted from the _Droit\r\nd’Aubaine_, ‘_dans les Etats de S. M. T. C._ it is a ground the more for\r\nour claiming the exemption. To these, you will be pleased to add\r\nsuch other considerations of reason, friendship, hospitality, and\r\nreciprocity, as will readily occur to yourself.\r\n\r\nAbout two or three weeks ago, a Mr. Campbell called on me, and\r\nintroduced himself by observing that his situation was an awkward one,\r\nthat he had come from Denmark with an assurance of being employed\r\nhere in a public character, that he was actually in service, though\r\nunannounced. He repeated conversations which had passed between Count\r\nBernstorff and him, and asked me when a minister would be appointed to\r\nthat court, or a character sent to negotiate a treaty of commerce: he\r\nhad not the scrip of a pen to authenticate himself, however informally.\r\nI told him our government had not yet had time to settle a plan of\r\nforeign arrangments; that with respect to Denmark particularly, I\r\nmight safely express to him those sentiments of friendship which our\r\ngovernment entertained for that country, and assurances that the King’s\r\nsubjects would always meet with favor and protection here; and in\r\ngeneral, I said to him those things which, being true, might be said\r\nto any body. You can perhaps learn something of him from the Baron de\r\nBlome. If he be an unauthorized man, it would be well it should be known\r\nhere, as the respect which our citizens might entertain, and the credit\r\nthey might give to any person supposed to be honored by the King’s\r\nappointment, might lead them into embarrassment.\r\n\r\nYou know the situation of the new loan of three millions of florins\r\ngoing on at Amsterdam. About one half of this is destined for an\r\nimmediate payment to France; but advantage may be gained by judiciously\r\ntiming the payment. The French colonies will doubtless claim, in their\r\nnew constitution, a right to receive the necessaries of life from\r\nwhomever will deliver them cheapest; to wit, grain, flour, live stock,\r\nsalted fish, and other salted provisions. It would be well that you\r\nshould confer with their deputies, guardedly, and urge them to this\r\ndemand, if they need urging. The justice of the National Assembly will\r\nprobably dispose them to grant it, and the clamors of the Bordeaux\r\nmerchants may be silenced by the clamors and arms of the colonies.\r\nIt may cooperate with the influence of the colonies, if favorable\r\ndispositions towards us can be excited in the moment of discussing this\r\npoint. It will therefore be left to you to say, when the payment shall\r\nbe made, in confidence that you will so time it as to forward this great\r\nobject: and when you make this payment, you may increase its effect, by\r\nadding assurances to the minister, that measures have been taken which\r\nwill enable us to pay up, within a very short time, all arrears of\r\nprincipal and interest now due; and further, that Congress has fully\r\nauthorized our government to go on and pay even the balance not yet due,\r\nwhich we mean to do, if that money can be borrowed on reasonable\r\nterms; and that favorable arrangements of commerce between us and their\r\ncolonies, might dispose us to effect that payment with less regard to\r\nterms. You will, of course, find excuses for not paying the money which\r\nis ready and put under your orders, till you see that the moment has\r\narrived when the emotions it may excite, may give a desisive cast to the\r\ndemands of the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, as usual, will accompany the present.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and attachment, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIII.--TO M. LA FOREST, August 30, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LA FOREST, _Consul of France_,\r\n\r\nNew York, August 30, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI asked the favor of the Secretary of the Treasury to consider the\r\nfourth article of the consular convention, and to let me know whether he\r\nshould conclude that Consuls not exercising commerce, were exempt from\r\npaying duties on things imported for their own use. I furnished him no\r\nexplanation whatever, of what had passed on the subject at the time of\r\nforming the convention, because I thought it should be decided on the\r\nwords of the convention, as they are offered to all the world, and that\r\nit would only be where these are equivocal, that explanations might be\r\nadduced from other circumstances. He considered the naked words of the\r\narticle, and delivered to me as his opinion, that, according to these,\r\nthe first paragraph, ‘The Consuls and Vice-Consuls, &c. as the natives\r\nare,’ subjected all their property, in whatever form and under whatever\r\ncircumstances it existed, to the same duties and taxes to which the\r\nproperty of other individuals is liable, and exempts them only from\r\n_taxes on their persons_, as poll-taxes, head-rates for the poor, for\r\ntown-charges, &c.; and that the second paragraph, ‘Those of the said\r\nConsuls, he or other merchants,’ subjected such of them as exercised\r\ncommerce, even to the same personal taxes as other merchants are: that\r\nthe second paragraph is an abridgment of the first, not an enlargement\r\nof it; and that the exemption of those, not merchants, which seemed\r\nimplied in the words of the second paragraph, could not be admitted\r\nagainst the contrary meaning, directly and unequivocally expressed in\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, was his opinion, and it is exactly conformable to what the\r\nnegotiators had in view in forming this article. I have turned to\r\nthe papers which passed on that occasion, and I find that the first\r\nparagraph was proposed in the first project given in by myself, by\r\nwhich the distinction between taxes on their property and taxes on their\r\npersons, is clearly enounced, and was agreed to: but as our merchants\r\nexercising commerce in France, would have enjoyed a much greater\r\nbenefit from the personal exemption, than those of France do here, M. de\r\nReyneval, in his first counter-project, inserted the second paragraph,\r\nto which I agreed. So that the object was, in the first paragraph, to\r\nput Consuls, not being merchants, on the same footing with citizens, not\r\nbeing merchants; and in the second, to put Consuls, merchants, on the\r\nsame footing with citzens, merchants.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, we suppose to be the sense of the convention, which has\r\nbecome a part of the law of the land, and the law, you know, in this\r\ncountry, is not under the control of the executive, either in its\r\nmeaning or course. We must reserve, therefore, for more favorable\r\noccasions, our dispositions to render the situation of the Consuls of\r\nhis Majesty as easy as possible, by indulgences, depending more on\r\nus; and of proving the sentiments of esteem and attachment to yourself\r\npersonally, with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIV.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, August 31,1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNew York, August 31,1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince writing my letter of the 26th, it has been decided to commit to\r\nyour care the transaction of very important money matters at Amsterdam.\r\nIt is thought necessary that you should go there immediately, and\r\nremain there about three months, to possess yourself of the ground. The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury will detail to you the particulars requisite\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our affairs at Paris, we trust, in your absence, to\r\nthe friendship of the Marquis de la Fayette, for such things as are\r\nimportant enough to merit his attention. Two of the subjects lately\r\ngiven you in charge, are of this description. As to all others, do\r\nthem by letter or otherwise, as you can. It will be necessary for you,\r\ndoubtless, sometimes to ask the attention of the Marquis by letter; and\r\nwhere you think the moment requires essentially your presence, it is\r\nunderstood you will come to Paris express, returning again to Amsterdam\r\nas quickly as circumstances will admit. The facilities of travelling, in\r\nEurope, admit of this. Should you think it necessary, you may appoint a\r\nsecretary during your absence, to remain at Paris and communicate with\r\nyou, allowing him a salary of four thousand livres a year. If you think\r\nthis not necessary, you of course will not make the appointment.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere and great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLV.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, December 17, 1790\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 17, 1790.\r\n\r\nSince mine to you of August the 12th, yours of July the 3rd, August the\r\n16th, and September the 18th, have come to hand. They suffice to remove\r\nall doubts which might have been entertained as to the real intentions\r\nof the British cabinet, on the several matters confided to you. The view\r\nof government in troubling you with this business, was, either to remove\r\nfrom between the two nations all causes of difference, by a fair and\r\nfriendly adjustment, if such was the intention of the other party, or to\r\nplace it beyond a doubt that such was not their intention. In result,\r\nit is clear enough that further applications would tend to delay, rather\r\nthan advance our object. It is therefore the pleasure of the President,\r\nthat no others be made; and that in whatever state this letter may find\r\nthe business, in that state it be left. I have it in charge at the same\r\ntime to assure you, that your conduct in these communications with the\r\nBritish ministers has met the President’s entire approbation, and to\r\nconvey to you his acknowledgments for your services.\r\n\r\nAs an attendance on this business must, at times, have interfered with\r\nyour private pursuits, and subjected you also to additional expenses,\r\nI have the honor to enclose you a draft on our bankers in Holland for a\r\nthousand dollars, as an indemnificatian for those sacrifices.\r\n\r\nMy letter of August the 12th desired a certain other communication to be\r\nmade to the same court, if a war should have actually commenced. If the\r\nevent has not already called for it, it is considered as inexpedient to\r\nbe made at all.\r\n\r\nYou will, of course, have the goodness to inform us of whatever may have\r\npassed further, since the date of your last.\r\n\r\nIn conveying to you this testimony of approbation from the President of\r\nthe United States, I am happy in an occasion of repeating assurances\r\nof the sentiments of perfect esteem and respect, with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVI.--TO JOSHUA JOHNSON, December 17, 1790\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 17, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThough not yet informed of your receipt of my letter, covering your\r\ncommission as Consul for the United States in the port of London, yet\r\nknowing that the ship has arrived by which it went, I take for granted\r\nthe letter and commission have gone safe to hand, and that you have been\r\ncalled into the frequent exercise of your office for the relief of our\r\nseamen, upon whom such multiplied acts of violence have been committed\r\nin England, by press-gangs, pretending to take them for British\r\nsubjects, not only without evidence, but against evidence. By what means\r\nmay be procured for our seamen, while in British ports, that security\r\nfor their persons which the laws of hospitality require, and which the\r\nBritish nation will surely not refuse, remains to be settled. In\r\nthe mean time, there is one of these cases, wherein so wilful and so\r\nflagrant a violation has been committed by a British officer, on the\r\nperson of one of our citizens, as requires that it be laid before\r\nhis government, in friendly and firm reliance of satisfaction for the\r\ninjury, and of assurance for the future, that the citizens of the United\r\nStates, entering the ports of Great Britain, in pursuit of a lawful\r\ncommerce, shall be protected by the laws of hospitality in usage among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIt is represented to the President of the United States, that Hugh\r\nPurdie, a native of Williamsburg in Virginia, was, in the month of\r\nJuly last, seized in London by a party of men, calling themselves\r\npress-officers, and pretending authority from their government so to\r\ndo, notwithstanding his declarations and the evidence he offered of his\r\nbeing a native citizen of the United States; and that he was transferred\r\non board the Crescent, a British ship of war, commanded by a Captain\r\nYoung. Passing over the intermediate violences exercised on him,\r\nbecause not peculiar to his case (so many other American citizens having\r\nsuffered the same), I proceed to the particular one which distinguishes\r\nthe present representation. Satisfactory evidence having been produced\r\nby Mr. John Brown Cutting, a citizen of the United States, to the Lords\r\nof the Admiralty, that Hugh Purdie was a native citizen of the same\r\nStates, they, in their justice, issued orders to the Lord Howe, their\r\nAdmiral, for his discharge. In the mean time, the Lord Howe had sailed\r\nwith the fleet of which the Crescent was.\r\n\r\nBut, on the 27th of August, he wrote to the board of admiralty, that\r\nhe had received their orders for the discharge of Hugh Purdie, and had\r\ndirected it accordingly. Notwithstanding these orders, the receipt of\r\nwhich at sea Captain Young acknowledges, notwithstanding Captain Young’s\r\nconfessed knowledge that Hugh Purdie was a citizen of the United States,\r\nfrom whence it resulted that his being carried on board the Crescent\r\nand so long detained there had been an act of wrong, which called for\r\nexpiatory conduct and attentions, rather than new injuries on his part\r\ntowards the sufferer, instead of discharging him, according to the\r\norders he had received, on his arrival in port, which was on the 14th\r\nof September, he, on the 15th, confined him in irons for several hours,\r\nthen had him bound and scourged in presence of the ship’s crew, under\r\na threat to the executioner, that if he did not do his duty well, he\r\nshould take the place of the sufferer. At length he discharged him\r\non the 17th, without the means of subsistence for a single day. To\r\nestablish these facts, I enclose you copies of papers communicated to\r\nme by Mr. Cutting, who laid the case of Purdie before the board of\r\nadmiralty, and who can corroborate them by his personal evidence. He\r\ncan especially verify the letter of Captain Young, were it necessary\r\nto verify a paper, the original of which is under the command of his\r\nMajesty’s ministers, and this paper is so material, as to supersede of\r\nitself all other testimony, confessing the orders to discharge Purdie,\r\nthat yet he had whipped him, and that it was impossible, without giving\r\nup all sense of discipline, to avoid whipping a free American citizen.\r\nWe have such confidence in the justice of the British government, in\r\ntheir friendly regard to these States, in their respect for the honor\r\nand good understanding of the two countries, compromitted by this act of\r\ntheir officer, as not to doubt their due notice of him, indemnification\r\nto the sufferer, and a friendly assurance to these States that effectual\r\nmeasures shall be adopted in future, to protect the persons of their\r\ncitizens while in British ports.\r\n\r\nBy the express command of the President of the United States, you are\r\nto lay this case, and our sense of it, before his Britannic Majesty’s\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, to urge it on his particular notice by all\r\nthe motives which it calls up, and to communicate to me the result.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, your most obedient, humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVII.--TO JOSHUA JOHNSON, December 23, 1790\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 23, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe vexations of our seamen, and their sufferings under the press-gangs\r\nof England, have become so serious, as to oblige our government to take\r\nserious notice of it. The particular case has been selected where\r\nthe insult to the United States has been the most barefaced, the most\r\ndeliberately intentional, and the proof the most complete. The\r\nenclosed letter to you is on that subject, and has been written on the\r\nsupposition that you would show the original to the Duke of Leeds,\r\nand give him a copy of it, but as of your own movement, and not as if\r\nofficially instructed so to do. You will be pleased to follow up this\r\nmatter as closely as decency will permit, pressing it in firm but\r\nrespectful terms, on all occasions. We think it essential that Captain\r\nYoung’s case may be an example to others. The enclosed, letters are\r\nimportant. Be so good as to have them conveyed by the surest means\r\npossible. I am, with great esteem, Dear Sir, you most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVIII.--TO CHARLES HELLSTEDT, February 14,1791\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES HELLSTEDT, Swedish Consul.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 14,1791.\r\n\r\nSir, I now return you the papers you were pleased to put into my\r\nhands, when you expressed to me your dissatisfaction that our court of\r\nadmiralty had taken cognizance of a complaint of some Swedish\r\nsailors against their captain for cruelty. If there was error in this\r\nproceeding, the law allows an appeal from that to the Supreme Court;\r\nbut the appeal must be made in the forms of the law, which have nothing\r\ndifficult in them. You were certainly free to conduct the appeal\r\nyourself, without employing an advocate, but then you must do it in the\r\nusual form. Courts of justice, all over the world, are held by the laws\r\nto proceed according to certain forms, which the good of the suitors\r\nthemselves requires they should not be permitted to depart from.\r\n\r\nI have further to observe to you, Sir, that this question lies\r\naltogether with the courts of justice; that the constitution of the\r\nUnited States having divided the powers of government into three\r\nbranches, legislative, executive, and judiciary, and deposited each with\r\na separate body of magistracy, forbidding either to interfere in the\r\ndepartment of the other, the executive are not at liberty to intermeddle\r\nin the present question. It must be ultimately decided by the Supreme\r\nCourt. If you think proper to carry it into that, you may be secure of\r\nthe strictest justice from them. Partialities they are not at liberty to\r\nshow. But for whatever may come before the executive, relative to\r\nyour nation, I can assure you of every favor which may depend on their\r\ndispositions to cultivate harmony and a good understanding with it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIX.--TO M. DE PINTO, February 21,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE PINTO.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 21,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received the letter of November the 30th, which your\r\nExcellency did me the honor to write, informing me that her Most\r\nFaithful Majesty had appointed Mr. Freire her minister resident with us,\r\nand stating the difficulty of meeting us in the exchange of a _chargé\r\ndes affaires_, the grade proposed on our part. It is foreseen that a\r\ndeparture from our system in this instance will materially affect our\r\narrangements with other nations; but the President of the United States\r\nhas resolved to give her Majesty this proof of his desire to concur in\r\nwhatever may best tend to promote that harmony and perfect friendship,\r\nso interesting to both countries. He has, therefore, appointed Colonel\r\nHumphreys to be minister resident for the United States at the court of\r\nher Majesty. This gentleman has long been of the President’s own family,\r\nand enjoys his particular confidence. I make no doubt he will so conduct\r\nhimself, as to give perfect satisfaction to her Majesty and yourself,\r\nand I therefore recommend him to your friendly attention and respect.\r\nMr. Freire will have every title to the same from us, and will assuredly\r\nreceive it. It is always with pleasure, that I repeat the homage of\r\nthose sentiments of respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER L.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, March 8,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 8,1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA conveyance offering by which we can send large packets, you will\r\nreceive herewith the following articles.\r\n\r\n1. The newspapers.\r\n\r\n2. The acts of the second session of Congress.\r\n\r\n3. A report on the fisheries of the United States. It is thought that\r\nthis contains matter which may be usefully communicated. I am persuaded\r\nthe better this subject is understood in France, the more they will see\r\ntheir interest in favoring our fisheries.\r\n\r\n4. A letter from the President to the King, of which an open copy is\r\nenclosed for your information.\r\n\r\n5. A letter from myself to the Count de Moustier, in answer to his to\r\nthe President and myself, taking leave.\r\n\r\n6. A letter from myself to the President of the National Assembly of\r\nFrance, in answer to his to Congress on the death of Dr. Franklin.\r\nLet it be understood, that Congress can only correspond through the\r\nexecutive, whose organ in the case of foreign nations is the Secretary\r\nof State. The President of the United States being co-ordinate with\r\nCongress, cannot personally be their scribe.\r\n\r\n7. Some papers in a case interesting to Dr. M’Henry, of Baltimore. He\r\nat first sent them to me, with a desire to commit the subject of them\r\nwholly to you. I informed him, we could not consent that you should be\r\nused as the agent of private individuals, but that if he would provide\r\nan agent on the spot who would undertake the details of solicitation,\r\nmanagement, correspondence, &c. I would desire you to patronize the\r\nmeasure so far as you should find it prudent and just. It is put on this\r\nfooting, as you will see by his answer to me.\r\n\r\n8. A correction of the report on weights and measures.\r\n\r\nYou are desired to have a medal of gold struck from the diplomatic die\r\nformerly ordered, and present it with a chain of gold to the Count de\r\nMoustier, who is notified that this will be done by you. I formerly\r\ninformed you, that we proposed to vary the worth of the present, by\r\nvarying the size of the links of the chain, which are fixed at three\r\nhundred and sixty-five in number. Let each link, in the present\r\ninstance, contain six livres worth of gold, and let it be made of\r\nplain wire, so that the value may be in the metal and not at all in the\r\nworkmanship. I shall hope to receive the dies themselves, when a safe\r\nconveyance presents itself. I am, with great esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LI.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, March 8, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 8, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have it in charge from the President of the United States of America,\r\nto communicate to the National Assembly of France, the peculiar\r\nsensibility of Congress to the tribute paid to the memory of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, by the enlightened and free representatives of a great nation,\r\nin their decree of the 11th of June, 1790.\r\n\r\nThat the loss of such a citizen should be lamented by us, among whom he\r\nlived, whom he so long and eminently served, and who feel their country\r\nadvanced and honored by his birth, life, and labors, was to be expected.\r\nBut it remained for the National Assembly of France to set the first\r\nexample of the representative of one nation, doing homage, by a public\r\nact, to the private citizen of another, and by withdrawing arbitrary\r\nlines of separation, to reduce into one fraternity the good and the\r\ngreat, wherever they have lived or died.\r\n\r\nThat these separations may disappear between us in all times and\r\ncircumstances, and that the union of sentiment which mingles our sorrows\r\non this occasion, may continue long to cement the friendship and the\r\ninterests of our two nations, is our constant prayer. With no one is\r\nit more sincere than with him, who, in being charged with the honor of\r\nconveying a public sentiment, is permitted that of expressing the homage\r\nof profound respect and veneration, with which he is, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LII.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, March 12, 1791\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 12, 1791,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI enclose you a statement of the case of Joseph St. Marie, a citizen\r\nof the United States of America, whose clerk, Mr. Swimmer, was, in\r\nthe latter part of the year 1787, seized on the eastern side of the\r\nMississippi, in latitude 34° 40’, together with his goods, of the value\r\nof nineteen hundred and eighty dollars, by a party of Spanish soldiers.\r\nThey justified themselves under the order of a Mr. Valliere, their\r\nofficer, who avowed authority from the Governor of New Orleans,\r\nrequiring him to seize and confiscate all property found on either side\r\nof the Mississippi, below the mouth of the Ohio. The matter being then\r\ncarried by St. Marie before the Governor of New Orleans, instead\r\nof correcting the injury, he avowed the act and its principle, and\r\npretended orders from his court for this and more. We have so much\r\nconfidence, however, in the moderation and friendship of the court\r\nof Madrid, that we are more ready to ascribe this outrage to officers\r\nacting at a distance, than to orders from a just sovereign. We have\r\nhitherto considered the delivery of the post of the Natches, on the part\r\nof Spain, as only awaiting the result of those arrangements which\r\nhave been under amicable discussion between us; but the remaining in\r\npossession of a post which is so near our limit of thirty-one degrees,\r\nas to admit some color of doubt whether it be on our side or theirs, is\r\none thing; while it is a very different one, to launch two hundred and\r\nfifty miles further, and seize the persons and property of our citizens;\r\nand that too, in the very moment that a friendly accommodation of all\r\ndifferences is under discussion. Our respect for their candor and good\r\nfaith does not permit us to doubt, that proper notice will be taken of\r\nthe presumption of their officer, who has thus put to hazard the peace\r\nof both nations, and we particularly expect that indemnification will be\r\nmade to the individual injured. On this you are desired to insist in the\r\nmost friendly terms, but with that earnestness and perseverance which\r\nthe complexion of this wrong requires. The papers enclosed will explain\r\nthe reasons of the delay which has intervened. It is but lately they\r\nhave been put into the hands of our government.\r\n\r\nWe cannot omit this occasion of urging on the court of Madrid the\r\nnecessity of hastening a final acknowledgment of our right to navigate\r\nthe Mississippi; a right which has been long suspended in exercise, with\r\nextreme inconvenience on our part, merely with a desire of reconciling\r\nSpain to what it, is impossible for us to relinquish. An accident at\r\nthis day, like that now complained of, would put further parley beyond\r\nour power; yet to such accidents we are every day exposed by the\r\nirregularities of their officers, and the impatience of our citizens.\r\nShould any spark kindle these dispositions of our borderers into a\r\nflame, we are involved beyond recall by the eternal principles of\r\njustice to our citizens, which we will never abandon. In such an event,\r\nSpain cannot possibly gain; and what may she not lose?\r\n\r\nThe boldness of this act of the Governor of New Orleans, and of his\r\navowal of it, renders it essential to us to understand the court of\r\nSpain on this subject. You will therefore avail yourself of the earliest\r\noccasion of obtaining their sentiments, and of communicating them to us.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIII.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, March 12,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 12,1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed papers will explain to you a case which imminently\r\nendangers the peace of the United States with Spain. It is not indeed of\r\nrecent date, but it has been recently laid before government, and is\r\nof so bold a feature, as to render dangerous to our rights a further\r\nacquiescence in their suspension. The middle ground held by France\r\nbetween us and Spain, both in friendship and interest, requires that\r\nwe should communicate with her with the fullest confidence on this\r\noccasion. I therefore enclose you a copy of my letter to Mr. Carmichael,\r\nand of the papers it refers to, to be communicated to Monsieur de\r\nMontmorin, whose efficacious interference with the court of Madrid you\r\nare desired to ask. We rely with great confidence on his friendship,\r\njustice, and influence.\r\n\r\nA cession of the navigation of the Mississippi, with such privileges\r\nas to make it useful, and free from future chicane, can be no longer\r\ndispensed with on our part: and perhaps while I am writing, something\r\nmay have already happened to cut off this appeal to friendly\r\naccommodation. To what consequences such an event would lead, cannot be\r\ncalculated. To such, very possibly, as we should lament, without being\r\nable to control. Your earnestness with Monsieur de Montmorin, and\r\nhis with the court of Spain, cannot be more pressing than the present\r\nsituation and temper of this country requires. The case of St. Marie\r\nhappens to be the incident presenting itself in the moment, when the\r\ngeneral question must otherwise have been brought forward.. We rely, on\r\nthis occasion, on the good offices of the Marquis de la Fayette, whom\r\nyou are desired to interest in it.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere and great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIV.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, March 15, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 15, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn mine of January the 23rd, I acknowledged the receipt of your letters\r\nfrom No. 29 to 48 inclusive, except 31, 44, 45, 46. Since that, I have\r\nreceived Nos. 45 and 50, the former in three months and seven days, the\r\nlatter in two months and seventeen days, by the English packet, which\r\nhad an uncommonly long passage. Nos. 31, 44, 46,47, 48, 49, are still\r\nmissing. They have probably come through merchant vessels and merchants,\r\nwho will let them lie on their counters two or three months before they\r\nwill forward them. I wrote you on the 8th and 12th instant, by a private\r\nhand, on particular subjects. I am not certain whether this will be in\r\ntime to go by the same conveyance. In yours of December the 23rd, you\r\nsuppose we receive regularly the journals of the National Assembly from\r\nyour secretary at Paris, but we have never received any thing from him.\r\nNothing has been addressed to him, his name being unknown to us.\r\n\r\nIt gives great satisfaction, that the _Arrêt du Conseil_ of December,\r\n1787, stands a chance of being saved. It is in truth the sheet-anchor\r\nof our connection with France, which will be much loosened when that\r\nis lost. This _Arrêt_ saved, a free importation of salted meats into\r\nFrance, and of provisions of all kinds into her colonies, will bind our\r\ninterests to that country more than to all the world besides. It has\r\nbeen proposed in Congress to pass a navigation act, which will deeply\r\nstrike at that of Great Britain. I send you a copy of it. It is probable\r\nthe same proposition will be made at the next Congress, as a first step,\r\nand for one more extensive at a later period. It is thought the first\r\nwill be carried: the latter will be more doubtful. Would it not be worth\r\nwhile to have the bill now enclosed, translated, printed, and circulated\r\namong the members of the National Assembly? If you think so, have\r\nit done at the public expense, with any little comment you may think\r\nnecessary, concealing the quarter from whence it is distributed; or take\r\nany other method you think better, to see whether that Assembly will\r\nnot pass a similar act. I shall send copies of it to Mr. Carmichael, at\r\nMadrid, and to Colonel Humphreys, appointed resident at Lisbon, with\r\na desire for them to suggest similar acts there. The measure is just,\r\nperfectly innocent as to all other nations, and will effectually defeat\r\nthe navigation act of Great Britain, and reduce her power on the ocean\r\nwithin safer limits.\r\n\r\nThe time of the late Congress having expired on the 3rd instant, they\r\nthen separated of necessity. Much important matter was necessarily laid\r\nover; this navigation act among others. The land law was put off, and\r\nnothing further done with the mint than to direct workmen to be engaged.\r\nThe new Congress will meet on the 4th Monday in October. Their laws\r\nshall be sent you by the first opportunity after they shall be printed.\r\nYou will receive herewith those of their second session. We know that\r\nMassachusetts has agreed to the amendments to the constitution, except\r\n(as is said) the first, second, and twelfth articles. The others,\r\ntherefore, are now in force. The articles excepted, will depend on the\r\nother legislatures. The late expedition against the northern Indians\r\nhaving been ineffectual, more serious operations against them will\r\nbe undertaken as soon as the season admits. The President is just now\r\nsetting out on a tour to the southern States, from whence he will\r\nnot return till June. The British packet being the quickest mode of\r\nconveyance, I shall avail myself of that, as well as of the French\r\npacket, to write to you. Are the letters which now pass through the\r\nFrench post-offices opened, as they were under the former government?\r\nThis is important for me to know.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. 1 omitted to draw your attention to an additional duty of one cent\r\nper gallon on rum, by name. This was intended as some discrimination\r\nbetween England and France. It would have been higher, but for the fear\r\nof affecting the revenues in a contrary direction. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LV.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, March 17,1791\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 17,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe term of the first Congress having expired on the 3rd instant,\r\nthey separated on that day, much important business being necessarily\r\npostponed. New elections have taken place for the most part, and very\r\nfew changes made. This is one of many proofs, that the proceedings of\r\nthe new government have given general satisfaction. Some acts, indeed,\r\nhave produced local discontents; but these can never be avoided. The new\r\nCongress will meet on the 4th Monday of October. Enclosed is the copy\r\nof an act reported by a committee to the late Congress, who, not having\r\ntime to go through the subject, referred it to me, to be examined and\r\nreported to the next Congress. This measure, therefore, will be proposed\r\nto them as a first and immediate step, and perhaps something further\r\nat a more distant day. I have sent copies of this act to Mr. Short and\r\nColonel Humphreys, and I enclose this to you, that you may communicate\r\nit to the court of Madrid, as a measure in contemplation with us. How\r\nfar such an one may be politic to be adopted by Spain, France, and\r\nPortugal, is for them to consider. The measure is perfectly innocent as\r\nto all nations except those, or rather that, which has a navigation\r\nact; and to that it retorts only its own principles. Being founded\r\nin universal reciprocity, it is impossible it should excite a single\r\ncomplaint. Its consequences on that nation are such as they cannot\r\navoid; for either they must repeal their navigation act, in order to be\r\nlet in to a share of foreign carriage, or the shipping they now employ\r\nin foreign carriage will be out of employ, and this act frustrated,\r\non which their naval power is built. Consequently, that power will be\r\nreduced within safer limits, and the freedom of the ocean be better\r\nsecured to all the world. The more extensive the adoption of this\r\nmeasure is, the more irresistible will be its effect. We would not wish\r\nto be declared the exciters of such a concert of measures, but we have\r\nthought it expedient to suggest informally to the courts of France,\r\nSpain, and Portugal, the measure we propose to take, and to leave with\r\nthem to decide, on the motives of their own interest, how far it may be\r\nexpedient for them to adopt a similar measure. Their concurrence will\r\nmore completely insure the object of our act, and therefore I leave it\r\nto yourself to insinuate it with all the discretion and effect you can.\r\n\r\nYour letter of May the 6th, 1789, is still the last we have received,\r\nand that is now near two years old. A letter from Colonel Humphreys,\r\nwritten within twenty-four hours after his arrival at Madrid, reached us\r\nwithin two months and ten days after its date. A full explanation of the\r\ncauses of this suspension of all information from you, is expected\r\nin answer to my letter of August the 6th. It will be waited for yet a\r\nreasonable time, and in the mean while, a final opinion suspended. By\r\nthe first vessel to Cadiz, the laws and gazettes shall be forwarded.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVI.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, March 19, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 19, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of November the 6th, No. 46, by Mr. Osmont came to hand\r\nyesterday, and I have just time before the departure of Mr. Terrasson,\r\nthe bearer of my letter of the 15th instant, and despatches accompanying\r\nit, to acknowledge the receipt, and inform you that it has been laid\r\nbefore the President. On consideration of the circumstances stated in\r\nthe second page of your letter, he is of opinion, that it is expedient\r\nto press at this moment a settlement of our difference with Spain. You\r\nare therefore desired, instead of confining your application for the\r\ninterference of the court of France to the simple case of St. Marie,\r\nmentioned in my letter of the 12th, to ask it on the broad bottom of\r\ngeneral necessity, that our right of navigating the Mississippi be at\r\nlength ceded by the court of Madrid, and be ceded in such form, as to\r\nrender the exercise of it efficacious and free from chicane. This cannot\r\nbe without an _entrepôt_ in some convenient port of the river, where\r\nthe river and sea craft may meet and exchange loads, without any control\r\nfrom the laws of the Spanish government. This subject was so fully\r\ndeveloped to you in my letter of August the 10th, 1790, that I shall at\r\npresent only refer to that. We wish you to communicate this matter\r\nfully to the Marquis de la Fayette, to ask his influence and assistance,\r\nassuring him that a settlement of this matter is become indispensable\r\nto us; any further delay exposing our peace, both at home and abroad, to\r\naccidents, the results of which are incalculable and must no longer be\r\nhazarded. His friendly interposition on this occasion, as well as that\r\nof his nation, will be most sensibly felt by us. To his discretion,\r\ntherefore, and yours, we confide this matter, trusting that you will\r\nso conduct it as to obtain our right in an efficacious form, and at the\r\nsame time, to preserve to us the friendship of France and Spain, the\r\nlatter of which we value much, and the former infinitely.\r\n\r\nMr. Carmichael is instructed to press this matter at Madrid; yet if the\r\nMarquis and yourself think it could be better effected at Paris, with\r\nthe Count de Nunez, it is left to you to endeavor to draw it there.\r\nIndeed, we believe it would be more likely to be settled there than at\r\nMadrid or here. Observe always, that to accept the navigation of the\r\nriver without an entrepot would be perfectly useless, and that an\r\nentrepot, if trammeled, would be a certain instrument for bringing on\r\nwar instead of preventing it.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVII.--TO MR. OTTO, March 29, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. OTTO.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 29, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe note of December the 13th, which you did me the honor to address to\r\nme, on the acts of Congress of the 20th of July, 1789, and 1790, fixing\r\nthe tonnage payable by foreign vessels arriving from a foreign port,\r\nwithout excepting those of France, has been submitted to the government\r\nof the United States. They consider the conduct of his Most Christian\r\nMajesty, in making this the subject of fair discussion and explanation,\r\nas a new proof of his justice and friendship, and they have entered on\r\nthe consideration with all the respect due to whatever comes from his\r\nMajesty or his ministers, and with all the dispositions to find grounds\r\nfor an union of opinion, which a sincere attachment to your nation and\r\na desire to meet their wishes on every occasion, could inspire. But\r\nthe fifth article of the treaty of amity and commerce is not seen here\r\nexactly in the point of view, in which your note places it.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth articles subject the vessels of each nation to\r\npay in the ports of the other, only such duties as are paid by the\r\nmost favored nation; and give them reciprocally, all the privileges and\r\nexemptions in navigation and commerce, which are given by either to the\r\nmost favored nations. Had the contracting parties stopped here, they\r\nwould have been free to raise or lower their tonnage, as they should\r\nfind it expedient; only taking care to keep the other on the footing of\r\nthe most favored nation.\r\n\r\nThe question then is, whether the fifth article, cited in the note, is\r\nany thing more than an application of the principle comprised in the\r\nthird and fourth, to a particular object: or whether it is an additional\r\nstipulation of something not so comprised.\r\n\r\nI. That it is merely an application of a principle comprised in the\r\npreceding articles, is declared by the express words of the article,\r\nto wit, _dans l’exemption ci-dessus est nommément compris_, &c: ‘In the\r\nabove exemption is particularly comprised the imposition of one hundred\r\nsols per ton, established in France on foreign vessels.’ Here then is\r\nat once an express declaration, that the exemption from the duty of one\r\nhundred sols is comprised in the third and fourth articles; that is to\r\nsay, it was one of the exemptions enjoyed by the most favored nations,\r\nand, as such, extended to us by those articles. If the exemption spoken\r\nof in this first member of the fifth article was comprised in the third\r\nand fourth articles, as is expressly declared, then the reservation by\r\nFrance out of that exemption, (which makes the second member of the same\r\narticle) was also comprised: that is to say, if the whole was comprised,\r\nthe part was comprised. And if this reservation of France in the second\r\nmember, was comprised in the third and fourth articles, then the counter\r\nreservation by the United States (which constitutes the third and the\r\nlast member of the same article) was also comprised. Because it is but\r\na corresponding portion of a similar whole, on our part, which had been\r\ncomprised by the same terms with theirs.\r\n\r\nIn short, the whole article relates to a particular duty of one hundred\r\nsols, laid by some antecedent law of France on the vessels of foreign\r\nnations, relinquished as to the most favored, and consequently as to\r\nus. It is not a new and additional stipulation then, but a declared\r\napplication of the stipulations comprised in the preceding articles to a\r\nparticular case, by way of greater caution.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine laid down generally in the third and fourth articles, and\r\nexemplified specially in the fifth, amounts to this. ‘The vessels of the\r\nmost favored nation, coming from foreign ports, are exempted from the\r\nduty of one hundred sols: therefore, you are exempted from it by the\r\nthird and fourth articles. The vessels of the most favored nations,\r\ncoming coastwise, pay that duty: therefore, you are to pay it by the\r\nthird and fourth articles. We shall not think it unfriendly in you, to\r\nlay a like duty on coasters, because it will be no more than we have\r\ndone ourselves. You are free also to lay that or any other duty on\r\nvessels coming from foreign ports, provided they apply to all other\r\nnations, even the most favored. We are free to do the same, under the\r\nsame restriction. Our exempting you from a duty which the most favored\r\nnations do not pay, does not exempt you from one which they do pay.’\r\n\r\nIn this view, it is evident, that the fifth article neither enlarges\r\nnor abridges the stipulations of the third and fourth. The effect of\r\nthe treaty would have been precisely the same, had it been omitted\r\naltogether; consequently, it may be truly said that the reservation by\r\nthe United States, in this article, is completely useless. And it may\r\nbe added with equal truth, that the equivalent reservation by France\r\nis completely useless, as well as her previous abandonment of the same\r\nduty: and in short, the whole article. Each party then remains free to\r\nraise or lower its tonnage, provided the change operates on all nations,\r\neven the most favored.\r\n\r\nWithout undertaking to affirm, we may obviously conjecture, that this\r\narticle has been inserted on the part of the United States, from an\r\nover caution to guard, _nommément_, by name, against a particular\r\naggrievance, which they thought could never be too well secured against:\r\nand that has happened, which generally happens; doubts have been\r\nproduced by the too great number of words used to prevent doubt.\r\n\r\nII. The court of France, however, understands this article as intended\r\nto introduce something to which the preceding articles had not reached,\r\nand not merely as an application of them to a particular case. Their\r\nopinion seems to be founded on the general rule in the construction of\r\ninstruments, to leave no words merely useless, for which any rational\r\nmeaning can be found. They say, that the reservation by the United\r\nStates of a right to lay a duty equivalent to that of the one hundred\r\nsols, reserved by France, would have been completely useless, if they\r\nwere left free by the preceding articles, to lay a tonnage to any\r\nextent whatever; consequently, that the reservation of a part proves a\r\nrelinquishment of the residue.\r\n\r\nIf some meaning, and such a one, is to be given to the last member\r\nof the article, some meaning, and a similar one, must be given to the\r\ncorresponding member. If the reservation by the United States of a right\r\nto lay an equivalent duty, implies a relinquishment of their right to\r\nlay any other, the reservation by France of a right to continue\r\nthe specified duty, to which it is an equivalent, must imply a\r\nrelinquishment of the right on her part, to lay or continue any other.\r\nEquivalent reservations by both, must imply equivalent restrictions on\r\nboth. The exact reciprocity stipulated in the preceding articles, and\r\nwhich pervades every part of the treaty, ensures a counter right to each\r\nparty for every right ceded to the other.\r\n\r\nLet it be further considered, that the duty called tonnage, in the\r\nUnited States, is in lieu of the duties for anchorage, for the support\r\nof buoys, beacons, and light-houses, to guide the mariner into harbor\r\nand along the coast, which are provided and supported at the expense of\r\nthe United States, and for fees to measurers, weighers, guagers, &c,\r\nwho are paid by the United States; for which articles, among many others\r\n(light excepted), duties are paid by us in the ports of France, under\r\ntheir specific names. That government has hitherto thought these duties\r\nconsistent with the treaty; and consequently, the same duties under a\r\ngeneral instead of specific names, with us, must be equally consistent\r\nwith it: it is not the name, but the thing, which is essential. If we\r\nhave renounced the right to lay any port duties, they must be understood\r\nto have equally renounced that of either laying new or continuing the\r\nold. If we ought to refund the port duties received from their vessels\r\nsince the date of the act of Congress, they should refund the port\r\nduties they have received from our vessels since the date of the treaty,\r\nfor nothing short of this is the reciprocity of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIf this construction be adopted, then each party has for ever renounced\r\nthe right of laying any duties on the vessels of the other coming\r\nfrom any foreign port, or more than one hundred sols on those coming\r\ncoastwise. Could this relinquishment be confined to the two contracting\r\nparties alone, its effect would be calculable. But the exemption\r\nonce conceded by the one nation to the other, becomes immediately\r\nthe property of all others who are on the footing of the most favored\r\nnations. It is true, that those others would be obliged to yield the\r\nsame compensation, that is to say, to receive our vessels duty free.\r\nWhether France and the United States would gain or lose in the exchange\r\nof the measure with them, is not easy to say.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this construction will be, that the vessels of\r\nthe most favored nations, paying no duties, will be on a better footing\r\nthan those of natives, which pay a moderate duty: consequently, either\r\nthe duty on these also must be given up, or they will be supplanted by\r\nforeign vessels in our own ports.\r\n\r\nThe resource, then, of duty on vessels, for the purposes either of\r\nrevenue or regulation, will be for ever lost to both. It is\r\nhardly conceivable that either party, looking forward to all these\r\nconsequences, would see their interest in them. So that on the\r\nwhole, Sir, we consider the fifth article of the treaty merely as an\r\nillustration of the third and fourth articles, by an application of\r\nthe principles comprised in them to the case stated in that, and that\r\na contrary construction would exceedingly embarrass and injure both\r\nthe contracting parties. We feel every disposition on our part to make\r\nconsiderable sacrifices, where they would result to the sole benefit\r\nof your nation: but where they would excite from other nations\r\ncorresponding claims, it becomes necessary to proceed with caution. You\r\nprobably know, Sir, that the general subject of navigation was before\r\nour legislature at their last session, and was postponed merely for the\r\nwant of time to go through it, before the period arrived to which the\r\nconstitution had limited their existence. It will be resumed at the\r\nmeeting of the new legislature, and from a knowledge of the sincere\r\nattachment of my countrymen to the prosperity of your nation, and to\r\nthe increase of our intercourse with it, I may safely say for the\r\nnew legislature, that the encouragement of that intercourse, for\r\nthe advantage of both parties, will be considered as among the most\r\ninteresting branches of the general subject submitted to them. From a\r\nperfect conviction of the coincidence of our interests, nobody wishes\r\nmore sincerely to cultivate the habit of mutual good offices and favors,\r\nthan he who has the honor to be, with sentiments of the greatest respect\r\nand esteem, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER--FROM THE PRESIDENT, April 4, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his respects to the Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States, and has the honor to enclose him the copy of a letter\r\nfrom the President, just now received.\r\n\r\nApril 8, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The annexed is the letter referred to.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Vernon, April 4, 1791. Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nAs the public service may require that communications should be made to\r\nme, during my absence from the seat of government, by the most direct\r\nconveyances, and as, in the event of any very extraordinary occurrence,\r\nit will be necessary to know at what time I may be found in any\r\nparticular place, I have to inform you, that unless the progress of my\r\njourney to Savannah is retarded by unforeseen interruptions, it will be\r\nregulated (including days of halt) in the following manner. I shall be,\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April, at Fredericksburg,\r\n\r\n“11th” Richmond,\r\n\r\n“14th” Petersburg,\r\n\r\n“16th” Halifax,\r\n\r\n“18th” Tarborough,\r\n\r\n“20th” Newbern, ‘\r\n\r\n“24th” Wilmington,\r\n\r\n“29th” Georgetown, South Carolina,\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of May, at Charleston, halting five days,\r\n\r\n“11th” Savannah, halting two days.\r\n\r\nThence, leaving the line of the mail, I shall proceed to Augusta, and\r\naccording to the information which I may receive there, my return, by\r\nan upper road, will be regulated. The route of my return is at present\r\nuncertain, but in all probability it will be through Columbia, Camden,\r\nCharlotte, Salisbury, Salem, Guilford, Hillsborough, Harrisburg,\r\nWilliamsburg to Taylor’s Ferry on the Roanoke, and thence to\r\nFredericksburg by the nearest and best road.\r\n\r\nAfter thus explaining to you, as far as I am able at present, the\r\ndirection and probable progress of my journey, I have to express my\r\nwish, if any serious and important case should arise during my absence\r\n(of which the probability is but too strong), that the Secretaries for\r\nthe departments of State, Treasury, and War, may hold consultations\r\nthereon, to determine whether they are of such a nature as to require my\r\npersonal attendance at the seat of government, and if they should be\r\nso considered, I will return immediately from any place at which\r\nthe information may reach me; or should they determine that measures\r\nrelevant to the case may be legally and properly pursued, without\r\nthe immediate agency of the President, I will approve and ratify the\r\nmeasures which may be conformed to such determination.\r\n\r\nPresuming that the Vice-President will have left the seat of government\r\nfor Boston, I have not requested his opinion to be taken on the supposed\r\nemergency. Should it be otherwise, I wish him also to be consulted.\r\n\r\nI am, Gentlemen, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nG. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and Henry Knox, Esquires,\r\nSecretaries of the United States for the departments of State, Treasury,\r\nand War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVIII.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, April 11, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 11, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you March the 15th, with postscripts of the 18th and 19th. Since\r\nthat, yours of January the 3rd, No. 10, January the 15th, No. 11, from\r\nMadrid, February the 6th, No. 12, and February the 12th, No. 13, from\r\nLisbon, have been received. They covered a letter from Mr. Carmichael,\r\nthe only one we have from him of later date than May, 1789. You know\r\nthat my letter to him, of which you were the bearer, took notice of the\r\nintermission of his correspondence, and the one enclosed to him in my\r\nletter to you of March the 15th, being written when this intermission\r\nwas felt still stronger, as having continued so much longer, conveyed\r\nstronger marks of dissatisfaction. Though his letter, now received,\r\nconvinces us he has been active in procuring intelligence, yet it does\r\nnot appear that he has been equally assiduous in procuring means of\r\nconveyance, which was the more incumbent on him, in proportion as the\r\ngovernment was more jealous and watchful. Still, however, I wish him to\r\nreceive the letter now enclosed for him, herein, as it softens what had\r\nbeen harder said, and shows a disposition rather to look forward than\r\nbackward. I hope you will receive it in time to forward with the other.\r\nIt contains important matter, pressing on him, as I wish to do on\r\nyou and have done on Mr. Short, to engage your respective courts in\r\na co-operation in our navigation act. Procure us all the information\r\npossible, as to the strength, riches, resources, lights, and\r\ndispositions of Brazil. The jealousy of the court of Lisbon on this\r\nsubject, will, of course, inspire you with due caution in making and\r\ncommunicating these inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe acts of the three sessions of Congress, and Fenno’s papers from\r\nApril, 1790, were sent you with my last. You will now receive the\r\ncontinuation of Fenno’s paper. I send for Mr. Carmichael, also, laws and\r\nnewspapers, in hopes you may find some means of conveying them to him.\r\nI must sometimes avail myself of your channel to write to him, till we\r\nshall have a Consul at Cadiz.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIX.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, April 11,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 11,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 12th of March, and again on the 17th of the same\r\nmonth; since which, I have received your favor of January the 24th,\r\nwherein you refer to copies of two letters, also to a paper, No. 1,\r\nsupposed to be enclosed in that letter; but there was nothing enclosed.\r\nYou speak particularly of several other letters formerly forwarded, but\r\nnot a single one was ever received of later date than May the 6th, 1789;\r\nand this of January the 24th is all we possess from you since that date.\r\nI enclose you a list of letters addressed to you on various subjects,\r\nand to which answers were, and are, naturally expected; and send you\r\nagain copies of the papers in the case of the Dover Cutter, which has\r\nbeen the subject of so many of those letters, and is the subject of\r\nthe constant solicitation of the parties here. A final decision on that\r\napplication, therefore, is earnestly desired. When you consider\r\nthe repeated references of matters to you from hence, and the total\r\nsuppression of whatever you have written in answer, you will not\r\nbe surprised if it had excited a great degree of uneasiness. We had\r\ninquired whether private conveyances did not occur, from time to time,\r\nfrom Madrid to Cadiz, where we have vessels almost constantly, and we\r\nwere assured that such conveyances were frequent. On the whole, Sir,\r\nyou will be sensible, that under the jealous government with which you\r\nreside, the conveyance of intelligence requires as much management as\r\nthe obtaining it; and I am in hopes, that in future you will be on your\r\nguard against those infidelities in that line, under which you and we\r\nhave so much suffered.\r\n\r\nThe President is absent on a journey through the southern States, from\r\nwhich he will not return till the end of June; consequently, I could not\r\nsooner notify him of your desire to return; but even then, I will take\r\nthe liberty of saying nothing to him on the subject till I hear further\r\nfrom you. The suppression of your correspondence has, in a considerable\r\ndegree, withdrawn you from the public sight. I sincerely wish that\r\nbefore your return, you could do something to attract their attention\r\nand favor, and render your return pleasing to yourself and profitable to\r\nthem, by introducing you to new proofs of their confidence. My two last\r\nletters to you furnish occasions; that of a co-operation against the\r\nBritish navigation act, and the arrangement of our affairs on the\r\nMississippi. The former, if it can be effected, will form a remarkable\r\nand memorable epoch in the history and freedom of the ocean. Mr. Short\r\nwill press it at Paris, and Colonel Humphreys at Lisbon. The latter will\r\nshow most at first; and as to it, be so good as to observe always, that\r\nthe right of navigating the Mississippi is considered as so palpable,\r\nthat the recovery of it will produce no other sensation than that of\r\na gross injustice removed. The extent and freedom of the port for\r\nfacilitating the use of it, is what will excite the attention and\r\ngratification of the public. Colonel Humphreys writes me, that all Mr.\r\nGardoqui’s communications, while here, tended to impress the court of\r\nMadrid with the idea, that the navigation of the Mississippi was only\r\ndemanded on our part, to quiet our western settlers, and that it was not\r\nsincerely desired by the maritime States. This is a most fatal error,\r\nand must be completely eradicated and speedily, or Mr. Gardoqui will\r\nprove to have been a bad peace-maker. It is true, there were characters,\r\nwhose stations entitled them to credit, and who, from geographical\r\nprejudices, did not themselves wish the navigation of the Mississippi to\r\nbe restored to us, and who believe, perhaps, as is common with mankind,\r\nthat their opinion was the general opinion. But the sentiments of the\r\ngreat mass of the union were decidedly otherwise then, and the very\r\npersons to whom Mr. Gardoqui alluded, have now come over to the\r\nopinion heartily, that the navigation of the Mississippi, in full and\r\nunrestrained freedom, is indispensably necessary, and must be obtained\r\nby any means it may call for. It will be most unfortunate, indeed, if we\r\ncannot convince Spain that we make this demand in earnest, but by acts\r\nwhich will render that conviction too late to prevent evil.\r\n\r\nNot knowing how better to convey to you the laws and the gazettes, than\r\nby committing them to the patronage of Colonel Humphreys, I now send\r\nthrough that channel the laws of the second and third sessions of\r\nCongress, and the newspapers.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LX.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, April 25, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 25, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy late letters to you have been of the 8th, 12th, 15th, and\r\n\r\n19th of March; yours received and acknowledged, are as follows,\r\n\r\n******\r\n\r\nI consider the consular convention as securing clearly our right to\r\nappoint Consuls in the French colonies. The words ‘_Etats du roi_’\r\nunquestionably extend to all his dominions. If they had been merely\r\nsynonymous with ‘_la France_,’ why was the alteration made? When I\r\nproposed that alteration, I explained my reasons, and it cannot be\r\nsupposed I would offer a change of language, but for some matter of\r\nsubstance. Again, in the translation, it is ‘dominions of France.’ This\r\ntranslation was submitted to M. de Montmorin and M. de Reyneval, with a\r\nrequest that they would note any deviation in it from the original, or\r\notherwise it would be considered as faithful. No part was objected to.\r\nM. de Reyneval says, we must decide by the instrument itself, and not by\r\nthe explanations which took place. It is a rule, where expressions are\r\nsusceptible of two meanings, to recur to other explanations. Good\r\nfaith is in favor of this recurrence. However, in the present case, the\r\nexpression does not admit of two constructions; it is co-extensive with\r\nthe dominions of the King. I insist on this, only as a reservation\r\nof our right, and not with a view to exercise it, if it shall be\r\ninconvenient or disagreeable to the government of France. Only two\r\nappointments have as yet been made (Mr. Skipwith at Martinique and\r\nGuadaloupe, and Mr. Bourne in St. Dominique), and they shall be\r\ninstructed not to ask a regular _Exequatur_. We certainly wish to press\r\nnothing on our friends, which shall be inconvenient. I shall hope\r\nthat M. de Montmorin will order such attentions to be shown to those\r\ngentlemen as the patronage of commerce may call for, and may not be\r\ninconvenient to the government. These gentlemen are most pointedly\r\ninstructed not to intermeddle, by word or deed, with political matters.\r\n\r\nMy letter of August, 1790, to Mr. Carmichael, was delivered to him by\r\nColonel Humphreys.\r\n\r\nThe report you mention of the prospect of our captives at Algiers\r\nbeing liberated, has not taken its rise from any authoritative source.\r\nUnfortunately for us, there have been so many persons, who (from\r\nfriendly or charitable motives, or to recommend themselves) have busied\r\nthemselves about this redemption, as to excite great expectations in the\r\ncaptors, and render our countrymen in fact irredeemable. We have not a\r\nsingle operation on foot for that purpose, but what you know of, and the\r\nmore all voluntary interpositions are discouraged, the better for our\r\nunhappy friends whom they are meant to serve.\r\n\r\nYou know how strongly we desire to pay off our whole debt to France,\r\nand that for this purpose, we will use our credit as far as it will hold\r\ngood. You know, also, what may be the probability of our being able to\r\nborrow the whole sum. Under these dispositions and prospects, it would\r\ngrieve us extremely to see our debt pass into the hands of speculators,\r\nand be subjected ourselves to the chicaneries and vexations of private\r\navarice. We desire you, therefore, to dissuade the government, as far as\r\nyou can prudently, from listening from any overtures of that kind, and\r\nas to the speculators themselves, whether native or foreign, to inform\r\nthem, without reserve, that our government condemns their projects, and\r\nreserves to itself the right of paying nowhere but into the treasury of\r\nFrance, according to their contract.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of Mr. Grand’s note to me, stating the conditions\r\non which Drost would come, and also a letter from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, expressing his ideas as to those terms, with which I agree.\r\nWe leave to your agency the engaging and sending Mr. Drost as soon\r\nas possible, and to your discretion to fix the terms, rendering the\r\nallowance for expenses certain, which his first proposition leaves\r\nuncertain. Subsistence here costs about one third of what it does in\r\nParis, to a housekeeper. In a lodging house, the highest price for a\r\nroom and board is a dollar a day, for the master, and half that for the\r\nservant. These facts may enable you to settle the article of expenses\r\nreasonably. If Mr. Drost undertakes assaying, I should much rather\r\nconfide it to him, than to any other person who can be sent. It is the\r\nmost confidential operation in the whole business of coining. We should\r\nexpect him to instruct a native in it. I think, too, he should be\r\nobliged to continue longer than a year, if it should be necessary for\r\nqualifying others to continue his operations. It is not important that\r\nhe be here till November or December, but extremely desirable then. He\r\nmay come as much sooner as he pleases.\r\n\r\nWe address to M. la Motte a small box for you, containing a complete set\r\nof the journals of the ancient Congress, the acts of the last session of\r\nthe federal legislature, and a continuation of the newspapers.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend\r\nand humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXI.--TO MR. OTTO, May 7, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. OTTO.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 7, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have now the honor to return you the propositions of Messrs.\r\nSchweizer, Jeanneret, and Company, which have been submitted to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. He does not think they can be acceded to on\r\nthe part of the United States. The greater premium demanded than what we\r\nnow pay, the change of the place of payment, the change of the bankers\r\nwhom we have always employed, for others unknown to us, the danger of\r\nrisking our credit by putting such a mass of our paper into new hands,\r\nwill, I dare say, appear to you, Sir, substantial reasons for declining\r\nthis measure; and the more so, as the new instructions given to Mr.\r\nShort, are to raise money as fast as our credit will admit: and we have\r\nno reason to suppose it cannot be as soon done by our ancient bankers as\r\nby others. Our desire to pay our whole debt, principal and interest, to\r\nFrance, is as strong as hers can be to receive it, and we believe, that\r\nby the arrangements already taken it will be as soon done for her, and\r\nmore safely and advantageously for us than by a change of them. We\r\nbeg you to be assured, that no exertions are sparing on our part to\r\naccomplish this desirable object, as it will be peculiarly gratifying to\r\nus, that monies advanced to us in critical times, should be reimbursed\r\nto France in times equally critical to her.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXII.--TO THE ATTORNEY OF THE DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY, May 7,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY OF THE DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 7,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nA certain James O’Fallon is, as we are informed, undertaking to raise,\r\norganize, and commission an army, of his own authority, and independent\r\nof that of the government, the object of which is, to go and possess\r\nthemselves of lands which have never yet been granted by any authority,\r\nwhich the government admits to be legal, and with an avowed design to\r\nhold them by force against any power, foreign or domestic. As this will\r\ninevitably commit our whole nation in war with the Indian nations, and\r\nperhaps others, it cannot be permitted that all the inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States shall be involved in the calamities of war, and the blood\r\nof thousands of them be poured out, merely that a few adventurers may\r\npossess themselves of lands: nor can a well-ordered government tolerate\r\nsuch an assumption of its sovereignty by unauthorized individuals. I\r\nsend you herein the Attorney General’s opinion of what may legally be\r\ndone, with a desire that you proceed against the said O’Fallon\r\naccording to law. It is not the wish, to extend the prosecution to\r\nother individuals, who may have given thoughtlessly in to his unlawful\r\nproceeding. I enclose you a proclamation to this effect. But they may be\r\nassured, that if this undertaking be prosecuted, the whole force of the\r\nUnited States will be displayed to punish the transgression. I enclose\r\nyou one of O’Fallon’s commissions, signed, as is said, by himself.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIII.--TO THOMAS BARCLAY, May 13,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 13,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYou are appointed by the President of the United States, to go to the\r\ncourt of Morocco for the purpose of obtaining from the new Emperor, a\r\nrecognition of our treaty with his father. As it is thought best that\r\nyou should go in some definite character, that of Consul has been\r\nadopted, and you consequently receive a commission as Consul for the\r\nUnited States, in the dominions of the Emperor of Morocco, which, having\r\nbeen issued during the recess of the Senate, will of course expire at\r\nthe end of their next session. It has been thought best, however, not to\r\ninsert this limitation in the commission, as being unnecessary; and it\r\nmight, perhaps, embarrass. Before the end of the next session of the\r\nSenate, it is expected the objects of your mission will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nLisbon being the most convenient port of correspondence between us\r\nand Morocco, sufficient authority will be given to Colonel Humphreys,\r\nresident of the United States at that place, over funds in Amsterdam,\r\nfor the objects of your mission. On him, therefore, you will draw for\r\nthe sums herein allowed, or such parts of them as shall be necessary. To\r\nthat port, too, you had better proceed in the first vessel which shall\r\nbe going there, as it is expected you will get a ready passage from\r\nthence to Morocco.\r\n\r\nOn your arrival at Morocco, sound your ground, and know how things stand\r\nat present. Your former voyage there, having put you in possession of\r\nthe characters through whom this may be done, who may best be used for\r\napproaching the Emperor and effecting your purpose, you are left to use\r\nyour own knowledge to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nThe object being merely to obtain an acknowledgment of the treaty, we\r\nrely that you will be able to do this, giving very moderate presents.\r\nAs the amount of these will be drawn into precedent on future similar\r\nrepetitions of them, it becomes important. Our distance, our seclusion\r\nfrom the ancient world, its politics, and usages, our agricultural\r\noccupations and habits, our poverty, and lastly, our determination to\r\nprefer war in all cases to tribute under any form, and to any people\r\nwhatever, will furnish you with topics for opposing and refusing high\r\nor dishonoring pretensions; to which may be added, the advantages their\r\npeople will derive from our commerce, and their sovereign, from the\r\nduties laid on whatever we extract from that country.\r\n\r\nKeep us regularly informed of your proceedings and progress, by\r\nwriting by every possible occasion, detailing to us particularly your\r\nconferences, either private or public, and the persons with whom they\r\nare held.\r\n\r\nWe think that Francisco Chiappe has merited well of the United States,\r\nby his care of their peace and interests. He has sent an account\r\nof disbursements for us, amounting to three hundred and ninety-four\r\ndollars. Do not recognise the account, because we are unwilling, by\r\ndoing that, to give him a color for presenting larger ones hereafter,\r\nfor expenses which it is impossible for us to scrutinize or control. Let\r\nhim understand, that our laws oppose the application of public money so\r\ninformally; but in your presents, treat him handsomely, so as not only\r\nto cover this demand, but go beyond it with a liberality which may\r\nfix him deeply in our interests. The place he holds near the Emperor,\r\nrenders his friendship peculiarly important. Let us have nothing further\r\nto do with his brothers, or any other person. The money, which would\r\nmake one good friend, divided among several, will produce no attachment.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor has intimated that he expects an ambassador from us. Let him\r\nunderstand, that this may be a custom of the old world, but it is not\r\nours; that we never sent an ambassador to any nation.\r\n\r\nYou are to be allowed, from the day of your departure till your return,\r\none hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty-six cents and two thirds, a\r\nmonth, for your time and expenses, adding thereto your passage money and\r\nsea-stores going and coming.\r\n\r\nRemain in your post till the first of April next, and as much longer as\r\nshall be necessary to accomplish the objects of your mission, unless you\r\nshould receive instructions from hence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nWith your commission, you will receive a letter to the Emperor of\r\nMorocco, a cipher, and a letter to Colonel Humphreys.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A private Instruction which Mr. Barclay is to carry in his memory and\r\nnot on paper, lest it should come into improper hands_.\r\n\r\nWe rely that you will obtain the friendship of the new Emperor, and his\r\nassurances that the treaty shall be faithfully observed, with as little\r\nexpense as possible. But the sum of ten thousand dollars is fixed as the\r\nlimit which all your donations together are not to exceed.\r\n\r\nMay 13, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Letter from the President to the Emperor of Morocco, referred to in the\r\nletter to Mr Barclay.]\r\n\r\nGreat and Magnanimous Friend,\r\n\r\nSeparated by an immense ocean from the more ancient nations of the\r\nearth, and little connected with their politics or proceedings, we are\r\nlate in learning the events which take place among them, and later in\r\nconveying to them our sentiments thereon.\r\n\r\nThe death of the late Emperor, your father and our friend, of glorious\r\nmemory, is one of those events which, though distant, attracts our\r\nnotice and concern. Receive, great and good friend, my sincere sympathy\r\nwith you on that loss; and permit me, at the same time, to express the\r\nsatisfaction with which I learn the accession of so worthy a successor\r\nto the imperial throne of Morocco, and to offer you the homage of my\r\nsincere congratulations. May the days of your Majesty’s life be many\r\nand glorious, and may they ever mark the era during which a great people\r\nshall have been most prosperous and happy, under the best and happiest\r\nof sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe late Emperor, very soon after the establishment of our infant\r\nnation, manifested his royal regard and amity to us by many friendly\r\nand generous acts, and particularly by the protection of our citizens\r\nin their commerce with his subjects. And as a further instance of his\r\ndesire to promote our prosperity and intercourse with his realms, he\r\nentered into a treaty of amity and commerce with us, for himself and his\r\nsuccessors, to continue fifty years. The justice and magnanimity of your\r\nMajesty, leave us full confidence that the treaty will meet your royal\r\npatronage also; and it will give me great satisfaction to be assured,\r\nthat the citizens of the United States of America may expect from your\r\nimperial Majesty the same protection and kindness, which the example of\r\nyour illustrious father has taught them to expect from those who occupy\r\nthe throne of Morocco, and to have your royal word, that they may count\r\non a due observance of the treaty which cements the two nations in\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nThis will be delivered to your Majesty by our faithful citizen, Thomas\r\nBarclay, whom I name Consul for these United States in the dominions of\r\nyour Majesty, and who, to the integrity and knowledge qualifying him\r\nfor that office, unites the peculiar advantage of having been the agent,\r\nthrough whom our treaty with the late Emperor was received. I pray\r\nyour Majesty to protect him in the exercise of his functions for the\r\npatronage of the commerce between our two countries, and of those who\r\ncarry it on.\r\n\r\nMay that God, whom we both adore, bless your imperial Majesty with long\r\nlife, health, and success, and have you always, great and magnanimous\r\nfriend, under his holy keeping.\r\n\r\nWritten at Philadelphia, the thirty-first day of March, in the fifteenth\r\nyear of our sovereignty and independence, from your good and faithful\r\nfriend, George Washington.\r\n\r\nBy the President.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIV.--TO FULWAR SKIPWITH, May 13,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FULWAR SKIPWITH.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 13,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYou will readily conceive, that the union of domestic with the foreign\r\naffairs under the department of State, brings on the head of this\r\ndepartment such incessant calls, not admitting delay, as oblige him to\r\npostpone whatever will bear postponing: hence, though it is important\r\nthat I should continue to receive, from time to time, regular\r\ninformation from you of whatever occurs within your notice, interesting\r\nto the United States, yet it is not in my power to acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your letters, regularly as they come. I mention this\r\ncircumstance, that you may ascribe the delay of acknowledgment to the\r\nreal cause, and that it may not produce any relaxation on your part\r\nin making all those communications which it is important should be\r\nreceived, and which govern our proceedings, though it is not in my power\r\nto note it to you specially.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that Congress, at their last session, would have passed\r\na bill for regulating the functions of Consuls. Such an one was laid\r\nbefore them, but there being a considerable difference of opinion as to\r\nsome of its parts, it was finally lost by the shortness of the session,\r\nwhich the constitution had limited to the 3rd of March. It will be taken\r\nup again at the ensuing session of October next: in the mean time, you\r\nwill be pleased to govern yourself by the instructions already given.\r\n\r\nIn general, our affairs are proceeding in a train of unparalleled\r\nprosperity. This arises from the real improvements of our government;\r\nfrom the unbounded confidence reposed in it by the people, their zeal to\r\nsupport it, and their conviction that a solid union is the best rock\r\nof their safety; from the favorable seasons which, for some years past,\r\nhave co-operated with a fertile soil and genial climate to increase the\r\nproductions of agriculture; and from the growth of industry, economy,\r\nand domestic manufactures. So that I believe I may say, with truth, that\r\nthere is not a nation under the sun enjoying more present prosperity,\r\nnor with more in prospect.\r\n\r\nThe Indians on our frontier, indeed, still continue to cut off\r\nstraggling individuals or families falling in their way. An expedition\r\nagainst them the last summer was less successful than there was reason\r\nto expect; we lost in it about one hundred men. The operations of the\r\npresent summer will more probably bring them to peace, which is all\r\nwe desire of them, it having been a leading object of our present\r\ngovernment to guaranty them in their present possessions, and to protect\r\ntheir persons with the same fidelity which is extended to its own\r\ncitizens. We ask nothing of them but that they will accept our peace,\r\nfriendship, and services; and we hope soon to make them sensible of\r\nthis, in spite of the incitements against us, which they have been so\r\nmuch the dupes of. This is the general state of our affairs at present,\r\nas faithfully as I am able to give it.\r\n\r\nYour favors of August the 30th, September the 18th, October the 10th,\r\nand February the 10th, have been duly received. Particular reasons\r\nrender it improper to press a formal acknowledgment of our Consuls in\r\nthe French colonies: for this purpose we must wait till circumstances\r\nshall render it less inconvenient to their government. In the mean\r\ntime, as to every thing essential, the same attention will be paid\r\nto yourself, your representations, and applications, as if you were\r\nformally acknowledged. I am to recommend to you, in the strongest\r\nterms, not to intermeddle in the least, by word or deed, in the internal\r\ndisputes of the colony, or those with the mother country: consider this\r\nas a family affair, with which we have neither the right nor the wish to\r\nintermeddle. We shall expect, however, narratives of them from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXV.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, May 16, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 16, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMr. Swanwick informs me, that the house of Morris, Willing, and Swanwick\r\nhave suffered a very considerable loss in the port of St. Andero, by an\r\nabuse of office, in having a cargo of corn thrown overboard, as being\r\nbad, when it was in fact perfectly good. I know that in some countries\r\nof Europe it is often difficult to obtain justice against persons\r\nprotected by court favor. In this, as in all other instances where our\r\ncitizens shall have occasion to seek justice in the country of your\r\nresidence, I would wish you to interfere just so far, as by the\r\ninfluence of your character to counterbalance the undue protection of\r\ntheir opponents, so as that equal and impartial justice may be done\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe regulation by which they suffer, in the present instance, is, in its\r\nnature, extremely susceptible of abuse, and prevails, as I am told, only\r\nin the ports of the Bay of Biscay. The patronage of our commerce being\r\nthe chief object of our diplomatic establishments abroad, you would\r\nrender that an essential service could you obtain a repeal of this\r\nregulation, or an impartial exercise of it, if the repeal cannot be\r\nobtained; and in any event a permission to re-export a cargo of grain\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVI.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, July 13,1791\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 13,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay having been detained longer than was expected, you will\r\nreceive this as well as my letter of May the 13th, from him. Since the\r\ndate of that, I have received your No. 15, March the 31st, No. 16, April\r\nthe 8th, No. 17, April the 30th, No. 18, May the 3rd, and No. 20, May\r\nthe 21st.\r\n\r\nYou are not unacquainted with the situation of our captives at Algiers.\r\nMeasures were taken, and were long depending, for their redemption.\r\nDuring the time of their dependence, we thought it would forward our\r\nsuccess to take no notice of the captives. They were maintained by the\r\nSpanish Consul, from whom applications for reimbursement, through\r\nMr. Carmichael, often came: no answer of any kind was ever given. A\r\ncertainty now, that our measures for their redemption will not succeed,\r\nrenders it unnecessary for us to be so reserved on the subject, and\r\nto continue to wear the appearance of neglecting them. Though the\r\ngovernment might have agreed to ransom at the lowest price admitted with\r\nany nation (as, for instance, that of the French order of Merci), they\r\nwill not give any thing like the price which has been lately declared to\r\nbe the lowest by the captors. It remains, then, for us to see what other\r\nmeans are practicable for their recovery. In the mean time, it is our\r\ndesire that the disbursements hitherto made for their subsistence,\r\nby the Spanish Consul or others, be paid off, and that their future\r\ncomfortable subsistence be provided for. As to past disbursements,\r\nI must beg the favor of you to write to Mr. Carmichael, that you are\r\nauthorized to pay them off, pray him to let you know their amount,\r\nand to whom payments are due. With respect to future provision for the\r\ncaptives, I must put it into your hands. The impossibility of getting\r\nletters to or from Mr. Carmichael, renders it improper for us to use\r\nthat channel. As to the footing on which they are to be subsisted, the\r\nration and clothing of a soldier would have been a good measure, were\r\nit possible to apply it to articles of food and clothing so extremely\r\ndifferent as those used at Algiers. The allowance heretofore made them\r\nby the Spanish Consul might perhaps furnish a better rule, as we have it\r\nfrom themselves, that they were then comfortably subsisted. Should you\r\nbe led to correspond with them at all, it had better be with Captain\r\nO’Bryan, who is a sensible man, and whose conduct since he has been\r\nthere, has been particularly meritorious. It will be better for you to\r\navoid saying any thing which may either increase or lessen their hopes\r\nof ransom. I write to our bankers, to answer your drafts for these\r\npurposes, and enclose you a duplicate to be forwarded with your first\r\ndraft. The prisoners are fourteen in number: their names and qualities\r\nas follows; Richard O’Bryan and Isaac Stephens, captains; Andrew\r\nMontgomery and Alexander Forsyth, mates; Jacob Tessanier, a French\r\npassenger; William Patterson, Philip Sloan, Peleg Lorin, John Robertson,\r\nJames Hall, James Cathcart, George Smith, John Gregory, James Hermel,\r\nseamen. They have been twenty-one or twenty-two.\r\n\r\nWe are in hourly expectation of hearing the event of General Scott’s\r\nirruption into the Indian country, at the head of between seven and\r\neight hundred mounted infantry. Perhaps it may yet be known in time\r\nto communicate to you by this opportunity. Our bank was filled with\r\nsubscriptions the moment it was opened. Eight millions of dollars\r\nwere the whole permitted to be subscribed, of which two millions were\r\ndeposited in cash, the residue to be public paper. Every other symptom\r\nis equally favorable to our credit.\r\n\r\nThe President has returned from his southern tour in good health. You\r\nwill receive herewith the newspapers up to the present date.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem Dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh; Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVII.--TO M. VAN BERKEL, July 14,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. VAN BERKEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 14,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of troubling you with the perusal of the enclosed\r\npapers from Mr. Shaw, Consul for the United States in the East Indies;\r\nwherein you will observe, he complains of a prohibition from the\r\ngovernment of Batavia, to American ships, by name, to have any trade\r\nin that port, while such trade was permitted to other nations. I do not\r\nhesitate to presume, that something has been misunderstood in this case.\r\nMy presumption is founded on those sentiments of general amity which\r\nsubsist between our government and that of the United Netherlands, and\r\nalso on the whole tenor of our treaty, which secures to us always the\r\ntreatment of the most favored nation. Nevertheless, the refusal by the\r\ngovernment of Batavia has been so formal, so deliberate and pointed, as\r\nto render it necessary to ask for some explanation. If you will allow me\r\nthe honor of a moment’s conference on this subject, the first time you\r\ncome to town, I shall be obliged to you: and in the mean time, have that\r\nof assuring you of those sentiments of esteem and respect, with which I\r\nam, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVIII.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, July 26,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 26,1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of February the 26th and March the 16th have been duly\r\nreceived. The conferences which you held last with the British minister\r\nneeded no apology. At the time of writing my letter desiring that\r\ncommunications with them might cease, it was supposed possible that some\r\nmight take place before it would be received. They proved to be such as\r\nnot to vary the opinion formed, and, indeed, the result of the whole is\r\nwhat was to have been expected from known circumstances. Yet the essay\r\nwas perhaps necessary to justify, as well as induce, the measures proper\r\nfor the protection of our commerce. The first remittance of a thousand\r\ndollars to you, was made without the aid of any facts, which could\r\nenable the government to judge what sum might be an indemnification\r\nfor the interference of the business referred to you, with your private\r\npursuits. Your letter of February the 26th furnishing grounds for\r\ncorrecting the first judgment, I now enclose you a bill on our bankers\r\nin Holland for another sum of a thousand dollars. In the original\r\nremittance, as in this supplement to it, there has been no view but to\r\ndo what is right between the public and those who serve them.\r\n\r\nThough no authentic account is yet received, we learn through private\r\nchannels that General Scott has returned from a successful expedition\r\nagainst the Indians; having killed about thirty warriors, taken fifty\r\nodd women and children prisoners, and destroyed two or three villages,\r\nwithout the loss of a man, except three, drowned by accident. A similar\r\nexpedition was to follow immediately after the first, while preparations\r\nare making for measures of more permanent effect: so that we hope this\r\nsummer to bring the Indians to accept of a just and general peace, on\r\nwhich nothing will be asked of them but their peace.\r\n\r\nThe crops of wheat in the United States are rather abundant, and the\r\nquality good. Those of tobacco are not promising as yet. I have heard\r\nnothing of the rice crops.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIX.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, July 28,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 28,1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince my last I have received letters from you as follows:\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nMine to you unacknowledged, were of March the 8th, 12th, 15th, 19th,\r\nApril the 25th, and May the 10th. Your two last letters mention the\r\nlength of time you have been without intelligence, having then received\r\nmine of January the 23rd only. You will perceive by the above, that six\r\nletters of a later date were on their way to you. The receipt of\r\nthese, with the newspapers, journals, laws, and other printed papers\r\naccompanying them, will have relieved your anxiety, by answering\r\nseveral articles of your former letters, and opening to you some new\r\nand important matters. I scarcely ever miss the opportunity of a private\r\nvessel going from hence or New York to any port of France, without\r\nwriting to you and sending you the newspapers, &c. In the winter,\r\noccasions are very rare, this port particularly being blocked up with\r\nice. The reason of so long an interval between the last and present\r\nletter, has been the journey of a month, which that informed you I\r\nwas about to take. This is the first vessel which has offered since my\r\nreturn: she is bound to Havre, and will carry the newspapers as usual.\r\n\r\nThe difference of sixty-two livres ten sols the hogshead, established by\r\nthe National Assembly on tobacco brought in their and our ships, is\r\nsuch an act of hostility against our navigation, as was not to have been\r\nexpected from the friendship of that nation. It is as new in its nature\r\nas extravagant in its degree; since it is unexampled, that any nation\r\nhas endeavored to wrest from another the carriage of its own produce,\r\nexcept in the case of their colonies. The British navigation act, so\r\nmuch and so justly complained of, leaves to all nations the carriage of\r\ntheir own commodities free. This measure, too, is calculated expressly\r\nto take our own carriage from us and give the equivalent to other\r\nnations: for it is well known, that the shipping of France is not\r\nequal to the carriage of their whole commerce; but the freight in other\r\nbranches of navigation being on an equal footing with only forty livres\r\nthe hogshead, in ours, and this new arrangement giving them sixty-two\r\nlivres ten sols the hogshead, in addition to their freight, that is to\r\nsay, one hundred and two livres ten sols, instead of forty livres, their\r\nvessels will leave every other branch of business to fill up this. They\r\nwill consequently leave a void in those other branches, which will be\r\noccupied by English, Dutch, and Swedes, on the spot. They complain of\r\nour tonnage duty, but it is because it is not understood. In the ports\r\nof France, we pay fees for anchorage, buoys, and beacons, fees\r\nto measurers, weighers, and guagers, and in some countries, for\r\nlight-houses. We have thought it better that the public here should pay\r\nall these, and reimburse itself by a consolidation of them into one fee,\r\nproportioned to the tonnage of the vessel, and therefore called by\r\nthat name. They complain that the foreign tonnage is higher than the\r\ndomestic. If this complaint had come from the English, it would not have\r\nbeen wonderful, because the foreign tonnage operates really as a tax on\r\ntheir commerce, which, under this name, is found to pay sixteen dollars\r\nand fifty cents for every dollar paid by France. It was not conceived,\r\nthat the latter would have complained of a measure calculated to operate\r\nso unequally on her rival, and I still suppose she would not complain,\r\nif the thing were well understood. The refusing to our vessels the\r\nfaculty of becoming national bottoms, on sale to their citizens, was\r\nnever before done by any nation but England. I cannot help hoping that\r\nthese were wanderings of a moment, founded in misinformation, which\r\nreflection will have corrected before you receive this.\r\n\r\nWhenever jealousies are expressed as to any supposed views of ours, on\r\nthe dominion of the West Indies, you cannot go farther than the truth,\r\nin asserting we have none. If there be one principle more deeply rooted\r\nthan any other in the mind of every American, it is, that we should\r\nhave nothing to do with conquest. As to commerce, indeed, we have strong\r\nsensations. In casting our eyes over the earth, we see no instance of a\r\nnation forbidden, as we are, by foreign powers, to deal with neighbors,\r\nand obliged, with them, to carry into another hemisphere, the mutual\r\nsupplies necessary to relieve mutual wants. This is not merely a\r\nquestion between the foreign power and our neighbor. We are interested\r\nin it equally with the latter, and nothing but moderation, at least with\r\nrespect to us, can render us indifferent to its continuance. An exchange\r\nof surpluses and wants between neighbor nations is both a right and a\r\nduty under the moral law, and measures against right should be mollified\r\nin their exercise, if it be wished to lengthen them to the greatest\r\nterm possible. Circumstances sometimes require, that rights the most\r\nunquestionable should be advanced with delicacy. It would seem that the\r\none now spoken of would need only a mention, to be assented to by any\r\nunprejudiced mind: but with respect to America, Europeans in general\r\nhave been too long in the habit of confounding force with right.\r\nThe Marquis de la Fayette stands in such a relation between the two\r\ncountries, that I should think him perfectly capable of seeing what\r\nis just as to both. Perhaps on some occasion of free conversation, you\r\nmight find an opportunity of impressing these truths on his mind,\r\nand that from him they might be let out at a proper moment as matters\r\nmeriting consideration and weight, when they shall be engaged in the\r\nwork of forming a constitution for our neighbors. In policy, if not in\r\njustice, they should be disposed to avoid oppression, which, falling on\r\nus as well as on their colonies, might tempt us to act together.*\r\n\r\n     [* This paragraph was in cipher, but an explication of it\r\n     preserved with the copy.]\r\n\r\nThe element of measure adopted by the National Assembly excludes, _ipso\r\nfacto_, every nation on earth from a communion of measure with them; for\r\nthey acknowledge themselves, that a due portion for admeasurement of a\r\nmeridian crossing the forty-fifth degree of latitude, and terminating\r\nat both ends in the same level, can be found in no country on earth but\r\ntheirs. It would follow then, that other nations must trust to their\r\nadmeasurement, or send persons into their country to make it themselves,\r\nnot only in the first instance, but whenever afterwards they may wish to\r\nverify their measures. Instead of concurring, then, in a measure which,\r\nlike the pendulum, may be found in every point of the forty-fifth\r\ndegree, and through both hemispheres, and consequently in all the\r\ncountries of the earth lying under that parallel, either northern or\r\nsouthern, they adopt one which can be found but in a single point of\r\nthe northern parallel, and consequently only in one country, and that\r\ncountry is theirs.\r\n\r\nI left with you a statement of the case of Schweighaeuser and Dobree,\r\nwith the original vouchers on which it depends. From these you will have\r\nknown, that being authorized by Congress to settle this matter, I began\r\nby offering to them an arbitration before honest and judicious men of\r\na neutral nation. They declined this, and had the modesty to propose\r\nan arbitration before merchants of their own town. I gave them warning\r\nthen, that as the offer on the part of a sovereign nation to submit to\r\na private arbitration was an unusual condescendence, if they did not\r\naccept it then, it would not be repeated, and that the United States\r\nwould judge the case for themselves hereafter. They continued to decline\r\nit, and the case now stands thus. The territorial judge of France\r\nhas undertaken to call the United States to his jurisdiction, and has\r\narrested their property, in order to enforce appearance, and possess\r\nhimself of a matter whereon to found a decree; but no court can have\r\njurisdiction over a sovereign nation. This position was agreed to;\r\nbut it was urged, that some act of Mr. Barclay’s had admitted the\r\njurisdiction. It was denied that there had been any such act by Mr.\r\nBarclay, and disavowed, if there was one, as without authority from the\r\nUnited States, the property on which the arrest was made having been\r\npurchased by Dr. Franklin, and remaining in his possession till taken\r\nout of it by the arrest. On this disavowal, it was agreed that there\r\ncould be no further contest, and I received assurance that the property\r\nshould be withdrawn from the possession of the court by an evocation\r\nof the cause before the King’s Council, on which, without other\r\nproceedings, it should be delivered to the United States. Applications\r\nwere repeated as often as dignity, or even decency, would permit; but\r\nit was never done. Thus the matter rests, and thus it is meant it should\r\nrest. No answer of any kind is to be given to Schweighaeuser and Dobree.\r\nIf they think proper to apply to their sovereign, I presume there will\r\nbe a communication either through you or their representative here, and\r\nwe shall have no difficulty to show the character of the treatment we\r\nhave experienced.\r\n\r\nI will observe for your information, that the sustenance of our captives\r\nat Algiers is committed to Colonel Humphreys.\r\n\r\nYou will be so kind as to remember, that your public account from the\r\n1st day of July, 1790, to the last of June, 1791, inclusive, is desired\r\nbefore the meeting of congress, that I may be able to lay before them\r\nthe general account of the foreign fund for that year.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott has returned from a successful expedition against the\r\nnorthern Indians, having killed thirty-two warriors, taken fifty-eight\r\nwomen and children prisoners, and destroyed three towns and villages,\r\nwith a great deal of corn in grain and growth. A similar expedition was\r\nto follow immediately, while preparation is making for measures of more\r\npermanent effect; so that we may reasonably hope the Indians will be\r\ninduced to accept of peace, which is all we desire.\r\n\r\nOur funds have risen nearly to par. The eight millions for the bank was\r\nsubscribed as fast as it could be written, and that stock is now above\r\npar. Our crops of wheat have been rather abundant, and of excellent\r\nquality. Those of tobacco are not very promising as yet. The census\r\nis not yet completed, but, from what we hear, we may expect our whole\r\nnumbers will be nearer four than three millions. I enclose a sketch of\r\nthe numbers as far as we yet know them.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your sincere friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXX.--TO THE PRESIDENT, July 30,1791\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 30,1791.\r\n\r\nSir, I have the honor to enclose, for your perusal, a letter which I\r\nhave prepared for Mr. Short.\r\n\r\nThe ill humor into which the French colonies are getting, and the little\r\ndependence on the troops sent thither, may produce a hesitation in\r\nthe National Assembly as to the conditions they will impose in their\r\nconstitution. In a moment of hesitation, small matters may influence\r\ntheir decision. They may see the impolicy of insisting on particular\r\nconditions, which, operating as grievances on us as well as on their\r\ncolonists, might produce a concert of action. I have thought it would\r\nnot be amiss to trust to Mr. Short the sentiments in the ciphered part\r\nof the letter, leaving him to govern himself by circumstances, whether\r\nto let them leak out at all or not, and whether so as that it may be\r\nknown or remain unknown that they come from us. A perfect knowledge of\r\nhis judgment and discretion leaves me entirely satisfied, that they will\r\nbe not used, or so used as events shall render proper. But if you think\r\nthat the possibility that harm may be done, overweighs the chance of\r\ngood, I would expunge them, as, in cases of doubt, it is better to say\r\ntoo little than too much.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXI.--TO GENERAL KNOX, August 10, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KNOX.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 10, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have now the honor to return you the petition of Mr. Moultrie on\r\nbehalf of the South Carolina Yazoo company. Without noticing that some\r\nof the highest functions of sovereignty are assumed in the very papers\r\nwhich he annexes as his justification, I am of opinion that government\r\nshould firmly maintain this ground; that the Indians have a right to\r\nthe occupation of their lands, independent of the States within whose\r\nchartered lines they happen to be; that until they cede them by treaty\r\nor other transaction equivalent to a treaty, no act of a State can give\r\na right to such lands; that neither under the present constitution, nor\r\nthe ancient confederation, had any State or person a right to treat with\r\nthe Indians, without the consent of the General Government; that that\r\nconsent has never been given to any treaty for the cession of the lands\r\nin question; that the government is determined to exert all its energy\r\nfor the patronage and protection of the rights of the Indians, and the\r\npreservation of peace between the United States and them and that if any\r\nsettlements are made on lands not ceded by them, without the previous\r\nconsent of the United States, the government will think itself bound,\r\nnot only to declare to the Indians that such settlements are without the\r\nauthority or protection of the United States, but to remove them also by\r\nthe public force.\r\n\r\nIt is in compliance with your request, my dear Sir, that I submit these\r\nideas to you, to whom it belongs to give place to them, or such others\r\nas your better judgment shall prefer, in answer to Mr. Moultrie.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most sincere and\r\nrespectful esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXII.--TO THE MINISTER OF FRANCE, August 12, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has the honor to inform the Minister of France,\r\nthat the President will receive his letters of credence today, at half\r\nafter two; that this will be done in a room of private audience, without\r\nany ceremony whatever, or other person present than the Secretary of\r\nState, this being the usage which will be observed.\r\n\r\nAs the Secretary of State will be with the President before that hour on\r\nbusiness, the Minister will find him there.\r\n\r\nAugust 12,1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIII.--TO SYLVANUS BOURNE, August 14,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SYLVANUS BOURNE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 14,1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy letter of May the 13th acknowledged the receipt of yours of November\r\nthe 30th. Since writing that, I have received yours of April the 29th\r\nand June the 30th, addressed to myself, and of July the 14th, to Mr.\r\nRemsen. As none of these acknowledge mine of May the 13th, I now enclose\r\nyou a duplicate of it, fearing the first has miscarried. In this,\r\nyou will find the sentiments of our government on the subject of your\r\nrecognition. Subsequent circumstances have rendered it an object still\r\nless proper to be pressed. In the present divisions of that country, we\r\nwish to avoid every measure which may excite the jealousy of any party,\r\nbeing sincerely the friends and well-wishers of all. As to my writing to\r\nthe Governor, as pressed in your letter of April the 29th, it would be\r\ncontrary to the usage established among nations, and therefore cannot be\r\ndone. We have received Consuls from France, England, Portugal, Sweden,\r\nwith no other credential but their open commissions; we have sent\r\nConsuls to most of the countries of Europe with nothing more. There has\r\nnever been an instance of a special letter demanded.\r\n\r\nThough we have not received an authenticated copy of the decree of the\r\nNational Assembly of France, extending the repeal of the law of _Droit\r\nd’Aubaine_, by name, to their colonies, yet we know it has been so\r\nextended, and doubt not that a notification thereof has been sent to the\r\ncolonies, so as to relieve us from that oppression.\r\n\r\nAs Congress have not, as yet, allowed any emoluments to the Consuls of\r\nthe United States, and perhaps may not mean to do it, we do not expect\r\nthat any of those gentlemen will think themselves confined to their\r\nresidence a moment beyond their own convenience. These appointments\r\nare given to gentlemen who are satisfied to perform their duties, in\r\nconsideration of the respect and accidental advantages they may\r\nderive from them. When the consideration ceases to be sufficient, the\r\ngovernment cannot insist on a continuation of services, because this\r\nwould found claims which it does not mean to authorize. On these\r\nprinciples, Mr. Skipwith has lately returned from Martinique; on the\r\nsame, it is my duty to say, that however satisfied we should be with a\r\ncontinuance of your services at St. Domingo, we cannot and do not ask\r\nthem longer than convenient to yourself.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great regard, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIV.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, August 29, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 29, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 67, June the 6th, No. 68,\r\nJune the 10th, No. 69, June the 22nd, No. 70, June the 26th, No. 71,\r\nJune the 29th; the three last by the British packet. My last to you\r\nwas of July the 28th, by a vessel bound to Havre. This goes to the same\r\nport, because accompanied by newspapers. It will be the last I shall\r\nwrite you these two months, as I am to set out for Virginia the next\r\nweek. I now enclose you a copy of my letter of March the 12th, to Mr.\r\nCarmichael, which you say was not in that of the same date to you.\r\nThere was no paper to accompany it but St. Marie’s, which you say you\r\nreceived. I enclose you also a copy of our census, written in black ink,\r\nso far as we have actual returns, and supplied by conjecture in red ink,\r\nwhere we have no returns: but the conjectures are known to be very near\r\nthe truth. Making very small allowance for omissions, which we know to\r\nhave been very great, we are certainly above four millions, probably\r\nabout four millions one hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nThere is a vessel now lying at Philadelphia, advertising to receive\r\nemigrants to Louisiana, gratis, on account of the Spanish government. Be\r\nso good as to mention this to M. de Montmorin, who will be a judge what\r\nwe must feel under so impudent a transaction.\r\n\r\nYou observe, that if Drost does not come, you have not been authorized\r\nto engage another coiner. If he does not come, there will probably be\r\none engaged here. If he comes, I should think him a safe hand to send\r\nthe diplomatic die by, as also all the dies of our medal, which may be\r\nused here for striking off what shall be wanting hereafter. But I would\r\nnot have them trusted at sea, but from April to October inclusive.\r\nShould you not send them by Drost, Havre will be the best route. I have\r\nnot spoken with the Secretary of the Treasury yet, on the subject of the\r\npresses, but believe you may safely consider two presses as sufficient\r\nfor us, and agree for no more without a further request.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the National Assembly, relative to tobacco carried in\r\nFrench or American ships, is likely to have such an effect in our ports,\r\nas to render it impossible to conjecture what may or may not be done.\r\nIt is impossible to let it go on without a vigorous correction. If that\r\nshould be administered on our part, it will produce irritation on both\r\nsides, and lessen that disposition which we feel cordially to concur in\r\na treaty, which shall melt the two nations as to commercial matters into\r\none, as nearly as possible. It is extremely desirable, that the National\r\nAssembly should themselves correct the decree, by a repeal founded on\r\nthe expectation of an arrangement.\r\n\r\nWe have, as yet, no news of the event of our second expedition against\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXV.--TO M. LA MOTTE, August 30, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LA MOTTE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 30, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of February the 9th,\r\nMarch the 25th, and April the 24th; as also of the several packages of\r\nwine, carriages, &c. which came safe to hand, and for your care of which\r\nbe pleased to accept my thanks.\r\n\r\nI am sensible of the difficulties to which our Consuls are exposed by\r\nthe applications of sailors, calling themselves Americans. Though the\r\ndifference of dialect between the Irish and Scotch, and the Americans,\r\nis sensible to the ear of a native, it is not to that of a foreigner,\r\nhowever well he understands the language; and between the American and\r\nEnglish (unless of particular provinces) there is no difference sensible\r\neven to a native. Among hundreds of applications to me, at Paris,\r\nnine-tenths were Irish, whom I readily discovered. The residue, I think,\r\nwere English: and I believe not a single instance of a Scotchman or\r\nAmerican. The sobriety and order of the two last, preserve them from\r\nwant. You will find it necessary, therefore, to be extremely on your\r\nguard against these applications. The bill of expenses for Huls is\r\nmuch beyond those aids which I should think myself authorized to have\r\nadvanced habitually, until the law shall make express provision for that\r\npurpose. I must, therefore, recommend to you, to hazard only small sums\r\nin future, until our legislature shall lay down more precise rules for\r\nmy government.\r\n\r\nThe difference of duty on tobacco carried to France in French and\r\nAmerican bottoms, has excited great uneasiness. We presume the National\r\nAssembly must have been hurried into the measure, without being allowed\r\ntime to reflect on its consequences. A moment’s consideration must\r\nconvince any body, that no nation upon earth ever submitted to so\r\nenormous an assault on the transportation of their own produce.\r\nRetaliation, to be equal, will have the air of extreme severity and\r\nhostility. Such would be an additional tonnage of twelve livres ten sous\r\nthe ton burthen, on all French ships entering Our ports. Yet this would\r\nbut exactly balance an additional duty of six livres five sous the\r\nhogshead of tobacco, brought in American ships entering in the ports\r\nof France. I hope, either that the National Assembly will repeal the\r\nmeasure, or the proposed treaty be so hastened, as to get this matter\r\nout of the way before it shall be necessary for the ensuing legislature\r\nto act on it. Their measure, and our retaliation on it, which is\r\nunavoidable, will very illy prepare the minds of both parties for\r\na liberal treaty. My confidence in the friendly dispositions of the\r\nNational Assembly, and in the sincerity of what they have expressed on\r\nthe subject, induce me to impute, it to surprise altogether, and to hope\r\nit will be repealed before time shall be given to take it up here.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVI.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, August 30, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 30, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy letter of July the 26th covered my first of exchange for a thousand\r\ndollars, and though that went by so sure an opportunity as to leave\r\nlittle doubt of its receipt, yet, for greater security, I enclose a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity of our country leaves us nothing to relate, which may\r\ninterest a mind surrounded by such buoyant scenes as yours. No matter; I\r\nwill still tell you the charming though homespun news, that our crops of\r\nwheat have been abundant and of superior quality; that very great though\r\npartial drought has destroyed the crops of hay to the north, and corn\r\nto the south; that the late rains may recover the tobacco to a middling\r\ncrop, and that the fields of rice are promising.\r\n\r\nI informed you in my last, of the success of our first expedition\r\nagainst the Indians. A second has gone against them, the result of which\r\nis not yet known. Our public credit is good, but the abundance of paper\r\nhas produced a spirit of gambling in the funds, which has laid up our\r\nships at the wharves, as too slow instruments of profit, and has even\r\ndisarmed the hand of the tailor of his needle and thimble. They say the\r\nevil will cure itself. I wish it may; but I have rarely seen a gamester\r\ncured, even by the disasters of his vocation. Some new indications of\r\nthe ideas with which the British cabinet are coming into treaty, confirm\r\nyour opinions, which I knew to be right, but the Anglomany of some would\r\nnot permit them to accede to.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir. Your affectionate, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVII.--TO MONSIEUR DE TERNANT, September 1, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE TERNANT, _Minister Plenipotentiary of France_.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 1, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have communicated to the President what passed between us the other\r\nday, on the subject of the payments made to France by the United States\r\nin the _assignats_ of that country, since they have lost their par with\r\ngold and silver; and after conferences, by his instruction, with the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, I am authorized to assure you, that the\r\ngovernment of the United States have no idea of paying their debt in a\r\ndepreciated medium, and that in the final liquidation of the payments\r\nwhich shall have bean made, due regard will be had to an equitable\r\nallowance for the circumstance of depreciation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVIII.--TO T. NEWTON, September 8, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. NEWTON.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown, September 8, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI was in the moment of my departure from Philadelphia, for Virginia,\r\nwhen I received your favor, inquiring how far the law of nations is to\r\ngovern in proceedings respecting foreign consuls.\r\n\r\nThe law of nations does not of itself extend to consuls at all. They\r\nare not of the diplomatic class of characters, to which alone that law\r\nextends of right. Convention, indeed, may give it to them, and sometimes\r\nhas done so; but in that case, the convention can be produced. In ours\r\nwith France, it is expressly declared that consuls shall not have the\r\nprivileges of that law, and we have no convention with any other nation.\r\n\r\nCongress have had before them a bill on the subject of consuls, but have\r\nnot as yet passed it. Their code then furnishes no law to govern these\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nConsequently, they are to be decided by the State laws alone. Some of\r\nthese, I know, have given certain privileges to consuls; and I think\r\nthose of Virginia did at one time. Of the extent and continuance of\r\nthose laws, you are a better judge than I am.\r\n\r\nIndependently of law, consuls are to be considered as distinguished\r\nforeigners, dignified by a commission from their sovereign, and\r\nspecially recommended by him to the respect of the nation with whom they\r\nreside. They are subject to the laws of the land, indeed, precisely as\r\nother foreigners are, a convention, where there is one, making a part of\r\nthe laws of the land; but if at any time, their conduct should render\r\nit necessary to assert the authority of the laws over them, the rigor of\r\nthose laws should be tempered by our respect for their sovereign, as far\r\nas the case will admit. This moderate and respectful treatment towards\r\nforeign-consuls, it is my duty to recommend and press on our citizens,\r\nbecause I ask it for their good towards our own consuls, from the people\r\nwith whom they reside.\r\n\r\nIn what I have said, I beg leave to be understood as laying down general\r\nprinciples only, and not as applying them to the facts which may have\r\narisen. Before such application, those facts should be heard from all\r\nwhom they interest. You, who have so heard them, will be able to make\r\nthe application yourself, and that, not only in the present, but in\r\nfuture cases.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, your most obedient, humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIX.--TO MR. HAMMOND, October 26,1791\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson has the honor of presenting his compliments to Mr.\r\nHammond, of expressing his regrets that he happened to be from home when\r\nMr. Hammond did him the honor of calling on him, and was equally unlucky\r\nin not finding him at home when he waited on him on Monday. Being\r\ninformed by Mr. Bond, that Mr. Hammond is charged with a public mission\r\nto the government of the United States, relative to which some previous\r\nexplanations might be proper, Mr. Jefferson has the honor to assure Mr.\r\nHammond, he shall be ready to receive any communications and enter\r\ninto explanations, either formally or informally, as Mr. Hammond shall\r\nchoose, and at any time suitable to him. He recollects with pleasure\r\nhis acquaintance with Mr. Hammond in Paris, and shall be happy in every\r\nopportunity of rendering him such offices and attentions as may be\r\nacceptable to him.\r\n\r\nOctober 26,1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXX.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, November 6, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 6, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was of the 24th of August. A gentleman going from\r\nhence to Cadiz will be the bearer of this, and of the newspapers to the\r\npresent date, and will take care that the letter be got safe to you, if\r\nthe papers cannot.\r\n\r\nMr. Mangnal, at length tired out with his useless solicitations at this\r\noffice, to obtain redress from the court of Spain for the loss of the\r\nDover Cutter, has laid the matter before Congress, and the Senate have\r\ndesired me to report thereon to them. I am very sorry to know nothing\r\nmore of the subject, than that letter after letter has been written to\r\nyou thereon, and that the office is in possession of nothing more than\r\nacknowledgments of your receipt of some of them, so long ago as August,\r\n1786, and still to add, that your letter of January the 24th, 1791,\r\nis the only one received of later date than May the 6th, 1789. You\r\ncertainly will not wonder, if the receipt of but one letter in two years\r\nand an half inspires a considerable degree of impatience. I have learned\r\nthrough a circuitous channel, that the court of Madrid is at length\r\ndisposed to yield our right of navigating the Mississippi. I sincerely\r\nwish it may be the case, and that this act of justice may be made known,\r\nbefore the delay of it produces any thing intemperate from our western\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nCongress is now in session. You will see, in the paper herewith sent,\r\nthe several weighty matters laid before them in the President’s speech.\r\nThe session will probably continue through the winter. I shall sincerely\r\nrejoice to receive from you, not only a satisfactory explanation of the\r\nreasons why we receive no letters, but grounds to hope that it will be\r\notherwise in future.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXI.--TO THE PRESIDENT, November 6, 1791\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nNovember 6, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you the draught of a letter to Governor\r\nPinckney, and to observe, that I suppose it to be proper that there\r\nshould, on fit occasions, be a direct correspondence between the\r\nPresident of the United States and the Governors of the States; and\r\nthat it will probably be grateful to them to receive from the President,\r\nanswers to the letters they address to him. The correspondence with them\r\non ordinary business may still be kept up by the Secretary of State, in\r\nhis own name.\r\n\r\nI enclose also a letter to Major Pinckney, with a blank to be filled up,\r\nwhen you shall have made up your mind on it. I have conferred with Mr.\r\nM. on the idea of the commissioners of the federal town proceeding to\r\nmake private sales of the lots, and he thinks it advisable. I cannot but\r\nrepeat, that if the surveyors will begin on the river, laying off the\r\nlots from Rock Creek to the Eastern Branch, and go on, abreast in that\r\nway, from the river towards the back part of the town, they may pass the\r\navenue from the President’s house to the Capitol, before the spring;\r\nand as soon as they shall have passed it, a public sale may take place,\r\nwithout injustice to either the Georgetown or Carrolsburg interest.\r\nWill not the present afford you a proper occasion of assuring the\r\ncommissioners, that you leave every thing respecting L’Enfant to them?\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXII.--TO MAJOR THOMAS PINCKNEY, November 6, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR THOMAS PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 6, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe mission of a Minister Plenipotentiary to the court of London being\r\nnow to take place, the President of the United States is desirous\r\nof availing the public of your services in that office. I have it in\r\ncharge, therefore, from him, to ask whether it will be agreeable that he\r\nshould nominate you for that purpose to the Senate. We know that higher\r\nmotives will alone influence your mind in the acceptance of this charge.\r\nYet it is proper, at the same time, to inform you, that as a provision\r\nfor your expenses in the exercise of it, an outfit of nine thousand\r\ndollars is allowed, and an annual salary to the same amount, payable\r\nquarterly. On receiving your permission, the necessary orders for these\r\nsums, together with your credentials, shall be forwarded to you, and it\r\nwould be expected that you should proceed on the mission as soon as you\r\ncan have made those arrangements for your private affairs, which such\r\nan absence may render indispensable. Let me only ask the favor of you to\r\ngive me an immediate answer, and by duplicate, by sea and post, that\r\nwe may have the benefit of both chances for receiving it as early as\r\npossible. Though I have not the honor of a personal acquaintance with\r\nyou, yet I beg you to be assured, that I feel all that anxiety for your\r\nentrance on this important mission, which a thorough conviction of your\r\nfitness for it can inspire; and that in its relations with my office, I\r\nshall always endeavor to render it as agreeable to you as possible.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and\r\nesteem, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIII.--TO THE PRESIDENT, November 7, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 7, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly considered the letter you were pleased to refer to me, of\r\nthe 18th of August, from his Excellency Governor Pinckney to yourself,\r\ntogether with the draught of one proposed to be written by him to the\r\nGovernor of Florida, claiming the re-delivery of certain fugitives from\r\njustice, who have been received in that country. The inconveniences of\r\nsuch a receptacle for debtors and malefactors in the neighborhood of the\r\nsouthern States, are obvious and great, and I wish the remedy were as\r\ncertain and short as the latter seems to suppose.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of fugitives from one country to another, as practised by\r\nseveral nations, is in consequence of conventions settled between them,\r\ndefining precisely the cases wherein such deliveries shall take place.\r\nI know that such conventions exist between France and Spain, France and\r\nSardinia, France and Germany, France and the United Netherlands; between\r\nthe several sovereigns constituting the Germanic body, and, I believe,\r\nvery generally between co-terminous States on the continent of Europe.\r\nEngland has no such convention with any nation, and their laws have\r\ngiven no power to their executive to surrender fugitives of any\r\ndescription; they are, accordingly, constantly refused, and hence\r\nEngland has been the asylum of the Paolis, the La Mottes, the Calonnes,\r\nin short, of the most atrocious offenders as well as the most innocent\r\nvictims, who have been able to get there.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the United States, like those of England, receive every\r\nfugitive, and no authority has been given to our executives to deliver\r\nthem up. In the case of Longchamp, a subject of France, a formal demand\r\nwas made by the minister of France, and was refused. He had, indeed,\r\ncommitted an offence within the United States; but he was not demanded\r\nas a criminal, but as a subject.\r\n\r\nThe French government has shown great anxiety to have such a convention\r\nwith the United States, as might authorize them to demand their subjects\r\ncoming here: they got a clause in the consular convention signed by Dr.\r\nFranklin and the Count de Vergennes, giving their Consuls a right\r\nto take and send back captains of vessels, mariners, and passengers.\r\nCongress saw the extent of the word passengers, and refused to ratify\r\nthe convention; a new one was therefore formed, omitting that word.\r\nIn fact, however desirable it be that the perpetrators of crimes,\r\nacknowledged to be such by all mankind, should be delivered up to\r\npunishment, yet it is extremely difficult to draw the line between\r\nthose, and acts rendered criminal by tyrannical laws only; hence the\r\nfirst step always is a convention defining the cases where a surrender\r\nshall take place.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the United States could not deliver up to Governor Quesada,\r\na fugitive from the laws of his country, we cannot claim as a right the\r\ndelivery of fugitives from us; and it is worthy consideration, whether\r\nthe demand proposed to be made in Governor Pickney’s letter, should it\r\nbe complied with by the other party, might not commit us disagreeably,\r\nperhaps dishonorably, in event; for I do not think we can take for\r\ngranted, that the legislature of the United States will establish\r\na convention for the mutual delivery of fugitives; and without a\r\nreasonable certainty that they will, I think we ought not to give\r\nGovernor Quesada any grounds to expect that in a similar case, we would\r\nre-deliver fugitives from his government.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most profound respect and attachment,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIV.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, November 24, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 24, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of August the 29th, acknowledging the receipt of your\r\nNos. 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, and informing you I was about setting out to\r\nVirginia, and should not again write to you till my return. Only one\r\nvessel has sailed from hence to Havre since my return, and my notice of\r\nher departure was so short, that I could not avail myself of it. Your\r\nNos. 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, came here during my absence, and 79, 80, were\r\nreceived October the 28th. The Nos. 76 and 77 seem to be missing.\r\n\r\nYou mention that Drost wishes the devices of our money to be sent to\r\nhim, that he may engrave them there. This cannot be done, because\r\nnot yet decided on. The devices will be fixed by the law which shall\r\nestablish the mint. M. de Ternant tells me he has no instructions to\r\npropose to us the negotiation of a commercial treaty, and that he does\r\nnot expect any. I wish it were possible to draw that negotiation to this\r\nplace. In your letter of July the 24th, is the following paragraph. It\r\nis published in the English newspapers, that war is inevitable between\r\nthe United States and Spain, and that preparations are making for it on\r\nboth sides.’ M. de Montmorin asked me how the business stood at present,\r\nand seemed somewhat surprised at my telling him, that I knew nothing\r\nlater than what I had formerly mentioned to him. I have, in more\r\nthan one instance, experienced the inconvenience of being without\r\ninformation. In this, it is disagreeable, as it may have the appearance\r\nwith M. de Montmorin, of my having something to conceal from him, which\r\nnot being the case, it would be wrong that he should be allowed to take\r\nup such an idea. I observed, that I did not suppose there was any new\r\ncircumstance, as you had not informed me of it.’ Your observation was\r\ncertainly just. It would be an Augean task for me to go through the\r\nLondon newspapers, and formally contradict all their lies, even\r\nthose relating to America. On our side, there have been certainly no\r\npreparations for war against Spain; nor have I heard of any on\r\ntheir part, but in the London newspapers. As to the progress of the\r\nnegotiation, I know nothing of it but from you; having never had a\r\nletter from Mr. Carmichael on the subject. Our best newspapers are sent\r\nyou from my office with scrupulous exactness, by every vessel sailing to\r\nHavre or any other convenient port of France. On these I rely for giving\r\nyou information of all the facts possessed by the public; and as\r\nto those not possessed by them, I think there has not been a single\r\ninstance of my leaving you uninformed of any of them which related to\r\nthe matters under your charge. In Freneau’s paper of the 21st instant,\r\nyou will see a small essay on population and emigration, which I think\r\nit would be well if the news-writers of Paris would translate and insert\r\nin their papers. The sentiments are too just not to make impression.\r\n\r\nSome proceedings of the assembly of St. Domingo have lately taken place,\r\nwhich it is necessary for me to state to you exactly, that you may be\r\nable to do the same to M. de Montmorin. When the insurrection of their\r\nnegroes assumed a very threatening appearance, the Assembly sent a\r\ndeputy here to ask assistance of military stores and provisions. He\r\naddressed himself to M. de Ternant, who (the President being then in\r\nVirginia, as I was also) applied to the Secretaries of the Treasury and\r\nWar. They furnished one thousand stand of arms, other military stores,\r\nand placed forty thousand dollars in the treasury, subject to the order\r\nof M. de Ternant, to be laid out in provisions, or otherwise, as he\r\nshould think best. He sent the arms and other military stores; but\r\nthe want of provisions did not seem so instantaneous as to render it\r\nnecessary, in his opinion, to send any at that time. Before the vessel\r\narrived in St. Domingo, the Assembly, further urged by the appearance of\r\ndanger, sent two deputies more, with larger demands; viz. eight thousand\r\nfusils and bayonets, two thousand musquetoons, three thousand pistols,\r\nthree thousand sabres, twenty-four thousand barrels of flour, four\r\nhundred thousand livres’ worth of Indian meal, rice, pease, and hay, and\r\na large quantity of plank, &c. to repair the buildings destroyed. They\r\napplied to M. de Ternant, and then with his consent to me; he and I\r\nhaving previously had a conversation on the subject. They proposed to\r\nme, first, that we should supply those wants from the money we owed\r\nFrance; or secondly, from the bills of exchange which they were\r\nauthorized to draw on a particular fund in France; or thirdly, that we\r\nwould guaranty their bills, in which case they could dispose of them to\r\nmerchants, and buy the necessaries themselves. I convinced them the two\r\nlatter alternatives were beyond the powers of the executive, and the\r\nfirst could only be done with the consent of the minister of France.\r\nIn the course of our conversation, I expressed to them our sincere\r\nattachment to France and all its dominions, and most especially to them\r\nwho were our neighbors, and whose interests had some common points of\r\nunion with ours, in matters of commerce; that we wished, therefore, to\r\nrender them every service they needed, but that we could not do it in\r\nany way disagreeable to France; that they must be sensible, that M.\r\nde Ternant might apprehend that jealousy would be excited by their\r\naddressing themselves directly to foreign powers, and, therefore, that a\r\nconcert with him in their applications to us was essential. The subject\r\nof independence and their views towards it having been stated in the\r\npublic papers, this led our conversation to it; and, I must say, they\r\nappeared as far from these views as any persons on earth. I expressed\r\nto them, freely, my opinion that such an object was neither desirable\r\non their part, nor attainable; that as to ourselves, there was one case\r\nwhich would be peculiarly alarming to us, to wit, were there a danger of\r\ntheir falling under any other power; that we conceived it to be strongly\r\nour interest, that they should retain their connection with the mother\r\ncountry; that we had a common interest with them, in furnishing them\r\nthe necessaries of life in exchange for sugar and coffee for our own\r\nconsumption, but that I thought we might rely on the justice of the\r\nmother country towards them, for their obtaining this privilege: and,\r\non the whole, let them see that nothing was to be done, but with the\r\nconsent of the minister of France.\r\n\r\nI am convinced myself, that their views and their application to us are\r\nperfectly innocent; however, M. de Ternant, and still more, M. de la\r\nForest, are jealous. The deputies, on the other hand, think that M. de\r\nTernant is not sensible enough of their wants. They delivered me\r\nsealed letters to the President and to Congress. That to the President\r\ncontained only a picture of their distresses, and application for\r\nrelief. That to Congress, I know no otherwise than through the public\r\npapers. The Senate read it, and sent it to the Representatives, who read\r\nit, and have taken no other notice of it. The line of conduct I pursue,\r\nis, to persuade these gentlemen to be contented with such moderate\r\nsupplies, from time to time, as will keep them from real distress, and\r\nto wait with patience for what would be a surplus, till M. de Ternant\r\ncan receive instructions from France, which he has reason to expect\r\nwithin a few weeks; and I encourage the latter gentleman even to go\r\nbeyond their absolute wants of the moment, so far as to keep them in\r\ngood humor. He is accordingly proposing to lay out ten thousand dollars\r\nfor them, for the present. It would be ridiculous in the present case,\r\nto talk about forms. There are situations when form must be dispensed\r\nwith. A man attacked by assassins will call for help to those nearest\r\nhim, and will not think himself bound to silence till a magistrate may\r\ncome to his aid. It would be unwise in the highest degree, that the\r\ncolonists should be disgusted with either France or us; for it might\r\nthen be made to depend on the moderation of another power, whether what\r\nappears a chimera may not become a reality. I have thought it necessary\r\nto go thus fully into this transaction, and particularly as to the\r\nsentiments I have expressed to them, that you may be enabled to place\r\nour proceedings in their true light.\r\n\r\nOur Indian expeditions have proved successful. As yet, however, they\r\nhave not led to peace. Mr. Hammond has lately arrived here, as Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary from the court of London, and we propose to name one\r\nto that court in return. Congress will probably establish the ratio\r\nof representation by a bill now before them, at one representative for\r\nevery thirty thousand inhabitants. Besides the newspapers, as usual, you\r\nwill receive herewith the census lately taken, by towns and counties as\r\nwell as by States.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXV.--TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, December 5,1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 5,1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed memorial from the British minister, on the case of Thomas\r\nPagan, containing a complaint of injustice in the dispensations of\r\nlaw by the courts of Massachusetts to a British subject, the President\r\napproves of my referring it to you, to report thereon your opinion of\r\nthe proceedings, and whether any thing, and what, can or ought to be\r\ndone by the government in consequence thereof.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Memorial of the British minister_.]\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, his Britannic Majesty’s Minister Plenipotentiary to the\r\nUnited States of America, has the honor of laying before the Secretary\r\nof State, the following brief abstract of the case of Thomas Pagan, a\r\nsubject of his Britannic Majesty, now confined in the prison of Boston,\r\nunder an execution issued against him out of the Supreme Judicial Court\r\nof Massachusetts Bay. To this abstract, the undersigned has taken the\r\nliberty of annexing some observations, which naturally arise out of the\r\nstatement of the transaction, and which may perhaps tend to throw some\r\nsmall degree of light on the general merits of the case.\r\n\r\nIn the late war, Thomas Pagan was agent for, and part owner of a\r\nprivateer called the Industry, which, on the 25th of March, 1783, off\r\nCape Ann, captured a brigantine called the Thomas, belonging to Mr.\r\nStephen Hooper, of Newburyport. The brigantine and cargo were libelled\r\nin the Court of Vice-Admiralty in Nova Scotia, and that court ordered\r\nthe prize to be restored. An appeal was however moved for by the\r\ncaptors, and regularly prosecuted in England before the Lords of Appeals\r\nfor prize causes, who, in February, 1790, reversed the decree of the\r\nVice-Admiralty Court of Nova Scotia, and condemned the brigantine and\r\ncargo as good and lawful prize.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1788, a judgment was obtained by Stephen Hooper in the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas for the county of Essex, in Massachusetts, against\r\nThomas Pagan for three thousand five hundred pounds lawful money, for\r\nmoney had and received to the plaintiff’s use. An appeal was brought\r\nthereon in May, 1789, to the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth\r\nof Massachusetts, held at Ipswich, for the county of Essex, and on the\r\n16th of June, 1789, a verdict was found for Mr. Hooper, and damages were\r\nassessed at three thousand and nine pounds two shillings and ten pence,\r\nwhich sum is ‘for the vessel called the brigantine Thomas, her cargo,\r\nand every article found on board.’ After this verdict, and before\r\nentering the judgment, Mr. Pagan moved for a new trial, suggesting that\r\nthe verdict was against law; because the merits of the case originated\r\nin a question, whether a certain brigantine called the Thomas, with\r\nher cargo, taken on the high seas by a private ship of war called the\r\nIndustry, was prize or no prize, and that the court had no authority\r\nto give judgment in a cause, where the point of a resulting or implied\r\npromise arose upon a question of this sort. The Supreme Judicial Court\r\nrefused this motion for a new trial, because it appeared to the court,\r\nthat, in order to a legal decision, it is not necessary to inquire\r\nwhether this prize and her cargo were prize or no prize, and because\r\nthe case did not, in their opinion, involve a question relative to any\r\nmatter or thing necessarily consequent upon the capture thereof: it was\r\ntherefore considered by the court, that Hooper should receive of Pagan\r\nthree thousand and nine pounds two shillings and ten pence, lawful\r\nmoney, damages; and taxed costs, sixteen pounds two shillings and\r\nten pence. From this judgment, Pagan claimed an appeal to the Supreme\r\nJudicial Court of the United States of America, for these reasons; that\r\nthe judgment was given in an action brought by Hooper, who is, and at\r\nthe time of commencing the action was, a citizen of the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts, one of the United States, against Pagan, who at the time\r\nwhen the action was commenced, was and ever since has been a subject of\r\nthe King of Great Britain, residing in and inhabiting his province of\r\nNew Brunswick. This claim of an appeal was not allowed, because it was\r\nconsidered by the court, that this court was the Supreme Judicial Court\r\nof the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from whose judgment there is no\r\nappeal; and further, because there does not exist any such court within\r\nthe United States of America, as that to which Pagan has claimed an\r\nappeal from the judgment of this court. Thereupon, execution issued\r\nagainst Pagan on the 9th of October, 1789, and he has been confined in\r\nBoston prison ever since. It is to be observed, that in August, 1789,\r\nMr. Pagan petitioned the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts for a\r\nnew trial, and after hearing the arguments of counsel, a new trial was\r\nrefused. On the 1st of January, 1791, his Britanic Majesty’s Consul at\r\nBoston applied for redress on behalf of Mr. Pagan, to the Governor of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, who, in his letter of the 28th of January, 1791, was\r\npleased to recommend this matter to the serious attention of the Senate\r\nand House of Representatives of that State. On the 14th of February,\r\n1791, the British Consul memorialized the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives on this subject. On the 22nd of February, a committee of\r\nboth Houses reported a resolution, that the memorial of the Consul\r\nand message from the Governor with all the papers, be referred to the\r\nconsideration of the justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, who\r\nwere directed, as far as may be, to examine into and consider the\r\ncircumstances of the case, and if they found that by the force and\r\neffect allowed by the law of nations to foreign admiralty jurisdictions,\r\n&c. Hooper ought not to have recovered judgment against Pagan, the court\r\nwas authorized to grant a review of the action. On the 13th of June,’\r\n1791, the British Consul again represented to the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, that the justices of the Supreme Judicial Court had not\r\nbeen pleased to signify their decision on this subject, referred to\r\nthem by the resolution of the 22nd of February. This representation\r\nwas considered by a committee of the Senate and of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, who concluded that one of them should make inquiry of\r\nsome of the judges to know their determination, and upon being informed\r\nthat the judges intended to give their opinion, with their reasons, in\r\nwriting, the committee would not proceed any further in the business.\r\nOn the 27th of June, 1791, Mr. Pagan’s counsel moved the justices of\r\nthe Supreme Judicial Court for their opinion in the case of Hooper and\r\nPagan, referred to their consideration by the resolve of the General\r\nCourt, founded on the British Consul’s memorial. Chief Justice and\r\nJustice Dana being absent, Justice Paine delivered it as the unanimous\r\nopinion of the judges absent as well as present, that Pagan was not\r\nentitled to a new trial for any of the causes mentioned in the said\r\nresolve, and added, ‘that the court intended to put their opinions upon\r\npaper and to file them in the cause: that the sickness of two of the\r\ncourt had hitherto prevented it, but that it would soon be done.’\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable, that the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\nMassachusetts Bay should allege, that this case did not necessarily\r\ninvolve a question relative to prize or no prize, when the very jury to\r\nwhom the court referred the decision of the case established the fact;\r\ntheir verdict was for three thousand and nine pounds two shillings and\r\nten pence, damages, which sum is for the vessel called the brigantine\r\nThomas, her cargo, and every thing found on board. Hence it is evident,\r\nthat the case did involve a question of prize or no prize, and\r\nhaving received a formal decision by the only court competent to take\r\ncognizance thereof (viz. the High Court of Appeals for prize causes in\r\nEngland), every thing that at all related to the property in question\r\nor to the legality of the capture, was thereby finally determined. The\r\nlegality of the capture being confirmed by the High Court of Appeals in\r\nEngland, cannot consistently with the principles of the law of nations\r\nbe discussed in a foreign court of law; or at least, if a foreign\r\ncourt of common law is, by any local regulations, deemed competent to\r\ninterfere in matters relating to captures, the decisions of admiralty\r\ncourts or courts of appeal, should be received and taken as conclusive\r\nevidence of the legality or illegality of captures. By such decisions,\r\nproperty is either adjudged to the captors or restored to the owners;\r\nif adjudged to the captors, they obtain a permanent property in the\r\ncaptured goods acquired by the rights of war; and this principle\r\noriginates in the wisdom of nations, and is calculated to prevent\r\nendless litigation.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts Bay are\r\nin direct violation of the rules and usages that have been universally\r\npractised among nations in the determination of the validity of\r\ncaptures, and of all collateral questions that may have reference\r\nthereto. The General Court of Massachusetts Bay, among other things,\r\nkept this point in view, when they referred the case of Mr. Pagan to\r\nthe consideration of the justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, and\r\nauthorized the court to grant a review of the action, if it should be\r\nfound that by the force and effect allowed by the law of nations to\r\nforeign admiralty jurisdictions, Mr. Hooper ought not to have recovered\r\njudgment against Mr. Pagan. But the Supreme Judicial Court have not\r\nonly evaded this material consideration, upon which the whole question\r\nincontestably turns, but have assumed a fact in direct contradiction to\r\nthe truth of the case, viz. that the case did not involve a question of\r\nprize or no prize. Moreover, they have denied Mr. Pagan the benefit\r\nof appeal to that court which is competent to decide on the force of\r\ntreaties, and which court, by the constitution of the United States, is\r\ndeclared to possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact,\r\nin all cases of controversy between citizens of the United States and\r\nsubjects of foreign countries, to which class this case is peculiarly\r\nand strictly to be referred.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing abstract of the case of Thomas Pagan, it appears that\r\nhe is now detained in prison, in Boston, in consequence of a judgment\r\ngiven by a court which is not competent to decide upon his case, or\r\nwhich, if competent, refused to admit the only evidence that ought to\r\nhave given jurisdiction, and that he is denied the means of appealing to\r\nthe highest court of judicature known in these States, which exists in\r\nthe very organization of the constitution of the United States, and\r\nis declared to possess appellate jurisdiction in all cases of a nature\r\nsimilar to this.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the undersigned begs leave respectfully to submit\r\nthe whole matter to the consideration of the Secretary of State, and to\r\nrequest him to take such measures as may appear to him the best adapted\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining for the said Thomas Pagan, such speedy and\r\neffectual redress as his case may seem to require.\r\n\r\nGeorge Hammond,\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 26,1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVI.--TO MR. HAMMOND, December 5, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND, _Minister Plenipotentiary of Great Britain_,\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 5, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of November the 30th remains still unanswered, because the\r\nclerks are employed in copying some documents on the subject of the\r\ntreaty of peace, which I wish to exhibit to you with the answer.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, as to that part of your letter which respects matters\r\nof commerce, the fear of misunderstanding it induces me to mention my\r\nsense of it, and to ask if it be right. Where you are pleased to say,\r\nthat ‘you are authorized to communicate to this government his Majesty’s\r\nreadiness to enter into a negotiation for establishing that intercourse\r\n(of commerce) upon principles of reciprocal benefit,’ I understand that\r\nyou are not furnished with any commission or express powers to arrange\r\na treaty with us, or to make any specific propositions on the subject of\r\ncommerce; but only to assure us that his Britannic Majesty is ready to\r\nconcur with us, in appointing persons, times, and places for commencing\r\nsuch a negotiation. Be so good as to inform me if there be any\r\nmisapprehension in this, as some steps on our part may be necessary in\r\nconsequence of it.\r\n\r\n1 have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVII.--TO MR. HAMMOND, December 12, 1791\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 12, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of enclosing you an extract of a letter from a\r\nrespectable character, giving information of a Mr. Bowles, lately come\r\nfrom England into the Creek country, endeavoring to excite that nation\r\nof Indians to war against the United States, and pretending to be\r\nemployed by the government of England. We have other testimony of these\r\nhis pretensions, and that he carries them much farther than is here\r\nstated. We have too much confidence in the justice and wisdom of the\r\nBritish government, to believe they can approve of the proceedings of\r\nthis incendiary and impostor, or countenance for a moment a person who\r\ntakes the liberty of using their name for such a purpose; and I make the\r\ncommunication, merely that you may take that notice of the case which in\r\nyour opinion shall be proper.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVIII.--TO MR. HAMMOND, December 13, 1791\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 13, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have laid before the President of the United States the letters of\r\nNovember the 30th and December the 6th, with which you honored me, and\r\nin consequence thereof and particularly of that part of your letter of\r\nDecember the 6th, where you say that you are fully authorized to\r\nenter into a negotiation for the purpose of arranging the commercial\r\nintercourse between the two countries, I have the honor to inform you,\r\nthat I am ready to receive a communication of your full powers for that\r\npurpose, at any time you shall think proper, and to proceed immediately\r\nto their object.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect. Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIX.--TO THE PRESIDENT, December 23, 1791\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 23, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAs the conditions of our commerce with the French and British dominions\r\nare important, and a moment seems to be approaching when it may be\r\nuseful that both should be accurately understood, I have thrown a\r\nrepresentation of them into the form of a table, showing at one view how\r\nthe principal articles, interesting to our agriculture and navigation,\r\nstand in the European and American dominions of these two powers. As to\r\nso much of it as respects France, I have cited under every article the\r\nlaw on which it depends; which laws, from 1784 downwards, are in my\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nPort-charges are so different, according to the size of the vessel and\r\nthe dexterity of the captain, that an examination of a greater number of\r\nport-bills might, perhaps, produce a different result. I can only say,\r\nthat that expressed in the table is fairly drawn from such bills as I\r\ncould readily get access to, and that I have no reason to suppose it\r\nvaries much from the truth, nor on which side the variation would\r\nlie. Still, I cannot make myself responsible for this article. The\r\nauthorities cited will vouch the rest.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Footing of the Commerce of the United States with France and England,\r\nand with the French and English American Colonies._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page143]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page144]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XC.--TO THE PRESIDENT, January 4, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 4, 1792,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHaving been in conversation to-day with Monsieur Payan, one of the St.\r\nDomingo deputies, I took occasion to inquire of him the footing on\r\nwhich our commerce there stands at present, and particularly whether\r\nthe colonial _Arrêt_ of 1789, permitting a free importation of our\r\nflour till 1793, was still in force. He answered, that that _Arrêt_ was\r\nrevoked in France on the clamors of the merchants there; and with a like\r\npermission to carry flour to the three usual ports, and he thinks to\r\nbring away coffee and sugar, was immediately renewed by the Governor.\r\nWhether this has been regularly kept up by renewed _Arrêts_, during\r\nthe present trouble, he cannot say, but is sure that in practice it\r\nhas never been discontinued, and that not by contraband, but openly and\r\nlegally, as is understood. The public application to us to send flour\r\nthere, is a proof of it. Instead, therefore, of resting this permission\r\non a colonial _Arrêt_ till 1793, it should be rested on temporary\r\n_Arrêts_ renewed from time to time, as heretofore. This correction\r\nof the notes I took the liberty of laying before you with the table\r\ncontaining a comparative view of our commerce with France and England, I\r\nthought it my duty to make.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCI.--TO THOMAS PINCKNEY, January 17, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 17, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of November the 29th, 30th, and December the 1st, came duly\r\nto hand, and gave sincere pleasure, by announcing your disposition to\r\naccept the appointment to London. The nominations to Paris and the Hague\r\nhaving been detained till yours could be made, they were all immediately\r\nsent in to the Senate, to wit, yourself for London, Mr. G. Morris for\r\nParis, Mr. Short for the Hague. Some members of the Senate, apprehending\r\nthey had a right of determining on the expediency of foreign missions,\r\nas well as on the persons named, took that occasion of bringing forward\r\nthe discussion of that question, by which the nominations were delayed\r\ntwo or three weeks. I am happy to be able to assure you, that not\r\na single personal motive with respect to yourself entered into the\r\nobjections to these appointments. On the contrary, I believe that\r\nyour nomination gave general satisfaction. Your commission will be\r\nimmediately made out, but as the opportunities of conveyance at this\r\nseason are precarious, and you propose coming to this place, I think it\r\nbetter to retain it.\r\n\r\nAs to the delay proposed in your letter, it was to be expected: indeed a\r\nwinter passage from Charleston to this place, or across the Atlantic, is\r\nso disagreeable, that if either that circumstance or the arrangement of\r\nyour affairs should render it in the smallest degree eligible to you to\r\nremain at home till the temperate season comes on, stay till after the\r\nvernal equinox; there will be no inconvenience to the public attending\r\nit. On the contrary, as we are just opening certain negotiations with\r\nthe British minister here, which have not yet assumed any determinate\r\ncomplexion, a delay till that time will enable us to form some judgment\r\nof the issue they may take, and to know exactly in what way your\r\nco-operation at the place of your destination may aid us. On this and\r\nother accounts it will be highly useful that you take this place in\r\nyour way, where, or at New York, you will always be sure of finding a\r\nconvenient, passage to England.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCII.--TO WILLINKS, VAN STAPHORSTS, AND HUBARD, Jan. 23,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. WILLINKS, VAN STAPHORSTS, AND HUBARD.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 23,1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of March last, I had the honor to enclose you a bill for\r\nninety-nine thousand florins, drawn on yourselves by the Treasurer of\r\nthe United States, in favor of the Secretary of State, and I desired you\r\nto raise an account with the Secretary of State, and pass that bill to\r\nhis credit in the account. In my letter of May the 14th, I enclosed\r\nyou a duplicate of the same bill, and informed you that this money was\r\ndestined to pay the salaries and contingent expenses of our ministers\r\nand agents of every description, from July the 1st, 1790, and nothing\r\nelse; and I added these words; ‘I must beg the favor of you, also, to\r\nmake up your account to the close of the last day of June this present\r\nyear, into which no expenses are to enter which preceded, the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1790, these being the dates of the appropriation of the law.’ And\r\nlastly, in my letter of August the 5th, I enclosed a triplicate of the\r\nsame bill, and added, ‘In the mean time, I hope that your account of\r\nthis fund, from July the 1st, 1790, to June the 30th, 1791, inclusive,\r\nis on its way to me, that I may receive it in time to lay before\r\nCongress at their meeting:’ but in fact, I have neither received the\r\naccount so much desired, nor even an acknowledgment of the receipt of\r\nany of the said letters or bills; and though Congress have been now\r\nsitting upwards of three months, I have it not in my power to lay before\r\nthem a statement of the administration of this fund. When you consider\r\nthe delicate situation of those entrusted with the disposal of public\r\nmonies, and the express injunction under which I am laid by my office to\r\nsubmit this account to a proper and timely examination, I leave you to\r\nconceive what my sensations must be under the disability to do it, which\r\nthe want of your account alone has brought,on me; and I hope I shall\r\nsoon be relieved by the receipt of it.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Gentlemen, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIII.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, January 23, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 23, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you, that the President of the United\r\nStates has appointed you Minister Resident for the United. States, at\r\nthe Hague, which was approved by the Senate on the 16th instant. This\r\nnew mark of the President’s confidence will be the more pleasing to you,\r\nas it imports an approbation of your former conduct, whereon be pleased\r\nto accept my congratulations. You will receive herewith, a letter from\r\nmyself to Monsieur de Montmorin, closing your former mission, your\r\nnew commission, letters of credence from the President for the States\r\nGeneral and Stadtholder, sealed, and copies of them open for your own\r\nsatisfaction. You will keep the cipher we have heretofore used.\r\n\r\nYour past experience in the same line, renders it unnecessary for me to\r\nparticularize your duties on closing your present, or conducting your\r\nfuture mission. Harmony with our friends being our object, you are\r\nsensible how much it will be promoted by attention to the manner as well\r\nas the matter of your communications with the government of the United\r\nNetherlands. I feel myself particularly bound to recommend, as the\r\nmost important of your charges, the patronage of our commerce and the\r\nextension of its privileges, both in the United Netherlands and their\r\ncolonies, but most especially the latter.\r\n\r\nThe allowance to a Minister Resident of the United States, is four\r\nthousand five hundred dollars a year, or all his personal services and\r\nother expenses, a year’s salary for his outfit and a quarter’s salary\r\nfor his return. It is understood that the personal services and other\r\nexpenses here meant, do not extend to the cost of gazettes and pamphlets\r\ntransmitted to the Secretary of State’s office, to translating or\r\nprinting necessary papers, postage, couriers, and necessary aids to poor\r\nAmerican sailors. These additional charges, therefore, may be inserted\r\nin your accounts; but no other of any description, unless where they are\r\nexpressly directed to be incurred. The salary of your new grade being\r\nthe same as of your former one, and your services continued, though the\r\nscene of them is changed, there will be no intermission of salary;\r\nthe new one beginning where the former ends, and ending when you shall\r\nreceive notice of your permission to return. For the same reason, there\r\ncan be but one allowance of outfit and return, the former to take place\r\nnow, the latter only on your final return. The funds appropriated to\r\nthe support of the foreign establishment do not admit the allowance of a\r\nsecretary to a Minister Resident. I have thought it best to state these\r\nthings to you minutely, that you may be relieved from all doubt as to\r\nthe matter of your accounts. I will beg leave to add a most earnest\r\nrequest, that on the 1st day of July next, and on the same day annually\r\nafterwards, you make out your account to that day, and send it by the\r\nfirst vessel, and by duplicates. In this I must be very urgent and\r\nparticular; because at the meeting of the ensuing Congress always, it is\r\nexpected that I prepare for them a statement of the disbursements from\r\nthis fund, from July to June inclusive. I shall give orders, by the\r\nfirst opportunity, to our bankers in Amsterdam, to answer your drafts\r\nfor the allowances herein before mentioned, recruiting them at the same\r\ntime by an adequate remitment; as I expect that by the time you receive\r\nthis, they will not have remaining on hand of this fund more than seven\r\nor eight thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nYou shall receive from me, from time to time, the laws and journals\r\nof Congress, gazettes, and other interesting papers: for whatever\r\ninformation is in possession of the public, I shall leave you generally\r\nto the gazettes, and only undertake to communicate by letter, such,\r\nrelative to the business of your mission, as the gazetteers cannot,\r\ngive. From you I shall ask, once or twice a month regularly, a\r\ncommunication of interesting occurrences in Holland, of the general\r\naffairs of Europe, and the regular transmission of,the Leyden gazette by\r\nevery British packet, in the way it now comes, which proves to be very\r\nregular. Send also such other publications as may be important enough to\r\nbe read by one who can spare little time to read any thing, or which\r\nmay contain matter proper to be turned to, on interesting subjects\r\nand occasions. The English packet is the most certain channel for such\r\nepistolary communications as are not very secret, and by those packets\r\nI would wish always to receive a letter from you by way of corrective to\r\nthe farrago of news they generally bring. Intermediate letters, secret\r\ncommunications, gazettes, and other printed papers, had better come by\r\nprivate vessels from Amsterdam; which channel I shall use generally for\r\nmy letters, and always for gazettes and other printed papers.\r\n\r\nThe President has also joined you in a special and temporary commission\r\nwith Mr. Carmichael to repair to Madrid, and there negotiate certain\r\nmatters respecting the navigation of the Mississippi, and other points\r\nof common interest between Spain and us. As some time will be necessary\r\nto make out the instructions and transcripts necessary in this business,\r\nthey can only be forwarded by some future occasion; but they shall\r\nbe soon forwarded, as we wish not to lose a moment in advancing\r\nnegotiations so essential to our peace. For this reason, I must urge\r\nyou to repair to the Hague at the earliest day the settlement of your\r\naffairs at Paris will admit, that your reception may be over, and the\r\nidea of your being established there strengthened, before you receive\r\nthe new orders.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIV.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, January 23, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 23, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you, that the President of the United\r\nStates has appointed you Minister Plenipotentiary for the United States,\r\nat the court of France, which was approved by the Senate on the 12th\r\ninstant; on which be pleased to accept my congratulations. You will\r\nreceive herewith your commission, a letter of credence for the King,\r\nsealed, and a copy of it open for your own satisfaction, as also a\r\ncipher, to be used on proper occasions in the correspondence between us.\r\n\r\nTo you, it would be more than unnecessary for me to undertake a general\r\ndelineation of the functions of the office to which you are appointed.\r\nI shall therefore only express our desire, that they be constantly\r\nexercised in that spirit of sincere friendship and attachment which\r\nwe bear to the French nation; and that in all transactions with the\r\nminister, his good dispositions be conciliated by whatever in language\r\nor attentions may tend to that effect. With respect to their government,\r\nwe are under no call to express opinions which might please or offend\r\nany party, and therefore it will be best to avoid them on all occasions,\r\npublic or private. Could any circumstances require unavoidably such\r\nexpressions, they would naturally be in conformity with the sentiments\r\nof the great mass of our countrymen, who, having first, in modern times,\r\ntaken the ground of government founded on the will of the people, cannot\r\nbut be delighted on seeing so distinguished and so esteemed a nation\r\narrive on the same ground, and plant their standard by our side.\r\n\r\nI feel myself particularly bound to recommend, as the most important\r\nof your charges, the patronage of our commerce and the extension of its\r\nprivileges, both in France and her colonies, but most especially\r\nthe latter. Our Consuls in France are under general instructions to\r\ncorrespond with the Minister of the United States at Paris; from them\r\nyou may often receive interesting information. Joseph Fenwick is\r\nConsul at Bordeaux, and Burwell Carnes at Nantz; Monsieur de la Motte,\r\nVice-Consul at Havre, and Monsieur Cathalan at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress, of July the 1st, 1790, has limited the allowance of\r\na Minster Plenipotentiary to nine thousand dollars a year, for all his\r\npersonal services and other expenses, a year’s salary for his outfit,\r\nand a quarter’s salary for his return. It is understood that the\r\npersonal services and other expenses here meant, do not extend to the\r\ncost of gazettes and pamphlets transmitted to the Secretary of State’s\r\noffice, to translating or printing necessary papers, postage, couriers,\r\nand necessary aids to poor American sailors. These additional charges,\r\ntherefore, may be inserted in your accounts; but no other of any\r\ndescription, unless where they are expressly directed to be incurred. By\r\nan ancient rule of Congress, your salary will commence from the day you\r\nreceive this letter, if you be then at Paris, or from the day you set\r\nout for Paris from any other place at which it may find you: it ceases\r\non receiving notice or permission to return, after which the additional\r\nquarter’s allowance takes place. You are free to name your own private\r\nsecretary, who will receive, from the public a salary of thirteen\r\nhundred and fifty dollars a year, without allowance for any extras. I\r\nhave thought it best to state these things to you minutely, that you may\r\nbe relieved from all doubt as to the matter of your accounts. I will beg\r\nleave to add a most earnest request, that on the 1st day of July next,\r\nand on the same day annually afterwards, you make out your account to\r\nthat day, and send it by the first vessel, and by duplicates. In this\r\nI must be very urgent and particular, because at the meeting of the\r\nensuing Congress always, it is expected that I prepare for them a\r\nstatement of the disbursements from this fund, from July to June\r\ninclusive. I shall give orders by the first opportunity to our bankers\r\nin Amsterdam, to answer your drafts for the allowances herein before\r\nmentioned, recruiting them at the same time by an adequate remitment, as\r\nI expect that by the time you receive this, they will not have remaining\r\non hand of this fund more than seven or eight thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nYou shall receive from me, from time to time, the laws and journals\r\nof Congress, gazettes, and other interesting papers: for whatever\r\ninformation is in possession of the public, I shall leave you generally\r\nto the gazettes, and only undertake to communicate by letter, such,\r\nrelative to the business of your mission, as the gazettes cannot give.\r\n\r\nFrom you I shall ask, once or twice a month regularly, a communication\r\nof interesting occurrences in France, of the general affairs of Europe,\r\nand transmission of the Leyden gazette, the Journal Logographe, and\r\nthe best paper of Paris for their colonial affairs, with such other\r\npublications as may be important enough to be read by one who can spare\r\nlittle time to read any thing, or which may contain matter proper to be\r\nturned to on interesting subjects and occasions. The English packet is\r\nthe most certain channel for such epistolary communications as are\r\nnot very secret, and by those packets I would wish always to receive\r\na letter from you by way of corrective to the farrago of news they\r\ngenerally bring. Intermediate letters, secret communications, gazettes,\r\nand other printed papers, had better come through the channel of\r\nMonsieur de la Motte at Havre, to whom I shall also generally address my\r\nletters to you, and always the gazettes and other printed papers.\r\n\r\nMr. Short will receive by the same conveyance, his appointment as\r\nMinister Resident at the Hague.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCV.--TO MR. HAMMOND, February 2, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 2, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of your letter of the 14th of December, I communicated\r\nit to the President of the United States, and under the sanction of his\r\nauthority, the principal members of the executive department made\r\nit their duty to make known in conversations generally, the explicit\r\ndisclaimer, in the name of your court, which you had been pleased to\r\ngive us, that the government of Canada had supported or encouraged the\r\nhostilities of our Indian neighbors in the western country. Your favor\r\nof January the 30th, to the same purpose, has been, in like manner,\r\ncommunicated to the President, and I am authorized to assure you, that\r\nhe is duly sensible of this additional proof of the disposition of the\r\ncourt of London to confine the proceedings of their officers in our\r\nvicinage within the limits of friendship and good neighborhood, and that\r\na conduct so friendly and just will furnish us a motive the more for\r\nthose duties and good offices which neighbor nations owe each other.\r\n\r\nYou have seen too much, Sir, of the conduct of the press in countries\r\nwhere it is free, to consider the gazettes as evidence of the sentiments\r\nof any part of the government: you have seen them bestow on the\r\ngovernment itself, in all its parts, its full share of inculpation. Of\r\nthe sentiments of our government on the subject of your letter, I cannot\r\ngive you better evidence than the statement of the causes of the Indian\r\nwar, made by the Secretary of War on the 26th of the last month,\r\nby order of the President, and inserted in the public papers. No\r\ninterference on the part of your nation is therein stated among the\r\ncauses of the war. I am happy however in the hope, that a due execution\r\nof the treaty will shortly silence those expressions of public feeling,\r\nby removing their cause.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVI.--TO MR. HAMMOND, February 25, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 25, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have now the honor to enclose you the answer of the Attorney General\r\nto a letter I wrote him on the subject of yours of the 18th instant.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States are\r\nopen to the application of Mr. Pagan for a writ of error to revise his\r\ncase. This writ is to be granted, indeed, or refused, at the discretion\r\nof the judge; but the discretion of the judge is governed by the rules\r\nof law: if these be in favor of Mr. Pagan’s application, his case\r\nwill be reviewed in the Supreme Court, and the decision against him\r\ncorrected, if wrong, if these be against his application, he will then\r\nbe at the end of the ordinary course of law, at which term alone it is\r\nusual for nations to take up the cause of an individual, and to inquire\r\nwhether their judges have refused him justice. At present, therefore,\r\nI am not able to say more, than that the judges of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States will receive Mr. Pagan’s application for a writ of\r\nerror to revise the judgment given against him by the inferior court,\r\nand that there can be no doubt they will do on that application what\r\nshall be right.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest esteem, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVII.--TO MESSRS. JOHNSON, CARROL, AND STEWART, March 6, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. JOHNSON, CARROL, AND STEWART.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 6, 1792,\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nIt having been found impracticable to employ Major L’Enfant about the\r\nfederal city, in that degree of subordination which was lawful and\r\nproper, he has been notified that his services are at an end. It is now\r\nproper that he should receive the reward of his past services; and the\r\nwish that he should have no just cause of discontent, suggests that it\r\nshould be liberal. The President thinks of two thousand five hundred, or\r\nthree thousand dollars, but leaves the determination to you. Ellicot is\r\nto go on, the week after, the next, to finish laying off the plan on\r\nthe ground, and surveying and platting the district. I have remonstrated\r\nwith him on the excess of five dollars a day and his expenses, and he\r\nhas proposed striking off the latter; but this also is left to you, and\r\nto make the allowance retrospective. He is fully apprized that he is\r\nentirely under your orders, and that there will be no person employed\r\nbut under your orders. The enemies of this enterprise will take\r\nadvantage of the retirement of L’Enfant, to trumpet an abortion of the\r\nwhole. This will require double exertions, to be counteracted. I enclose\r\nyou the project of a loan, which is agreed on, if you approve it. Your\r\nanswer will be immediately expected, and it is kept entirely secret,\r\ntill the subscriptions are actually opened. With this money, in aid of\r\nyour other funds, the works may be pushed with such spirit as to evince\r\nto the world that they will not be relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe immediate employment of a superintendent, of activity and\r\nintelligence equal to the nature of his functions and the public\r\nexpectations, becomes important. You will, doubtless, also consider\r\nit as necessary to advertise immediately for plans of the Capitol and\r\nPresident’s house. The sketch of an advertisement for the plan of a\r\nCapitol, which Mr. Johnson had sent to the President, is now returned\r\nwith some alterations, and one also for a President’s house. Both of\r\nthem are subject to your pleasure, and when accommodated to that, if\r\nyou will return them, they shall be advertised here and elsewhere. The\r\nPresident thinks it of primary importance to press the providing as\r\ngreat quantities of brick, stone, lime, plank, timber, &c. this year as\r\npossible. It will occur to you that the stone should be got by a skilful\r\nhand. Knowing what will be your funds, you will be able to decide which\r\nof the following works had better be undertaken for the present year.\r\n\r\nThe cellars of both houses.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of one, or both.\r\n\r\nBridge over Rock Creek, and the post-road brought over it.\r\n\r\nCanal.\r\n\r\nWharves.\r\n\r\nThe affair of Mr. Carrol of Duddington’s house, seems to call for\r\nsettlement. The President thinks the most just course would be, to\r\nrebuild the house in the same degree, using the same materials as far\r\nas they will go, and supplying what are destroyed or rendered unfit; so\r\nthat the effect will be in fact, only the removal of the house within\r\nhis lot, and in a position square with the streets. Do you not think it\r\nwould be expedient to take measures for importing a number of Germans\r\nand Highlanders? This need not be to such an extent as to prevent\r\nthe employment of eastern laborers, which is eligible for particular\r\nreasons. If you approve of the importation of Germans, and have a good\r\nchannel for it, you will use it, of course. If you have no channel,\r\nI can help you to one. Though Roberdeau’s conduct has been really\r\nblamable, yet we suppose the principal object of the arrest was to\r\nremove him off the ground. As the prosecution of him to judgment might\r\ngive room to misrepresentation of the motives, perhaps you may think it\r\nnot amiss to discontinue the proceedings. You will receive herewith a\r\npacket of papers, among which are several projects and estimates which\r\nhave been given in by different persons, and which are handed on to you,\r\nnot as by any means carrying with them any degree of approbation, but\r\nmerely, that if you find any thing good in them, you may convert it to\r\nsome account. Some of these contain the views of L’Enfant.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVIII.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 10, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy letter of January the 23rd, put under cover to Mr. Johnson in London,\r\nand sent by a passenger in the British packet of February, will have\r\nconveyed to you your appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States, at the court of France. By the Pennsylvania, Captain\r\nHarding, bound to Havre de Grace, and plying pretty regularly between\r\nthis place and that, you will receive the present letter, with the laws\r\nof the United States, journals of Congress, and gazettes to this day,\r\naddressed to the care of M. de la Motte. You will also receive a letter\r\nfrom the President to the King of France, in answer to his announcing\r\nthe acceptance of the constitution, which came to hand only a week ago.\r\nA copy of this letter is sent for your own use. You will be pleased\r\nto deliver the sealed one (to the minister I presume, according to the\r\nancient etiquette of the court), accompanying it with the assurances of\r\nfriendship, which the occasion may permit you to express, and which are\r\ncordially felt by the President and the great body of our nation. We\r\nwish no occasion to be omitted of impressing the National Assembly\r\nwith this truth. We had expected, ere this, that in consequence of the\r\nrecommendation of their predecessors, some overtures would have been\r\nmade to us on the subject of a treaty of commerce. An authentic copy\r\nof the recommendation was delivered, but nothing said about carrying it\r\ninto effect. Perhaps they expect that we should declare our readiness to\r\nmeet them on the ground of treaty. If they do, we have no hesitation to\r\ndeclare it. In the mean time, if the present communications produce any\r\nsensation, perhaps it may furnish a good occasion to endeavor to have\r\nmatters re-placed _in statu quo_, by repealing the late innovations as\r\nto our ships, tobacco, and whale-oil. It is right that things should be\r\non their ancient footing, at opening the treaty. M. Ternant has applied\r\nhere for four hundred thousand dollars for the succor of the French\r\ncolonies. The Secretary of the Treasury has reason to believe, that the\r\nlate loan at Antwerp has paid up all our arrearages to France, both of\r\nprincipal and interest, and consequently, that there is no part of our\r\ndebt exigible at this time. However, the legislature having authorized\r\nthe President to proceed in borrowing to pay off the residue, provided\r\nit can be done to the advantage of the United States, it is thought the\r\nlaw will be satisfied with avoiding loss to the United States. This has\r\nobliged the Secretary of the Treasury to require some conditions, which\r\nmay remove from us that loss which we encountered, from an unfavorable\r\nexchange, to pay what was exigible, and transfer it to France as\r\nto payments not exigible. These shall be fully detailed to you when\r\nsettled. In the mean time, the money will be furnished as far as it\r\ncan be done. Indeed, our wishes are cordial for the re-establishment\r\nof peace and commerce in those colonies, and to give such proofs of our\r\ngood faith both to them and the mother country, as to suppress all that\r\njealousy which might oppose itself to the free exchange of our mutual\r\nproductions, so essential to the prosperity of those colonies, and\r\nto the preservation of our agricultural interest. This is our true\r\ninterest, and our true object, and we have no reason to conceal views\r\nso justifiable, though the expression of them may require that the\r\noccasions be proper and the terms chosen with delicacy. The gazettes\r\nwill inform you of the proceedings of Congress, the laws passed and\r\nproposed, and generally speaking, of all public transactions. You will\r\nperceive that the Indian war calls for sensible exertions. It would have\r\nbeen a trifle had we only avowed enemies to contend with. The British\r\ncourt have disavowed all aid to the Indians. Whatever may have been\r\ntheir orders in that direction, the Indians are fully and notoriously\r\nsupplied by their agents with every thing necessary to carry on the war.\r\nTime will show how all this is to end. Besides the laws, journals,\r\nand newspapers, before mentioned, you will receive herewith the State\r\nconstitutions, the census, and almanac, and an answer to Lord Sheffield\r\non our commerce. A cipher is ready for you, but cannot be sent till we\r\ncan find a trusty passenger going to Paris.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nSince writing the preceding, the two Houses have come to resolutions on\r\nthe King’s letter, which are enclosed in the President’s, and copies of\r\nthem accompany this for your use. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIX.--TO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT, March 18, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 18, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nThe President having thought proper to appoint you joint commissioners\r\nplenipotentiary, on the part of the United States, to treat with the\r\ncourt of Madrid on the subjects of the navigation of the Mississippi,\r\narrangements on our limits, and commerce, you will herewith receive your\r\ncommission; as also observations on these several subjects, reported\r\nto the President and approved by him, which will therefore serve\r\nas instructions for you. These expressing minutely the sense of our\r\ngovernment and what they wish to have done, it is unnecessary for me to\r\ndo more here than desire you to pursue these objects unremittingly, and\r\nendeavor to bring them to an issue, in the course of the ensuing summer.\r\nIt is desirable that you should keep an exact journal of what shall pass\r\nbetween yourselves and the court or their negotiator, and communicate it\r\nfrom time to time to me, that your progress and prospects may be known.\r\nYou will be the best judges whether to send your letters by Lisbon,\r\nCadiz, or what other route; but we shall be anxious to hear from you as\r\noften as possible. If no safe conveyance occurs from Madrid to Lisbon,\r\nand your matter should be of importance sufficient to justify the\r\nexpense, a courier must be sent; but do not incur the expense, unless it\r\nbe to answer some good end.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Gentlemen, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER C.--TO COLONEL PICKERING, March 28, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL PICKERING.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 28, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President has desired me to confer with you on the proposition I\r\nmade the other day, of endeavoring to move the posts at the rate of one\r\nhundred miles a day. It is believed to be practicable here, because it\r\nis practised in every other country. The difference of expense alone\r\nappeared to produce doubts with you on the subject. If you have no\r\nengagement for dinner to-day, and will do me the favor to come and dine\r\nwith me, we will be entirely alone, and it will give us time to go over\r\nthe matter and weigh it thoroughly. I will, in that case, ask the favor\r\nof you to furnish yourself with such notes as may ascertain the present\r\nexpense of the posts, for one day in the week, to Boston and Richmond,\r\nand enable us to calculate the savings which may be made by availing\r\nourselves of the stages. Be pleased to observe that the stages travel\r\nall the day. There seems nothing necessary for us then, but to hand the\r\nmail along through the night till it may fall in with another stage the\r\nnext day, if motives, of economy should oblige us to be thus attentive\r\nto small savings. If a little latitude of expense can be allowed, I\r\nshould be for only using the stages the first day, and then have\r\nour riders. I am anxious that the thing should be begun by way of\r\nexperiment, for a short distance, because I believe it will so increase\r\nthe income of the post-office as to show we may go through with it. I\r\nshall hope to see you at three o’clock.\r\n\r\nI am with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CI.--TO MR. HAMMOND, March 31, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 31, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your favor of the day before, and immediately laid\r\nit before the President of the United States. I have it in charge from\r\nhim to express to you the perfect satisfaction which these assurances on\r\nthe part of your court have given him, that Bowles, who is the subject\r\nof them, is an unauthorized impostor. The promptitude of their disavowal\r\nof what their candor had forbidden him to credit, is a new proof of\r\ntheir friendly dispositions, and a fresh incitement to us to cherish\r\ncorresponding sentiments. To these we are led both by interest and\r\ninclination, and I am authorized to assure you that no occasion will be\r\nomitted, on our part, of manifesting their sincerity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CII.--TO GOVERNOR PINCKNEY, April 1, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 1, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of January the 8th to the President of the United States\r\nhaving been referred to me, I have given the subject of it as mature\r\nconsideration as I am able. Two neighboring and free governments,\r\nwith laws equally mild and just, would find no difficulty in forming\r\na convention for the interchange of fugitive criminals. Nor would two\r\nneighboring despotic governments, with laws of equal severity. The\r\nlatter wish that no door should be opened to their subjects flying from\r\nthe oppression of their laws. The fact is, that most of the governments\r\non the continent of Europe have such conventions; but England, the only\r\nfree one till lately, has never yet consented either to enter into a\r\nconvention for this purpose, or to give up a fugitive. The difficulty\r\nbetween a free government and a despotic one is indeed great. I have the\r\nhonor to enclose to your Excellency a sketch of the considerations which\r\noccurred to me on the subject, and which I laid before the President. He\r\nhas, in consequence, instructed me to prepare a project of a convention,\r\nto be proposed to the court of Madrid, which I have accordingly done,\r\nand now enclose a copy of it. I wish it may appear to you satisfactory.\r\nAgainst property we may hope it would be effectual; whilst it leaves a\r\ndoor open to life and liberty except in a single unquestionable case.\r\nMessrs. Carmichael and Short will be instructed to make this one of the\r\nsubjects of their negotiation with the court of Spain. I have the honor\r\nto be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, your\r\nExcellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIII.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, April 9, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 9, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you were of the 29th of November and the 13th of December.\r\nI have now to acknowledge the receipt of your Nos. 34 to 44, inclusive.\r\nThe river here and at New York having remained longer blocked with ice\r\nthan has been usual, has occasioned a longer interval than usual between\r\nmy letters. I have particularly to acknowledge, that Mr. Barclay’s\r\nreceipt of drafts from you on our bankers in Holland for thirty-two\r\nthousand one hundred and seventy-five florins has come safely to my\r\nhands, and is deposited in my office, where it will be to be found\r\nwrapped in the letter in which it came. You have been before informed of\r\nthe failure of our arms against the Indians, the last year. General St.\r\nClair has now resigned that command. We are raising our western force to\r\nfive thousand men. The stock-jobbing speculations have occupied some of\r\nour countrymen to such a degree, as to give sincere uneasiness to those\r\nwho would rather see their capitals employed in commerce, manufactures,\r\nbuildings, and agriculture. The failure of Mr. Duer, the chief of that\r\ndescription of people, has already produced some other bankruptcies, and\r\nmore are apprehended. He had obtained money from great numbers of small\r\ntradesmen and farmers, tempting them by usurious interest, which\r\nhas made the distress very extensive. Congress will adjourn within a\r\nfortnight. The President negatived their representation bill, as framed\r\non principles contrary to the constitution. I suppose another will\r\nbe passed, allowing simply a representative for every thirty or\r\nthirty-three thousand, in each State. The troubles in the French island\r\ncontinue extreme; we have, as yet, heard of the arrival but of a few\r\ntroops. There begins to be reason to apprehend, the negroes will perhaps\r\nnever be entirely reduced. A commission has issued to Mr. Carmichael and\r\nMr. Short, to treat with the court of Madrid on the subjects heretofore\r\nin negotiation between us. I suppose Mr. Short will be in Madrid by the\r\nlast of May. We expect Major Pinckney here hourly, on his way to London,\r\nas our Minister Plenipotentiary to that court. For a state of our\r\ntransactions in general, I refer you to the newspapers which accompany\r\nthis. I put under your cover letters and newspapers for Mr. Carmichael\r\nand Mr. Barclay, which I pray you to contrive by some sure\r\nconveyances. We must make you, for some time, the common centre of our\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nI am with great and sincere respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIV.--TO MR. HAMMOND, April 12, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 12, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am this moment favored with the letter you did me the honor of writing\r\nyesterday, covering the extract of a British statute forbidding the\r\nadmission of foreign vessels into any ports of the British dominions,\r\nwith goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of\r\nAmerica. The effect of this appears to me so extensive, as to induce\r\na doubt whether I understand rightly the determination to enforce it,\r\nwhich you notify, and to oblige me to ask of you whether we are\r\nto consider it as so far a revocation of the proclamation of your\r\ngovernment, regulating the commerce between the two countries, and that\r\nhenceforth no articles of the growth, production, or manufacture of the\r\nUnited States, are to be received in the ports of Great Britain or\r\nIreland, in vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CV.--TO MR. HAMMOND, April 13,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State presents his compliments to Mr. Hammond, and\r\nencloses him the draught of a letter to the President of the United\r\nStates, which he has prepared to accompany Mr. Hammond’s communication\r\nof the 11th and letter of the 12th. The whole will probably be laid by\r\nthe President before the legislature, and perhaps communicated to the\r\npublic, in order to let the merchants know that they need not suspend\r\ntheir shipments, but to the islands of Jersey and Guernsey. Before\r\nsending the letter to the President, the Secretary of State has chosen\r\nto communicate it to Mr. Hammond in a friendly way, being desirous to\r\nknow whether it meets his approbation, or whether he would wish any\r\nalterations in it.\r\n\r\nApril 13,1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVI.--TO THE PRESIDENT, April 13, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 13, 1792,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to lay before you a communication from Mr. Hammond,\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty, covering a clause\r\nof a statute of that country relative to its commerce with this, and\r\nnotifying a determination to carry it into execution henceforward.\r\nConceiving that the determination announced could not be really meant\r\nas extensively as the words import, I asked and received an explanation\r\nfrom the minister, as expressed in the letter and answer herein\r\nenclosed: and on consideration of all circumstances, I cannot but\r\nconfide in the opinion expressed by him, that its sole object is to\r\nexclude foreign vessels from the islands of Jersey and Guernsey. The\r\nwant of proportion between the motives expressed and the measure, its\r\nmagnitude, and consequences, total silence as to the proclamation on\r\nwhich the intercourse between the two countries has hitherto hung, and\r\nof which, in this broad sense, it would be a revocation, and the recent\r\nmanifestations of the disposition of that government to concur with this\r\nin mutual offices of friendship and good will, support his construction.\r\nThe minister, moreover, assured me verbally, that he would immediately\r\nwrite to his court for an explanation, and, in the mean time, is of\r\nopinion that the usual intercourse of commerce between the two countries\r\n(Jersey and Guernsey excepted) need not be suspended.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound respect and\r\nattachment, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVII.--TO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT, April 24, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 24, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nMy letter of March the 18th conveyed to you full powers for treating\r\nwith Spain on the subjects therein expressed. Since that, our attention\r\nhas been drawn to the case of fugitive debtors and criminals, whereon it\r\nis always well that coterminous States should understand one another, as\r\nfar as their ideas on the rightful powers of government can be made to\r\ngo together. Where they separate, the cases may be left unprovided for.\r\nThe enclosed paper, approved by the President, will explain to you how\r\nfar we can go, in an agreement with Spain for her territories bordering\r\non us: and the plan of a convention is there stated. You are desired to\r\npropose the matter to that court, and establish with them so much of it\r\nas they approve, filling up the blank for the manner of the demand by us\r\nand compliance by them, in such way, as their laws and the organization\r\nof their government may require. But recollect that they bound on us\r\nbetween two and three thousand miles, and consequently, that they should\r\nauthorize a delivery by some description of officers to be found on\r\nevery inhabited part of their border. We have thought it best to agree,\r\nspecially, the manner of proceeding in our country, on a demand of\r\ntheirs, because the convention will in that way execute itself, without\r\nthe necessity of a new law for the purpose. Your general powers being\r\ncomprehensive enough to take in this subject, no new ones are issued.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Gentlemen, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The annexed are the papers referred to in the preceding.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Project of a Convention with the Spanish Provinces_.\r\n\r\nAny person having committed murder of malice prepense, not of the nature\r\nof treason, within the United States or the Spanish provinces adjoining\r\nthereto, and fleeing from the justice of the country, shall be delivered\r\nup by the government where he shall be found, to that from which he\r\nfled, whenever demanded by the same.\r\n\r\nThe manner of the demand by the Spanish government, and of the\r\ncompliance by that of the United States, shall be as follows. The person\r\nauthorized by the Spanish government, where the murder was committed,\r\nto pursue the fugitive, may apply to any justice of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, or to the district judge of the place where the\r\nfugitive is, exhibiting proof on oath that a murder has been committed\r\nby the said fugitive within the said government, who shall thereon\r\nissue his warrant to the marshal or deputy-marshal of the same place, to\r\narrest the fugitive and have him before the said district judge; or the\r\nsaid pursuer may apply to such marshal or deputy-marshal directly,\r\nwho on exhibition of proof as aforesaid, shall thereupon arrest the\r\nfugitive, and carry him before the said district judge; and when before\r\nhim in either way, he shall, within not less than ---------days, nor\r\nmore than ---------, hold a special court of inquiry, causing a grand\r\njury to be summoned thereto, and charging them to inquire whether the\r\nfugitive hath committed a murder, not of the nature of treason, within\r\nthe province demanding him, and on their finding a true bill, the judge\r\nshall order the officer in whose custody the fugitive is, to deliver\r\nhim over to the person authorized as aforesaid to receive him, and shall\r\ngive such further authorities to aid the said person in safe-keeping and\r\nconveying the said fugitive to the limits of the United States, as\r\nshall be necessary and within his powers; and his powers shall expressly\r\nextend to command the aid of posse of every district through which the\r\nsaid fugitive is to be carried. And the said justices, judges, and other\r\nofficers, shall use in the premises the same process and proceedings,\r\n_mutatis mutandis_, and govern themselves by the same principles and\r\nrules of law, as in cases of murder committed on the high seas.\r\n\r\nAnd the manner of demand by the United States and of compliance by\r\nthe Spanish government shall be as follows. The person authorized by a\r\njustice of the Supreme Court of the United States, or by the district\r\njudge where the murder was committed, to pursue the fugitive, may apply\r\nto ---------\r\n\r\nEvidence on oath, though written and _ex parte_, shall have the same\r\nweight with the judge and grand jury in the preceding cases, as if the\r\nsame had been given before them orally and in presence of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe courts of justice of the said States and provinces, shall be\r\nreciprocally open for the demand and recovery of debts due to any person\r\ninhabiting the one, from any person fled therefrom and found in the\r\nother, in like manner as they are open to their own citizens; likewise,\r\nfor the recovery of the property, or the value thereof, carried away\r\nfrom any person inhabiting the one, by any person fled therefrom and\r\nfound in the other, which carrying away shall give a right of civil\r\naction, whether the fugitive came to the original possession lawfully\r\nor unlawfully, even feloniously; likewise, for the recovery of damages\r\nsustained by any forgery committed by such fugitive. And the same\r\nprovision shall hold in favor of the representatives of the original\r\ncreditor or sufferer, and against the representatives of the original\r\ndebtor, carrier away, or forger; also, in favor of either government or\r\nof corporations, as of natural persons. But in no case shall the person\r\nof the defendant be imprisoned for the debt, though the process, whether\r\noriginal, mesne, or final, be for the form sake directed against his\r\nperson. If the time between the flight and the commencement of the\r\naction exceed not ------ years, it shall be counted but as one day under\r\nany act of limitations.\r\n\r\nThis convention shall continue in force --------- years, from the\r\nexchange of ratifications, and shall not extend to any thing happening\r\nprevious to such exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heads of consideration on the establishment of conventions between the\r\nUnited States and their neighbors, for the mutual delivery of fugitives\r\nfrom justice._\r\n\r\nHas a nation a right to punish a person who has not offended itself?\r\nWriters on the law of nature agree that it has not. That, on the\r\ncontrary, exiles and fugitives are, to it, as other strangers, and have\r\na right of residence, unless their presence would be noxious; e. g.\r\ninfectious persons. One writer extends the exception to atrocious\r\ncriminals, too imminently dangerous to society; namely, to pirates,\r\nmurderers, and incendiaries. Vattel, L. 1.5. 233.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of _piracy_, being provided for by our laws, need not be\r\nso by convention.\r\n\r\n_Murder_. Agreed that this is one of the extreme crimes justifying a\r\ndenial of habitation, arrest, and re-delivery. It should be carefully\r\nrestrained by definition to homicide of malice prepense, and not of the\r\nnature of treason.\r\n\r\n_Incendiaries_, or those guilty of _arson_. This crime is so rare as not\r\nto call for extraordinary provision by a convention. The only rightful\r\nsubject then of arrest and delivery, for which we have need, is\r\nmurder. Ought we to wish to strain the natural right of arresting and\r\nre-delivering fugitives to other cases?\r\n\r\nThe punishment of all real crimes is certainly desirable, as a security\r\nto society; the security is greater in proportion as the chances of\r\navoiding punishment are less. But does the fugitive from his country\r\navoid punishment? He incurs exile, not voluntary, but under a moral\r\nnecessity as strong as physical. Exile, in some countries, has been\r\nthe highest punishment allowed by the laws. To most minds it is next to\r\ndeath; to many beyond it. The fugitive indeed is not of the latter; he\r\nmust estimate it somewhat less than death. It may be said that to some,\r\nas foreigners, it is no punishment.\r\n\r\nAnswer. These cases are few. Laws are to be made for the mass of cases.\r\n\r\nThe object of a convention then, in other cases, would be, that the\r\nfugitive might not avoid the difference between exile and the legal\r\npunishment of the case. Now in what case would this difference be so\r\nimportant, as to overweigh even the single inconvenience of multiplying\r\ncompacts?\r\n\r\n1. _Treason_. This, when real, merits the highest punishment. But most\r\ncodes extend their definitions of treason to acts not really against\r\none’s country. They do not distinguish between acts against the\r\ngovernment and acts against the oppressions of the government: the\r\nlatter are virtues; yet have furnished more victims to the executioner\r\nthan the former; because real treasons are rare, oppressions frequent.\r\nThe unsuccessful strugglers against tyranny have been the chief martyrs\r\nof treason-laws in all countries.\r\n\r\nReformation of government with our neighbors; being as much wanted now\r\nas reformation of religion is, or ever was any where, we should not wish\r\nthen, to give up to the executioner, the patriot who fails, and flees to\r\nus. Treasons then, taking the simulated with the real, are sufficiently\r\npunished by exile.\r\n\r\n2. Crimes against _property_; the punishment in most countries,\r\nimmensely disproportionate to the crime.\r\n\r\nIn England, and probably in Canada, to steal a horse is death, the first\r\noffence; to steal above the value of twelve pence is death, the second\r\noffence. All excess of punishment is a crime. To remit a fugitive to\r\nexcessive punishment is to be accessary to the crime. Ought we to wish\r\nfor the obligation, or the right to do it? Better, on the whole, to\r\nconsider these crimes as sufficiently punished by the exile.\r\n\r\nThere is one crime, however, against property, pressed by its\r\nconsequences into more particular notice, to wit;\r\n\r\n_Forgery_, whether of coin or paper; and whether paper of public or\r\nprivate obligation. But the fugitive for forgery is punished by exile\r\nand confiscation of the property he leaves: to which add by convention,\r\na civil action against the property he carries or acquires, to the\r\namount of the special damage done by his forgery.\r\n\r\nThe carrying away of the property of another, may also be reasonably\r\nmade to found a civil action. A convention then may include forgery and\r\nthe carrying away the property of others, under the head of,\r\n\r\n3. _Flight from debts_.\r\n\r\nTo remit the fugitive in this case, would be to remit him in every case.\r\nFor in the present state of things, it is next to impossible not to owe\r\nsomething. But I see neither injustice nor inconvenience in permitting\r\nthe fugitive to be sued in our courts. The laws of some countries\r\npunishing the unfortunate debtor by perpetual imprisonment, he is right\r\nto liberate himself by flight, and it would be wrong to re-imprison\r\nhim in the country to which he flies. Let all process, therefore, be\r\nconfined to his property.\r\n\r\n_Murder_, not amounting to treason, being the only case in which the\r\nfugitive is to be delivered;\r\n\r\nOn what _evidence_, and by _whom_, shall he be delivered? In this\r\ncountry let any justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, or\r\nother judge of the district where the fugitive is found, use the same\r\nproceedings as for a murder committed on the high seas, until the\r\nfinding of the ‘true bill’ by the grand jury; but evidence on oath from\r\nthe country demanding him, though in writing and ex parte, should have\r\nthe same effect as if delivered orally at the examination.\r\n\r\nA true bill being found by the grand jury, let the officer in whose\r\ncustody the fugitive is, deliver him to the person charged to demand and\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\nIn the British provinces adjoining us, the same proceedings will do.\r\n\r\nIn the Spanish provinces, a proceeding adapted to the course of their\r\nlaws should be agreed on.\r\n\r\nMarch 22, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVIII.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, April 28,1792\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 28,1792;\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was of the 10th of March. The preceding one\r\nof January the 23rd had conveyed to you your appointment as Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary to the court of France. The present will, I hope, find\r\nyou there. I now enclose you the correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and Minister of France, on the subject of the monies\r\nfurnished to the distressed of their colonies. You will perceive that\r\nthe Minister chose to leave the adjustment of the terms to be settled\r\nat Paris, between yourself and the King’s ministers. This you will\r\ntherefore be pleased to do on this principle; that we wish to avoid any\r\nloss by the mode of payment, but would not choose to make a gain which\r\nshould throw loss on them. But the letters of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury will sufficiently explain the desire of the government, and be\r\na sufficient guide to you.\r\n\r\nI now enclose you the act passed by Congress for facilitating the\r\nexecution of the consular convention with France. In a bill which has\r\npassed the House of Representatives for raising monies for the support\r\nof the Indian war, while the duties on every other species of wine are\r\nraised from one to three fourths more than they were, the best wines of\r\nFrance will pay little more than the worst of any other country, to wit,\r\nbetween six and seven cents a bottle; and where this exceeds forty per\r\ncent, on their cost, they will pay but the forty per cent. I consider\r\nthis latter provision as likely to introduce in abundance the cheaper\r\nwines of France, and the more so, as the tax on ardent spirits is\r\nconsiderably raised. I hope that these manifestations of friendly\r\ndispositions towards that country, will induce them to repeal the\r\nvery obnoxious laws respecting our commerce, which were passed by the\r\npreceding National Assembly. The present session of Congress will pass\r\nover, without any other notice of them than the friendly preferences\r\nbefore mentioned. But if these should not produce a retaliation of good\r\non their part, a retaliation of evil must follow on ours. It will be\r\nimpossible to defer longer than the next session of Congress, some\r\ncounter regulations for the protection of our navigation and commerce.\r\nI must entreat you, therefore, to avail yourself of every occasion of\r\nfriendly remonstrance on this subject. If they wish an equal and cordial\r\ntreaty with us, we are ready to enter into it. We would wish that this\r\ncould be the scene of negotiation, from considerations suggested by the\r\nnature of our government which will readily occur to you. Congress will\r\nrise on this day se’nnight. I enclose you a letter from Mrs. Greene, who\r\nasks your aid in getting her son forwarded by the Diligence to London,\r\non his way to America. The letter will explain to you the mode and the\r\nmeans, and the parentage and genius of the young gentleman will\r\ninsure your aid to him. As this goes by the French packet, I send no\r\nnewspapers, laws, or other articles of that kind, the postage of which\r\nwould be high.\r\n\r\nI am with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIX.--CIRCULAR TO THE AMERICAN CONSULS, May 31, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR TO THE AMERICAN CONSULS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 31, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nCongress having closed their session on the 8th instant, I have now the\r\nhonor to forward you a copy of the laws passed thereat. One of these,\r\nchapter twenty-four, will require your particular attention, as it\r\ncontains such regulations relative to the consular office, as it has\r\nbeen thought proper to establish legislatively.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the security required by the sixth section I would\r\nprefer persons residing within the United States, where the party\r\ncan procure such to be his security. In this case, his own bond duly\r\nexecuted may be sent to me, and his sureties here may enter into a\r\nseparate bond. Where the party cannot conveniently find sureties within\r\nthe United States, my distance, and want of means of knowing their\r\nsufficiency, oblige me to refer him to the Minister or _Chargé des\r\nAffaires_ of the United States, within the same government, if there be\r\none, and if not, then to the Minister of the United States, resident\r\nat Paris. The securities which they shall approve, will be admitted as\r\ngood. In like manner, the account for their disbursements, authorized\r\nby this law (and no other can be allowed) are to be settled at stated\r\nperiods with the Minister or _Chargé_ within their residence, if there\r\nbe one; if none, then with the Minister of the United States, at Paris.\r\nThe person who settles the account is authorized to pay it. Our Consuls\r\nin America are not meant to be included in these directions as to\r\nsecurityship and the settlement of their accounts, as their situation\r\ngives them a more convenient communication with me. It is also\r\nrecommended to the Consuls to keep an ordinary correspondence with the\r\nMinister or _Chargé_ to whom they are thus referred; but it would be\r\nalso useful, if they could forward directly to me, from time to time,\r\nthe prices current of their place, and any other circumstances which it\r\nmight be interesting to make known to our merchants without delay.\r\n\r\nThe prices of our funds have undergone some variations within the last\r\nthree months. The six per cents were pushed by gambling adventures up to\r\ntwenty-six and a half, or twenty-seven and a half shillings the pound. A\r\nbankruptcy having taken place among these, and considerably affected the\r\nmore respectable part of the paper, holders, a greater quantity of paper\r\nwas thrown suddenly on the market than there was demand or money to take\r\nup. The prices fell to nineteen shillings. This crisis has passed, and\r\nthey are getting up towards their value. Though the price of public\r\npaper is considered as the barometer of the public credit, it is truly\r\nso only as to the general average of prices. The real credit of the\r\nUnited States depends on their ability, and the immutability of their\r\nwill, to pay their debts. These were as evident when their paper fell\r\nto nineteen shillings, as when it was at twenty-seven shillings. The\r\nmomentary variation was like that in the price of corn, or any other\r\ncommodity, the result of a momentary disproportion between the demand\r\nand supply.\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful issue of our expedition against the savages the last\r\nyear, is not unknown to you. More adequate preparations are making\r\nfor the present year, and, in the mean time, some of the tribes have\r\naccepted peace, and others have expressed a readiness to do the same.\r\n\r\nAnother plentiful year has been added to those which had preceded it,\r\nand the present bids fair to be equally so. A prosperity built on the\r\nbasis of agriculture is that which is most desirable to us, because\r\nto the efforts of labor it adds the efforts of a greater proportion of\r\nsoil. The checks, however, which the commercial regulations of Europe\r\nhave given to the sale of our produce, have produced a very considerable\r\ndegree of domestic manufacture, which, so far as it is of the household\r\nkind, will doubtless continue, and so far as it is more public, will\r\ndepend on the continuance or discontinuance of the European policy.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CX.--TO JOHN PAUL JONES, June 1, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 1, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States having thought proper to appoint you\r\ncommissioner for treating with the Dey and government of Algiers, on\r\nthe subjects of peace and ransom of our captives, I have the honor to\r\nenclose you the commissions, of which Mr. Thomas Pinckney, now on his\r\nway to London as our Minister Plenipotentiary there, will be the bearer.\r\nSupposing that there exists a disposition to thwart our negotiations\r\nwith the Algerines, and that this would be very practicable, we have\r\nthought it advisable that the knowledge of this appointment should rest\r\nwith the President, Mr. Pinckney, and myself; for which reason you will\r\nperceive, that the commissions are all in my own hand-writing. For the\r\nsame reason, entire secrecy is recommended to you, and that you so cover\r\nfrom the public your departure and destination, as that they may not be\r\nconjectured or noticed; and at the same time, that you set out after as\r\nshort delay as your affairs will possibly permit.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable you to enter on this business with full information,\r\nit will be necessary to give you a history of what has passed.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July, 1785, the schooner Maria, Captain Stevens,\r\nbelonging to a Mr. Foster, of Boston, was taken off Cape St. Vincent’s,\r\nby an Algerine cruiser; and five days afterwards, the ship Dauphin,\r\nCaptain O’Bryan, belonging to Messrs. Irwins of Philadelphia, was taken\r\nby another, about fifty leagues westward of Lisbon. These vessels, with\r\ntheir cargoes and crews, twenty-one persons in number, were carried into\r\nAlgiers. Mr. John Lambe, appointed agent for treating of peace between\r\nthe United States and the government of Algiers, was ready to set out\r\nfrom France on that business, when Mr. Adams and myself heard of these\r\ntwo captures. The ransom of prisoners being a case not existing when\r\nour powers were prepared, no provision had been made for it. We thought,\r\nhowever, we ought to endeavor to ransom our countrymen, without waiting\r\nfor orders; but at the same time, that acting without authority, we\r\nshould keep within the lowest price which had been given by any other\r\nnation. We therefore gave a supplementary instruction to Mr. Lambe to\r\nransom our captives, if it could be done for two hundred dollars a man,\r\nas we knew that three hundred French captives had been just ransomed by\r\nthe Mathurins, at a price very little above this sum. He proceeded to\r\nAlgiers; but his mission proved fruitless. He wrote us word from thence,\r\nthat the Dey asked fifty-nine thousand four hundred and ninety-six\r\ndollars for the twenty-one captives, and that it was not probable he\r\nwould abate much from that price. But he never intimated an idea\r\nof agreeing to give it. As he has never settled the accounts of his\r\nmission, no further information has been received. It has been said\r\nthat he entered into a positive stipulation with the Dey, to pay for the\r\nprisoners the price above mentioned, or something near it; and that he\r\ncame away with an assurance to return with the money. We cannot believe\r\nthe fact true: and if it were, we disavow it totally, as far beyond his\r\npowers. We have never disavowed it formally, because it has never come\r\nto our knowledge with any degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1787, I wrote to Congress to ask leave to employ the\r\nMathurins of France in ransoming our captives; and on the 19th of\r\nSeptember, I received their orders to do so, and to call for the money\r\nfrom our bankers at Amsterdam, as soon as it could be furnished. It was\r\nlong before they could furnish the money, and as soon as they notified\r\nthat they could, the business was put into train by the General of the\r\nMathurins, not with the appearance of acting for the United States, or\r\nwith their knowledge, but merely on the usual ground of charity.\r\nThis expedient was rendered abortive by the revolution of France, the\r\nderangement of ecclesiastical orders there, and the revocation of church\r\nproperty, before any proposition, perhaps, had been made in form by the\r\nMathurins to the Dey of Algiers. I have some reason to believe that\r\nMr. Eustace, while in Spain, endeavored to engage the court of Spain to\r\nemploy their Mathurins in this business; but whether they actually moved\r\nin it or not, I have never learned.\r\n\r\nWe have also been, told, that a Mr. Simpson of Gibraltar, by the\r\ndirection of the Messrs. Bulkeleys of Lisbon, contracted for the ransom\r\nof our prisoners (then reduced by death and ransom to fourteen) at\r\nthirty-four thousand seven hundred and ninety-two dollars. By whose\r\norders they did it, we could never learn. I have suspected it was\r\nsome association in London, which, finding the prices far above their\r\nconception, did not go through with their purpose, which probably had\r\nbeen merely a philanthropic one. Be this as it may, it was without our\r\nauthority or knowledge.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Cathalan, our Consul at Marseilles, without any instruction\r\nfrom the government, and actuated merely, as we presume, by willingness\r\nto do something agreeable, set on foot another negotiation for their\r\nredemption; which ended in nothing.\r\n\r\nThese several volunteer interferences, though undertaken with good\r\nintentions, run directly counter to our plan; which was, to avoid the\r\nappearance of any purpose on our part ever to ransom our captives, and\r\nby that semblance of neglect, to reduce the demands of the Algerines to\r\nsuch a price, as might make it hereafter less their interest to pursue\r\nour citizens than any others. On the contrary, they have supposed all\r\nthese propositions directly or indirectly came from us; they inferred\r\nfrom thence the greatest anxiety on our part, where we had been\r\nendeavoring to make them suppose there was none; kept up their demands\r\nfor our captives at the highest prices ever paid by any nation; and\r\nthus these charitable, though unauthorized interpositions, have had the\r\ndouble effect of strengthening the chains they were meant to break, and\r\nmaking us at last set a much higher rate of ransom for our citizens,\r\npresent and future, than we probably should have obtained, if we had\r\nbeen left alone to do our own work in our own way. Thus stands this\r\nbusiness then at present. A formal bargain, as I am informed, being\r\nregistered in the books of the former Dey, on the part of the Bulkeleys\r\nof Lisbon, which they suppose to be obligatory on us, but which is to be\r\nutterly disavowed, as having never been authorized by us, nor its source\r\neven known to us.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, this subject was laid before Congress fully, and at the late\r\nsession, monies have been provided, and authority given to proceed to\r\nthe ransom of our captive citizens at Algiers, provided it shall not\r\nexceed a given sum, and provided also, a peace shall be previously\r\nnegotiated within certain limits of expense. And in consequence of these\r\nproceedings, your mission has been decided on by the President.\r\n\r\nSince, then, no ransom is to take place without a peace, you will of\r\ncourse take up first the negotiation of peace; or, if you find it better\r\nthat peace and ransom should be treated of together, you will take care\r\nthat no agreement for the latter be concluded, unless the former be\r\nestablished before or in the same instant.\r\n\r\nAs to the conditions, it is understood that no peace can be made with\r\nthat government, but for a larger sum of money to be paid at once for\r\nthe whole time of its duration, or for a smaller one to be annually\r\npaid. The former plan we entirely refuse, and adopt the latter. We have\r\nalso understood that peace might be bought cheaper with naval stores\r\nthan with money: but we will not furnish them naval stores, because we\r\nthink it not right to furnish them means which we know they will\r\nemploy to do wrong, and because there might be no economy in it as\r\nto Ourselves, in the end, as it would increase the expenses of that\r\ncoercion which we may in future be obliged to practise towards them.\r\nThe only question then, is, What sum of money will we agree to pay them\r\nannually, for peace? By a letter from Captain O’Bryan, a copy of which\r\nyou will receive herewith, we have his opinion that a peace could be\r\npurchased with money, for sixty thousand pounds sterling, or with naval\r\nstores, for one hundred thousand dollars. An annual payment equivalent\r\nto the first, would be three thousand pounds sterling, or thirteen\r\nthousand and five hundred dollars, the interest of the sum in gross.\r\nIf we could obtain it for as small a sum as the second, in money, the\r\nannual payment equivalent to it would be five thousand dollars. In\r\nanother part of the same letter, Captain O’Bryan says, ‘If maritime\r\nstores and two light cruisers be given, and a tribute paid in maritime\r\nstores every two years, amounting to twelve thousand dollars in\r\nAmerica,’ a peace can be had. The gift of stores and cruisers here\r\nsupposed, converted into an annual equivalent, may be stated at nine\r\nthousand dollars, and adding to it half the biennial sum, would make\r\nfifteen thousand dollars, to be annually paid. You will, of course, use\r\nyour best endeavors to get it at the lowest sum practicable; whereupon\r\nI shall only say, that we should be pleased with ten thousand dollars,\r\ncontented with fifteen thousand, think twenty thousand a very hard\r\nbargain, yet go as far as twenty-five thousand, if it be impossible to\r\nget it for less; but not a copper further, this being fixed by law as\r\nthe utmost limit. These are meant as annual sums. If you can put off the\r\nfirst annual payment to the end of the first year, you may employ any\r\nsum not exceeding that, in presents to be paid down; but if the first\r\npayment is to be made in hand, that and the presents cannot by law\r\nexceed twenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAnd here we meet a difficulty, arising from the small degree of\r\ninformation we have respecting the Barbary States. Tunis is said to\r\nbe tributary to Algiers. But whether the effect of this be, that\r\npeace being made with Algiers, is of course with the Tunisians without\r\nseparate treaty, or separate price, is what we know not. If it be\r\npossible to have it placed on this footing, so much the better. In\r\nany event, it will be necessary to stipulate with Algiers, that her\r\ninfluence be interposed as strongly as possible with Tunis, whenever we\r\nshall proceed to treat with the latter; which cannot be till information\r\nof the event of your negotiation, and another session of Congress.\r\n\r\nAs to the articles and form of the treaty in general, our treaty with\r\nMorocco was so well digested that I enclose you a copy of that, to be\r\nthe model with Algiers, as nearly as it can be obtained, only inserting\r\nthe clause with respect to Tunis.\r\n\r\nThe ransom of the captives is next to be considered. They are now\r\nthirteen in number; to wit, Richard O’Bryan and Isaac Stevens, captains,\r\nAndrew Montgomery and Alexander Forsyth, mates, Jacob Tessanier, a\r\nFrench passenger, William Patterson, Philip Sloan, Peleg Lorin, James\r\nHall, James Cathcart, George Smith, John Gregory, James Hermit, seamen.\r\nIt has been a fixed principle with Congress, to establish the rate of\r\nransom of American captives in the Barbary States at as low a point as\r\npossible, that it may not be the interest of those States to go in quest\r\nof our citizens in preference to those of other countries. Had it not\r\nbeen for the danger it would have brought on the residue of our seamen,\r\nby exciting the cupidity of those rovers against them, our citizens now\r\nin Algiers would have been long ago redeemed, without regard to price.\r\nThe mere money for this particular redemption neither has been, nor is,\r\nan object with any body here. It is from the same regard to the safety\r\nof our seamen at large, that they have now restrained us from any ransom\r\nunaccompanied with peace. This being secured, we are led to consent to\r\nterms of ransom, to which, otherwise, our government never would have\r\nconsented; that is to say, to the terms stated by Captain O’Bryan in\r\nthe following passage of the same letter. ‘By giving the minister of the\r\nmarine (the present Dey’s favorite) the sum of one thousand sequins,\r\nI would stake my life that we would be ransomed for thirteen thousand\r\nsequins, and all expenses included.’ Extravagant as this sum is, we\r\nwill, under the security of peace in future, go so far; not doubting,\r\nat the same time, that you will obtain It as much lower as possible, and\r\nnot indeed without a hope that a lower ransom will be practicable, from\r\nthe assurances given us in other letters from Captain O’Bryan, that\r\nprices are likely to be abated by the present Dey, and particularly\r\nwith us, towards whom he has been represented as well disposed. You will\r\nconsider this sum, therefore, say twenty-seven thousand dollars, as your\r\nultimate limit, including ransom, duties, and gratifications of every\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ransom is completed, you will be pleased to have the\r\ncaptives well clothed and sent home at the expense of the United States,\r\nwith as much economy as will consist with their reasonable comfort. It\r\nis thought best, that Mr. Pinckney, our Minister at London, should be\r\nthe confidential channel of communication between us. He is enabled to\r\nanswer your drafts for money within the limits before expressed; and as\r\nthis will be by re-drawing on Amsterdam, you must settle with him the\r\nnumber of days after sight, at which your bills shall be payable in\r\nLondon, so as to give him time, in the mean while, to draw the money\r\nfrom Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nWe shall be anxious to know, as soon and as often as possible, your\r\nprospects in these negotiations. You will receive herewith a cipher,\r\nwhich will enable you to make them with safety. London and Lisbon (where\r\nColonel Humphreys will forward my letters) will be the safest and best\r\nports of communication. I also enclose two separate commissions, for the\r\nobjects of peace and ransom. To these is added a commission to you as\r\nConsul for the United States, at Algiers, on the possibility that it\r\nmight be useful for you to remain there till the ratification of the\r\ntreaties shall be returned from hence; though you are not to delay till\r\ntheir return the sending the captives home, nor the necessary payments\r\nof money within the limits before prescribed. Should you be willing to\r\nremain there, even after the completion of the business, as Consul for\r\nthe United States, you will be free to do so, giving me notice, that no\r\nother nomination may be made. These commissions, being issued during the\r\nrecess of the Senate, are in force, by the constitution, only till the\r\nnext session of the Senate. But their renewal then is so much a matter\r\nof course and of necessity, that you may consider that as certain,\r\nand proceed without interruption. I have not mentioned this in the\r\ncommissions, because it is in all cases surplusage, and because it might\r\nbe difficult of explanation to those to whom you are addressed.\r\n\r\nThe allowance for all your expenses and time (exclusive of the ransom,\r\nprice of peace, duties, presents, maintenance, and transportation of\r\nthe captives) is at the rate of two thousand dollars a year, to commence\r\nfrom the day on which you shall set out for Algiers, from whatever place\r\nyou may take your departure. The particular objects of peace and ransom\r\nonce out of the way, the two thousand dollars annually are to go in\r\nsatisfaction of time, services, and expenses of every kind, whether you\r\nact as Consul or Commissioner.\r\n\r\nAs the duration of this peace cannot be counted on with certainty, and\r\nwe look forward to the necessity of coercion by cruises on their coast,\r\nto be kept up during the whole of their cruising season, you will\r\nbe pleased to inform yourself, as minutely as possible, of every\r\ncircumstance which may influence or guide us in undertaking and\r\nconducting such an operation, making your communications by safe\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nI must recommend to your particular notice Captain O’Bryan, one of the\r\ncaptives, from whom we have received a great deal of useful information.\r\nThe zeal which he has displayed under the trying circumstances of\r\nhis present situation, has been very distinguished. You will find him\r\nintimately acquainted with the manner in which, and characters with\r\nwhom, business is to be done there, and perhaps he may be an useful\r\ninstrument to you, especially in the outset of your undertaking, which\r\nwill require the utmost caution and the best information. He will be\r\nable to give you the characters of the European Consuls there, though\r\nyou will, probably, not think it prudent to repose confidence in any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nShould you be able successfully to accomplish the objects of your\r\nmission in time to convey notice of it to us as early as possible during\r\nthe next session of Congress, which meets in the beginning of November\r\nand rises the 4th of March, it would have a very pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXI.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, June 11, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 11, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir, I have already had the honor of delivering to you your\r\ncommission as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at the court\r\nof London, and have now that of enclosing your letter of credence to the\r\nKing, sealed, and a copy of it open for your own information. Mr. Adams,\r\nyour predecessor, seemed to understand, on his being presented to\r\nthat court, that a letter was expected for the Queen also. You will be\r\npleased to inform yourself whether the custom of that court requires\r\nthis from us; and to enable you to comply with it, if it should, I\r\nenclose a letter sealed for the Queen, and a copy of it open for your\r\nown information. Should its delivery not be requisite you will be so\r\ngood as to return it, as we do not wish to set a precedent which may\r\nbind us hereafter to a single unnecessary ceremony. To you, Sir, it will\r\nbe unnecessary to undertake a general delineation of the duties of the\r\noffice to which you are appointed. I shall therefore only express a\r\ndesire that they be constantly exercised in that spirit of sincere\r\nfriendship which we bear to the English nation, and that in all\r\ntransactions with the minister, his good dispositions be conciliated by\r\nwhatever in language or attentions may tend to that effect. With respect\r\nto their government, or policy, as concerning themselves or other\r\nnations, we wish not to intermeddle in word or deed, and that it be not\r\nunderstood that our government permits itself to entertain either a will\r\nor an opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\nI particularly recommend to you, as the most important of your charges,\r\nthe patronage of our commerce, and its liberation from embarrassments in\r\nall the British dominions; but most especially in the West Indies. Our\r\nConsuls in Great Britain and Ireland are under general instructions\r\nto correspond with you, as you will perceive by the copy of a circular\r\nletter lately written to them, and now enclosed. From them you may often\r\nreceive interesting information. Mr. Joshua Johnson is Consul for us at\r\nLondon, James Maury, at Liverpool, Elias Vanderhorst, at Bristol, Thomas\r\nAuldjo, Vice-Consul at Pool (resident at Cowes), and William Knox,\r\nConsul at Dublin. The jurisdiction of each is exclusive and independent,\r\nand extends to all places within the same allegiance nearer to him\r\nthan to the residence of any other Consul or Vice-Consul of the United\r\nStates. The settlement of their accounts from time to time, and the\r\npayment of them, are referred to you, and in this, the act respecting\r\nConsuls and any other laws made, or to be made, are to be your guide.\r\nCharges which these do not authorize, you will be pleased not to allow.\r\nThese accounts are to be settled up to the first day of July in every\r\nyear and to be transmitted to the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar custom in England, of impressing seamen on every appearance\r\nof war, will occasionally expose our seamen to peculiar oppressions and\r\nvexations. These will require your most active exertions and protection,\r\nwhich we know cannot be effectual without incurring considerable\r\nexpense; and as no law has as yet provided for this, we think it\r\nfairer to take the risk of it on the executive than to leave it on your\r\nshoulders. You will, therefore, with all due economy, and on the\r\nbest vouchers the nature of the case will admit, meet those expenses,\r\ntransmitting an account of them to the Secretary of State, to be\r\ncommunicated to the legislature. It will be expedient that you take\r\nproper opportunities in the mean time, of conferring with the minister\r\non this subject, in order to form some arrangement for the protection of\r\nour seamen on those occasions. We entirely reject the mode which was the\r\nsubject of a conversation between Mr. Morris and him, which was,\r\nthat our seamen should always carry about them certificates of their\r\ncitizenship. This is a condition never yet submitted to by any nation,\r\none with which seamen would never have the precaution to comply;\r\nthe casualties of their calling would expose them to the constant\r\ndestruction or loss of this paper evidence, and thus, the British\r\ngovernment would be armed with legal authority to impress the whole of\r\nour seamen. The simplest rule will be, that the vessel being American,\r\nshall be evidence that the seamen on board her are such. If they\r\napprehend that our vessels might thus become asylums for the fugitives\r\nof their own nation from impress-gangs, the number of men to be\r\nprotected by a vessel may be limited by her tonnage, and one or two\r\nofficers only be permitted to enter the vessel in order to examine the\r\nnumbers on board; but no press-gang should be allowed ever to go on\r\nboard an American vessel, till after it shall be found that there are\r\nmore than their stipulated number on board, nor till after the master\r\nshall have refused to deliver the supernumeraries (to be named by\r\nhimself) to the press-officer who has come on board for that purpose;\r\nand, even then, the American Consul should be called in. In order to\r\nurge a settlement of this point, before a new occasion may arise, it may\r\nnot be amiss to draw their attention to the peculiar irritation\r\nexcited on the last occasion, and the difficulty of avoiding our making\r\nimmediate reprisals on their seamen here. You will be so good as to\r\ncommunicate to me what shall pass on this subject, and it may be made an\r\narticle of convention, to be entered into either there or here.\r\n\r\nYou will receive herewith a copy of the journals of the ancient\r\nCongress, and of the laws, journals, and reports of the present. Those\r\nfor the future, with gazettes and other interesting papers, shall be\r\nsent you from time to time; and I shall leave you generally to the\r\ngazettes, for whatever information is in possession of the public, and\r\nshall especially undertake to communicate by letter, such only relative\r\nto the business of your mission as the gazetteers cannot give. From you\r\nI ask, once or twice a month, a communication of interesting occurrences\r\nin England, of the general affairs of Europe, the court gazette,\r\nthe best paper in the interest of the ministry, and the best of the\r\nopposition party, most particularly, that one of each which shall\r\ngive the best account of the debates of parliament, the parliamentary\r\nregister annually, and such other political publications as may be\r\nimportant enough to be read by one who can spare little time to read any\r\nthing, or which may contain matter proper to be kept and turned to,\r\non interesting subjects and occasions. The English packet is the most\r\ncertain channel for such epistolary communications as are not very\r\nsecret, and intermediate occasions by private vessels may be resorted\r\nto for secret communications, and for such as would come too expensively\r\nburthened with postage, by the packets. You are furnished with a cipher\r\nfor greater secrecy of communication. To the papers before mentioned,\r\nI must desire you to add the Leyden gazette, paper by paper as it comes\r\nout, by the first vessel sailing after its receipt.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the papers in the case of a Mr. Wilson, ruined by the\r\ncapture of his vessels after the term limited by the armistice. They\r\nwill inform you of the circumstances of his case, and where you may\r\nfind him personally, and I recommend his case to your particular\r\nrepresentations to the British court. It is possible that other similar\r\ncases may be transmitted to you. You have already received some letters\r\nof Mr. Adams’s explanations of the principles of the armistice, and of\r\nwhat had passed between him and the British minister on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Greene of Rhode Island will deliver you his papers, and I am to\r\ndesire that you may patronize his claims so far as shall be just and\r\nright, leaving to himself and his agent to follow up the minute details\r\nof solicitation, and coming forward yourself only when there shall be\r\nproper occasion for you to do so in the name of your nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutting has a claim against the government, vouchers for which he is\r\nto procure from England. As you are acquainted with the circumstances of\r\nit, I have only to desire that you will satisfy yourself as to any facts\r\nrelative thereto, the evidence of which cannot be transmitted, and that\r\nyou will communicate the same to me, that justice may be done between\r\nthe public and the claimant.\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion to ask your assistance in procuring a workman\r\nor two for our mint; but this shall be the subject of a separate letter\r\nafter I shall have received more particular explanations from the\r\ndirector of the mint.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXII.--TO THOMAS PINCKNEY, June 11, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 11, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe letter I have addressed to Admiral Jones, of which you have had the\r\nperusal, has informed you of the mission with which the President has\r\nthought proper to charge him at Algiers, and how far your agency is\r\ndesired for conveying to him the several papers, for receiving and\r\npaying his drafts to the amount therein permitted, by re-drawing\r\nyourself on our bankers in Amsterdam, who are instructed to honor your\r\nbills, and by acting as a channel of correspondence between us. It has\r\nbeen some time, however, since we have heard of Admiral Jones. Should\r\nany accident have happened to his life, or should you be unable to\r\nlearn where he is, or should distance, refusal to act, or any other\r\ncircumstance deprive us of his services on this occasion, or be likely\r\nto produce too great a delay, of which you are to be the judge, you will\r\nthen be pleased to send all the papers confided to you for him, to Mr.\r\nThomas Barclay, our Consul at Morocco, with the letter addressed to him,\r\nwhich is delivered you open, and by which you will perceive that he is,\r\nin that event, substituted to every intent and purpose in the place\r\nof Admiral Jones. You will be pleased not to pass any of the papers\r\nconfided to you on this business, through any post-office.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIII.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, June 14, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 14, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe United States being now about to establish a mint, it becomes\r\nnecessary to ask your assistance in procuring persons to carry on some\r\nparts of it; and to enable you to give it, you must be apprized of some\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nCongress, some time ago, authorized the President to take measures for\r\nprocuring some artists from any place where they were to be had. It was\r\nknown that a Mr. Drost, a Swiss, had made an improvement in the method\r\nof coining, and some specimens of his coinage were exhibited here, which\r\nwere superior to any thing we had ever seen. Mr. Short was therefore\r\nauthorized to engage Drost to come over, to erect the proper machinery,\r\nand instruct persons to go on with the coinage; and as he supposed this\r\nwould require but about a year, we agreed to give him a thousand louis\r\na year and his expenses. The agreement was made, two coining mills, or\r\nscrews, were ordered by him; but in the end he declined coming. We have\r\nreason to believe he was drawn off by the English East India Company,\r\nand that he is now at work for them in England. Mr. Bolton had also made\r\na proposition to coin for us in England, which was declined. Since this,\r\nthe act has been passed for establishing our mint, which authorizes,\r\namong other things, the employment of an assayer at fifteen hundred\r\ndollars a year, a chief coiner at the same, and an engraver at twelve\r\nhundred dollars. But it admits of the employment of one person, both\r\nas engraver and chief coiner; this we expect may be done, as we presume\r\nthat any engraver who has been used to work for a coinage, must be well\r\nenough acquainted with all the operations of coinage to direct them; and\r\nit is an economy worth attention, if we can have the services performed\r\nby one officer instead of two, in which case, it is proposed to give him\r\nthe salary of the chief coiner, that is to say, fifteen hundred dollars\r\na year. I have therefore to request that you will endeavor, on your\r\narrival in Europe, to engage and send us an assayer of approved skill\r\nand well attested integrity, and a chief coiner and engraver, in one\r\nperson, if possible, acquainted with all the improvements in coining,\r\nand particularly those of Drost and Bolton. Their salaries may commence\r\nfrom the day of their sailing for America. If Drost be in England, I\r\nthink he will feel himself under some obligation to aid you in procuring\r\npersons. How far Bolton will do it, seems uncertain. You will doubtless\r\nmake what you can of the good dispositions of either of these or any\r\nother person. Should you find it impracticable to procure an engraver\r\ncapable of performing the functions of chief coiner also, we must be\r\ncontent that you engage separate characters. Let these persons bring\r\nwith them all the implements necessary for carrying on the business,\r\nexcept such as you shall think too bulky and easily made here. It would\r\nbe proper, therefore, that they should consult you as to the necessary\r\nimplements and their prices, that they may act under your control.\r\nThe method of your paying for these implements and making reasonable\r\nadvances to the workmen, shall be the subject of another letter, after\r\nthe President shall have decided thereon. It should be a part of the\r\nagreement of these people, that they will faithfully instruct all\r\npersons in their art, whom we shall put under them for that purpose.\r\nYour contract with them may be made for any term not exceeding four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and much esteem, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. Should you not be able to procure persons of eminent\r\nqualifications for their business, in England, it will be proper to\r\nopen a correspondence with Mr. Morris on the subject, and see whether he\r\ncannot get such from France. Next to the obtaining the ablest artists,\r\na very important circumstance is to send them to us as soon as possible.\r\nT. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIV.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, June 16, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 16, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of March the 28th. Yours of April the 6th and 10th\r\ncame to hand three days ago.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the particular objects of commerce susceptible of being\r\nplaced on a better footing, on which you ask my ideas, they will show\r\nthemselves by the enclosed table of the situation of our commerce with\r\nFrance and England. That with France is stated as it stood at the time\r\nI left that country, when the only objects whereon change was still\r\ndesirable, were those of salted provisions, tobacco and tar, pitch\r\nand turpentine. The first was in negotiation when I came away, and\r\nwas pursued by Mr. Short with prospects of success, till their general\r\ntariff so unexpectedly deranged our commerce with them as to other\r\narticles. Our commerce with their West Indies had never admitted\r\namelioration during my stay in France. The temper of that period did\r\nnot allow even the essay, and it was as much as we could do to hold the\r\nground given us by the Marshal de Castries’ _Arrêt_, admitting us to\r\ntheir colonies with salted provisions, &c. As to both these branches of\r\ncommerce, to wit, with France and her colonies, we have hoped they would\r\npursue their own proposition of arranging them by treaty, and that\r\nwe could draw that treaty to this place. There is no other where the\r\ndependence of their colonies on our States for their prosperity is so\r\nobvious as here, nor where their negotiator would feel it so much. But\r\nit would be imprudent to leave to the uncertain issue of such a treaty,\r\nthe re-establishment of our commerce with France on the footing on which\r\nit was in the beginning of their revolution. That treaty may be long on\r\nthe anvil; in the mean time, we cannot consent to the late innovations,\r\nwithout taking measures to do justice to our own navigation. This\r\nobject, therefore, is particularly recommended to you, while you will\r\nalso be availing yourself of every opportunity which may arise, of\r\nbenefiting our commerce in any other part. I am in hopes you will have\r\nfound the moment favorable on your arrival in France, when Monsieur\r\nClaviere was in the ministry, and the dispositions of the National\r\nAssembly favorable to the ministers. Your cipher has not been sent\r\nhitherto, because it required a most confidential channel of conveyance.\r\nIt is now committed to Mr. Pinckney, who also carries the gazettes,\r\nlaws, and other public papers for you. We have been long without any\r\nvessel going to Havre. Some of the Indian tribes have acceded to terms\r\nof peace. The greater part, however, still hold off, and oblige us to\r\npursue more vigorous measures for war. I enclose you an extract from a\r\ncircular letter to our Consuls, by which you will perceive, that those\r\nin countries where we have no diplomatic representative, are desired to\r\nsettle their accounts annually with the Minister of the United States at\r\nParis. This business I must desire you to undertake. The act concerning\r\nConsuls will be your guide, and I shall be glad that the 1st of July be\r\nthe day to which their accounts shall be annually settled and paid, and\r\nthat they may be forwarded as soon after that as possible to the office\r\nof the Secretary of State, to enter into the general account of his\r\ndepartment, which it is necessary he should make up always before the\r\nmeeting of Congress.\r\n\r\nI am with great sincere esteem Dear Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. I have said nothing of our whale-oil, because I believe it is on a\r\nbetter footing since the tariff than before. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXV.--TO MR. VAN BERCKEL, July 2,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAN BERCKEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 2,1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIt was with extreme concern that I learned from your letter of June\r\nthe 25th, that a violation of the protection, due to you as the\r\nrepresentative of your nation had been committed, by an officer of this\r\nState entering your house and serving therein a process on one of your\r\nservants. There could be no question but that this was a breach of\r\nprivilege; the only one was, how it was to be punished. To ascertain\r\nthis, I referred your letter to the Attorney General, whose answer I\r\nhave the honor to enclose you. By this you will perceive, that from the\r\ncircumstance of your servant’s not being registered in the Secretary\r\nof State’s office, we cannot avail ourselves of the more certain and\r\neffectual proceeding which had been provided by an act of Congress for\r\npunishing infractions of the law of nations, that act having thought\r\nproper to confine the benefit of its provisions to such domestics only,\r\nas should have been registered; We are to proceed, therefore, as if that\r\nact had never been made, and the Attorney General’s letter indicates\r\ntwo modes of proceeding. 1. By a warrant before a single magistrate, to\r\nrecover the money paid by the servant under a process declared void\r\nby law. Herein the servant must be the actor, and the government not\r\nintermeddle at all. The smallness of the sum to be redemanded will\r\nplace this cause in the class of those in which no appeal to the higher\r\ntribunal is permitted, even in the case of manifest error, so that if\r\nthe magistrate should err, the government has no means of correcting the\r\nerror. 2. The second mode of proceeding would be, to indict the officer\r\nin the Supreme Court of the United States; with whom it would rest to\r\npunish him at their discretion, in proportion to the injury done and the\r\nmalice from which it proceeded; and it would end in punishment alone,\r\nand not in a restitution of the money. In this mode of proceeding, the\r\ngovernment of the United States is actor, taking the management of the\r\ncause into its own hands, and giving you no other trouble than that\r\nof bearing witness to such material facts as may not be otherwise\r\nsupported. You will be so good as to decide in which of these two\r\nways you would choose the proceeding should be; if the latter, I will\r\nimmediately take measures for having the offender prosecuted according\r\nto law.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVI.--TO MR. PALESKE, August 19,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PALESKE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 19,1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received at this place your favor of the 9th instant, wherein\r\nyou request, that agreeably to the treaty of commerce between the United\r\nStates and his Prussian Majesty, his Consul General be acknowledged as\r\nbelonging to a most favored nation; that the privileges and immunities\r\ndue to a Consul General of the most favored nation be granted to his\r\nConsul General, and that commissioners be appointed to regulate, by\r\nparticular convention the functions of the Consuls and Vice-Consuls of\r\nthe respective nations.\r\n\r\nTreaties of the United States duly made and ratified, as is that with\r\nhis Prussian Majesty, constitute a part of the law of the land, and need\r\nonly promulgation to oblige all persons to obey them, and to entitle all\r\nto those privileges which such treaties confer. That promulgation having\r\ntaken place, no other act is necessary or proper on the part of our\r\ngovernment, according to our rules of proceeding, to give effect to\r\nthe treaty. This treaty, however, has not specified the privileges or\r\nfunctions of Consuls; it has only provided that these shall be regulated\r\nby particular agreement. To the proposition to proceed as speedily as\r\npossible to regulate these functions by a convention, my absence from\r\nthe seat of government does not allow me to give a definitive answer.\r\nI know, in general, that it would be agreeable to our government, on\r\naccount of the recent changes in its form, to suspend for a while the\r\ncontracting specific engagements with foreign nations, until something\r\nmore shall be seen of the direction it will take, and of its mode of\r\noperation, in order that our engagements may be so moulded to that, as\r\nto insure the exact performance of them, which we are desirous ever to\r\nobserve. Should this be the sentiment of our government on the present\r\noccasion, the friendship of his Prussian Majesty is a sufficient\r\nreliance to us for that delay which our affairs might require for the\r\npresent: and the rather, as his vessels are not yet in the habit of\r\nseeking our ports, and for the few cases which may occur for some\r\ntime, our own laws, copied mostly in this respect from those of a very\r\ncommercial nation, have made the most material of those provisions\r\nwhich could be admitted into a special convention for the protection\r\nof vessels, their crews, and cargoes, coming hither. We shall on this,\r\nhowever, and every other occasion, do every thing we can to manifest our\r\nfriendship to his Prussian Majesty, and our desire to promote commercial\r\nintercourse with his subjects; and of this, we hope, he will be fully\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVII.--TO THE PRESIDENT, August 19, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 19, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI was yesterday honored with yours of the 13th instant, covering the\r\nGovernor of Vermont’s of July the 16th. I presume it can not now be long\r\nbefore I shall receive his answer to the two letters I wrote him from\r\nPhiladelphia on the same subject. I now enclose letters received by\r\nyesterday’s post from Mr. Hammond, Mr. William Knox, and Mr. Paleske,\r\nwith answers to the two latter. Should these meet your approbation, you\r\nwill be so good as to seal and let them go on under the cover to Mr.\r\nTaylor, who will have them conveyed according to their address. Should\r\nyou wish any alteration of them, it shall be made on their being\r\nreturned. The Prussian treaty is, I believe, within four years of its\r\nexpiration. I suspect that personal motives alone induce Mr. Paleske to\r\npress for a convention, which could hardly be formed and ratified before\r\nit would expire; and that his court cannot lay much stress on it. Mr.\r\nHammond’s former explanations of his notification of the 12th of\r\nApril having been laid before Congress, may perhaps make it proper to\r\ncommunicate to them also his sovereign’s approbation of them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nattachment, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVIII.--TO M. DE TERNANT, September 27,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 27,1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 2d instant, informing me that the legislative body,\r\non the proposition of the King of the French, had declared war against\r\nthe King of Hungary and Bohemia, has been duly received, and laid before\r\nthe President of the United States: and I am authorized to convey to\r\nyou the expression of the sincere concern we feel, on learning that the\r\nFrench nation, to whose friendship and interests we have the strongest\r\nattachments, are now to encounter the evils of war. We offer our prayers\r\nto Heaven that its duration may be short, and its course marked with as\r\nfew as may be of those calamities which render the condition of war so\r\nafflicting to humanity; and we add assurances, that during its course we\r\nshall continue in the same friendly dispositions, and render all those\r\ngood offices which shall be consistent with the duties of a neutral\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIX.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, October 12,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, October 12,1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of August the 7th came to hand on the 6th instant, and gave\r\nme the first certain information of your safe arrival. Mr. Otto, being\r\nabout to sail for London, furnishes me with an opportunity of sending\r\nthe newspapers for yourself and Mr Barclay, and I avail myself of\r\nit, chiefly for this purpose, as my late return from Virginia and\r\nthe vacation of Congress furnish little new and important for your\r\ninformation. With respect to the Indian war, the summer has been chiefly\r\nemployed on our part in endeavoring to persuade them to peace, in\r\nan abstinence from all offensive operations, in order to give those\r\nendeavors a fairer chance, and in preparation for activity the ensuing\r\nseason, if they fail. I believe we may say these endeavors have all\r\nfailed, or probably will do so. The year has been rather a favorable one\r\nfor our agriculture. The crops of small grain were generally good. Early\r\nfrosts have a good deal shortened those of tobacco and Indian corn, yet\r\nnot so as to endanger distress. From the south my information is less\r\ncertain, but from that quarter you will be informed through other\r\nchannels. I have a pleasure in noting this circumstance to you,\r\nbecause the difference between a plentiful and a scanty crop more than\r\ncounterpoises the expenses of any campaign. Five or six plentiful\r\nyears successively, as we have had, have most sensibly ameliorated the\r\ncondition of our country, and uniform laws of commerce, introduced by\r\nour new government, have enabled us to draw the whole benefits of our\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the copy of a letter from Messrs. Blow and Milhaddo,\r\nmerchants of Virginia, complaining of the taking away of their sailors\r\non the coast of Africa, by the commander of a British armed vessel. So\r\nmany instances of this kind have happened, that it is quite necessary\r\nthat their government should explain themselves on the subject, and be\r\nled to disavow and punish such conduct. I leave to your discretion to\r\nendeavor to obtain this satisfaction by such friendly discussions as may\r\nbe most likely to produce the desired effect, and secure to our commerce\r\nthat protection against British violence, which it has never experienced\r\nfrom any other nation. No law forbids the seaman of any country to\r\nengage in time of peace on board a foreign vessel: no law authorizes\r\nsuch seaman to break his contract, nor the armed vessels of his nation\r\nto interpose force for his rescue. I shall be happy to hear soon, that\r\nMr. B. has gone on the service on which he was ordered.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXX.--TO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT, October 14,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, October 14,1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nSince my letters of March the 18th and April the 24th (which have been\r\nretarded so unfortunately), another subject of conference-and convention\r\nwith Spain has occurred. You know that the frontiers of her provinces,\r\nas well as of our States, are inhabited by Indians holding justly the\r\nright of occupation, and leaving to Spain and to us only the claim of\r\nexcluding other nations from among them, and of becoming ourselves the\r\npurchasers of such portions of land, from time to time, as they choose\r\nto sell. We have thought that the dictates of interest as well as\r\nhumanity enjoined mutual endeavors with those Indians to live in peace\r\nwith both nations, and we have scrupulously observed that conduct.\r\nOur agent with the Indians bordering on the territories of Spain has\r\na standing instruction to use his best endeavors to prevent them from\r\ncommitting acts of hostility against the Spanish settlements. But\r\nwhatever may have been the conduct or orders of the government of\r\nSpain, that of their officers in our neighborhood has been indisputably\r\nunfriendly and hostile to us. The papers enclosed will demonstrate\r\nthis to you. That the Baron de Carondelet, their chief Governor at New\r\nOrleans, has excited the Indians to war on us, that he has furnished\r\nthem with abundance of arms and ammunition, and promised them whatever\r\nmore shall be necessary, I have from the mouth of him who had it from\r\nhis own mouth. In short, that he is the sole source of a great and\r\nserious war now burst out upon us, and from Indians who, we know,\r\nwere in peaceable dispositions towards us till prevailed on by him to\r\ncommence the war, there remains scarcely room to doubt. It has become\r\nnecessary that we understand the real policy of Spain in this point.\r\nYou will, therefore, be pleased to extract from the enclosed papers such\r\nfacts as you think proper to be communicated to that court, and enter\r\ninto friendly but serious expostulations on the conduct of their\r\nofficers; for we have equal evidence against the commandants of other\r\nposts in West Florida, though, they being subordinate to Carondelet, we\r\nname him as the source. If they disavow his conduct, we must naturally\r\nlook to their treatment of him as the sole evidence of their sincerity.\r\nBut we must look further. It is a general rule, that no nation has a\r\nright to keep an agent within the limits of another, without the consent\r\nof that other, and we are satisfied it would be best for both Spain and\r\nus, to abstain from having agents or other persons in our employ or\r\npay among the savages inhabiting our respective territories, whether\r\nas subjects or independent. You are, therefore, desired to propose and\r\npress a stipulation to that effect. Should they absolutely decline it,\r\nit may be proper to let them perceive that, as the right of keeping\r\nagents exists on both sides or on neither, it will rest with us\r\nto reciprocate their own measures. We confidently hope that these\r\nproceedings are unauthorized by the government of Spain, and, in this\r\nhope, we continue in the dispositions formerly expressed to you, of\r\nliving on terms of the best friendship and harmony with that country, of\r\nmaking their interests in our neighborhood our own, and of giving them\r\nevery proof of this, except the abandonment of those essential rights\r\nwhich you are instructed to insist on.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Gentlemen, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXI.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, October 15, 1792\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, October 15, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of July the 10th, No. 4, but no other number\r\npreceding or subsequent. I fear, therefore, that some miscarriage has\r\ntaken place. The present goes to Bordeaux under cover to Mr. Fenwick,\r\nwho I hope will be able to give it a safe conveyance to you. I observe\r\nthat you say in your letter, that ‘the marine department is to treat\r\nwith you for supplies to St. Domingo.’ I presume you mean ‘supplies\r\nof money,’ and not that our government is to furnish supplies of\r\nprovisions, &c. specifically, or employ others to do it, this being a\r\nbusiness into which they could not enter. The payment of money here, to\r\nbe employed by their own agents in purchasing the produce of our soil,\r\nis a desirable thing. We are informed by the public papers, that the\r\nlate constitution of France, formally notified to us, is suspended, and\r\na new convention called. During the time of this suspension, and while\r\nno legitimate government exists, we apprehend we cannot continue the\r\npayments of our debt to France, because there is no person authorized\r\nto receive it and to give us an unobjectionable acquittal. You are\r\ntherefore desired to consider the payment as suspended, until further\r\norders. Should circumstances oblige you to mention this (which it is\r\nbetter to avoid if you can), do it with such solid reasons as will occur\r\nto yourself, and accompany it with the most friendly declarations\r\nthat the suspension does not proceed from any wish in us to delay the\r\npayment, the contrary being our wish, nor from any desire to embarrass\r\nor oppose the settlement of their government in that way in which their\r\nnation shall desire it; but from our anxiety to pay this debt justly and\r\nhonorably, and to the persons really authorized by the nation (to whom\r\nwe owe it) to receive it for their use. Nor shall the suspension\r\nbe continued one moment after we can see our way clear out of the\r\ndifficulty into which their situation has thrown us. That they may\r\nspeedily obtain liberty, peace, and tranquillity, is our sincere prayer.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXII.--TO M. DE TERNANT, October 16,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, October 16,1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant,\r\nproposing a stipulation for the abolition of the practice of\r\nprivateering in times of war. The benevolence of this proposition is\r\nworthy of the nation from which it comes, and our sentiments on it have\r\nbeen declared in the treaty to which you are pleased to refer, as well\r\nas in some others which have been proposed. There are in those treaties\r\nsome other principles which would probably meet the approbation of your\r\ngovernment, as flowing from the same desire to lessen the occasions and\r\nthe calamities of war. On all of these, as well as on those amendments\r\nto our treaty of commerce which might better its conditions with both\r\nnations, and which the National Assembly of France has likewise brought\r\ninto view on a former occasion, we are ready to enter into negotiation\r\nwith you, only proposing to take the whole into consideration at once.\r\nAnd while contemplating provisions which look to the event of war, we\r\nare happy in feeling a conviction that it is yet at a great distance\r\nfrom us, and in believing that the sentiments of sincere friendship\r\nwhich we bear to the nation of France are reciprocated on their part.\r\nOf these our dispositions, be so good as to assure them on this and all\r\nother occasions; and to accept yourself those sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIII.--TO MESSRS. VIAR AND JAUDENES, November 1, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. VIAR AND JAUDENES, _Commissioners of Spain_\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 1, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI have now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of October the 29th,\r\nwhich I have duly laid before the President of the United States: and\r\nin answer thereto, I cannot but observe that some parts of its contents\r\nwere truly unexpected. On what foundation it can be supposed that\r\nwe have menaced the Creek nation with destruction during the present\r\nautumn, or at any other time, is entirely inconceivable. Our endeavors,\r\non the contrary, to keep them at peace, have been earnest, persevering,\r\nand notorious, and no expense has been spared which might attain that\r\nobject. With the same views to peace, we have suspended, now more than a\r\ntwelvemonth, the marking a boundary between them and us, which had been\r\nfairly, freely, and solemnly established with the chiefs whom they had\r\ndeputed to treat with us on that subject: we have suspended it, I say,\r\nin the constant hope, that taking time to consider it in the councils\r\nof their nation, and recognising the justice and reciprocity of its\r\nconditions, they would at length freely concur in carrying it into\r\nexecution. We agree with you, that the interests which either of us have\r\nin the proceedings of the other with this nation of Indians, is a proper\r\nsubject of discussion at the negotiations to be opened at Madrid, and\r\nshall accordingly give the same in charge to our commissioners there.\r\nIn the mean time, we shall continue sincerely to cultivate the peace and\r\nprosperity of all the parties, being constant in the opinion, that this\r\nconduct, reciprocally observed, will most increase the happiness of all.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIV.--TO THE PRESIDENT, November 2,1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 2,1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe letter of October the 29th, from Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes, not\r\nexpressing the principle on which their government interests itself\r\nbetween the United States and the Creeks, I thought it of importance to\r\nhave it ascertained. I therefore called on those Gentlemen, and entered\r\ninto explanations with them. They assured me, in our conversation, that\r\nsupposing all question of boundary to be out of the case, they did not\r\nimagine their government would think themselves authorized to take under\r\ntheir protection any nations of Indians living within limits confessed\r\nto be ours; and they presumed that any interference of theirs, with\r\nrespect to the Creeks, could only arise out of the question of disputed\r\nterritory, now existing between us: that, on this account, some part\r\nof our treaty with the Creeks had given dissatisfaction. They said,\r\nhowever, that they were speaking from their own sentiments only, having\r\nno instructions which would authorize them to declare those of their\r\ncourt: but that they expected an answer to their letters covering mine\r\nof July the 9th (erroneously cited by them as of the 11th), from which\r\nthey would probably know the sentiments of their court. They accorded\r\nentirely in the opinion, that it would be better that the two nations\r\nshould mutually endeavor to preserve each the peace of the other, as\r\nwell as their own, with the neighboring tribes of Indians.\r\n\r\nI shall avail myself of the opportunity by a vessel which is to sail\r\nin a few days, of sending proper information and instructions to\r\nour commissioners on the subject of the late, as well as of future\r\ninterferences of the Spanish officers to our prejudice with the Indians,\r\nand for the establishment of common rules of conduct for the two\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXV.--TO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT, November 3, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 3, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 14th of last month; since which some other incidents\r\nand documents have occurred, bearing relation to the subject of that\r\nletter. I therefore now enclose you a duplicate of that letter.\r\n\r\nCopy of a letter from the Governor of Georgia, with the deposition\r\nit covered of a Mr. Hull, and an original passport signed by Olivier,\r\nwherein he styles himself Commissary for his Catholic Majesty with the\r\nCreeks.\r\n\r\nCopy of a letter from Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes to myself, dated October\r\nthe 29th, with that of the extract of a letter of September the 24th,\r\nfrom the Baron de Carondelet to them.\r\n\r\nCopy of my answer of No. 1, to them, and copy of a letter from myself,\r\nto the President, stating a conversation with those gentlemen.\r\n\r\nFrom those papers you will find that we have been constantly\r\nendeavoring, by every possible means, to keep peace with the Creeks;\r\nthat in order to do this, we have even suspended and still suspend the\r\nrunning a fair boundary between them and us, as agreed on by themselves,\r\nand having for its object the precise definition of their and our\r\nlands, so as to prevent encroachment on either side, and that we have\r\nconstantly endeavored to keep them at peace with the Spanish settlements\r\nalso: that Spain on the contrary, or at least the officers of her\r\ngovernments, since the arrival of the Baron de Carondelet, have\r\nundertaken to keep an agent among the Creeks, have excited them and the\r\nother southern Indians to commence a war against us, have furnished them\r\nwith arms and ammunition for the express purpose of carrying on that\r\nwar, and prevented the Creeks from running the boundary which would\r\nhave removed the cause of difference from between us. Messrs. Viar and\r\nJaudenes explain the ground of interference on the fact of the Spanish\r\nclaim to that territory, and on an article in our treaty with the\r\nCreeks, putting themselves under our protection. But besides that you\r\nalready know the nullity of their pretended claim to the territory, they\r\nhad themselves set the example of endeavoring to strengthen that claim\r\nby the treaty mentioned in the letter of the Baron de Carondelet, and\r\nby the employment of an agent among them. The establishment of our\r\nboundary, committed to you, will, of course, remove the grounds of all\r\nfuture pretence to interfere with the Indians within our territory, and\r\nit was to such only that the treaty of New York stipulated protection:\r\nfor we take for granted, that Spain will be ready to agree to the\r\nprinciple, that neither party has a right to stipulate protection or\r\ninterference with the Indian nations inhabiting the territory of the\r\nother. But it is extremely material also, with sincerity and good faith,\r\nto patronize the peace of each other with the neighboring savages. We\r\nare quite disposed to believe that the late wicked excitements to war\r\nhave proceeded from the Baron de Carondelet himself, without authority\r\nfrom his court. But if so, have we not reason to expect the removal of\r\nsuch an officer from our neighborhood, as an evidence of the disavowal\r\nof his proceedings? He has produced against us a serious war. He says in\r\nhis letter, indeed, that he has suspended it. But this he has not done,\r\nnor possibly can he do it. The Indians are more easily engaged in a\r\nwar than withdrawn from it. They have made the attack in force on our\r\nfrontiers, whether with or without his consent, and will oblige us to a\r\nsevere punishment of their aggression. We trust that you will be able\r\nto settle principles of a friendly concert between us and Spain, with\r\nrespect to the neighboring Indians: and if not, that you will endeavor\r\nto apprize us of what we may expect, that we may no longer be tied up\r\nby principles, which, in that case, would be inconsistent with duty and\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVI.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, November 7, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 7, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 15th of October; since which I have received\r\nyour Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Though mine went by a conveyance directly\r\nto Bordeaux, and may therefore probably get safe to you, yet I think\r\nit proper, lest it should miscarry, to repeat to you the following\r\nparagraph from it.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly sensible that your situation must, ere this reaches you,\r\nhave been delicate and difficult; and though the occasion is probably\r\nover, and your part taken of necessity, so that instructions now would\r\nbe too late, yet I think it just to express our sentiments on the\r\nsubject, as a sanction of what you have probably done. Whenever the\r\nscene became personally dangerous to you, it was proper you should leave\r\nit, as well from personal as public motives. But what degree of danger\r\nshould be awaited, to what distance or place you should retire, are\r\ncircumstances which must rest with your own discretion, it being\r\nimpossible to prescribe them from hence. With what kind of government\r\nyou may do business, is another question. It accords with our principles\r\nto acknowledge any government to be rightful, which is formed by the\r\nwill of the nation substantially declared. The late government was of\r\nthis kind, and was accordingly acknowledged by all the branches of ours.\r\nSo, any alteration of it which shall be made by the will of the nation\r\nsubstantially declared, will doubtless be acknowledged in like manner.\r\nWith such a government every hind of business may be done. But there are\r\nsome matters which I conceive might be transacted with a government _de\r\nfacto_; such, for instance, as the reforming the unfriendly restrictions\r\non our commerce and navigation. Such cases you will readily distinguish\r\nas they occur. With respect to this particular reformation of their\r\nregulations, we cannot be too pressing for its attainment, as every\r\nday’s continuance gives it additional firmness, and endangers its taking\r\nroot in their habits and constitution; and indeed, I think they should\r\nbe told, as soon as they are in a condition to act, that if they do\r\nnot revoke the late innovations, we must lay additional and equivalent\r\nburthens on French ships, by name. Your conduct in the case of M. de\r\nBonne Carrere is approved entirely. We think it of great consequence\r\nto the friendship of the two nations, to have a minister here, in whose\r\ndispositions we have confidence. Congress assembled the day before\r\nyesterday. I enclose you a paper containing the President’s speech,\r\nwhereby you will see the chief objects of the present session. Your\r\ndifficulties as to the settlements of our accounts with France and as,\r\nto the payment of the foreign officers, will have been removed by the\r\nletter of the Secretary of the Treasury, of which, for fear it should\r\nhave miscarried, I now enclose you a duplicate. Should a conveyance for\r\nthe present letter offer to any port of France directly, your newspapers\r\nwill accompany it. Otherwise, I shall send it through Mr. Pinckney, and\r\nretain the newspapers as usual, for a direct conveyance.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVII.--TO M. DE TERNANT, November 20, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 20, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter on the subject of further supplies to the colony of St.\r\nDomingo has been duly received and considered. When the distresses of\r\nthat colony first broke forth, we thought we could not better evidence\r\nour friendship to that and to the mother country also, than to step\r\nin to its relief, on your application, without waiting a formal\r\nauthorization from the National Assembly. As the case was unforeseen, so\r\nit was unprovided for on their part, and we did what we doubted not\r\nthey would have desired us to do, had there been time to make the\r\napplication, and what we presumed they would sanction as soon as known\r\nto them. We have now been going on more than a twelvemonth, in making\r\nadvances for the relief of the colony, without having, as yet, received\r\nany such sanction; for the decree of four millions of livres in aid\r\nof the colony, besides the circuitous and informal manner by which we\r\nbecame acquainted with it, describes and applies to operations very\r\ndifferent from those which have actually taken place. The wants of the\r\ncolony appear likely to continue, and their reliance on our supplies to\r\nbecome habitual. We feel every disposition to continue our efforts for\r\nadministering to those wants; but that cautious attention to forms\r\nwhich would have been unfriendly in the first moment, becomes a duty to\r\nourselves, when the business assumes the appearance of long continuance,\r\nand respectful also to the National Assembly itself, who have a right to\r\nprescribe the line of an interference so materially interesting to the\r\nmother country and the colony.\r\n\r\nBy the estimate you were pleased to deliver me, we perceive that there\r\nwill be wanting, to carry the colony through the month of December,\r\nbetween thirty and forty thousand dollars, in addition to the sums\r\nbefore engaged to you. I am authorized to inform you, that the sum of\r\nforty thousand dollars shall be paid to your orders at the Treasury of\r\nthe United States, and to assure you, that we feel no abatement in our\r\ndispositions to contribute these aids from time to time, as they shall\r\nbe wanting, for the necessary subsistence of the colony: but the want of\r\nexpress approbation from the national legislature must ere long produce\r\na presumption that they contemplate perhaps other modes of relieving the\r\ncolony, and dictate to us the propriety of doing only what they\r\nshall have regularly and previously sanctioned. Their decree, before\r\nmentioned, contemplates purchases made in the United States only. In\r\nthis they might probably have in view, as well to keep the business\r\nof providing supplies under a single direction, as that these supplies\r\nshould be bought where they can be had cheapest, and where the same sum\r\nwill consequently effect the greatest, measure of relief to the colony.\r\nIt is our wish, as undoubtedly it must be yours, that the monies we\r\nfurnish be applied strictly in the line they prescribe. We understand,\r\nhowever, that there are in the hands of our citizens, some bills\r\ndrawn by the administration of the colony, for articles of subsistence\r\ndelivered there. It seems just, that such of them should be paid as\r\nwere received before _fide bonâ_ notice that that mode of supply was\r\nnot bottomed on the funds furnished to you by the United States, and we\r\nrecommend them to you accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have the the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem\r\nand respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVIII.--TO MR. RUTHERFORD, December 25, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RUTHERFORD.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 25, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have considered with all the attention which the shortness of the\r\ntime would permit, the two motions which you were pleased to put into my\r\nhands yesterday afternoon, on the subject of weights and measures, now\r\nunder reference to a committee of the Senate, and will take the liberty\r\nof making a few observations thereon.\r\n\r\nThe first, I presume, is intended as a basis for the adoption of that\r\nalternative of the report on measures and weights, which proposed\r\nretaining the present system, and fixing its several parts by a\r\nreference to a rod vibrating seconds, under the circumstances therein\r\nexplained: and to fulfil its object, I think the resolutions there\r\nproposed should be followed by this; ‘that the standard by which the\r\nsaid measures of length, surface, and capacity shall be fixed, shall\r\nbe an uniform cylindrical rod of iron, of such length, as in latitude\r\nforty-five degrees, in the level of the ocean, and in a cellar or other\r\nplace of uniform natural temperature, shall perform its vibrations in\r\nsmall and equal arcs, in one second of mean time, and that rain-water be\r\nthe substance, to some definite mass of which the said weights shall\r\nbe referred.’ Without this, the committee employed to prepare a bill on\r\nthose resolutions, would be uninstructed as to the principle by which\r\nthe Senate mean to fix their measures of length, and the substance by\r\nwhich they will fix their weights.\r\n\r\nThe second motion is a middle proposition between the first and the\r\nlast alternatives in the report. It agrees with the first in some of\r\nthe present measures and weights, and with the last, in compounding\r\nand dividing them decimally. If this should be thought best, I take the\r\nliberty of proposing the following alterations of these resolutions.\r\n\r\n2nd. For ‘metal’ substitute ‘iron.’ The object is to have one\r\ndeterminate standard. But the different metals having different degrees\r\nof expansibility, there would be as many different standards as there\r\nare metals, were that generic term to be used. A specific one seems\r\npreferable, and ‘iron ‘the best, because the least variable by\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n3rd. I should think it better to omit the chain of 66 feet, because it\r\nintroduces a series which is not decimal, viz. 1. 66. 80. and because it\r\nis absolutely useless. As a measure of length, it is unknown to the mass\r\nof our citizens; and if retained for the purpose of superficial measure,\r\nthe foot will supply its place, and fix the acre as in the fourth\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n4th. For the same reason I propose to omit the words ‘or shall be ten\r\nchains in length and one in breadth.’\r\n\r\n5th. This resolution would stand better, if it omitted the words ‘shall\r\nbe one foot square, and one foot and twenty cents of a foot deep,\r\nand,’ because the second description is perfect, and too plain to need\r\nexplanation. Or if the first expression be preferred, the second may be\r\nomitted, as perfectly tautologous.\r\n\r\n6th. I propose to leave out the words ‘shall be equal to the pound\r\navoirdupois now in use, and,’ for the reasons suggested on the second\r\nresolution, to wit, that our object is, to have one determinate\r\nstandard. The pound avoirdupois now in use, is an indefinite thing. The\r\ncommittee of parliament reported variations among the standard weights\r\nof the exchequer. Different persons weighing the cubic foot of\r\nwater have made it, some more and some less than one thousand ounces\r\navoirdupois; according as their weights had been tested by the lighter\r\nor heavier standard weights of the exchequer. If the pound now in use\r\nbe declared a standard, as well as the weight of sixteen thousand cubic\r\ncents of a foot in water, it may hereafter, perhaps, be insisted that\r\nthese two definitions are different, and that being of equal authority,\r\neither may be used, and so the standard pound be rendered as uncertain\r\nas at present.\r\n\r\n7th. For the same reasons I propose to omit the words ‘equal to seven\r\ngrains troy.’ The true ratio between the avoirdupois and troy weights,\r\nis a very contested one. The equation of seven thousand grains troy to\r\nthe pound avoirdupois, is only one of several opinions, and is indebted\r\nperhaps to its integral form for its prevalence. The introduction\r\neither of the troy or avoirdupois weight into the definition of our\r\nunit, will throw that unit under the uncertainties now enveloping the\r\ntroy and avoirdupois weights.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Representatives were pleased to refer to me the\r\nsubject of weights and measures, I was uninformed as to the hypothesis\r\non which I was to take it up; to wit, whether on that, that our citizens\r\nwould not approve of any material change in the present system, or on\r\nthe other, that they were ripe for a complete reformation. I therefore\r\nproposed plans for each alternative. In contemplating these, I had\r\noccasion to examine well all the middle ground between the two, and\r\namong others which presented themselves to my mind, was the plan of\r\nestablishing one of the known weights and measures as the unit in each\r\nclass; to wit, in the measures of lines, of surfaces, and of solids, and\r\nin weights, and to compound and divide them decimally. In the measure of\r\nweights, I had thought of the ounce as the best unit, because, calling\r\nit the thousandth part of a cubic foot of water, it fell into the\r\ndecimal series, formed a happy link of connection with the system of\r\nmeasures on the one side, and of coins on the other, by admitting an\r\nequality with the dollar, without changing the value of that or its\r\nalloy materially. But on the whole, I abandon this middle proposition,\r\non the supposition that if our fellow-citizens were ripe for advancing\r\nso great a length towards reformation, as to retain only four known\r\npoints of the very numerous series to which they were habituated, to\r\nwit, the foot, the acre, the bushel, and the ounce, abandoning all the\r\nmultiples and subdivisions of them, or recurring for their value to the\r\ntables which would be formed, they would probably be ripe for taking the\r\nwhole step, giving up these four points also, and making the reformation\r\ncomplete; and the rather, as in the present series and the one to be\r\nproposed, there would be so many points of very near approximation,\r\nas, aided in the same manner by tables, would not increase their\r\ndifficulties, perhaps, indeed, would lessen them by the greater\r\nsimplicity of the links by which the several members of the system are\r\nconnected together. Perhaps, however, I was wrong in this supposition.\r\nThe representatives of the people in Congress are alone competent to\r\njudge of the general disposition of the people, and to what precise\r\npoint of reformation they are ready to go. On this, therefore, I do not\r\npresume to give an opinion, nor to pronounce between the comparative\r\nexpediency of the three propositions; but shall be ready to give\r\nwhatever aid I can to any of them which shall be adopted by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with perfect respect, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIX.--TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, January 2, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 2, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAccording to the resolution of the House of Representatives, of the 31st\r\nof December, delivered to me yesterday, I have the honor to lay before\r\nyou a list of the several persons employed in my office, with the\r\nsalaries allowed to each, as follows:\r\n\r\nDollars. George Taylor, jr. (of New York), chief clerk, his salary fixed\r\nby law,................................................. 800\r\n\r\nJacob Blackwell (of New York), clerk,......................... 500\r\n\r\nGeorge Pfeiffer (of Pennsylvania), clerk,..................... 500\r\n\r\nPhilip Freneau (of New York), clerk for foreign languages,.... 250\r\n\r\nSampson Crosby (of Massachusetts), messenger and\r\noffice-keeper,................................................ 250\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of June the 4th, 1790, c. 18, allowed me an\r\nadditional clerk with the same salary as the chief clerk. After the\r\nretirement of the person first appointed, whose services had been\r\nparticularly desirable, because of his long and intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the papers of the office, it did not appear necessary to make\r\nfurther use of the indulgence of that law. No new appointment,\r\ntherefore, has been made.\r\n\r\nThe clerk for foreign languages has but half the usual salary. I found\r\nhis clerkship on this establishment when I came into office, and made\r\nno change in it, except, that in the time of his predecessor, where\r\ntranslations were required from any language with which he was\r\nunacquainted, they were sent to a special translator and paid for by the\r\npublic. The present clerk is required to defray this expense himself.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXX.--CIRCULAR TO THE MINISTERS, February 13, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circular to the Ministers of France, the United Netherlands Great\r\nBritain, &c._\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 13, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives having referred to me, to report to them\r\nthe nature and extent of the privileges and restrictions on the commerce\r\nof the United States with foreign nations, I have accordingly prepared a\r\nreport on that subject. Being particularly anxious that it may be exact\r\nin matters of fact, I take the liberty of putting into your hands,\r\nprivately and informally, an extract of such as relate to our commerce\r\nwith your nation, in hopes that if you can either enlarge or correct\r\nthem, you will do me that favor. It is safer to suppress an error in\r\nits first conception, than to trust to any after correction; and a\r\nconfidence in your sincere desire to communicate or to re-establish any\r\ntruths which may contribute to a perfect understanding between our two\r\nnations, has induced me to make the present request. I wish it had been\r\nin my power to have done this sooner, and thereby have obtained the\r\nbenefit of your having more time to contemplate it: but circumstances\r\nhave retarded the entire completion of the report till the Congress is\r\napproaching its end, which will oblige me to give it in within three or\r\nfour days.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. The report having been prepared before the late diminution of the\r\nduties on our tobacco, that circumstance will be noted in the letter\r\nwhich will cover the report. T. J.\r\n\r\n_France_ receives favorably our bread-stuff, rice, wood, pot and pearl\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nA duty of five, sous the kental, or nearly four and a half centss paid\r\non our tar, pitch, and turpentine. Our whale-oils pay six livres the\r\nkental, and are the only whale-oils admitted. Our indigo pays five\r\nlivres the kental, their own two and a half; but a difference of\r\nquality, still more than a difference of duty, prevents its seeking that\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nSalted beef is received freely for re-exportation; but if for home\r\nconsumption, it pays five livres the kental. Other salted provisions\r\npay that duty in all cases, and salted fish is made lately to pay the\r\nprohibitory one, of twenty livres the kental.\r\n\r\nOur ships are free to carry thither all foreign goods, which may be\r\ncarried in their own or any other vessels, except tobaccos not of our\r\nown growth: and they participate with theirs the exclusive carriage of\r\nour whale-oils.\r\n\r\nDuring their former government, our tobacco was under a monopoly,\r\nbut paid no duties; and our ships were freely sold in their ports and\r\nconverted into national bottoms. The first National Assembly took from\r\nour ships this privilege. They emancipated tobacco from its monopoly,\r\nbut subjected it to duties of eighteen livres fifteen sous the kental,\r\ncarried in their own vessels, and twenty-five livres, carried in ours; a\r\ndifference more than equal to the freight of the article.\r\n\r\nThey and their colonies consume what they receive from us.\r\n\r\nFrance, by a standing law, permits her West India possessions to receive\r\ndirectly our vegetables, live provisions, horses, wood, tar, pitch, and\r\nturpentine, rice and maize, and prohibits our other bread-stuff: but\r\na suspension of this prohibition having been left to the colonial\r\nlegislature, in times of scarcity, it was formerly suspended\r\noccasionally, but latterly without interruption.\r\n\r\nOur fish and salted provisions (except pork) are received in their\r\nislands, under a duty of three colonial livres the kental, and our\r\nvessels are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither, and\r\nto bring away rum and molasses.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n_The United Netherlands_ prohibit our pickled beef and pork, meals and\r\nbread of all sorts, and lay a prohibitory duty on spirits distilled from\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nAll other of our productions are received on varied duties, which may be\r\nreckoned, on a medium, at about three per cent.\r\n\r\nThey consume but a small proportion of what they receive. The residue\r\nis partly forwarded for consumption in the inland parts of Europe, and\r\npartly re-shipped to other maritime countries. On the latter portion,\r\nthey intercept between us and the consumer, so much of the real value as\r\nis absorbed by the charges attending an intermediate deposite.\r\n\r\nForeign goods, except some East India articles, are received in the\r\nvessels of any nation.\r\n\r\nOur ships may be sold and naturalized there, with exceptions of one or\r\ntwo privileges, which scarcely lessen their value.\r\n\r\nIn the American possessions of the United Netherlands, and Sweden, our\r\nvessels and produce are received, subject to duties, not so heavy as to\r\nhave been complained of.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n_Great Britain_ receives our pot and pearl ashes free, while those of\r\nother nations pay a duty of two shillings three pence the kental. There\r\nis an equal distinction in favor of our bar-iron, of which article,\r\nhowever, we do not produce enough for our own use. Woods are free from\r\nus, whilst they pay some small duty from other countries. Indigo and\r\nflaxseed are free from all countries. Our tar and pitch pay eleven pence\r\nsterling the barrel. From other alien countries they pay about a penny\r\nand a third more.\r\n\r\nOur tobacco, for their own consumption, pays one shilling three pence\r\nsterling the pound, custom and excise, besides heavy expenses of\r\ncollection: and rice, in the same case, pays seven shillings four pence\r\nsterling the hundred weight, which rendering it too dear as an article\r\nof common food, it is consequently used in very small quantity.\r\n\r\nOur salted fish, and other salted provisions, except bacon, are\r\nprohibited. Bacon and whale-oils are under prohibitory duties: so are\r\nour grains, meals, and bread, as to internal consumption, unless\r\nin times of such scarcity as may raise the price of wheat to fifty\r\nshillings sterling the quarter, and other grains and meals in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nOur ships, though purchased and navigated by their own subjects, are not\r\npermitted to be used, even in their trade with us.\r\n\r\nWhile the vessels of other nations are secured by standing laws, which\r\ncannot be altered but by the concurrent will of the three branches of\r\nthe British legislature, in carrying thither any produce or manufacture\r\nof the country to which they belong, which may be lawfully carried in\r\nany vessels, ours, with the same prohibition of what is foreign, are\r\nfurther prohibited by a standing law (12 Car. 2, c. 18, s. 3.)\r\nfrom carrying thither all and any of our domestic productions and\r\nmanufactures. A subsequent act, indeed, has authorized their executive\r\nto permit the carriage of our own productions in our own bottoms, at its\r\nsole discretion: and the permission has been given from year to year,\r\nby proclamation; but subject every moment to be withdrawn on that single\r\nwill, in which event, our vessels having any thing on board, stand\r\ninterdicted from the entry of all British ports. The disadvantage of\r\na tenure which may be so suddenly discontinued, was experienced by our\r\nmerchants on a late occasion, when an official notification that this\r\nlaw would be strictly enforced, gave them just apprehensions for the\r\nfate of their vessels and cargoes despatched or destined to the ports of\r\nGreat Britain. It was privately believed, indeed, that the order of that\r\ncourt went further than their intention, and so we were, afterwards,\r\nofficially informed: but the embarrassments of the moment were real and\r\ngreat, and the possibility of their renewal lays our commerce to that\r\ncountry under the same species of discouragement, as to other countries\r\nwhere it is regulated by a single legislator: and the distinction is too\r\nremarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the\r\nsecurity of fixed laws, while that security is given to the navigation\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nOur vessels pay in their ports one shilling nine pence sterling per ton,\r\nlight and trinity dues, more than is paid by British ships, except in\r\nthe port of London, where they pay the same as British. The greater part\r\nof what they receive from us is re-exported to other countries, under\r\nthe useless charges of an intermediate deposite and double voyage.\r\n\r\nFrom tables published in England, and composed, as is said, from the\r\nbooks of their Custom-Houses, it appears, that of the indigo imported\r\nthere in the years 1773-4-5, one third was re-exported; and, from a\r\ndocument of authority, we learn that of the rice and tobacco imported\r\nthere before the war, four fifths were re-exported. We are assured,\r\nindeed, that the quantities sent thither for re-exportation since the\r\nwar are considerably diminished; yet less so than reason and national\r\ninterest would dictate. The whole of our grain is re-exported, when\r\nwheat is below fifty shillings the quarter, and other grains in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain admits in her islands our vegetables, live provisions,\r\nhorses, wood, tar, pitch, and turpentine, rice and bread-stuff, by a\r\nproclamation of her executive, limited always to the term of a year, but\r\nhitherto renewed from year to year. She prohibits our salted fish\r\nand other salted provisions. She does not permit our vessels to carry\r\nthither our own produce. Her vessels alone may take it from us, and\r\nbring in exchange, rum, molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa-nuts, ginger, and\r\npimento. There are, indeed, some freedoms in the island of Dominica,\r\nbut under such circumstances as to be little used by us. In the British\r\ncontinental colonies, and in Newfoundland, all our productions are\r\nprohibited, and our vessels forbidden to enter their ports. Their\r\nGovernors, however, in times of distress, have power to permit a\r\ntemporary importation of certain articles in their own bottoms, but not\r\nin ours.\r\n\r\nOur citizens cannot reside as merchants or factors within any of the\r\nBritish plantations, this being expressly prohibited by the same statute\r\nof 12 Car. 2, c. 18, commonly called their navigation act.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nOf our commercial objects, _Spain_ receives favorably our breadstuff,\r\nsalted fish, wood, ships, tar, pitch, and turpentine. On our meals,\r\nhowever, when re-exported to their colonies, they have lately imposed\r\nduties, of from half a dollar to two dollars the barrel, the duties\r\nbeing so proportioned to the current price of their own flour, as that\r\nboth together are to make the constant sum of nine dollars per barrel.\r\n\r\nThey do not discourage our rice, pot and pearl ash, salted provisions,\r\nor whale-oil; but these articles, being in small demand at their\r\nmarkets, are carried thither but in a small degree. Their demand for\r\nrice, however, is increasing. Neither tobacco nor indigo are received\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThemselves and their colonies are the actual consumers of what they\r\nreceive from us.\r\n\r\nOur navigation is free with the kingdom of Spain, foreign goods being\r\nreceived there in our ships on the same conditions as if carried in\r\ntheir own, or in the vessels of the country of which such goods are the\r\nmanufacture or produce.\r\n\r\nSpain and Portugal refuse to those parts of America which they govern,\r\nall direct intercourse with any people but themselves. The commodities\r\nin mutual demand between them and their neighbors, must be carried to be\r\nexchanged in some port of the dominant country, and the transportation\r\nbetween that and the subject state must be in a domestic bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXI.--TO MR. HAMMOND, February 16, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 16, 1793.\r\n\r\nI have duly received your letter of yesterday, with the statement of the\r\nduties payable on articles imported into Great Britain The object of\r\nthe report, from which I had communicated some extracts to you, not\r\nrequiring a minute detail of the several duties on every article, in\r\nevery country, I had presented both articles and duties in groups, and\r\nin general terms, conveying information sufficiently accurate for\r\nthe object. And I have the satisfaction to find, on re-examining the\r\nexpressions in the report, that they correspond with your statement\r\nas nearly as generals can with particulars. The differences which any\r\nnation makes between our commodities and those of other countries,\r\nwhether favorable or unfavorable to us, were proper to be noted. But\r\nthey were subordinate to the more important questions, What countries\r\nconsume most of our produce, exact the lightest duties, and leave to us\r\nthe most favorable balance?\r\n\r\nYou seem to think that in the mention made of your official\r\ncommunication of April the 11th, 1792, that the clause in the navigation\r\nact (prohibiting our own produce to be carried in our own vessels into\r\nthe British European dominions) would be strictly enforced in future,\r\nand the private belief expressed at the same time, that the intention of\r\nthat court did not go so far, that the latter terms are not sufficiently\r\naccurate. About the fact it is impossible we should differ, because it\r\nis a written one. The only difference, then, must be a merely verbal\r\none. For thus stands the fact. In your letter of April the 11th, you\r\nsay, you have received by a circular despatch from your court, direction\r\nto inform this government that it had been determined in future strictly\r\nto enforce this clause of the navigation act. This I considered as an\r\nofficial notification. In your answer of April the 12th, to my request\r\nof explanation, you say, ‘In answer to your letter of this day, I\r\nhave the honor of observing that I have no other instructions upon the\r\nsubject of my communication, than such as are contained in the circular\r\ndespatch, of which I stated the purport in my letter dated yesterday.\r\nI have, however, no difficulty in assuring you, that the result of\r\nmy personal conviction is, that the determination of his Majesty’s\r\ngovernment to enforce the clause of the act, &c. is not intended to\r\nmilitate against the proclamation,’ &c. This personal conviction is\r\nexpressed in the report as a private belief, in contradistinction of the\r\nofficial declaration. In your letter of yesterday, you chose to call it\r\n‘a formal assurance of your conviction.’ As I am not scrupulous about\r\nwords when they are once explained, I feel no difficulty in substituting\r\nin the report, your own words ‘personal conviction,’ for those of\r\n‘private belief’ which I had thought equivalent. I cannot indeed insert\r\nthat it was a formal assurance, lest some readers might confound this\r\nwith an official one, without reflecting that you could not mean to\r\ngive official assurance that the clause would be enforced, and official\r\nassurance, at the same time, of your personal conviction that it would\r\nnot be enforced.\r\n\r\nI had the honor to acknowledge verbally the receipt of your letter of\r\nthe 3rd of August, when you did me that of making the inquiry verbally\r\nabout six weeks ago; and I beg leave to assure you, that I am, with due\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXII.--TO M. DE TERNANT, February 17, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 17, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your letter of yesterday, and am sensible of your\r\nfavor in furnishing me with your observations on the statement of the\r\ncommerce between our two nations, of which I shall avail myself for the\r\ngood of both. The omission of our participation with your vessels, in\r\nthe exclusive transportation of our tobacco, was merely that of the\r\ncopy, as it was expressed in the original draught where the same\r\ncircumstance respecting our whale-oil was noted: and I am happy that\r\nyour notice of it has enabled me to reinstate it before the report\r\ngoes out of my hand. I must candidly acknowledge to you, that I do\r\nnot foresee the same effect in favor of our navigation, from the late\r\nreduction of duties on our tobaccos in France, which you seem to expect.\r\nThe difference in favor of French vessels is still so great, as, in my\r\nopinion, to make it their interest to quit all other branches of the\r\ncarrying business, to take up this; and as your stock of shipping is\r\nnot adequate to the carriage of all your exports, the branches which\r\nyou abandon will be taken up by other nations: so that this difference\r\nthrusts us out of the tobacco carriage, to let other nations in to the\r\ncarriage of other branches of your commerce. I must therefore avail\r\nmyself of this occasion to express my hope, that your nation will again\r\nrevise this subject, and place it on more equal grounds. I am happy in\r\nconcurring with you more perfectly in another sentiment, that as the\r\nprinciples of our governments become more congenial, the links of\r\naffection are multiplied between us. It is impossible they should\r\nmultiply beyond our wishes. Of the sincere interest we take in\r\nthe happiness and prosperity of your nation, you have had the most\r\nunequivocal proofs.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept assurances of sincere attachment to you personally,\r\nand of the sentiments of respect and esteem, with which I am, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIII.--TO M. DE TERNANT, February 20, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 20, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have laid before the President of the United States your notification\r\nof the 17th instant, in the name of the Provisory Executive Council\r\ncharged with the administration of your government, that the French\r\nnation has constituted itself into a republic. The President receives\r\nwith great satisfaction this attention of the Executive Council, and the\r\ndesire they have manifested of making known to us the resolution entered\r\ninto by the National Convention, even before a definitive regulation\r\nof their new establishment could take place. Be assured, Sir, that the\r\ngovernment and the citizens of the United States, view with the most\r\nsincere pleasure every advance of your nation towards its happiness,\r\nan object essentially connected with its liberty, and they consider the\r\nunion of principles and pursuits between our two countries, as a link\r\nwhich binds still closer their interests and affections. We earnestly\r\nwish on our part, that these our natural dispositions may be improved to\r\nmutual good, by establishing our commercial intercourse on principles as\r\nfriendly to natural right and freedom, as are those of our governments.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIV.--TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, February 20, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 20, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, about the close of the session before the\r\nlast, referred to me the report of a committee on a message from the\r\nPresident of the United States, of the 14th of February, 1791, with\r\ndirections to report to Congress the nature and extent of the privileges\r\nand restrictions of the commercial intercourse of the United States\r\nwith foreign nations, and measures for its improvement. The report was\r\naccordingly prepared during the ensuing recess, ready to be delivered at\r\nthe next session, that is to say, at the last. It was thought possible\r\nat that time, however, that some changes might take place in the\r\nexisting state of things, which might call for corresponding changes\r\nin measures. I took the liberty of mentioning this in a letter to the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, to express an opinion that a\r\nsuspension of proceedings thereon, for a time, might be expedient, and\r\nto propose retaining the report till the present session, unless the\r\nHouse should be pleased to signify their pleasure to the contrary. The\r\nchanges then contemplated have not taken place, nor, after waiting as\r\nlong as the term of the session will admit, in order to learn something\r\nfurther on the subject, can any thing definite thereon be now said. If,\r\ntherefore, the House wishes to proceed on the subject, the report shall\r\nbe delivered at a moment’s warning. Should they not choose to take it up\r\ntill their next session, it will be an advantage to be permitted to keep\r\nit by me till then, as some farther particulars may perhaps be procured\r\nrelative to certain parts of our commerce, of which precise information\r\nis difficult to obtain. I make this suggestion, however, with the most\r\nperfect deference to their will, the first intimation of which shall be\r\nobeyed on my part, so as to occasion them no delay.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXV.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, March 12,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 12,1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, have been duly received. I am sensible\r\nthat your situation must have been difficult during the transition\r\nfrom the late form of government to the re-establishment of some other\r\nlegitimate authority, and that you may have been at a loss to determine\r\nwith whom business might be done. Nevertheless, when principles are well\r\nunderstood, their application is less embarrassing. We surely cannot\r\ndeny to any nation that right whereon our own government is founded,\r\nthat every one may govern itself according to whatever form it pleases,\r\nand change these forms at its own will; and that it may transact its\r\nbusiness with foreign nations through whatever organ it thinks proper,\r\nwhether King, Convention, Assembly, Committee, President, or any thing\r\nelse it may choose. The will of the nation is the only thing essential\r\nto be regarded. On the dissolution of the late constitution in France,\r\nby removing so integral a part of it as the King, the National Assembly,\r\nto whom a part only of the public authority had been delegated, appear\r\nto have considered themselves as incompetent to transact the affairs of\r\nthe nation legitimately. They invited their fellow-citizens, therefore,\r\nto appoint a National Convention. In conformity with this their idea\r\nof the defective state of the national authority, you were desired\r\nfrom hence to suspend further payments of our debts to France till\r\nnew orders, with an assurance, however, to the acting power, that\r\nthe suspension should not be continued a moment longer than should be\r\nnecessary for us to see the re-establishment of some person or body of\r\npersons authorized to receive payment and give us a good acquittal; (if\r\nyou should find it necessary to give any assurance or explanation at\r\nall.) In the mean time, we went on paying up the four millions of livres\r\nwhich had been destined by the last constituted authorities to\r\nthe relief of St. Domingo. Before this was completed, we received\r\ninformation that a National Assembly had met, with full powers to\r\ntransact the affairs of the nation, and soon afterwards, the minister of\r\nFrance here presented an application for three millions of livres, to\r\nbe laid out in provisions to be sent to France. Urged by the strongest\r\nattachment to that country, and thinking it even providential, that\r\nmonies lent to us in distress, could be repaid under like circumstances,\r\nwe had no hesitation to comply with the application, and arrangements\r\nare accordingly taken, for furnishing this sum at epochs accommodated\r\nto the demand and our means of paying it. We suppose this will rather\r\noverpay the instalments and interest due on the loans of eighteen, six,\r\nand ten millions, to the end of 1792; and we shall certainly use our\r\nutmost endeavors to make punctual payments of the instalments and\r\ninterest hereafter becoming exigible, and to omit no opportunity of\r\nconvincing that nation how cordially we wish to serve them. Mutual good\r\noffices, mutual affection, and similar principles of government, seem\r\nto destine the two nations for the most intimate communion: and I cannot\r\ntoo much press it on you, to improve every opportunity which may occur\r\nin the changeable scenes which are passing, and to seize them as they\r\noccur, for placing our commerce with that nation and its dependencies,\r\non the freest and most encouraging footing possible. Besides what\r\nwe have furnished publicly for the relief of St. Domingo, individual\r\nmerchants of the United States have carried considerable supplies\r\nthither, which have been sometimes purchased, sometimes taken by force,\r\nand bills given by the administration of the colony on the Minister\r\nhere, which have been protested for want of funds. We have no doubt that\r\njustice will be done to these our citizens, and that without a delay\r\nwhich would be ruinous to them. We wish authority to be given to the\r\nMinister of France here to pay the just demands of our citizens, out of\r\nthe monies he may receive from us.\r\n\r\nDuring the fluctuating state of the assignats of France, I must ask\r\nthe favor of you to inform me, in every letter, of the rate of exchange\r\nbetween them and coin, this being necessary for the regulation of our\r\nCustom-Houses.\r\n\r\nCongress closed its session on the 2nd instant. You will see their acts\r\nin the newspapers forwarded to you, and the body of them shall be sent\r\nas soon as the octavo edition is printed. We are to hold a treaty with\r\nthe western Indians in the ensuing month of May, but not under very\r\nhopeful auspices.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the newspapers, a remarkable fall in the price of\r\nour public paper. This is owing chiefly to the extraordinary demand for\r\nthe produce of our country, and a temporary scarcity of cash to purchase\r\nit. The merchants holding public paper are obliged to part with it at\r\nany price, to raise money.\r\n\r\nI sent you, by the way of London, a dozen plans of the city of\r\nWashington in the federal territory, hoping you would have them\r\ndisplayed to public view where they would be most seen by those\r\ndescriptions of men worthy and likely to be attracted to it. Paris,\r\nLyons, Rouen, and the sea-port towns of Havre, Nantes, Bordeaux, and\r\nMarseilles, would be proper places to send some of them. I trust to Mr.\r\nTaylor to forward you the newspapers by every direct occasion to France.\r\nThese are rare at all times, and especially in the winter: and to\r\nsend them through England would cost too much in postage. To these\r\ncircumstances, as well, probably, as to some miscarriages, you must\r\nascribe the length of intervals sometimes experienced in the receipt of\r\nyour papers.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVI.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, March 15, 1793\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe President has seen with satisfaction, that the Ministers of the\r\nUnited States in Europe, while they have avoided an useless commitment\r\nof their nation on the subject of the Marquis de la Fayette, have\r\nnevertheless shown themselves attentive to his situation. The interest\r\nwhich the President himself, and our citizens in general, take in the\r\nwelfare of this gentleman, is great and sincere, and will entirely\r\njustify all prudent efforts to serve him. I am therefore to desire, that\r\nyou will avail yourself of every opportunity of sounding the way towards\r\nhis liberation, of finding out whether those in whose power he is are\r\nvery tenacious of him, or insinuating through such channels as you\r\nshall think suitable, the attentions of the government and people of the\r\nUnited States to this object, and the interest they take in it, and of\r\nprocuring his liberation by informal solicitations, if possible. But if\r\nformal ones be necessary, and the moment should arrive when you shall\r\nfind that they will be effectual, you are authorized to signify through\r\nsuch channel as you shall find suitable, that our government and nation,\r\nfaithful in their attachments to this gentleman for the services he has\r\nrendered them, feel a lively interest in his welfare, and will view\r\nhis liberation as a mark of consideration and friendship for the United\r\nStates, and as a new motive for esteem and a reciprocation of kind\r\noffices toward the power to whom they shall be indebted for this act.\r\n\r\nA like letter being written to Mr. Pinckney, you will of course take\r\ncare, that however you may act through different channels, there be\r\nstill a sufficient degree of concert in your proceedings.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVII.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, March 16, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 16, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 30th of December, and again a short letter on the\r\n1st of January, since which I have received yours of October the 2nd and\r\n5th, November the 6th and 9th, and December the 13th, 14th, 15th. I now\r\nenclose you the Treasurer’s second of exchange for twenty-four thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty guilders, to be employed in the purchase of\r\ncopper for the mint, from Sweden, or wherever else it can be got on the\r\nbest terms; the first of exchange having been enclosed in my letter of\r\nDecember the 30th.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes you will have been able to enter into proper arrangements\r\nwith the British Minister for the protection of our seamen from\r\nimpressment, before the preparations for war shall have produced\r\ninconvenience to them. While he regards so minutely the inconveniences\r\nto themselves which may result from a due regulation of this practice,\r\nit is just he should regard our inconveniences also, from the want of\r\nit. His observations in your letter imply merely, that if they should\r\nabstain from injuring us, it might be attended with inconvenience to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nYou ask, what should be your conduct, in case you should at any\r\ntime discover negotiations to be going on, which might eventually be\r\ninteresting to us. The nature of the particular case will point out what\r\nmeasures, on your part, would be the most for our interest, and to your\r\ndiscretion we must refer the taking such measures, without waiting for\r\ninstructions, where circumstances would not admit of such a delay. A\r\nlike necessity to act may arise on other occasions. In the changeable\r\nscenes, for instance, which are passing in Europe, were a moment\r\nto offer when you could obtain any advantage for our commerce, and\r\nespecially in the American colonies, you are desired to avail us of it\r\nto the best advantage, and not to let the occasion slip by for want of\r\nprevious instruction.\r\n\r\nYou ask, what encouragements are given to emigrants by the several\r\nStates. No other than a permission to become citizens, and to\r\nparticipate of the rights of citizens, except as to eligibility to\r\ncertain offices in the government. The rules, as to these, are not\r\nuniform in the states. I have found it absolutely impracticable to\r\nobtain, even for my office, a regular transmission of the laws of the\r\nseveral States: consequently, it would be more so to furnish them to\r\nour ministers abroad. You will receive by this or the first proper\r\nconveyance, those of Congress, passed at their last session.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to give any authority for the advance of monies\r\nto Mr. Wilson. Were we to do it in his case, we should, on the same\r\nprinciples, be obliged to do it in several others wherein foreign\r\nnations decline or delay doing justice to our citizens. No law of the\r\nUnited States would cover such an act of the executive; and all we can\r\ndo legally is, to give him all the aid which our patronage of his claims\r\nwith the British court can effect.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the payment of your allowances, as the laws authorize\r\nthe payment of a given number of dollars to you, and as your duties\r\nplace you in London, I suppose we are to pay you the dollars there, or\r\nother money of equal value, estimated by the par of the metals. Such\r\nhas, accordingly, been the practice ever since the close of the war.\r\nYour powers to draw on our bankers in Holland, will leave you the master\r\nof fixing your drafts by this standard.\r\n\r\nThe transactions of Europe are now so interesting, that I should be\r\nobliged to you, every week, to put the Leyden gazettes of the week under\r\ncover to me; and put them into such ship’s bag as shall be first coming\r\nto any port north of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay’s death is just made known to us, and measures are taking in\r\nconsequence of it.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the newspapers, a remarkable fall in the price of\r\nour public paper. This is owing chiefly to the extraordinary demand for\r\nthe produce of our country, and a temporary scarcity of cash to purchase\r\nit. The merchants holding public paper are obliged to part with it at\r\nany price, to raise money.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVIII.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, March 21, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 21, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe death of Admiral Paul Jones first, and afterwards of Mr. Barclay,\r\nto whom the mission to Algiers, explained in the enclosed papers, was\r\nsuccessively confided, have led the President to desire you to undertake\r\nthe execution of it in person. These papers, being copies of what had\r\nbeen delivered to them, will serve as your guide. But Mr. Barclay having\r\nbeen also charged with a mission to Morocco, it will be necessary to\r\ngive you some trouble with respect to that also.\r\n\r\nMr. Nathaniel Cutting, the bearer hereof, is despatched specially, first\r\nto receive from Mr. Pinckney in London any papers or information, which\r\nhis agency in the Algerine business may have enabled him to communicate\r\nto you: he will then proceed to deliver the whole to you, and accompany\r\nand aid you in the character of secretary.\r\n\r\nIt is thought necessary that you should, in the first instance, settle\r\nMr. Barclay’s accounts respecting the Morocco mission, which will\r\nprobably render it necessary that you should go to Gibraltar. The\r\ncommunications you have had with Mr. Barclay in this mission, will\r\nassist you in your endeavors at a settlement. You know the sum received\r\nby Mr. Barclay on that account, and we wish as exact a statement as can\r\nbe made of the manner in which it has been laid out, and what part of\r\nits proceeds is now on hand. You will be pleased to make an inventory of\r\nthese proceeds now existing. If they or any part of them can be used for\r\nthe Algerine mission, we would have you by all means apply them to that\r\nuse, debiting the Algerine fund and crediting that of Morocco with the\r\namount of such application. If they cannot be so used, then dispose of\r\nthe perishable articles to the best advantage, and if you can sell those\r\nnot perishable for what they cost, do so, and what you cannot so sell,\r\ndeposite in any safe place under your own power. In this last stage of\r\nthe business, return us an exact account, 1. Of the specific articles\r\nremaining on hand for that mission, and their value. 2. Of its cash on\r\nhand. 3. Of any money which may be due to or from Mr. Barclay or any\r\nother person on account of this mission: and take measures for replacing\r\nthe clear balance of cash in the hands of Messrs. W. and J. Willincks,\r\nand Nicholas and Jacob Van Staphorsts and Hubard.\r\n\r\nThis matter being settled, you will be pleased to proceed on the mission\r\nto Algiers. This you will do by the way of Madrid, if you think any\r\ninformation you can get from Mr. Carmichael or any other, may be\r\nequivalent for the trouble, expense, and delay of the journey. If not\r\nproceed in whatever other way you please to Algiers.\r\n\r\nProper powers and credentials for you, addressed to that government, are\r\nherewith enclosed. The instructions first given to Admiral Paul Jones\r\nare so full that no others need be added, except a qualification in one\r\nsingle article, to wit: should that government finally reject peace on\r\nthe terms in money, to which you are authorized to go, you may offer to\r\nmake the first payments for peace and that for ransom in naval stores,\r\nreserving the right to make the subsequent annual payments in money.\r\n\r\nYou are to be allowed your travelling expenses, your salary as minister\r\nresident in Portugal going on. Those expenses must be debited to\r\nthe Algerine mission, and not carried into your ordinary account as\r\nresident. Mr. Cutting is allowed one hundred dollars a month and his\r\nexpenses, which, as soon as he joins you, will of course be consolidated\r\nwith yours. We have made choice of him as particularly qualified to aid,\r\nunder your direction, in the matters of account, with which he is well\r\nacquainted. He receives here an advance of one thousand dollars, by a\r\ndraft on our bankers in Holland, in whose hands the fund is deposited.\r\nThis, and all other sums furnished him, to be debited to the Algerine\r\nfund. I enclose you a letter to our bankers giving you complete\r\nauthority over these funds, which you had better send with your first\r\ndraft, though I send a copy of it from hence by another opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis business being done, you will be pleased to return to Lisbon, and\r\nto keep yourself and us, thereafter, well informed of the transactions\r\nin Morocco; and as soon as you shall find that the succession to\r\nthat government is settled and stable, so that we may know to whom a\r\ncommissioner may be addressed, be so good as to give us the information,\r\nthat we may take measures in consequence.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIX.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, March 22, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 22, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters from No. 60 to 67,\r\ninclusive. You cannot be too vigilant against any such treaty as that\r\nmentioned in No. 60, which by giving the exclusive supply of wheat to\r\nNaples, would altogether debar the United States from it. This would\r\nbear so hard on us, that not only an exclusion of their wines from\r\nthe United States ought to be expected on their part, but every other\r\nmeasure which might open to us a market in any other part of the world,\r\nhowever Portugal might be affected by it. And I must for ever repeat it,\r\nthat, instead of excluding our wheat, we must continue to hope that they\r\nwill open their ports to our flour, and that you will continue to use\r\nyour efforts, on every good occasion, to obtain this without waiting for\r\na treaty.\r\n\r\nAs there appears at present a probability of a very general war in\r\nEurope, you will be pleased to be particularly attentive to preserve for\r\nour vessels all the rights of neutrality, and to endeavor that our flag\r\nbe not usurped by others to procure to themselves the benefits of our\r\nneutrality. This usurpation tends to commit us with foreign nations, to\r\nsubject those vessels truly ours to rigorous scrutinies and delays\r\nto distinguish them from counterfeits, and to take the business of\r\ntransportation out of our hands.\r\n\r\nContinue, if you please, your intelligence relative to the affairs of\r\nSpain, from whence we learn nothing but through you: to which it will be\r\nacceptable that you add any leading events from other countries, as\r\nwe have several times received important facts through you, even from\r\nLondon, sooner than they have come from London directly.\r\n\r\nThe letters enclosed for Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Short are of a very\r\nsecret nature. If you go by Madrid, you will be the bearer of them\r\nyourself; if not, it would be better to retain them than to send them\r\nby any conveyance which does not command your entire confidence. I have\r\nnever yet had a letter from Mr. Carmichael but the one you brought from\r\nMadrid. A particular circumstance will occasion forbearance yet a little\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cutting will bring you a copy of the laws of the last session of\r\nCongress, and of the gazettes to the time of his departure.\r\n\r\nNot yet knowing the actual arrival of Mr. Church at Lisbon, I believe\r\nit will be safer that I direct letters for you, during your absence, to\r\nMessrs. Bulkeley and son, with whom you will leave what directions on\r\nthe subject you shall think proper.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXL.*--TO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT, March 23, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 23, 1793.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nIt is intimated to us in such a way as to attract our attention,\r\nthat France means to send a strong force early this spring to offer\r\nindependence to the Spanish American colonies, beginning with those on\r\nthe Mississippi; and that she will not object to the receiving those\r\non the east side into our confederation. Interesting considerations\r\nrequire, that we should keep ourselves free to act in this case\r\naccording to circumstances, and consequently, that you should not, by\r\nany clause of treaty, bind us to guaranty any of the Spanish colonies\r\nagainst their own independence, nor indeed against any other nation.\r\nFor when we thought we might guaranty Louisiana, on their ceding the\r\nFloridas to us, we apprehended it would be seized by Great Britain, who\r\nwould thus completely encircle us with her colonies and fleets. This\r\ndanger is now removed by the concert between Great Britain and Spain;\r\nand the times will soon enough give independence, and consequently free\r\ncommerce to our neighbors, without our risking the involving ourselves\r\nin a war for them.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect and esteem, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n** The above meets the approbation of George Washington.\r\n\r\n     [* This letter was in cipher, but a literal copy of it\r\n     preserved.]\r\n\r\n     [** This is in the hand-writing of General Washington.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLI.--TO MR. HAMMOND, April 18, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 18, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have now the honor to enclose you the answer of the Attorney General\r\nto my letter covering yours of March the 12th, on the case of Hooper and\r\nPagan, wherein he has stated the proceedings of Pagan for obtaining a\r\nwrit of error from the Supreme Court of the United States, for revisal\r\nof the judgment of the inferior court pronounced against him; and, also,\r\nhis opinion on the merits of the question, had the writ of error been\r\nprocured, and the merits thereby been brought into question. From this\r\nstatement you will be able to judge whether Pagan has, _bonâ fide_,\r\ncomplied with the rule which requires that a foreigner, before he\r\napplies for extraordinary interposition, should use his best endeavors\r\nto obtain the justice he claims from the ordinary tribunals of the\r\ncountry. You will perceive also, that had the writ been pressed for and\r\nobtained, and the substantial justice of Pagan’s claim thereby brought\r\ninto discussion, substantial justice would have been against him,\r\naccording to the opinion of the Attorney General, according to the\r\nuniform decisions of the courts of the United States, even in the cases\r\nof their own citizens, and according to the decision of this very case\r\nin the British provincial court, where the evidence was taken and the\r\ntrial first had. This does not appear then to be one of those cases of\r\ngross and palpable wrong, ascribable only to wickedness of the heart,\r\nand not to error of the head, in the judges who have decided on it,\r\nand founding a claim of national satisfaction. At least, that it is so,\r\nremains yet to be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which the government of the United States has entered\r\ninto inquiries concerning the case of Mr. Pagan, even before that case\r\nwas ripe for their interposition, according to ordinary rules, will, I\r\nhope, satisfy you that they would, with equal readiness, have done for\r\nthe redress of his case whatever the laws and constitution would have\r\npermitted them to do, had it appeared in the result that their courts\r\nhad been guilty of partiality or other gross wrong against Mr. Pagan.\r\nOn the contrary, it is hoped, that the marked attentions which have been\r\nshown to him by the government of Massachusetts, as well as by that of\r\nthe United States, have evinced, the most scrupulous dispositions to\r\npatronize and effectuate his right, had right been on his side.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with due respect, Sir, your most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The letter of the Attorney General, referred to in the\r\n     preceding.]\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 12, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYou will perceive from the two letters marked A. and B. of which I\r\nenclose copies, that the subject of Mr. Pagan has been for some time\r\nin my view. The former of those letters being intended for you, and\r\ncontaining a summary of facts, I determined to show it to Mr. Tilghman,\r\nwho was Pagan’s counsel, before it was sent to you, in order that he\r\nmight correct any misstatement. This produced the latter letter from him\r\nto me; and I have thought it more advisable to forward both of them to\r\nyou even in the unfinished state of my own, than to reduce the case into\r\na form which might be supposed to be less accurate.\r\n\r\nAs I do not discover an essential difference between Mr. Tilghman and\r\nmyself, I shall not discuss any seeming variance, but proceed upon his\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nIt is too obvious to require a diffusive exposition, that the\r\napplication for a writ of error was not only prudent, but a duty in\r\nPagan. To this Mr. Tilghman explicitly assents, when he says, that he\r\nwas perfectly ‘satisfied of the prudence of applying for the writ of\r\nerror, as Pagan could not complain of a defect of justice, until he had\r\ntried the writ of error and found that mode ineffectual.’ This remark\r\nbecomes the more important, as it manifests that the process was not\r\nsuggested as an expedient for shifting any burthen from the government.\r\nIndeed I may with truth add, that the proceedings, taken collectively,\r\nappeared to me to present a sufficient intimation of the main question,\r\nto serve as a ground of decision.\r\n\r\nHowever, take the case under either aspect; as excluding the\r\nconsideration of the main question by an omission in the pleadings and\r\nrecord; or as exhibiting it fully to the cognizance of the court.\r\n\r\nIt never was pretended that a writ of error ought to have been granted,\r\nunless the matter was apparent on the record. Whose office was it to\r\nmake it thus apparent. Of the attorney who managed the pleadings. If,\r\ntherefore, he has failed to do so, we may presume that he considered the\r\nground untenable, or was guilty of inattention. Either presumption\r\nwould be fatal to a citizen of the United States; and the condition of a\r\nforeigner cannot create a new measure in the administration of justice.\r\nIt is moreover certain, that those who have been consulted on Pagan’s\r\nbehalf, as well as others, have seriously doubted whether a cause,\r\nwhich has been pursued to the extent which his had reached before the\r\ncommencement of our new government, was susceptible of federal relief.\r\n\r\nThe last observation opens the inquiry, what remedy ought the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States to have administered, even if the question\r\nhad been fairly before them? My opinion is, that the very merits are\r\nagainst Mr. Pagan. In America, the construction of the armistice has\r\nbeen almost universally to compute the places, within which different\r\ntimes were to prevail, by latitude only. Am I misinformed, that such\r\nan interpretation has been pressed by our ministers, and not denied by\r\nthose of London? A second mode has been adopted, by describing a circle,\r\nand thereby comprehending longitude as well as latitude: now let either\r\nrule be adopted, and the position of the capture in this case will be\r\nadverse to Pagan’s pretensions.\r\n\r\nBut what can be exacted from our government, after repeated trials,\r\nbefore various jurisdictions, none of which can be charged with any\r\nsymptom of impropriety, and upon a subject, which, to say no more, is at\r\nleast equipoised? Nothing; and I appeal to the British reasoning on the\r\nSilesia loan, as supporting this sentiment, in the following passage.\r\n‘The law of nations, founded upon justice, equity, convenience, and\r\nthe reason of the thing, and confirmed by long usage, does not allow of\r\nreprisals, except in case of violent injuries directed and supported by\r\nthe State, and justice absolutely denied, in _re minime dubid_, by all\r\nthe tribunals, and afterwards by the prince.’ Where the judges are\r\nleft free, and give sentence according to their consciences, ‘though\r\nit should be erroneous, that would be no ground for reprisals. Upon\r\ndoubtful questions, different men think and judge differently; and all a\r\nfriend can desire is, that justice should be as impartially administered\r\nto him, as it is to the subjects of that prince, in whose courts the\r\nmatter is tried.’ Under such circumstances, a citizen must acquiesce. So\r\ntherefore must Pagan; against whom even the court of Nova Scotia, within\r\nthe dominions of his sovereign, has once decided.\r\n\r\nThere are many smaller points, arising from the controversy, which might\r\nbe relied on. But I pass them over, from a hope that the observations\r\nalready made will induce you to think with me, that government is not\r\nbound to interpose farther in the behalf of Pagan. I have the honor,\r\nSir, to be, with respect and esteem, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEdmond Randolph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLII.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, April 20, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 20, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn a postscript to my letter of the 12th, I acknowledged the receipt\r\nof yours of January the 3rd; since which, those of January the 30th and\r\nFebruary the 5th have been received by the William Penn.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our negotiation with Mr. Hammond, it is exactly in the\r\nstate in which it was when you left America, not one single word having\r\nbeen received in reply to my general answer, of which you had a copy. He\r\nsays, he waits for instructions, which he pretends to expect from packet\r\nto packet. But sometimes the ministers are all in the country, sometimes\r\nthey are absorbed in negotiations nearer home, sometimes it is the hurry\r\nof impending war, or attention to other objects, the stock of which is\r\ninexhaustible, and can therefore never fail those who desire nothing but\r\nthat things shall rest as they are. Perhaps, however, the present times\r\nmay hasten justice.\r\n\r\nWe shall be glad to receive the assayer you hope to procure, as soon as\r\npossible, for we cannot get one in this country equal to the business\r\nin all its parts. With respect to Mr. Droz, we retain the same desire to\r\nengage him, but we are forced to require an immediate decision, as the\r\nofficer employed in the interim, and who does tolerably well, will not\r\ncontinue much longer under an uncertainty of permanent employment.\r\nI must therefore desire you to press Mr. Morris to bring Droz to an\r\nimmediate determination; and we place the matter on this ground with\r\nhim, that if he is not embarked by the first day of July next, we shall\r\ngive a permanent commission to the present officer, and be free to\r\nreceive no other. We are likely to be in very great distress for copper\r\nfor the mint, and must therefore press your expediting what we desired\r\nyou to order from Sweden.\r\n\r\nYou may, on every occasion, give assurances which cannot go beyond\r\nthe real desires of this country, to preserve a fair neutrality in\r\nthe present war, on condition that the rights of neutral nations are\r\nrespected in us, as they have been settled in modern times, either by\r\nthe express declarations of the powers of Europe, or their adoption of\r\nthem on particular occasions. From our treaties with France and Holland,\r\nand that of England and France, a very clear and simple line of conduct\r\ncan be marked out for us, and I think we are not unreasonable in\r\nexpecting that England shall recognise towards us the same principles\r\nwhich she has stipulated to recognise towards France, in a state of\r\nneutrality.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIII.--CIRCULAR TO MORRIS, PINCKNEY, AND SHORT, April 26,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR TO MESSRS. MORRIS, PINCKNEY, AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 26,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe public papers giving us reason to believe that the war is becoming\r\nnearly general in Europe, and that it has already involved nations with\r\nwhich we are in daily habits of commerce and friendship, the President\r\nhas thought it proper to issue the proclamation of which I enclose you a\r\ncopy, in order to mark out to our citizens the line of conduct they\r\nare to pursue. That this intimation, however, might not work to their\r\nprejudice, by being produced against them as conclusive evidence of\r\ntheir knowledge of the existence of war and of the nations engaged in\r\nit, in any case where they might be drawn into courts of justice for\r\nacts done without that knowledge, it has been thought necessary to write\r\nto the representatives of the belligerent powers here, the letter\r\nof which a copy is also enclosed, reserving to our citizens those\r\nimmunities to which they are entitled, till authentic information\r\nshall be given to our government by the parties at war, and be thus\r\ncommunicated, with due certainty, to our citizens. You will be pleased\r\nto present to the government where you reside this proceeding of the\r\nPresident, as a proof of the earnest desire of the United States to\r\npreserve peace and friendship with all the belligerent powers, and to\r\nexpress his expectation that they will in return extend a scrupulous and\r\neffectual protection to all our citizens, wheresoever they may need it,\r\nin pursuing their lawful and peaceable concerns with their subjects, or\r\nwithin their jurisdiction. You will, at the same time, assure them, that\r\nthe most exact reciprocation of this benefit shall be practised by us\r\ntowards their subjects, in the like cases.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect. Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIV.--TO M. DE TERNANT, April 27,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 27,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 13th instant, asking monies to answer the expenses\r\nand salaries of the consular offices of France, has been duly laid\r\nbefore the President, and his directions thereon taken.\r\n\r\nI have in consequence to observe to you, that before the new government\r\nof France had time to attend to things on this side the Atlantic, and\r\nto provide a deposite of money for the purposes here, there appeared a\r\ndegree of necessity that we, as the friends and debtors of that nation,\r\nshould keep their affairs from suffering, by furnishing money for urgent\r\npurposes. This obliged us to take on ourselves to judge of the\r\npurpose, because on the soundness of that, we were to depend for our\r\njustification. Hence we furnished monies for their colonies and their\r\nagents here, without express authority, judging from the importance and\r\nnecessity of the case, that they would approve of our interference.\r\n\r\nBut this kind of necessity is now at an end: the government has\r\nestablished a deposite of money in the hands of their minister here, and\r\nwe have nothing now to do but to furnish the money, which we are in the\r\ncourse of doing, without looking into the purposes to which it is to be\r\napplied. Their Minister is to be the judge of these, and to pay it to\r\nwhom and for what he pleases.\r\n\r\nIf it be urged that they have appropriated all the money we are\r\nfurnishing, to other objects, and that you are not authorized to divert\r\nany of it to any other purpose, and therefore that you need a further\r\nsum, it may be answered, that it will not lessen the stretch of\r\nauthority to add an unauthorized payment by us to an unauthorized\r\napplication by you; and that it seems fitter that their Minister should\r\nexercise a discretion over their appropriations, standing as he does in\r\na place of confidence, authority, and responsibility, than we who\r\nare strangers and unamenable to them. It is a respect we owe to their\r\nauthority, to leave to those acting under that the transaction of their\r\naffairs, without an intermeddling on our part, which might justly appear\r\nofficious.\r\n\r\nIn this light I hope you will view our conduct, and that the consular\r\nofficers will be sensible, that in referring them to your care, under\r\nwhich the national authority has placed them, we do but con-form\r\nourselves to that authority.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect and esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLV.--TO M. DE TERNANT, May 3,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 3,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty has represented to\r\nthe government of the United States, that on the 25th of April last, the\r\nBritish ship Grange, while lying at anchor in the bay of the Delaware,\r\nwithin the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, was taken\r\npossession of by the Embuscade, a frigate of the French republic, has\r\nbeen brought to this port, where she is now detained as prize and the\r\ncrew as prisoners, and has made a requisition in form, for a restoration\r\nof the vessel and liberation of the crew. I have the honor to furnish\r\nyou with copies of the evidence given in by the British Minister, and to\r\nobserve, that the United States, being at peace with all parties, cannot\r\nsee with indifference its territory or jurisdiction violated by either;\r\nthat the government will therefore proceed to inquire into the facts,\r\nand for that purpose will receive with pleasure, and consider with\r\nimpartiality, any evidence you will be pleased to have them furnished\r\nwith on the subject: and the President hopes that you will take\r\neffectual measures for detaining here the vessel taken, her crew and\r\ncargo, to abide the decision which will be made thereon, and which is\r\ndesired to be without delay.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVI.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, May 7, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 7, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince my letter of April the 16th, yours have been received of March the\r\n12th, 12th, 13th, 13th, and 19th. Before the receipt of these, one of\r\nwhich covered the form of your passports, it had been determined here,\r\nthat passports should be issued in our own ports only, as well to\r\nsecure us against those collusions which would be fraudulent towards\r\nour friends, and would, introduce a competition injurious to our own\r\nvessels, as to induce these to remain in our own service, and thereby\r\ngive to the productions of our own soil the protection of its own flag\r\nin its passage to foreign markets. As our citizens are free to purchase\r\nand use foreign-built vessels, and these, like all their other lawful\r\nproperty, are entitled to the protection of their government, passports\r\nwill be issued to them as freely as to home-built vessels. This is\r\nstrictly within our treaties, the letter of which, as well as their\r\nspirit, authorizes passports to all vessels belonging to citizens of\r\nthe United States. Our laws, indeed, indulge home-built vessels with the\r\npayment of a lower tonnage, and to evidence their right to this, permit\r\nthem alone to take out registers from our own offices, but they do\r\nnot exclude foreign-built vessels owned by our citizens from any other\r\nright. As our home-built vessels are adequate to but a small proportion\r\nof our transportation, if we could not suddenly augment the stock of our\r\nshipping, our produce would be subject to war-insurance in the vessels\r\nof the belligerent powers, though we remain at peace ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn one of your letters of March the 13th, you express your apprehension\r\nthat some of the belligerent powers may stop our vessels going with\r\ngrain to the ports of their enemies, and ask instructions which may meet\r\nthe question in various points of view, intending, however, in the\r\nmean time, to contend for the amplest freedom of neutral nations. Your\r\nintention in this is perfectly proper, and coincides with the ideas of\r\nour own government in the particular case you put, as in general cases.\r\nSuch a stoppage to an unblockaded port would be so unequivocal an\r\ninfringement of the neutral rights, that we cannot conceive it will\r\nbe attempted. With respect to our conduct, as a neutral nation, it\r\nis marked out in our treaties with France and Holland, two of the\r\nbelligerent powers: and as the duties of neutrality require an equal\r\nconduct to both parties, we should, on that ground, act on the same\r\nprinciples towards Great Britain. We presume that this would be\r\nsatisfactory to her, because of its equality, and because she too has\r\nsanctioned the same principles in her treaty with France. Even our\r\nseventeenth article with France, which might be disagreeable, as from\r\nits nature it is unequal, is adopted exactly by Great Britain in her\r\nfortieth article with the same power, and would have laid her, in a like\r\ncase, under the same unequal obligations against us. We wish then, that\r\nit could be arranged with Great Britain, that our treaties with France\r\nand Holland, and that of France and Great Britain (which agree in what\r\nrespects neutral nations), should form the line of conduct for us all,\r\nin the present war, in the cases for which they provide. Where they are\r\nsilent, the general principles of the law of nations must give the rule,\r\nas the principles of that law have been liberalized in latter times by\r\nthe refinement of manners and morals, and evidenced by the declarations,\r\nstipulations, and practice of every civilized nation. In our treaty\r\nwith Prussia, indeed, we have gone ahead of other nations, in doing\r\naway restraints on the commerce of peaceful nations, by declaring that\r\nnothing shall be contraband. For in truth, in the present improved state\r\nof the arts, when every country has such ample means of procuring arms\r\nwithin and without itself, the regulations of contraband answer no other\r\nend than to draw other nations into the war. However, as other nations\r\nhave not given sanction to this improvement, we claim it, at present,\r\nwith Prussia alone.\r\n\r\nYou are desired to persevere till you obtain a regulation to guard our\r\nvessels from having their hands impressed, and to inhibit the British\r\nnavy-officers from taking them under the pretext of their being British\r\nsubjects. There appears but one practicable rule, that the vessel\r\nbeing American, shall be conclusive evidence that the hands are so to\r\na certain number, proportioned to her tonnage. Not more than one or two\r\nofficers should be permitted to visit a vessel. Mr. Albion Coxe has just\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVII.--TO MR. HAMMOND, May 15, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour several memorials of the 8th instant have been laid before the\r\nPresident, as had been that of the 2nd, as soon as received. They have\r\nbeen considered with all the attention and the impartiality, which\r\na firm determination to do what is equal and right between all the\r\nbelligerent powers could inspire.\r\n\r\nIn one of these, you communicate, on the information of the British\r\nConsul at Charleston, that the Consul of France at the same place\r\nhad condemned, as legal prize, a British vessel, captured by a French\r\nfrigate, and you justly add, that this judicial act is not warranted\r\nby the usage of nations, nor by the stipulations existing between the\r\nUnited States and France. I observe further, that it is not warranted by\r\nany law of the land. It is consequently a mere nullity; as such it can\r\nbe respected in no court, can make no part in the title to the vessel,\r\nnor give to the purchaser any other security than what he would have\r\nhad without it. In short, it is so absolutely nothing, as to give no\r\nfoundation of just concern to any person interested in the fate of the\r\nvessel; and in this point of view, Sir, I am in hopes you will see it.\r\nThe proceeding, indeed, if the British Consul has been rightly informed\r\n(and we have no other information of it), has been an act of\r\ndisrespect towards the United States, to which its government cannot\r\nbe inattentive: a just sense of our own rights and duties, and the\r\nobviousness of the principle, are a security that no inconveniences will\r\nbe permitted to arise from repetitions of it.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of arms and military accoutrements by an agent of the\r\nFrench government, in this country, with an intent to expert them to\r\nFrance, is the subject of another of the memorials. Of this fact we are\r\nequally uninformed as of the former. Our citizens have been always\r\nfree to make, vend, and export arms. It is the constant occupation and\r\nlivelihood of some of them. To suppress their callings, the only means\r\nperhaps of their subsistence, because a war exists in foreign and\r\ndistant countries, in which we have no concern, would scarcely be\r\nexpected. It would be hard in principle, and impossible in practice. The\r\nlaw of nations, therefore, respecting the rights of those at peace, does\r\nnot require from them such an internal derangement in their occupations.\r\nIt is satisfied with the external penalty pronounced in the President’s\r\nproclamation, that of confiscation of such portion of these arms as\r\nshall fall into the hands of any of the belligerent powers on their way\r\nto the ports of their enemies. To this penalty our citizens are warned\r\nthat they will be abandoned; and that even private contraventions may\r\nwork no inequality between the parties at war, the benefits of them will\r\nbe left equally free and open to all.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the British ship Grange by the French frigate L’Embuscade\r\nhas on inquiry been found to have taken place within the bay of Delaware\r\nand jurisdiction of the United States, as stated in your memorial of\r\nthe 2nd instant. The government is, therefore, taking measures for the\r\nliberation of the crew and restitution of the ship and cargo.’\r\n\r\nIt condemns, in the highest degree, the conduct of any of our citizens\r\nwho may personally engage in committing hostilities at sea against any\r\nof the nations, parties to the present war, and will exert all the means\r\nwith which the laws and constitution have armed them to discover such\r\nas offend herein, and bring them to condign punishment. Of these\r\ndispositions I am authorized to give assurances to all the parties,\r\nwithout reserve. Our real friendship for them all, our desire to\r\npursue ourselves the path of peace, as the only one leading surely to\r\nprosperity, and our wish to preserve the morals of our citizens from\r\nbeing vitiated by courses of lawless plunder and murder, may assure you\r\nthat our proceedings, in this respect, will be with good faith, fervor,\r\nand vigilance. Instructions are consequently given to the proper law\r\nofficer, to institute such proceedings as the laws will justify,\r\nfor apprehending and punishing certain individuals of our citizens,\r\nsuggested to have been concerned in enterprises of this kind, as\r\nmentioned in one of your memorials of the 8th instant.\r\n\r\nThe practice of commissioning, equipping, and manning vessels in our\r\nports, to cruise on any of the belligerent parties, is equally and\r\nentirely disapproved; and the government will take effectual measures to\r\nprevent a repetition of it. The remaining point in the same memorial is\r\nreserved for further consideration.\r\n\r\nI trust, Sir, that in the readiness with which the United States\r\nhave attended to the redress of such wrongs as are committed by their\r\ncitizens, or within their jurisdiction, you will see proofs of their\r\njustice and impartiality to all parties; and that it will insure to\r\ntheir citizens pursuing their lawful business by sea or by land, in all\r\nparts of the world, a like efficacious interposition of governing powers\r\nto protect them from injury, and redress it, where it has taken place.\r\nWith such dispositions on both sides, vigilantly and faithfully carried\r\ninto effect, we may hope that the blessings of peace, on the one part,\r\nwill be as little impaired, and the evils of war, on the other, as\r\nlittle aggravated, as the nature of things will permit; and that this\r\nshould be so, is, we trust, the prayer of all.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVIII.*--TO M. DE TERNANT, May 15, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHaving received several memorials from the British Minister on subjects\r\narising out of the present war, I take the liberty of enclosing them\r\nto you, and shall add an explanation of the determinations of the\r\ngovernment thereon. These will serve to indicate the principles on which\r\nit is meant to proceed; and which are to be applied, with impartiality,\r\nto the proceedings of both parties. They will form, therefore, as far as\r\nthey go, a rule of action for them and for us.\r\n\r\nIn one of these memorials, it is stated, that arms and military\r\naccoutrements are now buying up by a French agent in this country, with\r\nan intent to export them to France. We have answered, &c.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAnother of these memorials complains that the Consul of France at\r\nCharleston, has condemned, as legal prize, a British vessel captured by\r\na French frigate, observing that this judicial act is not warranted by\r\nthe usage of nations nor by the stipulations existing between the United\r\nStates and France. It is true, &c.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nOur information is not perfect on the subject matter of another of these\r\nmemorials, which states that a vessel has been fitted out at Charleston,\r\nmanned there, and partly too with citizens of the United States,\r\nreceived a commission there to cruise against nations at peace with us,\r\nand has taken and sent a British vessel into this port. Without taking\r\nall these facts for granted, we have not hesitated to express our\r\nhighest disapprobation of the conduct of any of our citizens who may\r\npersonally engage in committing hostilities at sea against any of the\r\nnations, parties to the present war, and to declare, that if the case\r\nhas happened, or that should it happen, we will exert all the measures\r\nwith which the laws and constitution have armed us, to discover such\r\noffenders and bring them to condign punishment. And that the like\r\nconduct shall be observed, should the like enterprises be attempted\r\nagainst your nation, I am authorized to give you the most unreserved\r\nassurances.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the British ship Grange, by the French frigate\r\nL’Embuscade, within the Delaware, has been the subject of a former\r\nletter to you. On full and mature consideration, the government deems\r\nthe capture to have been unquestionably within its jurisdiction, and\r\nthat according to the rules of neutrality and the protection it owes to\r\nall persons while within its limits, it is bound to see that the crew be\r\nliberated, and the vessel and cargo restored to their former owners.\r\nThe Attorney General of the United States has made a statement of the\r\ngrounds of this determination, a copy of which I have the honor to\r\nenclose you. I am, in consequence, charged by the President of the\r\nUnited States to express to you his expectation, and at the same time\r\nhis confidence that you will be pleased to take immediate and effectual\r\nmeasures for having the ship Grange and her cargo restored to the\r\nBritish owners, and the persons taken on board her set at liberty.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded, Sir, you will be sensible, on mature consideration, that\r\nin forming these determinations, the government of the United States has\r\nlistened to nothing but the dictates of immutable justice: they consider\r\nthe rigorous exercise of that virtue as the surest means of preserving\r\nperfect harmony between the United States and the powers at war.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n[* The parts of this letter which are mere repetitions of what is\r\ncontained in the preceding, to the British Minister, are omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIX.--TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, May 21,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 21,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have been duly honored with your favor of May the 8th, covering the\r\nletter of Mr. Newton, and that of May the 13th, with the letter of the\r\nBritish Consul at Norfolk and the information of Henry Tucker, all of\r\nwhich have been laid before the President.\r\n\r\nThe putting the several harbors of the United States into a state of\r\ndefence, having never yet been the subject of deliberation and decision\r\nwith the legislature, and consequently, the necessary monies not having\r\nbeen appropriated or levied, the President does not find himself in a\r\nsituation competent to comply with the proposition on the subject of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\nMr. Newton supposes, that by the treaties with France and Holland,\r\nthose powers are authorized to arm vessels within our ports. A careful\r\nexamination of the treaties will show, however, that no such permission\r\nhas been stipulated therein. Measures are accordingly taken to correct\r\nthis error as to the past, and others will be taken to prevent a\r\nrepetition of it. Proceedings are ordered against Mr. Hooper and other\r\nAmerican citizens who have participated in any hostilities against\r\nnations at peace with the United States, and circular instructions are\r\ngiven to the District Attorneys of the United States, to institute like\r\nprosecutions in all future similar cases. The bringing vessels to, of\r\nwhatever nation, while within the limits of the protection of the\r\nUnited States, will be pointedly forbidden; the government being firmly\r\ndetermined to enforce a peaceable demeanor among all the parties within\r\nthose limits, and to deal to all the same impartial measure. I have\r\nthe honor to be, with the most perfect respect, your Excellency’s most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CL.--TO MR.

VAN BERCKEL.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 29,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am favored with your note of the 22nd instant, stating that under\r\ncircumstances of invasion and urgent danger, their High Mightinesses,\r\nthe States General of the United Netherlands, had found it necessary to\r\nlay an embargo on all vessels in their ports, and that an American ship,\r\nthe Hope, being involved in this general order, the master had claimed\r\nan exemption under the eighth article of our treaty, which it had been\r\nnecessary to refuse him.\r\n\r\nI have laid this note before the President of the United States, and\r\nhave it in charge from him to assure you, that the United States having\r\nthe utmost confidence in the sincerity and good faith with which their\r\nHigh Mightinesses will observe the treaty between the two countries,\r\nfeel no dissatisfaction at the circumstance mentioned in your note. They\r\nare sensible that in human affairs, there are moments of difficulty and\r\nnecessity, to which it is the office of friendship to accommodate its\r\nstrict rights.\r\n\r\nThe President considers the explanation, which their High Mightinesses\r\nhave instructed you to give of this incident, as a proof of their desire\r\nto cultivate harmony and good understanding with these United States,\r\nand charges me to assure you that he has nothing more at heart than to\r\nconvince their High Mightinesses of the same amicable sentiments on the\r\npart of this country, and of the certainty with which they may count on\r\nits justice and friendship on every occasion.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLI.--TO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT, May 31, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 31, 1793.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nIn my letters of October the 14th and November the 3rd, 1792, I\r\ncommunicated to you papers and observations on the conduct of the\r\nSpanish officers on our southwestern frontier, and particularly of the\r\nBaron de Carondelet, the Governor of New Orleans. These made it evident\r\nthat he had industriously excited the southern Indians to war against\r\nus, and had furnished them with arms and ammunition in abundance, for\r\nthat express purpose. We placed this under the view of the commissioners\r\nof Spain here, who undertook to communicate it to their court, and also\r\nto write on the subject to the Baron de Carondelet. They have lately\r\nmade us communications from both these quarters; the aspect of\r\nwhich, however, is by no means such as to remove the causes of our\r\ndissatisfaction. I send you these commmunications, consisting of\r\ntreaties between Spain, the Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Cherokees,\r\nhanded us by express order from their court, a speech of Jiaron de\r\nCarondelet to the Cherokees, and a letter from Messrs. de Viar and\r\nJaudenes, covering that speech, and containing in itself very serious\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nI will first observe to you, that the question stated in that letter to\r\nhave been proposed to the Cherokees, What part they would take, in the\r\nevent of a war between the United States and Spain was never proposed by\r\nauthority from this government. Its instructions to its agents have, on\r\nthe contrary, been explicitly to cultivate, with good faith, the peace\r\nbetween Spain and the Indians: and from the known prudence and good\r\nconduct of Governor Blount, to whom it is imputed, it is not believed to\r\nhave been proposed by him. This proposition then, you are authorized\r\nto disavow to the court of Madrid, in the most unequivocal terms. With\r\nrespect to the treaties, the speech, and the letter, you will see that\r\nthey undertake to espouse the concerns of Indians within our limits; to\r\nbe mediators of boundary between them and us; to guaranty that boundary\r\nto them; to support them with their whole power; and hazard to us\r\nintimations of acquiescence to avoid disagreeable results. They even\r\npropose to extend their intermeddlings to the northern Indians. These\r\nare pretensions so totally inconsistent with the usages established\r\namong the white nations with respect to Indians living within their\r\nseveral limits, that it is believed no example of them can be produced,\r\nin times of peace; and they are presented to us in a manner which\r\nwe cannot deem friendly. The consequence is, that the Indians, and\r\nparticularly the Creeks, finding themselves so encouraged, have passed,\r\nwithout the least provocation on our part, from a state of peace, which\r\nappeared to be well settled, to that of serious hostility. Their murders\r\nand depredations, which, for some months, we were willing to hope were\r\nonly individual aggressions, now assume the appearance of unequivocal\r\nwar. Yet such is our desire of courting and cultivating the peace of\r\nall our Indian neighbors, that instead of marching at once into their\r\ncountry and taking satisfaction ourselves, we are peaceably requiring\r\npunishment of the individual aggressors; and, in the mean time, are\r\nholding ourselves entirely on the defensive. But this state of things\r\ncannot continue. Our citizens are entitled to effectual protection, and\r\ndefensive measures are, at the same time, the most expensive and\r\nleast effectual. If we find then, that peace cannot be obtained by the\r\ntemperate means we are still pursuing, we must proceed to those which\r\nare extreme, and meet all the consequences, of whatever nature, or from\r\nwhatever quarter, they may be. We have certainly been always desirous to\r\navoid whatever might disturb our harmony with Spain. We should be still\r\nmore so, at a moment when we see that nation making part of so powerful\r\na confederacy as is formed in Europe, and under particular good\r\nunderstanding with England, our other neighbor. In so delicate a\r\nposition, therefore, instead of expressing our sense of these things, by\r\nway of answer to Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes, the President has thought\r\nit better that it should be done to you, and to trust to your discretion\r\nthe moment, the measure, and the form of communicating it to the court\r\nof Madrid. The actual state of Europe at the time you will receive this,\r\nthe solidity of the confederacy, and especially as between Spain and\r\nEngland, the temper and views of the former, or of both, towards us,\r\nthe state of your negotiation, are circumstances which will enable you\r\nbetter to decide how far it may be necessary to soften, or even perhaps\r\nto suppress, the expressions of our sentiments on this subject. To your\r\ndiscretion, therefore, it is committed by the President, to let the\r\ncourt of Spain see how impossible it is for us to submit with folded\r\narms to be butchered by these savages, and to prepare them to view, with\r\na just eye, the more vigorous measures we must pursue to put an end to\r\ntheir atrocities, if the moderate ones we are now taking should fail of\r\nthat effect.\r\n\r\nOur situation on other accounts and in other quarters is critical. The\r\nPresident is, therefore, constantly anxious to know the state of things\r\nwith you: and I entreat you to keep him constantly and well informed.\r\nMr. Yznardi, the younger, lately appointed Consul of the United States,\r\nat Cadiz, may be a convenient channel of forwarding your letters.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Gentlemen, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLII.--TO MR. GENET, June 5,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET, _Minister Plenipotentiary of France_.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 5,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of May the 15th, to M. de Ternant, your predecessor, after\r\nstating the answer which had been given to the several memorials of\r\nthe British Minister, of May the 8th, it was observed that a part\r\nstill remained unanswered of that which respected the fitting out armed\r\nvessels in Charleston, to cruise against nations with whom we are at\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation which I had afterwards the honor of holding with you,\r\nI observed that one of those armed vessels, the Citizen Genet, had come\r\ninto this port with a prize: that the President had thereupon taken\r\nthe case into further consideration, and after mature consultation and\r\ndeliberation, was of opinion, that the arming and equipping vessels in\r\nthe ports of the United States to cruise against nations with whom they\r\nare at peace, was incompatible with the territorial sovereignty of the\r\nUnited States; that it made them instrumental to the annoyance of\r\nthose nations, and thereby tended to compromit their peace; and that he\r\nthought it necessary as an evidence of good faith to them, as well as\r\na proper reparation to the sovereignty of the country, that the armed\r\nvessels of this description should depart from the ports of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the 27th instant, with which you have honored me, has\r\nbeen laid before the President, and that part of it which contains your\r\nobservations on this subject has been particularly attended to. The\r\nrespect due to whatever comes from you, friendship for the French\r\nnation, and justice to all, have induced him to re-examine the subject,\r\nand particularly to give your representations thereon the consideration\r\nthey deservedly claim. After fully weighing again, however, all the\r\nprinciples and circumstances of the case, the result appears still to\r\nbe, that it is the right of every nation to prohibit acts of sovereignty\r\nfrom being exercised by any other within its limits; and the duty of\r\na neutral nation to prohibit such as would injure one of the warring\r\npowers; that the granting military commissions within the United States\r\nby any other authority than their own, is an infringement on their\r\nsovereignty, and particularly so when granted to their own citizens to\r\nlead them to acts contrary to the duties they owe their own country;\r\nthat the departure of vessels thus illegally equipped from the ports of\r\nthe United States, will be but an acknowledgment of respect analogous to\r\nthe breach of it, while it is necessary on their part, as an evidence of\r\ntheir faithful neutrality. On these considerations, Sir, the President\r\nthinks that the United States owe it to themselves and to the nations\r\nin their friendship, to expect this act of reparation on the part of\r\nvessels, marked in their very equipment with offence to the laws of the\r\nland, of which the law of nations makes an integral part.\r\n\r\nThe expressions of friendly sentiments which we have already had the\r\nsatisfaction of receiving from you, leave no room to doubt that, the\r\nconclusion of the President being thus made known to you, these vessels\r\nwill be permitted to give no further umbrage by their presence in the\r\nports of the United States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIII.--TO MR. HAMMOND, June 5, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 5, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn the letter which I had the honor of writing you on the 15th of\r\nMay, in answer to your several memorials of the 8th of that month, I\r\nmentioned that the President reserved for further consideration, a part\r\nof the one which related to the equipment of two privateers in the port\r\nof Charleston. The part alluded to was that wherein you express your\r\nconfidence that the executive government of the United States would\r\npursue measures for repressing such practices in future, and for\r\nrestoring to their rightful owners any captures, which such privateers\r\nmight bring into the ports of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President, after a full investigation of this subject and the most\r\nmature consideration, has charged me to communicate to you, that the\r\nfirst part of this application is found to be just, and that effectual\r\nmeasures are taken for preventing repetitions of the act therein\r\ncomplained of; but that the latter part, desiring restitution of the\r\nprizes, is understood to be inconsistent with the rules which govern\r\nsuch cases, and would, therefore, be unjustifiable towards the other\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe principal agents in this transaction were French citizens. Being\r\nwithin the United States at the moment a war broke out between their\r\nown and another country, they determine to go into its defence;\r\nthey purchase, arm, and equip a vessel with their own money, man it\r\nthemselves, receive a regular commission from their nation, depart\r\nout of the United States, and then commence hostilities by capturing a\r\nvessel, If, under these circumstances, the commission of the captors was\r\nvalid, the property, according to the laws of war, was by the capture\r\ntransferred to them, and it would be an aggression on their nation, for\r\nthe United States to rescue it from them, whether on the high seas or\r\non coming into their ports. If the commission was not valid, and,\r\nconsequently, the property not transferred by the laws of war to the\r\ncaptors, then the case would have been cognizable in our courts of\r\nadmiralty, and the owners might have gone thither for redress. So\r\nthat, on neither supposition, would the executive be justifiable in\r\ninterposing.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the United States, the transaction can be in nowise\r\nimputed to them. It was in the first moment of the war, in one of their\r\nmost distant ports, before measures could be provided by the government\r\nto meet all the cases which such a state of things was to produce,\r\nimpossible to have been known, and, therefore, impossible to have been\r\nprevented by that government.\r\n\r\nThe moment it was known, the most energetic orders were sent to every\r\nState and port of the Union, to prevent a repetition of the accident.\r\nOn a suggestion that citizens of the United States had taken part in\r\nthe act, one, who was designated, was instantly committed to prison, for\r\nprosecution; one or two others have been since named, and committed\r\nin like manner; and should it appear that there were still others, no\r\nmeasure will be spared to bring them to justice. The President has\r\neven gone further. He has required, as a reparation of their breach of\r\nrespect to the United States, that the vessels so armed and equipped,\r\nshall depart from our ports.\r\n\r\nYou will see, Sir, in these proceedings of the President, unequivocal\r\nproofs of the line of strict right which he means to pursue. The\r\nmeasures now mentioned, are taken in justice to the one party; the\r\nulterior measure, of seizing and restoring the prizes, is declined in\r\njustice to the other; and the evil, thus early arrested, will be of very\r\nlimited effects; perhaps, indeed, soon disappear altogether.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIV.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, June 13, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 13, 1793,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt has long since been observed, that of the three millions of livres\r\ngiven by the court of France to aid us in the commencement of our\r\nrevolution, one million was unaccounted for by the hands into which\r\nit was paid. The date of the payment is fixed to have been the 10th of\r\nJune, 1776, but to whom it was paid has never been known. Suspicions\r\nare, that it was to Beaumarchais; and that with this very money he\r\npurchased the supplies furnished us by him, for which large sums have\r\nbeen paid him already, and a further large sum has lately been certified\r\nto be due to him as the balance of the account. I enclose you a letter\r\nfrom the Secretary of the Treasury on this subject, with all the papers\r\nrelative to the same which his office can furnish: and as you are on\r\nthe spot, I must beg the favor of you to make an immediate and thorough\r\ninvestigation of it. No reasons of State can now exist for covering the\r\ntransaction longer under mystery.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The letter of the Secretary of the Treasury, and other papers, relative\r\nto the lost million alluded to in the letter to Mr. Morris.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS--RE THE LOST MILLION, June 10, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasury Department, June 10, 1793. Sir,\r\n\r\nThe comptroller of the Treasury has reported to me, that ‘on examining\r\nthe subsisting contracts between the United States and the government\r\nof France and the Farmers General, and a comparison thereof with\r\nthe foreign accounts and documents transmitted to the Treasury, the\r\nfollowing facts appear.\r\n\r\nThat previous to the treaty of February, 1778, the sum of three millions\r\nof livres had been advanced by the government of France to the agents\r\nof the United States, under the title of gratuitous, for which no\r\nreimbursement was to be made.\r\n\r\nThat the payments, which composed the before-mentioned sum of three\r\nmillions of livres, are stated, in a letter of Mr. Durival to Mr. Grand,\r\ndated in 1786, to have been made at the following periods:\r\n\r\nOne million delivered by the Royal Treasury the 10th of June, 1776, and\r\ntwo other millions advanced also by the Royal Treasury in 1777, on four\r\nreceipts of the Deputies of Congress, of the 17th of January, 3rd of\r\nApril, 10th of June, and 15th of October of the same year.\r\n\r\nIn the account of Mr. Ferdinand Grand, banker of the United States, the\r\nfollowing sums are credited, viz.\r\n\r\n     1777.--January 31, ....   500,000 livres.\r\n     April 26, ......   500,000\r\n     June 4, ........ 1,000,000\r\n     July 3, ........   500,000\r\n     October 10, ....   500,000\r\n\r\n     Amount in the whole, .. 3,000,000 livres.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers General of France claim a large balance from the United\r\nStates, on account of one million of livres which they contend was\r\nadvanced in June, 1777, in consequence of a special contract with\r\nMessrs. Franklin and Deane, to be repaid by the delivery of tobacco at\r\ncertain stipulated prices, and the advance made by the Farmers General\r\nis said to be the same money, as is credited by Mr. Grand on the 4th of\r\nJune, 1777.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful examination of the foreign accounts, it is found that no\r\nmore than three millions of livres have been credited by any agents of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAn opinion was entertained by the late officers of the Treasury, that\r\nthe sum claimed by the Farmers General composed a part of the sum\r\nsupplied as gratuitous aid by the government. Subsequent explanations\r\nhave however rendered it probable, that, including the claim of the\r\nFarmers General, the sum of four millions of livres were in fact\r\nreceived; it is, however, indispensable that it should be known to whom\r\nthe money was paid.\r\n\r\nThe most direct mode of obtaining this information will be, to call for\r\ncopies of the receipts mentioned in Mr. Durival’s letter of 1786, and\r\nmore particularly, a copy of that said to have been given on the 10th of\r\nJune, 1776.’\r\n\r\nAnd as explanatory of the transaction, he has sent me the documents\r\nherewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe most likely conjecture, in my mind, considering the period of\r\nthe advance and the circumstances of that period, is, that the\r\nunaccounted-for million went into the hands of M. de Beaumarchais.\r\nThe supplies which he furnished to the United States exceeded his own\r\nprobable resources, besides the imprudence of having hazarded so much at\r\nthat stage of our affairs upon our ability to pay. And there were many\r\nsymptoms, at the time, of his having been secretly put in motion by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is now become urgent, that the truth of the case should be known. An\r\naccount has recently passed the auditor’s office, admitting in favor of\r\nM. de Beaumarchais a balance of four hundred and twenty-two thousand two\r\nhundred and sixty-five dollars and thirteen cents, with a reservation\r\nonly of the question of the million. If he has received that million,\r\nwhich has been acknowledged as a free gift from the French government,\r\nit is unjust that he should be able to establish a claim against the\r\nUnited States for supplies which must have been the proceeds of that\r\nsum. If he has never received the million, every, day’s suspension of\r\nhis claim, after the immense delays heretofore incurred, is a grievous\r\nhardship upon him. It concerns materially the interests, and more the\r\njustice, the credit, and the character of the United States, that as\r\nspeedy a solution as possible of the enigma may be obtained.\r\n\r\nWith a view to this, I have the honor to make you the present\r\ncommunication, that you may be pleased to take such steps as shall\r\nappear to you the most proper and efficacious to procure, as speedily\r\nas the nature of the case will admit, the requisite explanations. With\r\nrespect, I have the honor to be, &c.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Mr. Grand to ------ ------_\r\n\r\nParis, September 9, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe letter you honored me with, covered the copies of three letters\r\nwhich Mr. Thomson wrote you to obtain an explanation of a million\r\nwhich is not to be found in my accounts. I should have been very much\r\nembarrassed in satisfying him and proving that I had not put that\r\nmillion in my pocket, had I not applied to M. Durival, who, as you will\r\nsee by the answer enclosed, informs me that there was a million paid by\r\nthe Royal Treasury on the 10th of June, 1776. This is the very million\r\nabout which Mr. Thomson inquires, as I have kept an account of the other\r\ntwo millions, which were also furnished by the Royal Treasury, viz.:\r\n\r\nThe million in January and April, 1777; the other in July and October of\r\nthe same year; as well as that furnished by the Farmers General in June,\r\n1777.\r\n\r\nHere then are the three millions, exactly, which were given by the King\r\nbefore the treaty of 1778, and that furnished by the Farmers General.\r\nNothing then remains to be known but who received the first million in\r\nJune, 1776. It could not be by me, who was not charged with the business\r\nof Congress until January, 1777. I therefore requested of M. Durival the\r\ncopy of the receipt for the one million. You have the answer which he\r\nreturned to me. I wrote to him again, renewing my request, but as the\r\ncarrier is just setting off, I cannot wait to give you his answer, but\r\nyou will receive it in my next, if I receive one. In the mean while, I\r\nbeg you will receive the assurances of the sentiments of respect, with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, my Dear Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nGrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Mr. Durival to Mr. Grand_.\r\n\r\nVersailles, August 30, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received the letter which you did me the honor to write the 28th\r\nof this month, touching the advance of a million, which you say was made\r\nby the General Farm to the United States of America, the 3rd of June,\r\n1777. I have no knowledge of that advance. What I have verified is, that\r\nthe King by the contract of the 25th of February, 1783, has confirmed\r\nthe gratuitous gift which his Majesty had previously made of the three\r\nmillions hereafter mentioned, viz:\r\n\r\nOne million delivered by the Royal Treasury the 10th of June, 1776, and\r\ntwo other millions advanced also by the Royal Treasury in 1777, on four\r\nreceipts of the Deputies of Congress of the 17th of January, 3rd\r\nof April, 10th of June, and 15th of October, of the same year. This\r\nexplanation will, Sir, resolve your doubt touching the advance of the\r\n3rd of June, 1777. I farther recommend to you, Sir, to confer on this\r\nsubject with Mr. Gojard, who ought to be better informed than us, who\r\nhave no knowledge of any advances but those made by the Royal Treasury.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nDU RIVAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Postscript from Mr. Grand_.\r\n\r\nParis, September 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nI hazard a letter in hopes it may be able to join that of the 9th,\r\nat L’Orient, in order to forward to you, Sir, the answer I have\r\njust received from Mr. Durival. You will therefore see, Sir, that\r\nnotwithstanding my entreaty, the Minister himself refuses to give me the\r\ncopy of the receipts which I asked for. I cannot conceive the reason for\r\nthis reserve, more especially, since if there has been a million paid,\r\nhe who received it has kept the account, and must in time be known.\r\nI shall hear with pleasure that you have been more fortunate in this\r\nrespect in America than I have been in France, and repeat to you the\r\nassurances of the sentiments of regard, with which I have the honor to\r\nbe, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nGrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Mr. Durival to Mr. Grand_.\r\n\r\nVersailles, September 5, 1786.\r\n\r\nI laid before the Count de Vergennes the two letters which you did me\r\nthe honor, to write, touching the three millions, the free gift of which\r\nthe King has confirmed in favor of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe Minister, Sir, observed, that this gift has nothing to do with the\r\nmillion which Congress may have received from the General Farm,\r\n1777. Consequently he thinks that the receipt which you desire may be\r\ncommunicated to you, cannot satisfy the object of your view, and that it\r\nwould be useless to give you the copy which you desire.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with perfect attachment, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nDurival.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Mr. Durival to Mr. Grand_.\r\n\r\nVersailles, September 10, 1786.\r\n\r\nI have laid before the Count de Vergennes, as you, Sir, seem to desire,\r\nthe letter which you did me the honor to write yesterday. The Minister\r\npersists in the opinion that the receipt, the copy of which you request,\r\nhas no relation to the business with which you are entrusted on behalf\r\nof Congress, and that this price would be useless in the new point of\r\nview in which you have placed it. Indeed, Sir, it is easy for you to\r\nprove that the money in question was not delivered by the Royal Treasury\r\ninto your hands, as you did not begin to be charged with the business of\r\nCongress until January, 1777, and the receipt is of the date of the 10th\r\nof June, 1776.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with perfect attachment, Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nDurival.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a letter from Benjamin Franklin to Mr. Grand, banker at\r\nParis, dated Philadelphia, July the 11th, 1786_.\r\n\r\n‘I send you enclosed some letters that have passed between the Secretary\r\nof Congress and me, respecting three millions of livres acknowledged to\r\nhave been received before the treaty of 1778, as _don gratuit_, from the\r\nKing, of which only two millions are found in your accounts; unless\r\nthe million from the Fanners General be one of the three. I have been\r\nassured that all the money received from the King, whether as loan or\r\ngift, went through your hands; and as I always looked on the million we\r\nhad of the Farmers General to be distinct from what we had of the crown,\r\nI wonder how I came to sign the contract acknowledging three millions\r\nof gift, when in reality there were only two, exclusive of that from\r\nthe Farmers. And as both you and I examined the project of the contract\r\nbefore I signed it, I am surprised that neither of us took notice of\r\nthe error. It is possible that the million furnished ostensibly by the\r\nFarmers, was in fact a gift of the crown, in which case, as Mr. Thomson\r\nobserves, they owe us for the two ship-loads of tobacco they received\r\non account of it. I must earnestly request of you to get this,matter\r\nexplained, that it may stand clear before I die, lest some enemy should\r\nafterwards accuse me of having received a million not accounted for.’\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Dr. Franklin to Charles Thomson_.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 25, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Friend,\r\n\r\nYou may remember that in the correspondence between us in June last, on\r\nthe subject of a million, free gift of the King of France, acknowledged\r\nin our contract to have been received, but which did not appear to be\r\naccounted for in our banker’s accounts, unless it should be the same\r\nwith the million said to be received from the Farmers General, I\r\nmentioned that an explanation might doubtless be easily obtained, by\r\nwriting to Mr. Grand or Mr. Jefferson. I know not whether you have\r\naccordingly written to either of them. But being desirous that the\r\nmatter should be speedily cleared up, I wrote myself to Mr. Grand a\r\nletter upon it, of which I now enclose a copy with his answer, and\r\nseveral letters from Mr. Durival, who is _chef du bureau des fonds_ (and\r\nhas under his care _la finance des affaires étrangerès_). You will see by\r\nthese letters, that the million in question was delivered to somebody on\r\nthe 10th of June, 1776, but it does not appear to whom. It is clear that\r\nit could not be to Mr. Grand, nor to the commissioners from Congress,\r\nfor we did not meet in France till the end of December, 1777. That\r\nbanker was not charged before with our affairs. By the Minister’s\r\nrefusing him a copy of the receipt, I conjecture it must be money\r\nadvanced for our use to Mr. Beaumarchais, and that it is a _mystère\r\ndu cabinet_, which perhaps should not be further inquired into, unless\r\nnecessary to guard against more demands than may be just from that\r\nagent: for it may well be supposed that if the court furnished him with\r\nthe means of supplying us, they may not be willing to furnish authentic\r\nproofs of such a transaction so early in our dispute with Britain.\r\n\r\nPray tell me, has he dropped his demands, or does he still continue to\r\nworry you with them?\r\n\r\nI should like to have these original letters returned to me, but you\r\nmay, if you please, keep copies of them.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the million in question makes no difference in your accounts\r\nwith the King of France, it not being mentioned or charged as so much\r\nlent and repaid, but stood as freely given. Yet if it was put into the\r\nhands of any of our agents or ministers, they ought certainly to account\r\nfor it. I do not recollect whether Mr. Deane had arrived in France\r\nbefore the 10th of June, 1776, but from his great want of money when I\r\njoined him a few months after, I hardly think it could have been paid\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPossibly Mr. Jefferson may obtain the information, though Mr. Grand\r\ncould not, and I wish he may be directed to make the inquiry, as I\r\nknow he would do it directly; I mean, if by Hortales and Co.’ s further\r\ndemands, or for any other reason, such an inquiry should be thought\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nI am ever, my Dear Friend, yours most affectionately,\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLV.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, June 13, 1793\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 13, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe insulated state in which France is placed with respect to almost\r\nall the world, by the present war, has cut off all means of addressing\r\nletters to you through other countries. I embrace the present occasion\r\nby a private individual going to France directly, to mention, that since\r\nthe date of my last public letter, which was April the 24th, and which\r\ncovered the President’s proclamation of April, I have received your Nos.\r\n17 to 24. M. de Ternary notified us of his recall on the 17th of May,\r\nand delivered the letter of the Provisory Executive Council to that\r\neffect. I now enclose you the President’s answer to the Council, which\r\nyou will be pleased to deliver; a copy of it is also enclosed, open, for\r\nyour, information. Mr. Genet delivered his credentials on the same\r\nday on which M. de Ternant took his leave, and was received by the\r\nPresident. He found himself immediately immersed in business, the\r\nconsequence of this war. The incidents to which that gives daily rise,\r\nand the questions respecting chiefly France and England, fill the\r\nexecutive with business, equally delicate difficult, and disagreeable.\r\nThe course intended to be pursued being that of a strict and impartial\r\nneutrality, decisions rendered by the President rigorously on that\r\nprinciple, dissatisfy both parties, and draw complaints from both. That\r\nyou may have a proper idea of them, I enclose you copies of several\r\nmemorials and letters, which have passed between the executive and the\r\nministers of those two countries, which will at the same time develope\r\nthe principles of the proceedings, and enable you to satisfy them in\r\nyour communications, should it be necessary. I enclose also the answer\r\ngiven to Mr. Genet, on a proposition from him to pay up the whole of\r\nthe French debt at once. While it will enable you to explain the\r\nimpracticability of the operation proposed, it may put it in your power\r\nto judge of the answer which would be given to any future proposition\r\nto that effect, and perhaps to prevent their being brought forward. The\r\nbill lately passed in England, prohibiting the business of this country\r\nwith France from passing through the medium of England, is a temporary\r\nembarrassment to our commerce, from the unhappy predicament of its all\r\nhanging on the pivot of London. It will be happy for us, should it be\r\ncontinued till our merchants may establish connections in the countries\r\nin which our produce is consumed, and to which it should go directly.\r\n\r\nOur commissioners have proceeded to the treaty with the northwestern\r\nIndians. They write, however, that the treaty will be a month later\r\nthan was expected. This delay, should it be extended, will endanger\r\nour losing the benefit of our preparations for the campaign, and\r\nconsequently bring on a delicate question, whether these shall be\r\nrelinquished for the result of a treaty in which we never had any\r\nconfidence. The Creeks have proceeded in their depredations till they\r\nassume the appearance of formal war. It scarcely seems possible to avoid\r\nits becoming so. They are so strong and so far from us, as to make very\r\nserious addition to our Indian difficulties. It is very probable that\r\nsome of the circumstances arising out of our affairs with the Indians,\r\nor with the belligerent powers of Europe, may occasion the convocation\r\nof Congress at an earlier day than that to which its meeting stands at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nI send you the forms of the passports given here. The one in three\r\ncolumns is that now used; the other having been soon discontinued. It is\r\ndetermined that they shall be given in our own ports only, and to serve\r\nbut for one voyage. It has also been determined, that they shall be\r\ngiven to all vessels _bonâ fide_ owned by American citizens _wholly_,\r\nwhether built here or not. Our property, whether in the form of vessels,\r\ncargoes, or any thing else, has a right to pass the seas untouched by\r\nany nation, by the law of nations; and no one has a right to ask where a\r\nvessel was built, but where is she owned? To the security which the\r\nlaw of nations gives to such vessels against all nations, are added\r\nparticular stipulations with three of the belligerent powers. Had it not\r\nbeen in our power to enlarge our national stock of shipping suddenly\r\nin the present exigency, a great proportion of our produce must have\r\nremained on our hands for want of the means of transportation to market.\r\nAt this time, indeed, a great proportion is in that predicament. The\r\nmost rigorous measures will be taken to prevent any vessel, not\r\nwholly and _bonâ fide_ owned by American citizens, from obtaining our\r\npassports. It is much our interest to prevent the competition of other\r\nnations from taking from us the benefits we have a right to expect from\r\nthe neutrality of our flag; and I think we may be very sure that few, if\r\nany, will be fraudulently obtained within our ports.\r\n\r\nThough our spring has been cold and wet, yet the crops of small grain\r\nare as promising as they have ever been seen. The Hessian fly, however,\r\nto the north, and the weavil to the south of the Potomac, will probably\r\nabridge the quantity. Still it seems very doubtful whether we shall not\r\nlose more for want of the means of transportation, and I have no doubt\r\nthat the ships of Sweden and Denmark would find full employment here.\r\n\r\nWe shall endeavor to get your newspapers under the care of Major Read,\r\nthe bearer of this letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVI.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, June 14, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 14, 1793.\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you have been of the 7th of May and 4th instant.\r\nSince the last date, yours of April the 15th has come to hand.\r\n\r\nI enclose you several memorials and letters which have passed between\r\nthe executive and the ministers of France and England. These will\r\ndevelope to you the principles on which we are proceeding between the\r\nbelligerent powers. The decisions being founded in what is conceived to\r\nbe rigorous justice, give dissatisfaction to both parties, and produce\r\ncomplaints from both. It is our duty, however, to persevere in them, and\r\nto meet the consequences. You will observe that Mr. Hammond proposes to\r\nrefer to his court the determination of the President, that the prizes\r\ntaken by the Citoyen Genet, could not be given up. The reasons for this\r\nare explained in the papers. Mr. Genet had stated that she was manned\r\nby French citizens. Mr. Hammond had not stated the contrary before the\r\ndecision. Neither produced any proofs. It was therefore supposed that\r\nshe was manned, principally, with French citizens. After the decision,\r\nMr. Hammond denies the fact, but without producing any proof. I am\r\nreally unable to say how it was; but I believe it to be certain there\r\nwere very few Americans. He says, the issuing the commission, Sic. by\r\nMr. Genet within our territory, was an infringement of our sovereignty;\r\ntherefore, the proceeds of it should be given up to Great Britain. The\r\ninfringement was a matter between France and us. Had we insisted on any\r\npenalty or forfeiture by way of satisfaction to our insulted rights,\r\nit would have belonged to us, not to a third party. As between Great\r\nBritain and us, considering all the circumstances explained in the\r\npapers, we deemed we did enough to satisfy her. We are moreover assured,\r\nthat it is the standing usage of France, perhaps too of other nations in\r\nall wars, to lodge blank commissions with all their foreign consuls,\r\nto be given to every vessel of their nation, merchant or armed; without\r\nwhich a merchant vessel would be punished as a pirate, were she to take\r\nthe smallest thing of the enemy that should fall in her way. Indeed, the\r\nplace of the delivery of a commission is immaterial. As it may be sent\r\nby letter to any one, so it may be delivered by hand to him any where.\r\nThe place of signature by the Sovereign is the material thing. Were that\r\nto be done in any other jurisdiction than his own, it might draw the\r\nvalidity of the act into question. I mention these things, because I\r\nthink it would be proper, that after considering them and such other\r\ncircumstances as appear in the papers, or may occur to yourself, you\r\nshould make it the subject of a conversation with the Minister. Perhaps\r\nit may give you an opportunity of touching on another subject. Whenever\r\nMr. Hammond applies to our government on any matter whatever, be it ever\r\nso new or difficult, if he does not receive his answer in two or three\r\ndays or a week, we are goaded with new letters on the subject. Sometimes\r\nit is the sailing of the packet, which is made the pretext for forcing\r\nus into premature and undigested determinations. You know best how far\r\nyour applications meet such early attentions, and whether you may\r\nwith propriety claim a return of them: you can best judge too of the\r\nexpediency of an intimation, that where despatch is not reciprocal, it\r\nmay be expedient and justifiable that delay should be so.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVII.--TO MR. GENET, June 17, X\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 17, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI shall now have the honor of answering your letter of the 1st instant,\r\nand so much of that of the 14th (both of which have been laid before\r\nthe President) as relates to a vessel armed in the port of New York and\r\nabout to depart from thence, but stopped by order of the government. And\r\nhere I beg leave to premise, that the case supposed in your letter, of\r\na vessel arming for her own defence, and to repel unjust aggressions,\r\nis not that in question, nor that on which I mean to answer, because\r\nnot having yet happened, as far as is known to the government, I have\r\nno instructions on the subject. The case in question is that of a vessel\r\narmed, equipped, and manned in a port of the United States, for the\r\npurpose of committing hostilities on nations at peace with the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was perceived that such enterprises would be attempted,\r\norders to prevent them were despatched to all the States and ports of\r\nthe Union. In consequence of these, the Governor of New York,\r\nreceiving information that a sloop heretofore called the Polly, now\r\nthe Republican, was fitting out, arming, and manning in the port of\r\nNew York, for the express and sole purpose of cruising against certain\r\nnations with whom we are at peace, that she had taken her guns and\r\nammunition aboard and was on the point of departure, seized the vessel.\r\nThat the Governor was not mistaken in the previous indications of her\r\nobject, appears by the subsequent avowal of the citizen Hauterive,\r\nConsul of France at that port, who, in a letter to the Governor,\r\nreclaims her as ‘_Un vaisseau arme, en guerre, et pret a mettre a la\r\nvoile_;’ and describes her object in these expressions; ‘_Cet usage\r\nétrange de la force publique contre les citoyens d’une nation amie qui\r\nse réunissent ici pour aller defendre leur frères_,’ &c. and again; ‘_Je\r\nrequiers, monsieur, l’autorité dont vous êtes revêtu, pour faire rendre\r\nà des Francois, à des allies, &c. la liberte de voler au secours de leur\r\npatrie_.’ This transaction being reported to the President, orders were\r\nimmediately sent to deliver over the vessel, and the persons concerned\r\nin the enterprise, to the tribunals of the country; that if the act\r\nwas of those forbidden by the law, it might be punished; if it was not\r\nforbidden, it might be so declared, and all persons apprized of what\r\nthey might or might not do.\r\n\r\nThis we have reason to believe is the true state of the case, and it\r\nis a repetition of that which was the subject of my letter of the\r\n5th instant, which animadverted, not merely on the single fact of\r\nthe granting commissions of war by one nation within the territory of\r\nanother, but on the aggregate of the facts: for it states the opinion of\r\nthe President to be, ‘that the arming and equipping vessels in the ports\r\nof the United States, to cruise against nations with whom they are at\r\npeace, was incompatible with the sovereignty of the United States; that\r\nit made them instrumental to the annoyance of those nations, and thereby\r\ntended to commit their peace.’ And this opinion is still conceived to be\r\nnot contrary to the principles of natural law, the usage of nations,\r\nthe engagements which unite the two people, nor the proclamation of the\r\nPresident, as you seem to think.\r\n\r\nSurely, not a syllable can be found in the last mentioned instrument\r\npermitting the preparation of hostilities in the ports of the United\r\nStates. Its object was to enjoin on our citizens ‘a friendly conduct\r\ntowards all the belligerent powers;’ but a preparation of hostilities is\r\nthe reverse of this.\r\n\r\nNone of the engagements in our treaties stipulate this permission. The\r\nXVIIth article of that of commerce, permits the armed vessels of either\r\nparty to enter the ports of the other, and to depart with their prizes\r\nfreely: but the entry of an armed vessel into a port, is one act; the\r\nequipping a vessel in that port, arming her, and manning her, is a\r\ndifferent one, and not engaged by any article of the treaty.\r\n\r\nYou think, Sir, that this opinion is also contrary to the law of nature\r\nand usage of nations. We are of opinion it is dictated by that law\r\nand usage; and this had been very maturely inquired into before it was\r\nadopted as a principle of conduct. But we will not assume the exclusive\r\nright of saying what that law and usage is. Let us appeal to enlightened\r\nand disinterested judges. None is more so than Vattel. He says, L. 3, 8,\r\n104. ‘_Tant qu’im peuple neutre veut jouir surement de cet état, il doit\r\nmontrer en toutes choses une exacte impartialité entre ceux qui se font\r\nla guerre. Car s’il favorise l’un au préjudice de l’autre, il ne pourra\r\npas se plaindre, quand celui-ci le traitera comme adhérent et associé\r\nde son ennemi. Sa neutralité seroit une neutralité frauduleuse, dont\r\npersonne ne veut être la dupe. Voyons done en quoi consiste cette\r\nimpartialité qu’un peuple neutre doit garder_.\r\n\r\n‘_Elle se rapport uniquement à la guerre, et comprend deux choses,\r\n1°. Ne point donner de secours quand on n’y est pas obligé; ne fournir\r\nlibrement ni troupes, ni armes, ni munitions, ni rien de ce qui sert\r\ndirectement à la guerre. Je dis ne point donner de secours, et non pas\r\nen donner également; car il seroit absurde qu’un etat secourut en\r\nmême tems deux ennemis. Et puis il seroit impossible de le faire avec\r\négalite; les mêmes choses, le merae nombre de troupes, la même quantite\r\nd’armes, de munitions, &c. fournies en des circonstances differentes,\r\nne forment plus des secours equivalents_,’ &c. If the neutral power may\r\nnot, consistent with its neutrality, furnish men to either party,\r\nfor their aid in war, as little can either enrol them in the neutral\r\nterritory by the law of nations. Wolf, S. 1174, says, ‘_Puisque Je droit\r\nde lever des soldats est un droit de majeste, qui ne peut être viole par\r\nune nation étrangere, il n’est pas permis de lever des soldats sur le\r\nterritoire d’autrui, sans le consentement du maitre du territoire_.’\r\nAnd Vattel, before cited, L. 3, 8, 15. ‘_Le droit de lever des soldats\r\nappartenant uniquement a la nation, ou au souverain, personne ne peut\r\nen envoler en pays etranger sans la permission du soverain: Ceux qui\r\nentreprennant d’engager des soldats en pays etranger sans la permission\r\ndu souverain, et en general quiconque debauche les sujets d’autrui,\r\nviole un des droits les plus sacres du prince et de la nation. C’est le\r\ncrime qu’on appelle plagiat, ou vol d’homme. Il n’est aucun état police\r\nqui ne le punisse tres sevérement_.’ &c. For I choose to refer you to\r\nthe passage, rather than follow it through all its developements. The\r\ntestimony of these, and other writers, on the law and usage of nations,\r\nwith your own just reflections on them, will satisfy you that the\r\nUnited States, in prohibiting all the belligerent powers from equipping,\r\narming, and manning vessels of war in their ports, have exercised\r\na right and a duty, with justice and with great moderation. By our\r\ntreaties with several of the belligerent powers, which are a part of\r\nthe laws of our land we have established a state of peace with them. But\r\nwithout appealing to treaties, we are at peace with them all by the\r\nlaw of nature. For by nature’s law, man is at peace with man till some\r\naggression is committed, which, by the same law, authorizes one to\r\ndestroy another as his enemy. For our citizens then to commit murders\r\nand depredations on the members of nations at peace with us, or combine\r\nto do it, appeared to the executive, and to those whom they consulted,\r\nas much against the laws of the land, as to murder or rob, or combine\r\nto murder or rob its own citizens; and as much to require punishment, if\r\ndone within their limits, where they have a territorial jurisdiction,\r\nor on the high seas, where they have a personal jurisdiction, that is\r\nto say, one which reaches their own citizens only, this being an\r\nappropriate part of each nation on an element where all have a common\r\njurisdiction. So say our laws, as we understand them ourselves. To them\r\nthe appeal is made; and whether we have construed them well or ill, the\r\nconstitutional judges will decide. Till that decision shall be obtained,\r\nthe government of the United States must pursue what they think right\r\nwith firmness, as is their duty. On the first attempt that was made, the\r\nPresident was desirous of involving in the censures of the law as few as\r\nmight be. Such of the individuals only, therefore, as were citizens of\r\nthe United States, were singled out for prosecution. But this second\r\nattempt being after full knowledge of what had been done on the first,\r\nand indicating a disposition to go on in opposition to the laws, they\r\nare to take their course against all persons concerned, whether citizens\r\nor aliens; the latter, while within our jurisdiction and enjoying the\r\nprotection of the laws, being bound to obedience to them, and to avoid\r\ndisturbances of our peace within, or acts which would commit it without,\r\nequally as citizens are.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect, and esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVIII.--TO MR. HAMMOND, June 19, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 19, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor to address you a letter on the 29th of May was\r\ntwelvemonth, on the articles still unexecuted of the treaty of peace\r\nbetween the two nations. The subject was extensive and important,\r\nand therefore rendered a certain degree of delay in the reply to\r\nbe expected. But it has now become such as naturally to generate\r\ndisquietude. The interest we have in the western posts, the blood and\r\ntreasure which their detention costs us daily, cannot but produce a\r\ncorresponding anxiety on our part. Permit me, therefore, to ask when I\r\nmay expect the honor of a reply to my letter, and to assure you of the\r\nsentiments of respect, with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIX.--TO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT, June 30, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 30, 1793.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI have received from Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes, the representatives of\r\nSpain at this place, a letter, which, whether considered in itself,\r\nor as the sequel of several others, conveys to us very disagreeable\r\nprospects of the temper and views of their court towards us. If this\r\nletter is a faithful expression of that temper, we presume it to be\r\nthe effect of egregious misrepresentations by their agents in America.\r\nRevising our own dispositions and proceedings towards that power, we\r\ncan find in them nothing but those of peace and friendship for them; and\r\nconscious that this will be apparent from a true statement of facts, I\r\nshall proceed to give you such a one, to be communicated to the court\r\nof Madrid. If they find it very different from that conveyed to them by\r\nothers, they may think it prudent to doubt, and to take and to give time\r\nfor mutual inquiry and explanation. I shall proceed to give you this\r\nstatement, beginning it from an early period.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the late war, the United States laid down as\r\na rule of their conduct, to engage the Indian tribes within their\r\nneighborhood to remain strictly neutral. They accordingly strongly\r\npressed it on them, urging that it was a family quarrel; with which they\r\nhad nothing to do, and in which we wished them to take no part: and we\r\nstrengthened these recommendations by doing them every act of friendship\r\nand good neighborhood, which circumstances left in our power. With some,\r\nthese solicitations prevailed; but the greater part of them suffered\r\nthemselves to be drawn into the war against us. They waged it in their\r\nusual cruel manner, murdering and scalping men, women, and children,\r\nindiscriminately, burning their houses, and desolating the country. They\r\nput us to vast expense, as well by the constant force we were obliged\r\nto keep up in that quarter, as by expeditions of considerable magnitude\r\nwhich we were under the necessity of sending into their country from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nPeace being at length concluded with England, we had it also to conclude\r\nwith them. They had made war on us without the least provocation or\r\npretence of injury. They had added greatly to the cost of that war. They\r\nhad insulted our feelings by their savage cruelties. They were by our\r\narms completely subdued and humbled. Under all these circumstances, we\r\nhad a right to demand substantial satisfaction and indemnification. We\r\nused that right, however, with real moderation. Their limits with us\r\nunder the former government were generally ill defined, questionable,\r\nand the frequent cause of war. Sincerely desirous of living in their\r\npeace, of cultivating it by every act of justice and friendship, and of\r\nrendering them better neighbors by introducing among them some of the\r\nmost useful arts, it was necessary to begin by a precise definition\r\nof boundary. Accordingly, at the treaties held with them, our mutual\r\nboundaries were settled; and notwithstanding our just right to\r\nconcessions adequate to the circumstances of the case, we required such\r\nonly as were inconsiderable; and for even these, in order that we might\r\nplace them in a state of perfect conciliation, we paid them a valuable\r\nconsideration, and granted them annuities in money which have been\r\nregularly paid, and were equal to the prices for which they have usually\r\nsold their lands.\r\n\r\nSensible, as they were, of the wrong they had done, they expected to\r\nmake some indemnification, and were, for the most part, satisfied\r\nwith the mode and measure of it. In one or two instances, where a\r\ndissatisfaction was observed to remain as to the boundaries agreed on,\r\nor doubts entertained of the authority of those with whom they were\r\nagreed, the United States invited the parties to new treaties, and\r\nrectified what appeared to be susceptible of it. This was particularly\r\nthe case with the Creeks. They complained of an inconvenient cession of\r\nlands on their part, and by persons not duly representing their nation.\r\nThey were therefore desired to appoint a proper deputation to revise\r\ntheir treaty; and that there might be no danger of any unfair practices,\r\nthey were invited to come to the seat of the General Government, and\r\nto treat with that directly. They accordingly came. A considerable\r\nproportion of what had been ceded, was on the revision yielded back to\r\nthem, and nothing required in lieu of it: and though they would have\r\nbeen better satisfied to have had the whole restored, yet they had\r\nobtained enough to satisfy them well. Their nation, too, would have\r\nbeen satisfied, for they were conscious of their aggression, and of the\r\nmoderation of the indemnity with which we had been contented. But at\r\nthat time came among them an adventurer of the name of Bowles, who,\r\nacting from an impulse with which we are unacquainted, flattered them\r\nwith the hope of some foreign interference, which should undo what had\r\nbeen done, and force us to consider the naked grant of their peace as\r\na sufficient satisfaction for their having made war on us. Of this\r\nadventurer the Spanish government rid us: but not of his principles,\r\nhis practices, and his excitements against us. These were more than\r\ncontinued by the officers commanding at New Orleans and Pensacola,\r\nand by agents employed by them and bearing their commission. Their\r\nproceedings have been the subject of former letters to you, and proofs\r\nof these proceedings have been sent to you. Those, with others now\r\nsent, establish the facts, that they called assemblies of the southern\r\nIndians, openly persuaded them to disavow their treaties, and the limits\r\ntherein established, promised to support them with all the powers which\r\ndepended on them, assured them of the protection of their sovereign,\r\ngave them arms in great quantities for the avowed purpose of committing\r\nhostilities on us, and promised them future supplies to their utmost\r\nneed. The Chickasaws, the most steady and faithful friends of these\r\nStates, have remained unshaken by these practices. So also have the\r\nChocktaws, for the most part. The Cherokees have been teazed into some\r\nexpressions of discontent, delivered only to the Spanish Governors, or\r\ntheir agents; while to us, they have continued to speak the language of\r\npeace and friendship. One part of the nation only, settled at Cuckamogga\r\nand mixed with banditti and outcasts from the Shawanese and other\r\ntribes, acknowledging control from none, and never in a state of peace,\r\nhave readily engaged in the hostilities against us to which they were\r\nencouraged. But what was much more important, great numbers of the\r\nCreeks, chiefly their young men, have yielded to these incitements,\r\nand have now, for more than a twelvemonth, been committing murders and\r\ndesolations on our frontiers. Really desirous of living in peace with\r\nthem, we have redoubled our efforts to produce the same disposition in\r\nthem. We have borne with their aggressions, forbidden all returns of\r\nhostility against them, tied up the hands of our people, insomuch that\r\nfew instances of retaliation have occurred even from our suffering\r\ncitizens; we have multiplied our gratifications to them, fed them when\r\nstarving from the produce of our own fields and labor. No longer ago\r\nthan the last winter, when they had no other resource against famine and\r\nmust have perished in great numbers, we carried into their country and\r\ndistributed among them, gratuitously, ten thousand bushels of corn; and\r\nthat too, at the same time, when their young men were daily committing\r\nmurders on helpless women and children, on our frontiers. And though\r\nthese depredations now involve more considerable parts of the nation, we\r\nare still demanding punishment of the guilty individuals, and shall be\r\ncontented with it. These acts of neighborly kindness and support on our\r\npart, have not been confined to the Creeks, though extended to them in\r\nmuch the greatest degree. Like wants among the Chickasaws had induced\r\nus to send them also, at first, five hundred bushels of corn, and\r\nafterwards, fifteen hundred more. Our language to all the tribes of\r\nIndians has constantly been, to live in peace with one another, and in\r\na most especial manner, we have used our endeavors with those in the\r\nneighborhood of the Spanish colonies, to be peaceable towards those\r\ncolonies. I sent you on a former occasion the copy of a letter from the\r\nSecretary at War to Mr. Seagrove, one of our agents with the Indians, in\r\nthat quarter, merely to convey to you the general tenor of the conduct\r\nmarked out for those agents: and I desired you, in placing before the\r\neyes of the Spanish ministry the very contrary conduct observed by their\r\nagents here, to invite them to a reciprocity of good offices with our\r\nIndian neighbors, each for the other, and to make our common peace the\r\ncommon object of both nations. I can protest that such have hitherto\r\nbeen the candid and zealous endeavors of this government, and that\r\nif its agents have in any instance acted in another way, it has been\r\nequally unknown and unauthorized by us, and that, were even probable\r\nproofs of it produced, there would be no hesitation to mark them with\r\nthe disapprobation of the government. We expected the same friendly\r\ncondescension from the court of Spain, in furnishing you with proofs\r\nof the practices of the Governor De Carondelet in particular practices\r\navowed by him, and attempted to be justified in his letter.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, in such dispositions towards Spain and towards\r\nthe Indians, in such a course of proceedings with respect to them, and\r\nwhile negotiations were instituted at Madrid for arranging these and all\r\nother matters which might affect our friendship and good understanding,\r\nwe received from Messrs. de Viar and Jaudenes their letter of May the\r\n25th, which was the subject of mine of May the 31st, to you; and now\r\nagain we have received that of the 18th instant, a copy of which is\r\nenclosed. This letter charges us, and in the most disrespectful style,\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n1. Exciting the Chickasaws to war on the Creeks.\r\n\r\n2. Furnishing them with provisions and arms.\r\n\r\n3. Aiming at the occupation of a post at the _Ecores Amargas_.\r\n\r\n4. Giving medals and marks of distinction to several Indians.\r\n\r\n5. Meddling with the affairs of such as are allies of Spain.\r\n\r\n6. Not using efficacious means to prevent these proceedings. I shall\r\nmake short observations on these charges.\r\n\r\n1. Were the first true, it would not be unjustifiable. The Creeks have\r\nnow a second time commenced against us a wanton and unprovoked war, and\r\nthe present one in the face of a recent treaty, and of the most friendly\r\nand charitable offices on our part. There would be nothing out of the\r\ncommon course of proceeding, then, for us to engage allies, if we needed\r\nany for their punishment. But we neither need, nor have sought them. The\r\nfact itself is utterly false, and we defy the world to produce a\r\nsingle proof of it. The declaration of war by the Chickasaws, as we\r\nare informed was a very sudden thing, produced by the murder of some of\r\ntheir people by a party of Creeks, and produced so instantaneously as to\r\ngive no body time to interfere, either to promote or prevent a rupture.\r\nWe had, on the contrary, most particularly exhorted that nation to\r\npreserve peace, because in truth we have a most particular friendship\r\nfor them. This will be evident from a copy of the message of the\r\nPresident to them, among the papers now enclosed.\r\n\r\n2. The gift of provisions was but an act of that friendship to them,\r\nwhen in the same distress, which had induced us to give five times as\r\nmuch to the less friendly nation of the Creeks. But we have given arms\r\nto them. We believe it is the practice of every white nation to give\r\narms to the neighboring Indians. The agents of Spain have done it\r\nabundantly, and we suppose not out of their own pockets, and this\r\nfor purposes of avowed hostility on us; and they have been liberal\r\nin promises of further supplies. We have given a few arms to a very\r\nfriendly tribe, not to make war on Spain, but to defend themselves from\r\nthe atrocities of a vastly more numerous and powerful people, and one\r\nwhich by a series of unprovoked and even unrepelled attacks on us, is\r\nobliging us to look towards war as the only means left of curbing their\r\ninsolence.\r\n\r\n3. We are aiming, as is pretended, at an establishment on the\r\nMississippi, at the _Ecores Amargas_. Considering the measures of this\r\nnature with which Spain is going on, having, since the proposition to\r\ntreat with us on the subject, established posts at the Walnut Hills\r\nand other places for two hundred miles upwards, it would not have been\r\nwonderful if we had taken countervailing measures. But the truth is,\r\nwe have not done it. We wished to give a fair chance to the negotiation\r\ngoing on, and thought it but common candor to leave things in _statu\r\nquo_, to make no innovation pending the negotiation. In this spirit we\r\nforbid, and deterred even by military force, a large association of our\r\ncitizens, under the name of the Yazoo companies, which had formed to\r\nsettle themselves at those very Walnut Hills, which Spain has since\r\noccupied. And so far are we from meditating the particular establishment\r\nso boldly charged in this letter, that we know not what place is meant\r\nby the _Ecores Amargas_. This charge then is false also.\r\n\r\n4. Giving medals and marks of distinction to the Indian Chiefs. This is\r\nbut blindly hinted at in this letter, but was more pointedly complained\r\nof in the former. This has been an ancient custom from time immemorial.\r\nThe medals are considered as complimentary things, as marks of\r\nfriendship to those who come to see us, or who do us good offices,\r\nconciliatory of their good-will towards us, and not designed to produce\r\na contrary disposition towards others. They confer no power, and seem\r\nto have taken their origin in the European practice of giving medals\r\nor other marks of friendship to the negotiators of treaties and\r\nother diplomatic characters, or visitors of distinction. The British\r\ngovernment, while it prevailed here, practised the giving medals,\r\ngorgets, and bracelets to the savages, invariably. We have continued it,\r\nand we did imagine, without pretending to know, that Spain also did it.\r\n\r\n5. We meddle with the affairs of Indians in alliance with Spain. We are\r\nperfectly at a loss to know what this means. The Indians on our frontier\r\nhave treaties both with Spain and us. We have endeavored to cultivate\r\ntheir friendship, to merit it by presents, charities, and exhortations\r\nto peace with their neighbors, and particularly with the subjects of\r\nSpain. We have carried on some little commerce with them, merely to\r\nsupply their wants. Spain too has made them presents, traded with\r\nthem, kept agents among them, though their country is within the limits\r\nestablished as ours at the general peace. However, Spain has chosen\r\nto have it understood that she has some claim to some parts of that\r\ncountry, and that it must be one of the subjects of our present\r\nnegotiations. Out of respect for her, then, we have considered her\r\npretensions to the country, though it was impossible to believe them\r\nserious, as coloring pretensions to a concern with those Indians on the\r\nsame ground with our own, and we were willing to let them go on till a\r\ntreaty should set things to rights between us.\r\n\r\n6. Another article of complaint is, that we have not used efficacious\r\nmeans to suppress these practices. But if the charge is false, or the\r\npractice justifiable, no suppression is necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, these gentlemen say, that, on a view of these proceedings of\r\nthe United States with respect to Spain and the Indians, their allies,\r\nthey foresee that our peace with Spain is very problematical in future.\r\nThe principal object of the letter being our supposed excitements of the\r\nChickasaws against the Creeks, and their protection of the latter, are\r\nwe to understand from this, that if we arm to repulse the attacks of the\r\nCreeks on ourselves, it will disturb our peace with Spain? That if we\r\nwill not fold our arms and let them butcher us without resistance,\r\nSpain will consider it as a cause of war? This is, indeed, so serious an\r\nintimation, that the President has thought it could no longer be treated\r\nwith subordinate characters, but that his sentiments should be conveyed\r\nto the government of Spain itself, through you.\r\n\r\nWe love and we value peace: we know its blessings from experience. We\r\nabhor the follies of war, and are not untried in its distresses and\r\ncalamities. Unmeddling with the affairs of other nations, we had hoped\r\nthat our distance and our disposition would have left us free, in the\r\nexample and indulgence of peace with all the world. We had, with sincere\r\nand particular dispositions, courted and cultivated the friendship of\r\nSpain. We have made to it great sacrifices of time and interest, and\r\nwere disposed to believe she would see her interests also in a perfect\r\ncoalition and good understanding with us. Cherishing still the same\r\nsentiments, we have chosen, in the present instance, to ascribe the\r\nintimations in this letter to the particular character of the writers,\r\ndisplayed in the peculiarity of the style of their communications, and\r\ntherefore we have removed the cause from them to their sovereign,\r\nin whose justice and love of peace we have confidence. If we are\r\ndisappointed in this appeal, if we are to be forced into a contrary\r\norder of things, our mind is made up. We shall meet it with firmness.\r\nThe necessity of our position will supersede all appeal to calculation\r\nhow, as it has done heretofore. We confide in our own strength, without\r\nboasting of it; we respect that of others, without fearing it. If\r\nwe cannot otherwise prevail on the Creeks to discontinue their\r\ndepredations, we will attack them in force. If Spain chooses to consider\r\nour defence against savage butchery as a cause of war to her, we must\r\nmeet her also in war, with regret, but without fear; and we shall be\r\nhappier, to the last moment, to repair with her to the tribunal of peace\r\nand reason.\r\n\r\nThe President charges you to communicate the contents of this letter\r\nto the court of Madrid, with all the temperance and delicacy which the\r\ndignity and character of that court render proper; but with all\r\nthe firmness and self-respect which befit a nation conscious of its\r\nrectitude, and settled in its purpose.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLX.--TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, July 18,1793\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates_.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 18,1793.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nThe war which has taken place among the powers of Europe, produces\r\nfrequent transactions within our ports and limits, on which questions\r\narise of considerable difficulty, and of greater importance to the peace\r\nof the United States. These questions depend for their solution on the\r\nconstruction of our treaties, on the laws of nature and nations, and on\r\nthe laws of the land; and are often presented under circumstances which\r\ndo not give a cognizance of them to the tribunals of the country. Yet\r\ntheir decision is so little analogous to the ordinary functions of the\r\nexecutive, as to occasion much embarrassment and difficulty to them. The\r\nPresident would, therefore, be much relieved, if he found himself free\r\nto refer questions of this description to the opinions of the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, whose knowledge of the subject\r\nwould secure us against errors dangerous to the peace of the United\r\nStates, and their authority insure the respect of all parties. He has\r\ntherefore asked the attendance of such judges as could be collected\r\nin time for the occasion, to know, in the first place, their opinions,\r\nwhether the public may with propriety be availed of their advice on\r\nthese questions. And if they may, to present, for their advice, the\r\nabstract questions which have already occurred, or may soon occur, from\r\nwhich they will themselves strike out such as any circumstances might,\r\nin their opinion, forbid them to pronounce on.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXI.--TO MR. GENET, July 24,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 24,1793. Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 9th instant, covering the information of Silvat\r\nDucamp, Pierre Nouvel, Chouquet de Savarence, Gaston de Nogère, and G.\r\nBlustier, that being on their passage from the French West Indies to\r\nthe United States, on board merchant vessels of the United States with\r\nslaves and merchandise, of their property, these vessels were stopped by\r\nBritish armed vessels and their property taken out as lawful prize, has\r\nbeen received.\r\n\r\nI believe it cannot be doubted, but that by the general law of nations,\r\nthe goods of a friend found in the vessel of an enemy are free, and the\r\ngoods of an enemy found in the vessel of a friend are lawful prize.\r\nUpon this principle, I presume, the British armed vessels have taken\r\nthe property of French citzens found in our vessels, in the cases above\r\nmentioned, and I confess I should be at a loss on what principle to\r\nreclaim it. It is true that sundry nations, desirous of avoiding the\r\ninconveniences of having their vessels stopped at sea, ransacked,\r\ncarried into port, and detained under pretence of having enemy goods\r\naboard, have in many instances introduced by their special treaties\r\nanother principle between them, that enemy bottoms shall make enemy\r\ngoods, and friendly bottoms friendly goods; a principle much less\r\nembarrassing to commerce, and equal to all parties in point of gain\r\nand loss. But this is altogether the effect of particular treaty,\r\ncontrolling in special cases the general principle of the law of\r\nnations, and therefore taking effect between such nations only as have\r\nso agreed to control it. England has generally determined to adhere to\r\nthe rigorous principle, having, in no instance, as far as I recollect,\r\nagreed to the modification of letting the property of the goods follow\r\nthat of the vessel, except in the single one of her treaty with France.\r\nWe have adopted this modification in our treaties with France, the\r\nUnited Netherlands, and Russia; and therefore, as to them, our vessels\r\ncover the goods of their enemies, and we lose our goods when in the\r\nvessels of their enemies. Accordingly, you will be pleased to recollect,\r\nthat in the late case of Holland and Mackie, citizens of the United\r\nStates, who had laden a cargo of flour on board a British vessel, which\r\nwas taken by the French frigate L’Ambuscade and brought into this port,\r\nwhen I reclaimed the cargo, it was only on the ground that they were\r\nignorant of the declaration of war when it was shipped. You observed,\r\nhowever, that the 14th article of our treaty had provided that ignorance\r\nshould not be pleaded beyond two months after the declaration of war,\r\nwhich term had elapsed in this case by some days, and finding that to\r\nbe the truth, though their real ignorance of the declaration was equally\r\ntrue, I declined the reclamation, as it never was in my view to\r\nreclaim the cargo, nor apparently in yours to offer to restore it, by\r\nquestioning the rule established in our treaty, that enemy bottoms make\r\nenemy goods. With England, Spain, Portugal, and Austria, we have no\r\ntreaties: therefore, we have nothing to oppose to their acting according\r\nto the general law of nations, that enemy goods are lawful prize, though\r\nfound in the bottom of a friend. Nor do I see that France can suffer\r\non the whole; for though she loses her goods in our vessels when found\r\ntherein by England, Spain, Portugal, or Austria, yet she gains our goods\r\nwhen found in the vessels of England, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the\r\nUnited Netherlands, or Prussia: and I believe I may safely affirm that\r\nwe have more goods afloat in the vessels of these six nations, than\r\nFrance has afloat in our vessels; and consequently, that France is the\r\ngainer and we the loser by the principle of our treaty. Indeed, we are\r\nlosers in every direction of that principle; for when it works in our\r\nfavor, it is to save the goods of our friends; when it works against us,\r\nit is to lose our own; and we shall continue to lose while the rule is\r\nonly partially established. When we shall have established it with all\r\nnations, we shall be in condition neither to gain nor lose, but shall\r\nbe less exposed to vexatious searches at sea. To this condition we are\r\nendeavoring to advance; but as it depends on the will of other nations\r\nas well as our own, we can only obtain it when they shall be ready to\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\nI cannot, therefore, but flatter myself, that on revising the cases of\r\nDucamp and others, you will perceive that their losses result from the\r\nstate of war, which has permitted their enemies to take their goods,\r\nthough found in our vessels; and consequently, from circumstances over\r\nwhich we have no control.\r\n\r\nThe rudeness to their persons, practised by their enemies, is certainly\r\nnot favorable to the character of the latter. We feel for it as much as\r\nfor the extension of it to our own citizens, their companions, and find\r\nin it a motive the more for requiring measures to be taken which may\r\nprevent repetitions of it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXII.--TO MR. GENET, August 7, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 7, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn a letter of June the 5th, I had the honor to inform you that the\r\nPresident, after reconsidering, at your request, the case of vessels\r\narmed within our ports to commit hostilities on nations at peace with\r\nthe United States, had finally determined that it could not be admitted,\r\nand desired that all those which had been so armed should depart from\r\nour ports. It being understood afterwards, that these vessels either\r\nstill remained in our ports, or had only left them to cruise on our\r\ncoasts and return again with their prizes, and that another vessel, the\r\nLittle Democrat, had been since armed at Philadelphia, it was desired\r\nin my letter of the 12th of July, that such vessels, with their prizes,\r\nshould be detained, till a determination should be had of what was to be\r\ndone under these circumstances. In disregard, however, of this desire,\r\nthe Little Democrat went out immediately on a cruise.\r\n\r\nI have it now in charge to inform you, that the President considers\r\nthe United States as bound, pursuant to positive assurances given in\r\nconformity to the laws of neutrality, to effectuate the restoration of\r\nor to make compensation for prizes, which shall have been made of any\r\nof the parties at war with France, subsequent to the fifth day of June\r\nlast, by privateers fitted out of our ports.\r\n\r\nThat it is consequently expected, that you will cause restitution to be\r\nmade of all prizes taken and brought into our ports subsequent to\r\nthe above mentioned day by such privateers, in defect of which, the\r\nPresident considers it as incumbent upon the United States to indemnify\r\nthe owners of those prizes; the indemnification to be reimbursed by the\r\nFrench nation.\r\n\r\nThat besides taking efficacious measures to prevent the future fitting\r\nout of privateers in the ports of the United States, they will not give\r\nasylum therein to any which shall have been at any time so fitted out,\r\nand will cause restitution of all such prizes as shall be hereafter\r\nbrought within their ports by any of the said privateers.\r\n\r\nIt would have been but proper respect to the authority of the country,\r\nhad that been consulted before these armaments were undertaken. It would\r\nhave been satisfactory, however, if their sense of them, when declared,\r\nhad been duly acquiesced in. Reparation of the injury to which the\r\nUnited States have been made so involuntarily instrumental is all which\r\nnow remains, and in this your compliance cannot but be expected.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the information given in your letter of the 4th\r\ninstant, that certain citizens of St. Domingo, lately arrived in\r\nthe United States, were associating for the purpose of undertaking a\r\nmilitary expedition from the territory of the United States, against\r\nthat island, the Governor of Maryland, within which State the expedition\r\nis understood to be preparing, is instructed to take effectual measures\r\nto prevent the same.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIII.--TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, August 16,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 16,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of January the 13th, I enclosed to you copies of several\r\nletters which had passed between Mr. Ternant, Mr. Genet, and myself,\r\non the occurrences to which the present war had given rise within our\r\nports. The object of this communication was to enable you to explain\r\nthe principles on which our government was conducting itself towards\r\nthe belligerent parties; principles which might not in all cases be\r\nsatisfactory to all, but were meant to be just and impartial to all. Mr.\r\nGenet had been then but a little time with us; and but a little more was\r\nnecessary to develope in him a character and conduct so unexpected\r\nand so extraordinary, as to place us in the most distressing dilemma,\r\nbetween our regard for his nation, which is constant and sincere, and a\r\nregard for our laws, the authority of which must be maintained; for\r\nthe peace of our country, which the executive magistrate is charged to\r\npreserve; for its honor, offended in the person of that magistrate; and\r\nfor its character grossly traduced, in the conversations and letters of\r\nthis gentleman. In the course of these transactions, it has been a great\r\ncomfort to us to believe, that none of them were within the intentions\r\nor expectations of his employers. These had been too recently expressed\r\nin acts which nothing could discolor, in the letters of the Executive\r\nCouncil, in the letter and decrees of the National Assembly, and in the\r\ngeneral demeanor of the nation towards us, to ascribe to them things\r\nof so contrary a character. Our first duty, therefore, was, to draw\r\na strong line between their intentions and the proceedings of their\r\nMinister; our second, to lay those proceedings faithfully before them.\r\n\r\nOn the declaration of war between France and England, the United States\r\nbeing at peace with both, their situation was so new and unexperienced\r\nby themselves, that their citizens were not, in the first instant,\r\nsensible of the new duties resulting therefrom, and of the restraints it\r\nwould impose even on their dispositions towards the belligerent powers.\r\nSome of them imagined (and chiefly their transient sea-faring citizens)\r\nthat they were free to indulge those dispositions, to take side with\r\neither party, and enrich themselves by depredations on the commerce of\r\nthe other, and were meditating enterprises of this nature, as there\r\nwas reason to believe. In this state of the public mind, and before\r\nit should take an erroneous direction, difficult to be set right and\r\ndangerous to themselves and their country, the President thought it\r\nexpedient, through the channel of a proclamation, to remind our fellow\r\ncitizens that we were in a state of peace with all the belligerent\r\npowers, that in that state it was our duty neither to aid nor injure\r\nany, to exhort and warn them against acts which might contravene this\r\nduty, and particularly those of positive hostility, for the punishment\r\nof which the laws would be appealed to; and to put them on their guard\r\nalso, as to the risks they would run, if they should attempt to carry\r\narticles of contraband to any. This proclamation, ordered on the 19th\r\nand signed the 22nd day of April, was sent to you in my letter of the\r\n26th of the same month.\r\n\r\nOn the day of its publication, we received, through the channel of the\r\nnewspapers, the first intimation that Mr. Genet had arrived on the 8th\r\nof the month at Charleston, in the character of Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nfrom his nation to the United States, and soon after, that he had\r\nsent on to Philadelphia the vessel in which he came, and would himself\r\nperform the journey by land. His landing at one of the most distant\r\nports of the Union from his points both of departure and destination,\r\nwas calculated to excite attention; and very soon afterwards, we learned\r\nthat, he was undertaking to authorize the fitting and arming vessels\r\nin that port, enlisting men, foreigners and citizens, and giving them\r\ncommissions to cruise and commit hostilities on nations at peace with\r\nus; that these vessels were taking and bringing prizes into our ports;\r\nthat the Consuls of France were assuming to hold courts of admiralty on\r\nthem, to try, condemn, and authorize their sale as legal prize, and all\r\nthis before Mr. Genet had presented himself or his credentials to\r\nthe President, before he was received by him, without his consent\r\nor consultation, and directly in contravention of the state of peace\r\nexisting, and declared to exist in the President’s proclamation, and\r\nincumbent on him to preserve till the constitutional authority should\r\notherwise declare. These proceedings became immediately, as was\r\nnaturally to be expected, the subject of complaint by the representative\r\nhere of that power against whom they would chiefly operate. The British\r\nminister presented several memorials thereon, to which we gave the\r\nanswer of May the 15th, heretofore enclosed to you, corresponding in\r\nsubstance with a letter of the same date written to Mr. Ternant, the\r\nMinister of France then residing here, a copy of which I send herewith.\r\nOn the next day Mr. Genet reached this place, about five or six weeks\r\nafter he had arrived at Charleston, and might have been at Philadelphia,\r\nif he had steered for it directly. He was immediately presented to the\r\nPresident, and received by him as the Minister of the Republic; and as\r\nthe conduct before stated seemed to bespeak a design of forcing us into\r\nthe war without allowing us the exercise of any free will in the case,\r\nnothing could be more assuaging than his assurance to the President at\r\nhis reception, which he repeated to me afterwards in conversation, and\r\nin public to the citizens of Philadelphia in answer to an address from\r\nthem, that on account of our remote situation and other circumstances,\r\nFrance did not expect that we should become a party to the war, but\r\nwished to see us pursue our prosperity and happiness in peace. In a\r\nconversation a few days after, Mr. Genet told me that M. de Ternant had\r\ndelivered him my letter of May the 15th. He spoke something of the case\r\nof the Grange, and then of the armament at Charleston, explained the\r\ncircumstances which had led him to it before he had been received by\r\nthe government and had consulted its will, expressed a hope that the\r\nPresident had not so absolutely decided against the measure but that he\r\nwould hear what was to be said in support of it, that he would write me\r\na letter on the subject, in which he thought he could justify it\r\nunder our treaty; but that if the President should finally determine\r\notherwise, he must submit; for that assuredly his instructions were to\r\ndo what would be agreeable to us. He accordingly wrote the letter of\r\nMay the 27th. The President took the case again into consideration, and\r\nfound nothing in that letter which could shake the grounds of his former\r\ndecision. My letter of June the 5th notifying this to him, his of June\r\nthe 8th and 14th, mine of the 17th, and his again of the 22nd, will show\r\nwhat further passed on this subject, and that he was far from retaining\r\nhis disposition to acquiesce in the ultimate will of the President.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to pursue this and our subsequent correspondence\r\nthrough all their details. Referring therefore for these to the letters\r\nthemselves, which shall accompany this, I will present a summary view\r\nonly of the points of difference which have arisen, and the grounds on\r\nwhich they rest.\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Genet asserts his right of arming in our ports and of enlisting\r\nour citizens, and that we have no right to restrain him or punish them.\r\nExamining this question under the law of nations, founded on the general\r\nsense and usage of mankind, we have produced proofs, from the most\r\nenlightened and approved writers on the subject, that a neutral nation\r\nmust, in all things relating to the war, observe an exact impartiality\r\ntowards the parties; that favors to one to the prejudice of the other\r\nwould import a fraudulent neutrality, of which no nation would be the\r\ndupe; that no succor should be given to either, unless stipulated by\r\ntreaty, in men, arms, or any thing else directly serving for war; that\r\nthe right of raising troops being one of the rights of sovereignty, and\r\nconsequently appertaining exclusively to the nation itself, no foreign\r\npower or person can levy men within its territory without its consent;\r\nand he who does, may be rightfully and severely punished; that if the\r\nUnited States have a right to refuse the permission to arm vessels and\r\nraise men within their ports and territories, they are bound by the laws\r\nof neutrality to exercise that right, and to prohibit such armaments\r\nand enlistments. To these principles of the law of nations Mr. Genet\r\nanswers, by calling them ‘diplomatic subtleties,’ and ‘aphorisms\r\nof Vattel and others.’ But something more than this is necessary to\r\ndisprove them; and till they are disproved, we hold it certain that the\r\nlaw of nations and the rules of neutrality forbid our permitting either\r\nparty to arm in our ports.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Genet says, that the twenty-second article of our treaty allows\r\nhim expressly to arm in our ports. Why has he not quoted the very words\r\nof that article expressly allowing it? For that would have put an end\r\nto all further question. The words of the article are, ‘It shall not be\r\nlawful for any foreign privateers not belonging to subjects of the M. C.\r\nKing, nor citizens of the said United States, who have commissions from\r\nany foreign Prince or State in enmity with either nation, to fit their\r\nships in the ports of either the one or the other of the aforesaid\r\nparties.’ Translate this from the general terms in which it here stands,\r\ninto the special case produced by the present war. ‘Privateers not\r\nbelonging to France or the United States, and having commissions from\r\nthe enemies of one of them,’ are, in the present state of things,’\r\nBritish, Dutch, and Spanish privateers.’ Substituting these then for\r\nthe equivalent terms, it will stand thus, ‘It shall not be lawful for\r\nBritish, Dutch, or Spanish privateers, to fit their ships in the ports\r\nof the United States.’ Is this an express permission to France to do\r\nit? Does the negative to the enemies of France, and silence as to France\r\nherself, imply an affirmative to France? Certainly not; it leaves\r\nthe question as to France open, and free to be decided according to\r\ncircumstances. And if the parties had meant an affirmative stipulation,\r\nthey would have provided for it expressly; they would never have left\r\nso important a point to be inferred from mere silence or implications.\r\nSuppose they had desired to stipulate a refusal to their enemies, but\r\nnothing to themselves; what form of expression would they have used?\r\nCertainly the one they have used; an express stipulation as to their\r\nenemies, and silence as to themselves. And such an intention corresponds\r\nnot only with the words, but with the circumstances of the times. It was\r\nof value to each party to exclude its enemies from arming in the ports\r\nof the other, and could in no case embarrass them. They therefore\r\nstipulated so far mutually. But each might be embarrassed by permitting\r\nthe other to arm in its ports. They therefore would not stipulate to\r\npermit that. Let us go back to the state of things in France when this\r\ntreaty was made, and we shall find several cases wherein France could\r\nnot have permitted us to arm in her ports. Suppose a war between these\r\nStates and Spain. We know, that by the treaties between France and\r\nSpain, the former could not permit the enemies of the latter to arm in\r\nher ports. It was honest in her, therefore, not to deceive us by such\r\na stipulation. Suppose a war between these States and Great Britain. By\r\nthe treaties between France and Great Britain, in force at the signature\r\nof ours, we could not have been permitted to arm in the ports of France.\r\nShe could not then have meant in this article to give us such a right.\r\nShe has manifested the same sense of it in her subsequent treaty with\r\nEngland, made eight years after the date of ours, stipulating in\r\nthe sixteenth article of it, as in our twenty-second, that foreign\r\nprivateers, not being subjects of either crown, should not arm against\r\neither in the ports of the other. If this had amounted to an affirmative\r\nstipulation that the subjects of the other crown might arm in her\r\nports against us, it would have been in direct contradiction to her\r\ntwenty-second article with us. So that to give to these negative\r\nstipulations an affirmative effect, is to render them inconsistent with\r\neach other, and with good faith; to give them only their negative and\r\nnatural effect, is to reconcile them to one another and to good faith,\r\nand is clearly to adopt the sense in which France herself has expounded\r\nthem. We may justly conclude then, that the article only obliges us to\r\nrefuse this right, in the present case, to Great Britain and the other\r\nenemies of France. It does not go on to give it to France, either\r\nexpressly or by implication. We may then refuse it. And since we are\r\nbound by treaty to refuse it to the one party, and are free to refuse\r\nit to the other, we are bound by the laws of neutrality to refuse it\r\nto that other. The aiding either party then with vessels, arms, or men,\r\nbeing unlawful by the law of nations, and not rendered lawful by the\r\ntreaty, it is made a question whether our citizens, joining in these\r\nunlawful enterprises, may be punished.\r\n\r\nThe United States being in a state of peace with most of the belligerent\r\npowers by treaty, and with all of them by the laws of nature, murders\r\nand robberies committed by our citizens within our territory, or on the\r\nhigh seas, on those with whom we are so at peace, are punishable equally\r\nas if committed on our own inhabitants. If I might venture to reason a\r\nlittle formally, without being charged with running into ‘subtleties and\r\naphorisms,’ I would say, that if one citizen has a right to go to war of\r\nhis own authority, every citizen has the same. If every citizen has that\r\nright, then the nation (which is composed of all its citizens) has a\r\nright to go to war, by the authority of its individual citizens. But\r\nthis is not true either on the general principles of society, or by our\r\nconstitution, which gives that power to Congress alone, and not to the\r\ncitizens individually. Then the first position was not true; and no\r\ncitizen has a right to go to war of his own authority, and for what he\r\ndoes without right, he ought to be punished. Indeed, nothing can be more\r\nobviously absurd than to say, that all the citizens may be at war, and\r\nyet the nation at peace.\r\n\r\nIt has been pretended, indeed, that the engagement of a citizen in an\r\nenterprise of this nature, was a divestment of the character of citizen,\r\nand a transfer of jurisdiction over him to another sovereign. Our\r\ncitizens are certainly free to divest themselves of that character by\r\nemigration and other acts manifesting their intention, and may then\r\nbecome the subjects of another power, and free to do whatever the\r\nsubjects of that power may do. But the laws do not admit that the bare\r\ncommission of a crime amounts of itself to a divestment of the character\r\nof citizen, and withdraws the criminal from their coercion. They would\r\nnever prescribe an illegal act among the legal modes by, which a citizen\r\nmight disfranchise himself; nor render treason, for instance, innocent\r\nby giving it the force of a dissolution of the obligation of the\r\ncriminal to his country. Accordingly, in the case of Henfeild, a citizen\r\nof these States, charged with having engaged in the port of Charleston,\r\nin an enterprise against nations at peace with us, and with having\r\njoined in the actual commission of hostilities, the Attorney General of\r\nthe United States, in an official opinion, declared, that the act with\r\nwhich he was charged was punishable by law. The same thing has been\r\nunanimously declared by two of the Circuit Courts of the United States,\r\nas you will see in the charges of Chief Justice Jay, delivered at\r\nRichmond, and Judge Wilson, delivered at Philadelphia, both of which are\r\nherewith sent. Yet Mr. Genet, in the moment he lands at Charleston, is\r\nable to tell the Governor, and continues to affirm in his correspondence\r\nhere, that no law of the United States authorizes their government\r\nto restrain either its own citizens or the foreigners inhabiting its\r\nterritory, from warring against the enemies of France. It is true,\r\nindeed, that in the case of Henfeild, the jury which tried, absolved\r\nhim. But it appeared on the trial, that the crime was not knowingly and\r\nwilfully committed; that Henfeild was ignorant of the unlawfulness of\r\nhis undertaking; that in the moment he was apprized of it, he showed\r\nreal contrition; that he had rendered meritorious services during the\r\nlate war, and declared he would live and die an American. The jury,\r\ntherefore, in absolving him, did no more than the constitutional\r\nauthority might have done, had they found him guilty: the constitution\r\nhaving provided for the pardon of offences in certain cases, and there\r\nbeing no case where it would have been more proper than where no offence\r\nwas contemplated. Henfeild, therefore, was still an American citizen,\r\nand Mr. Genet’s reclamation of him was as unauthorized as the first\r\nenlistment of him.\r\n\r\n2. Another doctrine advanced by Mr. Genet is, that our courts can take\r\nno cognizance of questions whether vessels, held by theirs, as prizes,\r\nare lawful prizes or not; that this jurisdiction belongs exclusively to\r\ntheir consulates here, which have been lately erected by the National\r\nAssembly into complete courts of admiralty. Let us consider, first,\r\nwhat is the extent of jurisdiction which the consulates of France may\r\nrightfully exercise here. Every nation has of natural right, entirely\r\nand exclusively, all the jurisdiction which may be rightfully\r\nexercised in the territory it occupies. If it cedes any portion of that\r\njurisdiction to judges appointed by another nation, the limits of their\r\npower must depend on the instrument of cession. The United States and\r\nFrance have, by their consular convention, given mutually to their\r\nConsuls jurisdiction in certain cases especially enumerated. But that\r\nconvention gives to neither the power of establishing complete courts\r\nof admiralty within the territory of the other, nor even of deciding the\r\nparticular question of prize, or not prize. The consulates of France,\r\nthen, cannot take judicial cognizance of those questions here. Of this\r\nopinion Mr. Genet was, when he wrote his letter of May the 27th, wherein\r\nhe promises to correct the error of the Consul at Charleston, of whom,\r\nin my letter of the 15th instant, I had complained, as arrogating to\r\nhimself that jurisdiction; though in his subsequent letters he has\r\nthought proper to embark in the errors of his Consuls.\r\n\r\nBut the United States, at the same time, do not pretend any right to try\r\nthe validity of captures made on the high seas, by France, or any other\r\nnation, over its enemies. These questions belong of common usage to the\r\nsovereignty of the captor, and whenever it is necessary to determine\r\nthem, resort must be had to his courts. This is the case provided for\r\nin the seventeenth article of the treaty, which says, that such prizes\r\nshall not be arrested, nor cognizance taken of the validity thereof; a\r\nstipulation much insisted on by Mr. Genet and the Consuls, and which we\r\nnever thought of infringing or questioning. As the validity of captures\r\nthen, made on the high seas by France over its enemies, cannot be tried\r\nwithin the United States by their Consuls, so neither can it by our own\r\ncourts. Nor is this the question between us, though we have been misled\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nThe real question is, whether the United States have not a right to\r\nprotect vessels within their waters and on their coasts? The Grange\r\nwas taken within the Delaware, between the shores of Jersey and of the\r\nDelaware State, and several miles above its mouth. The seizing her was a\r\nflagrant violation of the jurisdiction of the United States. Mr. Genet,\r\nhowever, instead of apologizing, takes great merit in his letters for\r\ngiving her up. The William is said to have been taken within two\r\nmiles of the shores of the United States. When the admiralty declined\r\ncognizance of the case, she was delivered to the French Consul according\r\nto my letter of June the 25th, to be kept till the executive of the\r\nUnited States should examine into the case; and Mr. Genet was desired by\r\nmy letter of June the 29th, to have them furnished with the evidence on\r\nbehalf of the captors, as to the place of capture. Yet to this day it\r\nhas never been done. The brig Fanny was alleged to be taken within five\r\nmiles from our shore; the Catharine within two miles and a half. It is\r\nan essential attribute of the jurisdiction of every country to preserve\r\npeace, to punish acts in breach of it, and to restore property taken by\r\nforce within its limits. Were the armed vessel of any nation to cut away\r\none of our own from the wharves of Philadelphia, and to choose to call\r\nit a prize, would this exclude us from the right of redressing the\r\nwrong? Were it the vessel of another nation, are we not equally bound to\r\nprotect it, while within our limits? Were it seized in any other of our\r\nwaters, or on the shores of the United States, the right of redressing\r\nis still the same: and humble indeed would be our condition, were\r\nwe obliged to depend for that on the will of a foreign Consul, or\r\non negotiation with diplomatic agents. Accordingly, this right of\r\nprotection within its waters and to a reasonable distance on its coasts,\r\nhas been acknowledged by every nation, and denied to none: and if the\r\nproperty seized be yet within their power, it is their right and duty to\r\nredress the wrong themselves. France herself has asserted the right in\r\nherself and recognised it in us, in the sixth article of our treaty,\r\nwhere we mutually stipulate that we will, by all the means in our\r\npower (not by negotiation), protect and defend each other’s vessels and\r\neffects in our ports or roads, or on the seas near our countries,\r\nand recover and restore the same to the right owners. The United\r\nNetherlands, Prussia, and Sweden, have recognised it also in treaties\r\nwith us; and indeed it is a standing formula, inserted in almost all the\r\ntreaties of all nations, and proving the principle to be acknowledged by\r\nall nations.\r\n\r\nHow, and by what organ of the government, whether judiciary or\r\nexecutive, it shall be redressed, is not yet perfectly settled with us.\r\nOne of the subordinate courts of admiralty has been of opinion, in the\r\nfirst instance, in the case of the ship William, that it does not belong\r\nto the judiciary. Another, perhaps, may be of a contrary opinion. The\r\nquestion is still subjudice, and an appeal to the court of last resort\r\nwill decide it finally. If finally the judiciary shall declare that\r\nit does not belong to the civil authority, it then results to the\r\nexecutive, charged with the direction of the military force of the\r\nUnion, and the conduct of its affairs with foreign nations. But this\r\nis a mere question of internal arrangement between the different\r\ndepartments of the government, depending on the particular diction\r\nof the laws and constitution; and it can in no wise concern a foreign\r\nnation to which department these have delegated it.\r\n\r\n3. Mr. Genet, in his letter of July the 9th, requires that the ship\r\nJane, which he calls an English privateer, shall be immediately ordered\r\nto depart; and to justify this, he appeals to the 22nd article of our\r\ntreaty, which provides that it shall not be lawful for any foreign\r\nprivateer to fit their ships in our ports, to sell what they have taken,\r\nor purchase victuals, &c. The ship Jane is an English merchant vessel,\r\nwhich has been many years employed in the commerce between Jamaica and\r\nthese States. She brought here a cargo of produce from that island,\r\nand was to take away a cargo of flour. Knowing of the war when she left\r\nJamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she\r\narmed for her defence, and took one of those commissions usually called\r\nletters of marque. She arrived here safely without having had any\r\nreencounter of any sort. Can it be necessary to say that a merchant\r\nvessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in\r\ntime of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes\r\nher a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war,\r\nwith a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier? The\r\noccupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant\r\nvessel is commerce and self-preservation. The article excludes the\r\nformer from our ports, and from selling what she has taken, that is what\r\nshe has acquired by war, to show it did not mean the merchant vessel and\r\nwhat she had acquired by commerce. Were the merchant vessels coming\r\nfor our produce forbidden to have any arms for their defence, every\r\nadventurer who had a boat, or money enough to buy one, would make her a\r\nprivateer, our coasts would swarm with them, foreign vessels must cease\r\nto come, our commerce must be suppressed, our produce remain on our\r\nhands, or at least that great portion of it which we have not vessels to\r\ncarry away, our ploughs must be laid aside, and agriculture suspended.\r\nThis is a sacrifice no treaty could ever contemplate, and which we are\r\nnot disposed to make out of mere complaisance to a false definition of\r\nthe term privateer. Finding that the Jane had purchased new carriages to\r\nmount two or three additional guns, which she had brought in her hold,\r\nand that she had opened additional port-holes for them, the carriages\r\nwere ordered to be relanded, the additional port-holes stopped, and her\r\nmeans of defence reduced, to be exactly the same at her departure as at\r\nher arrival. This was done on the general principle of allowing no party\r\nto arm within our ports.\r\n\r\n4. The seventeenth article of our treaty leaves armed vessels free to\r\nconduct, whithersoever they please, the ships and goods taken from their\r\nenemies without paying any duty, and to depart and be conducted freely\r\nto the places expressed in their commissions, which the captain shall be\r\nobliged to show. It is evident, that this article does not contemplate\r\na freedom to sell their prizes here; but on the contrary, a departure\r\nto some other place, always to be expressed in their commission, where\r\ntheir validity is to be finally adjudged. In such case, it would be as\r\nunreasonable to demand duties on the goods they had taken from an enemy,\r\nas it would be on the cargo of a merchant vessel touching in our ports\r\nfor refreshment or advices; and against this the article provides. But\r\nthe armed vessels of France have been also admitted to land and sell\r\ntheir prize-goods here for a consumption, in which case, it is as\r\nreasonable they should pay duties, as the goods of a merchantman landed\r\nand sold for consumption. They have however demanded, and as a matter\r\nof right, to sell them free of duty, a right, they say, given by this\r\narticle of the treaty, though the article does not give the right\r\nto sell at all. Where a treaty does not give the principal right of\r\nselling, the additional one of selling duty free cannot be given: and\r\nthe laws, in admitting the principal right of selling, may withhold\r\nthe additional one of selling duty free. It must be observed, that our\r\nrevenues are raised almost wholly on imported goods. Suppose prize-goods\r\nenough should be brought in to supply our whole consumption. According\r\nto their construction we are to lose our whole revenue. I put the\r\nextreme case to evince, more extremely, the unreasonableness of the\r\nclaim. Partial supplies would affect the revenue but partially. They\r\nwould lessen the evil, but not the error, of the construction: and\r\nI believe we may say, with truth, that neither party had it in\r\ncontemplation, when penning this article, to abandon any part of its\r\nrevenue for the encouragement of the sea-robbers of the other.\r\n\r\n5. Another source of complaint with Mr. Genet has been, that the English\r\ntake French goods out of American vessels, which he says is against the\r\nlaw of nations, and ought to be prevented by us. On the contrary, we\r\nsuppose it to have been long an established principle of the law of\r\nnations, that the goods of a friend are free in an enemy’s vessel,\r\nand an enemy’s goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend. The\r\ninconvenience of this principle, which subjects merchant vessels to\r\nbe stopped at sea, searched, ransacked, led out of their course, has\r\ninduced several nations latterly to stipulate against it by treaty, and\r\nto substitute another in its stead, that free bottoms shall make free\r\ngoods, and enemy bottoms enemy goods; a rule equal to the other in point\r\nof loss and gain, but less oppressive to commerce. As far as it has\r\nbeen introduced, it depends on the treaties stipulating it, and forms\r\nexceptions, in special cases, to the general operation of the law of\r\nnations. We have introduced it into our treaties with France, Holland,\r\nand Prussia; and French goods found by the two latter nations in\r\nAmerican bottoms are not made prize of. It is our wish to establish it\r\nwith other nations. But this requires their consent also, is a work of\r\ntime, and in the mean while, they have a right to act on the general\r\nprinciple, without giving to us or to France cause of complaint. Nor do\r\nI see that France can lose by if on the whole. For though she loses\r\nher goods when found in our vessels by the nations with whom we have no\r\ntreaties, yet she gains our goods, when found in the vessels of the same\r\nand all other nations: and we believe the latter mass to be greater than\r\nthe former. It is to be lamented, indeed, that the general principle has\r\noperated so cruelly in the dreadful calamity which has lately happened\r\nin St. Domingo. The miserable fugitives, who, to save their lives, had\r\ntaken asylum in our vessels, with such valuable and portable things as\r\ncould be gathered in the moment out of the ashes of their houses and\r\nwrecks of their fortunes, have been plundered of these remains by\r\nthe licensed sea-rovers of their enemies. This has swelled, on this\r\noccasion, the disadvantages of the general principle, that ‘an enemy’s\r\ngoods are free prize in the vessels of a friend.’ But it is one of those\r\ndeplorable and unforeseen calamities to which they expose themselves who\r\nenter into a state of war, furnishing to us an awful lesson to avoid it\r\nby justice and moderation, and not a cause or encouragement to expose\r\nour own towns to the same burnings and butcheries, nor of complaint\r\nbecause we do not.\r\n\r\n6. In a case like the present, where the missionary of one government\r\nconstrues differently from that to which he is sent, the treaties and\r\nlaws which are to form a common rule of action for both, it would be\r\nunjust in either to claim an exclusive right of construction. Each\r\nnation has an equal right to expound the meaning of their common rules;\r\nand reason and usage have established, in such cases, a convenient and\r\nwell understood train of proceeding. It is the right and duty of the\r\nforeign missionary to urge his own constructions, to support them with\r\nreasons which may convince, and in terms of decency and respect which\r\nmay reconcile the government of the country to a concurrence. It is the\r\nduty of that government to listen to his reasonings with attention and\r\ncandor, and to yield to them when just. But if it shall still appear to\r\nthem that reason and right are on their side, it follows of necessity,\r\nthat exercising the sovereign powers of the country, they have a right\r\nto proceed on their own constructions and conclusions as to whatever is\r\nto be done within their limits. The minister then refers the case to his\r\nown government, asks new instructions, and, in the mean time,\r\nacquiesces in the authority of the country. His government examines his\r\nconstructions, abandons them if wrong, insists on them if right, and the\r\ncase then becomes a matter of negotiation between the two nations. Mr.\r\nGenet, however, assumes a new and bolder line of conduct. After deciding\r\nfor himself ultimately, and without respect to the authority of the\r\ncountry, he proceeds to do what even his sovereign could not authorize,\r\nto put himself within the country on a line with its government, to act\r\nas co-sovereign of the territory; he arms vessels, levies men, gives\r\ncommissions of war, independently of them, and in direct opposition to\r\ntheir orders and efforts. When the government forbids their citizens to\r\narm and engage in the war, he undertakes to arm and engage them. When\r\nthey forbid vessels to be fitted in their ports for cruising on nations\r\nwith whom they are at peace, he commissions them to fit and cruise.\r\nWhen they forbid an unceded jurisdiction to be exercised within their\r\nterritory by foreign agents, he undertakes to uphold that exercise, and\r\nto avow it openly. The privateers Citoyen Genet and Sans Culottes having\r\nbeen fitted out at Charleston (though without the permission of the\r\ngovernment, yet before it was forbidden) the President only required\r\nthey might leave our ports, and did not interfere with their prizes.\r\nInstead, however, of their quitting our ports, the Sans Culottes remains\r\nstill, strengthening and equipping herself, and the Citoyen Genet went\r\nout only to cruise on our coast, and to brave the authority of the\r\ncountry by returning into port again with her prizes. Though in the\r\nletter of June the 5th, the final determination of the President was\r\ncommunicated, that no future armaments in our ports should be permitted,\r\nthe Vainqueur de la Bastille was afterwards equipped and commissioned in\r\nCharleston, the Anti-George in Savannah, the Carmagnole in Delaware,\r\na schooner and a sloop in Boston, and the Polly or Republican was\r\nattempted to be equipped in New York, and was the subject of reclamation\r\nby Mr. Genet, in a style which certainly did not look like relinquishing\r\nthe practice. The Little Sarah or Little Democrat was armed, equipped,\r\nand manned, in the port of Philadelphia, under the very eye of the\r\ngovernment, as if meant to insult it. Having fallen down the river, and\r\nbeing evidently on the point of departure for a cruise, Mr. Genet was\r\ndesired in my letter of July the 2th, on the part of the President,\r\nto detain her till some inquiry and determination on the case should\r\nbe had. Yet within three or four days after, she was sent out by orders\r\nfrom Mr. Genet himself, and is, at this time, cruising on our coasts, as\r\nappears by the protest of the master of one of our vessels maltreated by\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe government thus insulted and set at defiance by Mr. Genet, and\r\ncommitted in its duties and engagements to others, determined still to\r\nsee in these proceedings but the character of the individual, and not to\r\nbelieve, and it does not believe, that they are by instructions from his\r\nemployers. They had assured the British Minister here, that the vessels\r\nalready armed in our ports should be obliged to leave them, and that no\r\nmore should be armed in them. Yet more had been armed, and those before\r\narmed had either not gone away, or gone only to return with new prizes.\r\nThey now informed him that the order for departure should be enforced,\r\nand the prizes made contrary to it should be restored or compensated.\r\nThe same thing was notified to Mr. Genet in my letter of August the 7th,\r\nand that he might not conclude the promise of compensation to be of no\r\nconcern to him, and go on in his courses, he was reminded that it would\r\nbe a fair article of account against his nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Genet, not content with using our force, whether we will or not, in\r\nthe military line against nations with whom we are at peace, undertakes\r\nalso to direct the civil government; and particularly, for the executive\r\nand legislative bodies, to pronounce what powers may or may not be\r\nexercised by the one or the other. Thus in his letter of June the 8th,\r\nhe promises to respect the political opinions of the President, till\r\nthe Representatives shall have confirmed or rejected them; as if the\r\nPresident had undertaken to decide what belonged to the decision of\r\nCongress. In his letter of June the 4th, he says more openly, that the\r\nPresident ought not to have taken on himself to decide on the subject\r\nof the letter, but that it was of importance enough to have consulted\r\nCongress thereon; and in that of June the 22nd, he tells the President\r\nin direct terms, that Congress ought already to have been occupied on\r\ncertain questions which he had been too hasty in deciding: thus making\r\nhimself, and not the President, the judge of the powers ascribed by the\r\nconstitution to the executive, and dictating to him the occasion when he\r\nshould exercise the power of convening Congress at an earlier day than\r\ntheir own act had prescribed.\r\n\r\nOn the following expressions no commentary shall be made.\r\n\r\nJuly 9. ‘Les principes philosophiques proclames par le Président.’\r\n\r\nJune 22. ‘Les opinions privées ou publiques de M. le Président, et cette\r\négide ne paroissant pas suffisante.’\r\n\r\nJune 22. ‘Le gouvernement fédéral s’est empressé, poussé par je ne se gais\r\nquelle influence.’\r\n\r\nJune 22. ‘Je ne puis attribuer des démarches de cette nature qu’a des\r\nimpressions étrangeres dont le terns et la vérité triompheront.’\r\n\r\nJune 25. ‘On poursuit avec acharnement, en vertu des instructions de M.\r\nle Président, les armateurs Francais.’\r\n\r\nJune 14. ‘Ce refus tend a accomplir le système infernal du roi\r\nd’Angleterre, et des autres rois ses accomplices, pour faire perir par\r\nla famine les Républicans Francais avec la liberté.\r\n\r\nJune 8. ‘La lache abandon de ses amis.’\r\n\r\nJuly 25. ‘En vain le desirde conserver la paix fait-il sacrifier les\r\ninterets de la France a cet interêt du moment; en vain la soif des\r\nrichesses l’emporte-t-elle sur l’honneur dans la balance politique de\r\nl’Amérique. Tous ces menagemens, toute cette condescendance, toute cette\r\nhumilité n’aboutissent a rien: nos ennemis en rient, et les Francais\r\ntrop confiants sont punis pour avoir cru que la nation Américaine\r\navoit un pavilion, qu’elle avoit quelque egard pours ses loix, quelque\r\nconviction de ses forces, et qu’elle tenoit au sentiment de sa dignité.\r\nIl ne m’est pas possible de peindre toute ma sensibilité sur ce\r\nscandale, qui tend à la diminution de votre commerce, à l’oppression\r\ndu notre, et à l’abaissement, à l’avilissement des republiques. Si nos\r\nconcitoyens ont été trompes, si vous n’êtes point en état de soutenir la\r\nsouveraineté de votre peuple, parlez; nous l’avons garantie quand\r\nnous étions esclaves, nous saurons la rendre rédoubtable étant devenus\r\nlibres.’ We draw a veil over the sensations which these expressions\r\nexcite. No words can render them; but they will not escape the\r\nsensibility of a friendly and magnanimous nation, who will do us\r\njustice. We see in them neither the portrait of ourselves, nor the\r\npencil of our friends; but an attempt to embroil both; to add still\r\nanother nation to the enemies of his country, and to draw on both a\r\nreproach, which it is hoped will never stain the history of either.\r\nThe written proofs, of which Mr. Genet was himself the bearer, were\r\ntoo unequivocal to leave a doubt that the French nation are constant in\r\ntheir friendship to us. The resolves of their National Convention, the\r\nletters of their Executive Council attest this truth, in terms which\r\nrender it necessary to seek in some other hypothesis, the solution of\r\nMr. Genet’s machinations against our peace and friendship.\r\n\r\nConscious, on our part, of the same friendly and sincere dispositions,\r\nwe can with truth affirm, both for our nation and government, that we\r\nhave never omitted a reasonable occasion of manifesting them. For I will\r\nnot consider as of that character, opportunities of sallying forth from\r\nour ports to way-lay, rob, and murder defenceless merchants and others,\r\nwho have done us no injury, and who were coming to trade with us in\r\nthe confidence of our peace and amity. The violation of all the laws of\r\norder and morality which bind mankind together, would be an unacceptable\r\noffering to a just nation. Recurring then only to recent things, after\r\nso afflicting a libel we recollect with satisfaction, that in the course\r\nof two years, by unceasing exertions, we paid up seven years’ arrearages\r\nand instalments of our debt to France, which the inefficiency of our\r\nfirst form of government had suffered to be accumulating: that\r\npressing on still to the entire fulfilment of our engagements, we have\r\nfacilitated to Mr. Genet the effect of the instalments of the present\r\nyear, to enable him to send relief to his fellow citizens in France,\r\nthreatened with famine: that in the first moment of the insurrection\r\nwhich threatened the colony of St. Domingo, we stepped forward to their\r\nrelief with arms and money, taking freely on ourselves the risk of\r\nan unauthorized aid, when delay would have been denial: that we have\r\nreceived, according to our best abilities, the wretched fugitives from\r\nthe catastrophe of the principal town of that colony, who, escaping from\r\nthe swords and flames of civil war, threw themselves on us naked\r\nand houseless, without food or friends, money or other means, their\r\nfaculties lost and absorbed in the depth of their distresses: that\r\nthe exclusive admission to sell here the prizes made by France on her\r\nenemies, in the present war, though unstipulated in our treaties,\r\nand unfounded in her own practice or in that of other nations, as\r\nwe believe; the spirit manifested by the late grand jury in their\r\nproceedings against those who had aided the enemies of France with arms\r\nand implements of war; the expressions of attachment to his nation, with\r\nwhich Mr. Genet was welcomed on his arrival and journey from south to\r\nnorth, and our long forbearance under his gross usurpations and\r\noutrages of the laws and authority of our country, do not bespeak the\r\npartialities intimated in his letters. And for these things he rewards\r\nus by endeavors to excite discord and distrust between our citizens\r\nand those whom they have entrusted with their government, between the\r\ndifferent branches of our government, between our nation and his.\r\nBut none of these things, we hope, will be found in his power. That\r\nfriendship which dictates to us to bear with his conduct yet a while,\r\nlest the interests of his nation here should suffer injury, will\r\nhasten them to replace an agent, whose dispositions are such a\r\nmisrepresentation of theirs, and whose continuance here is inconsistent\r\nwith order, peace, respect, and that friendly correspondence which we\r\nhope will ever subsist between the two nations. His government will see\r\ntoo that the case is pressing. That it is impossible for two sovereign\r\nand independent authorities to be going on within our territory at\r\nthe same time, without collision. They will foresee that if Mr. Genet\r\nperseveres in his proceedings, the consequences would be so hazardous\r\nto us, the example so humiliating and pernicious, that we may be forced\r\neven to suspend his functions before a successor can arrive to continue\r\nthem. If our citizens have not already been shedding each other’s blood,\r\nit is not owing to the moderation of Mr. Genet, but to the forbearance\r\nof the government. It is well known that if the authority of the laws\r\nhad been resorted to, to stop the Little Democrat, its officers and\r\nagents were to have been resisted by the crew of the vessel, consisting\r\npartly of American citizens. Such events are too serious, too possible,\r\nto be left to hazard, or to what is more than hazard, the will of an\r\nagent whose designs are so mysterious.\r\n\r\nLay the case then immediately before his government. Accompany it with\r\nassurances, which cannot be stronger than true, that our friendship for\r\nthe nation is constant and unabating; that faithful to our treaties,\r\nwe have fulfilled them in every point to the best of our understanding;\r\nthat if in any thing, however, we have construed them amiss, we are\r\nready to enter into candid explanations, and to do whatever we can be\r\nconvinced is right; that in opposing the extravagances of an agent,\r\nwhose character they seem not sufficiently to, have known, we have\r\nbeen urged by motives of duty to ourselves and justice to others, which\r\ncannot but be approved by those who are just themselves; and finally,\r\nthat after independence and self-government, there is nothing we more\r\nsincerely wish than perpetual friendship with them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.*\r\n\r\n     * A copy of the preceding letter was sent, enclosed by the\r\n     Secretary of State, to Mr. Genet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIV.--CIRCULAR TO THE MERCHANTS OF THE U.S., August 23, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR TO THE MERCHANTS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 23, 1793,\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nComplaint having been made to the government of the United States, of\r\nsome instances of unjustifiable vexation and spoliation committed on our\r\nmerchant vessels by the privateers of the powers at war, and it being\r\npossible that other instances may have happened of which no information\r\nhas been given to the government, I have it in charge from the President\r\nto assure the merchants of the United States, concerned in foreign\r\ncommerce or navigation, that due attention will be paid to any injuries\r\nthey may suffer on the high seas or in foreign countries, contrary to\r\nthe law of nations or to existing treaties: and that on their forwarding\r\nhither well authenticated evidence of the same, proper proceedings will\r\nbe adopted for their relief.

GORE, September 2, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GORE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 2, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe President is informed through the channel of a letter from yourself\r\nto Mr. Lear, that M. Duplaine, Consul of France at Boston, has lately,\r\nwith an armed force, seized and rescued a vessel from the officer of\r\na court of justice, by process from which she was under arrest in his\r\ncustody: and that he has in like manner, with an armed force, opposed\r\nand prevented the officer, charged with process from a court against\r\nanother vessel, from serving that process. This daring violation of the\r\nlaws requires the more attention, as it is by a foreigner clothed with\r\na public character, arrogating an unfounded right to admiralty\r\njurisdiction, and probably meaning to assert it by this act of force.\r\nYou know that by the law of nations, consuls are not diplomatic\r\ncharacters, and have no immunities whatever against the laws of the\r\nland. To put this altogether out of dispute, a clause was inserted in\r\nour consular convention with France, making them amenable to the laws of\r\nthe land, as other inhabitants. Consequently, M. Duplaine is liable\r\nto arrest, imprisonment, and other punishments, even capital, as other\r\nforeign subjects resident here. The President therefore desires that you\r\nwill immediately institute such a prosecution against him, as the laws\r\nwill warrant. If there be any doubt as to the character of his offence,\r\nwhether of a higher or lower grade, it will be best to prosecute for\r\nthat which will admit the least doubt, because an acquittal, though it\r\nmight be founded merely on the opinion that the grade of offence with\r\nwhich he is charged is higher than his act would support, yet it might\r\nbe construed by the uninformed to be a judiciary decision against his\r\namenability to the law, or perhaps in favor of the jurisdiction these\r\nConsuls are assuming. The process, therefore, should be of the surest\r\nkind, and all the proceedings well grounded. In particular, if an\r\narrest, as is probable, be the first step, it should be so managed as\r\nto leave room neither for escape nor rescue. It should be attended with\r\nevery mark of respect, consistent with safe custody, and his confinement\r\nas mild and comfortable also, as that would permit. These are the\r\ndistinctions to which a Consul is entitled, that is to say, of a\r\nparticular decorum of deportment towards him, indicative of respect to\r\nthe sovereign whose officer he is.\r\n\r\nThe President also desires you will immediately obtain the best evidence\r\nit shall be in your power to procure, under oath or affirmation, of\r\nthe transaction stated in your letter, and that in this, you consider\r\nyourself as acting as much on behalf of M. Duplaine as the public, the\r\ncandid truth of the case being exactly that which is desired, as it may\r\nbe the foundation of an act, the justice of which should be beyond all\r\nquestion. This evidence I shall be glad to receive with as few days, or\r\neven hours, of delay as possible.\r\n\r\nI am also instructed to ask the favor of you to communicate copies of\r\nany memorials, representations, or other written correspondence which\r\nmay have passed between the Governor and yourself, with respect to the\r\nprivateers and prizes which have been the subject of your letters to Mr.\r\nLear.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVI.--TO MR. HAMMOND, September 5, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 5, 1793.\r\n\r\nI am honored with yours of August the 30th. Mine of the 7th of that\r\nmonth assured you that measures were taking for excluding from all\r\nfurther asylum in our ports, vessels armed in them to cruise on nations\r\nwith which we are at peace, and for the restoration of the prizes,\r\nthe Lovely Lass, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin and that\r\nshould the measures for restitution fail in their effect, the President\r\nconsiders it as incumbent on the United States, to make compensation for\r\nthe vessels. We are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent\r\nnations, by all the means in our power to protect and defend their\r\nvessels and effects in our ports or waters, or on the seas near our\r\nshores, and to recover and restore the same to the right owners when\r\ntaken from them. If all the means in our power are used and fail in\r\ntheir effect, we are not bound by our treaties with those nations to\r\nmake compensation.\r\n\r\nThough we have no similar treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion\r\nof the President that we should use towards that nation the same rule,\r\nwhich, under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and\r\neven to extend it to captures made on the high seas and brought into our\r\nports, if done by vessels which had been armed within them.\r\n\r\nHaving, for particular reasons, forborne to use all the measures in our\r\npower for the restitution of the three vessels mentioned in my letter of\r\nAugust the 7th, the President thought it incumbent on the United States\r\nto make compensation for them: and though nothing was said in that\r\nletter of other vessels taken under like circumstances, and brought in\r\nafter the 5th of June and before the date of that letter, yet where\r\nthe same forbearance had taken place, it was and is his opinion that\r\ncompensation would be equally due.\r\n\r\nAs to prizes made under the same circumstances, and brought in after the\r\ndate of that letter, the President determined that all the means in\r\nour power should be used for their restitution If these fail us, as we\r\nshould not be bound by our treaties to make compensation to the other\r\npowers, in the analogous case he did not mean to give an opinion that it\r\nought to be done to Great Britain. But still, if any cases shall arise\r\nsubsequent to that date the circumstances of which shall place them\r\non similar ground with those before it, the President would think\r\ncompensation equally incumbent on the United States.\r\n\r\nInstructions are given to the Governors of the different States, to\r\nuse all the means in their power for restoring prizes of this last\r\ndescription, found within their ports. Though they will of course take\r\nmeasures to be informed of them, and the General Government has given\r\nthem the aid of the Custom House officers for this purpose, yet you\r\nwill be sensible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their\r\ninformation, as far as shall depend on yourself or any person under\r\nyour direction, in order that the government may use the means in their\r\npower, for making restitution. Without knowledge of the capture, they\r\ncannot restore it. It will always be best to give the notice to them\r\ndirectly: but any information which you shall be pleased to send to me\r\nalso, at any time, shall be forwarded to them as quickly as the\r\ndistance will permit. Hence you will perceive, Sir, that the President\r\ncontemplates restitution or compensation, in the cases before the\r\nseventh of August, and, after that date, restitution, if it can be\r\neffected by any means in our power: and that it will be important that\r\nyou should substantiate the fact that such prizes are in our ports or\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nYour list of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports, is, I believe,\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nWith respect to losses by detention, waste, spoliation, sustained by\r\nvessels taken as before mentioned between the dates of June the 5th\r\nand August the 7th, it is proposed, as a provisional measure, that the\r\ncollector of the customs of the district, and the British Consul, or any\r\nother person you please, shall appoint persons to establish the value of\r\nthe vessel and cargo, at the times of her capture and of her arrival\r\nin the port into which she is brought, according to their value in that\r\nport. If this shall be agreeable to you, and you will be pleased to\r\nsignify it to me, with the names of the prizes understood to be of this\r\ndescription, instructions will be given, accordingly, to the collectors\r\nof the customs where the respective vessels are.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVII.--TO MR. PINCKNEY, September 7,1793\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 7,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nWe have received, through a channel which cannot be considered as\r\nauthentic, the copy of a paper, styled ‘Additional instructions to the\r\ncommanders of his Majesty’s ships of war and privateers, &c.’ dated at\r\nSt. James’s, June 8, 1793. If this paper be authentic, I have little\r\ndoubt but that you will have taken measures to forward it to me. But\r\nas your communication of it may miscarry, and time in the meanwhile be\r\nlost, it has been thought better that it should be supposed authentic:\r\nthat on that supposition I should notice to you its very exceptionable\r\nnature, and the necessity of obtaining explanations on the subject\r\nfrom the British government; desiring at the same time, that you will\r\nconsider this letter as provisionally written only, and as if never\r\nwritten, in the event that the paper which is the occasion of it be not\r\ngenuine.\r\n\r\nThe first article of it permits all vessels, laden wholly or in part\r\nwith corn, flour, or meal, bound to any port in France, to be stopped,\r\nand sent into any British port, to be purchased by that government, or\r\nto be released only on the condition of security given by the master,\r\nthat he will proceed to dispose of his cargo in the ports of some\r\ncountry in amity with his Majesty.\r\n\r\nThis article is so manifestly contrary to the law of nations, that\r\nnothing more would seem necessary than to observe that it is so. Reason\r\nand usage have established that when two nations go to war, those who\r\nchoose to live in peace retain their natural right to pursue their\r\nagriculture, manufactures, and other ordinary vocations, to carry the\r\nproduce of their industry for exchange to all nations, belligerent or\r\nneutral, as usual, to go and come freely without injury or molestation,\r\nand in short, that the war among others shall be, for them, as if it did\r\nnot exist. One restriction on their natural rights has been submitted\r\nto by nations at peace, that is to say, that of not furnishing to either\r\nparty implements merely of war for the annoyance of the other, nor any\r\nthing whatever to a place blockaded by its enemy. What these implements\r\nof war are, has been so often agreed and is so well understood as to\r\nleave little question about them at this day. There does not exist,\r\nperhaps, a nation in our common hemisphere, which has not made a\r\nparticular enumeration of them in some or all of their treaties, under\r\nthe name of contraband. It suffices for the present occasion, to say,\r\nthat corn, flour, and meal are not of the class of contraband, and\r\nconsequently remain articles of free commerce. A culture which, like\r\nthat of the soil, gives employment to such a proportion of mankind,\r\ncould never be suspended by the whole earth, or interrupted for them,\r\nwhenever any two nations should think proper to go to war.\r\n\r\nThe state of war then existing between Great Britain and France,\r\nfurnishes no legitimate right either to interrupt the agriculture of\r\nthe United States, or the peaceable exchange of its produce with all\r\nnations; and consequently, the assumption of it will be as lawful\r\nhereafter as now, in peace as in war. No ground, acknowledged by the\r\ncommon reason of mankind, authorizes this act now, and unacknowledged\r\nground may be taken at any time, and at all times. We see then a\r\npractice begun, to which no time, no circumstances prescribe any\r\nlimits, and which strikes at the root of our agriculture, that branch\r\nof industry which gives food, clothing, and comfort to the great mass of\r\nthe inhabitants of these States. If any nation whatever has a right to\r\nshut up to our produce all the ports of the earth except her own and\r\nthose of her friends, she may shut up these also, and so confine us\r\nwithin our own limits. No nation can subscribe to such pretensions; no\r\nnation can agree, at the mere will or interest of another, to have its\r\npeaceable industry suspended, and its citizens reduced to idleness and\r\nWant. The loss of our produce destined for foreign markets, or that loss\r\nwhich would result from an arbitrary restraint of our markets, is a tax\r\ntoo serious for us to acquiesce in. It is not enough for a nation\r\nto say, we and our friends will buy your produce. We have a right to\r\nanswer, that it suits us better to sell to their enemies as well as\r\ntheir friends. Our ships do not go to France to return empty. They go to\r\nexchange the surplus of one produce which we can spare, for surplusses\r\nof other kinds which they can spare and we want; which they can furnish\r\non better terms, and more to our mind, than Great Britain or her\r\nfriends. We have a right to judge for ourselves what market best suits\r\nus, and they have none to forbid to us the enjoyment of the necessaries\r\nand comforts which we may obtain from any other independent country.\r\n\r\nThis act, too, tends directly to draw us from that state of peace\r\nin which we are wishing to remain. It is an essential character of\r\nneutrality to furnish no aids (not stipulated by treaty) to one party,\r\nwhich we are not equally ready to furnish to the other. If we permit\r\ncorn to be sent to Great Britain and her friends, we are equally bound\r\nto permit it to France. To restrain it would be a partiality which\r\nmight lead to war with France; and between restraining it ourselves, and\r\npermitting her enemies to restrain it unrightfully, is no difference.\r\nShe would consider this as a mere pretext, of which she would not be the\r\ndupe; and on what honorable ground could we otherwise explain it?\r\nThus we should see ourselves plunged by this unauthorized act of Great\r\nBritain into a war with which we meddle not, and which we wish to avoid,\r\nif justice to all parties and from all parties will enable us to avoid\r\nit. In the case where we found ourselves obliged by treaty to withhold\r\nfrom the enemies of France the right of arming in our ports, we thought\r\nourselves in justice bound to withhold the same right from France also,\r\nand we did it. Were we to withhold from her supplies of provisions, we\r\nshould in like manner be bound to withhold them from her enemies also;\r\nand thus shut to ourselves all the ports of Europe where corn is in\r\ndemand, or make ourselves parties in the war. This is a dilemma which\r\nGreat Britain has no right to force upon us, and for which no pretext\r\ncan be found in any part of our conduct. She may indeed feel the desire\r\nof starving an enemy nation: but she can have no right of doing it at\r\nour loss, nor of making us the instruments of it.\r\n\r\nThe President therefore desires, that you will immediately enter into\r\nexplanations on this subject with the British government. Lay before\r\nthem in friendly and temperate terms all the demonstrations of the\r\ninjury done us by this act, and endeavor to obtain a revocation of it,\r\nand full indemnification, to any citizens of these States who may have\r\nsuffered by it in the mean time. Accompany your representations by every\r\nassurance of our earnest desire to live on terms of the best friendship\r\nand harmony with them, and to found our expectations of justice on their\r\npart, on a strict observance of it on ours.\r\n\r\nIt is with concern, however, I am obliged to observe, that so marked has\r\nbeen the inattention of the British court to every application which\r\nhas been made to them on any subject, by this government (not a single\r\nanswer I believe having ever been given to one of them, except in\r\nthe act of exchanging a minister), that it may become unavoidable, in\r\ncertain cases, where an answer of some sort is necessary, to consider\r\ntheir silence as an answer. Perhaps this is their intention. Still,\r\nhowever, desirous of furnishing no color of offence, we do not wish you\r\nto name to them any term for giving an answer. Urge one as much as you\r\ncan without commitment, and on the first day of December be so good as\r\nto give us information of the state in which this matter is, that it may\r\nbe received during the session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the same instruction allows the armed vessels\r\nof Great Britain to seize for condemnation all vessels, on their first\r\nattempt to enter a blockaded port, except those of Denmark and Sweden,\r\nwhich are to be prevented only, but not seized, on their first attempt.\r\nOf the nations inhabiting the shores of the Atlantic ocean, and\r\npractising its navigation, Denmark, Sweden, and the United States alone\r\nare neutral. To declare then all neutral vessels (for as to the vessels\r\nof the belligerent powers no order was necessary) to be legal prize,\r\nwhich shall attempt to enter a blockaded port, except those of Denmark\r\nand Sweden, is exactly to declare that the vessels of the United States\r\nshall be lawful prize, and those of Denmark and Sweden shall not. It\r\nis of little consequence that the article has avoided naming the United\r\nStates, since it has used a description applicable to them, and to them\r\nalone, while it exempts the others from its operation by name. You will\r\nbe pleased to ask an explanation of this distinction: and you will be\r\nable to say, in discussing its justice, that in every circumstance, we\r\ntreat Great Britain on the footing of the most favored nation where our\r\ntreaties do not preclude us, and that even these are just as favorable\r\nto her, as hers are to us. Possibly she may be bound by treaty to admit\r\nthis exception in favor of Denmark and Sweden. But she cannot be bound\r\nby treaty to withhold it from us. And if it be withheld merely because\r\nnot established with us by treaty, what might not we, on the same\r\nground, have withheld from Great Britain during the short course of the\r\npresent war, as well as the peace which preceded it?\r\n\r\nWhether these explanations with the British government shall be verbal\r\nor in writing, is left to yourself. Verbal communications are very\r\ninsecure; for it is only to deny them or to change their terms, in order\r\nto do away their effect at any time. Those in writing have as many and\r\nobvious advantages, and ought to be preferred, unless there be obstacles\r\nof which we are not apprized. I have the honor to be, with great and\r\nsincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVIII.--TO MR. HAMMOND, September 9, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 9, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your two memorials of the\r\n4th and 6th instant, which have been duly laid before the President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nYou cannot be uninformed of the circumstances which have occasioned\r\nthe French squadron now in New York to seek asylum in the ports of\r\nthe United States. Driven from those where they were on duty, by the\r\nsuperiority of the adverse party in the civil war which has so unhappily\r\nafflicted the colonies of France, filled with the wretched fugitives\r\nfrom the same scenes of distress and desolation, without water or\r\nprovisions for the shortest voyage, their vessels scarcely in a\r\ncondition to keep the sea at all, they were forced to seek the nearest\r\nports in which they could be received and supplied with necessaries.\r\nThat they have ever been out again to cruise, is a fact we have never\r\nlearned, and which we believe to be impossible, from the information\r\nreceived of their wants and other impediments to active service. This\r\ncase has been noted specially, to show that no inconvenience can have\r\nbeen produced to the trade of the other belligerent powers, by the\r\npresence of this fleet in our harbors. I shall now proceed to more\r\ngeneral ground.\r\n\r\nFrance, England, and all other nations have a right to cruise on our\r\ncoasts; a right not derived from our permission, but from the law of\r\nnature. To render this more advantageous, France has secured to herself,\r\nby a treaty with us, (as she has done also by a treaty with Great\r\nBritain, in the event of a war with us or any other nation) two special\r\nrights. 1. Admission for her prizes and privateers into our ports.\r\nThis, by the seventeenth and twenty-second articles, is secured to her\r\nexclusively of her enemies, as is done for her in the like case by\r\nGreat Britain, were her present war with us instead of Great Britain.\r\n2. Admission for her public vessels of war into our ports, in cases\r\nof stress of weather, pirates, enemies, or other urgent necessity, to\r\nrefresh, victual, repair, &c. This is not exclusive. As then we are\r\nbound by treaty to receive the public armed vessels of France, and\r\nare not bound to exclude those of her enemies, the executive has never\r\ndenied the same right of asylum in our ports to the public armed vessels\r\nof your nation. They, as well as the French, are free to come into them\r\nin all cases of weather, piracies, enemies, or other urgent necessity,\r\nand to refresh, victual, repair, &c. And so many are these urgent\r\nnecessities, to vessels far from their own ports, that we have thought\r\ninquiries into the nature as well as the degree of the necessities,\r\nwhich drive them hither, as endless as they would be fruitless, and\r\ntherefore have not made them. And the rather, because there is a third\r\nright, secured to neither by treaty, but due to both on the principles\r\nof hospitality between friendly nations, that of coming into our ports,\r\nnot under the pressure of urgent necessity, but whenever their comfort\r\nor convenience induces them. On this ground, also, the two nations are\r\non a footing.\r\n\r\nAs it has never been conceived that either would detain their ships of\r\nwar in our ports when they were in a condition for action, we have never\r\nconceived it necessary to prescribe any limits to the time of their\r\nstay. Nor can it be viewed as an injury to either party, to let their\r\nenemies lie still in our ports from year’s end to year’s end, if they\r\nchoose it. Thus, then, the public ships of war of both nations enjoy\r\na perfect equality in our ports; first, in cases of urgent necessity;\r\nsecondly, in cases of comfort or convenience; and thirdly, in the time\r\nthey choose to continue; and all a friendly power can ask from another\r\nis, to extend to her the same indulgences which she extends to other\r\nfriendly powers. And though the admission of the prizes and privateers\r\nof France is exclusive, yet it is the effect of treaty made long\r\nago, for valuable considerations, not with a view to the present\r\ncircumstances, nor against any nation in particular, but all in general,\r\nand may, therefore, be faithfully observed without offence to any; and\r\nwe mean faithfully to observe it. The same exclusive article has been\r\nstipulated, as was before observed, by Great Britain in her treaty with\r\nFrance, and indeed is to be found in the treaties between most nations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the usurpation of admiralty jurisdiction by the Consuls\r\nof France, within these States, the honor and rights of the States\r\nthemselves were sufficient motives for the executive to take measures to\r\nprevent its continuance, as soon as they were apprized of it. They\r\nhave been led by particular considerations to await the effect of these\r\nmeasures, believing they would be sufficient; but finding at length they\r\nwere not, such others have been lately taken as can no longer fail to\r\nsuppress this irregularity completely.\r\n\r\nThe President is duly sensible of the character of the act of opposition\r\nmade to the serving of legal process on the brig William Tell, and he\r\npresumes the representations made on that subject to the Minister of\r\nFrance, will have the effect of opening a free access to the officer\r\nof justice, when he shall again present himself with the precept of his\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIX.--TO MR. GENET, September 9, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 9, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of June the 25th, on the subject of the ship William, and\r\ngenerally of vessels suggested to be taken within the limits of the\r\nprotection of the United States by the armed vessels of your nation,\r\nI undertook to assure you it would be more agreeable to the President,\r\nthat such vessels should be detained under the orders of yourself or the\r\nConsul of France, than by a military guard, until the government of the\r\nUnited States should be able to inquire into and decide on the fact. In\r\ntwo separate letters of the 29th of the same month, I had the honor to\r\ninform you of the claims lodged with the executive for the same ship\r\nWilliam and the brig Fanny, to enclose you the evidence on which they\r\nwere founded, and to desire that if you found it just, you would order\r\nthe vessels to be delivered to the owners; or if overweighed in your\r\njudgment by any contradictory evidence which you might have or acquire,\r\nyou would do me the favor to communicate that evidence: and that the\r\nConsuls of France might retain the vessels in their custody, in the\r\nmean time, until the executive of the United States should consider and\r\ndecide finally on the subject.\r\n\r\nWhen that mode of proceeding was consented to for your satisfaction, it\r\nwas by no means imagined it would have occasioned such delays of\r\njustice to the individuals interested. The President is still without\r\ninformation, either that the vessels are restored, or that you have any\r\nevidence to offer as to the place of capture. I am, therefore, Sir, to\r\nrepeat the request of early information on this subject, in order\r\nthat if any injury has been done those interested, it maybe no longer\r\naggravated by delay.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the letter of June the 25th having been, to permit such\r\nvessels to remain in the custody of the Consuls, instead of that of a\r\nmilitary guard (which in the case of the ship William appeared to have\r\nbeen disagreeable to you), the indulgence was of course to be understood\r\nas going only to cases which the executive might take, or keep\r\npossession of, with a military guard, and not to interfere with the\r\nauthority of the courts of justice in any case wherein they should\r\nundertake to act. My letter of June the 29th, accordingly, in the same\r\ncase of the ship William, informed you that no power in this country\r\ncould take a vessel out of the custody of the courts, and that it was\r\nonly because they decided not to take cognizance of that case, that it\r\nresulted to the executive to interfere in it. Consequently, this alone\r\nput it in their power to leave the vessel in the hands of the Consul.\r\nThe courts of justice exercise the sovereignty of this country in\r\njudiciary matters; are supreme in these, and liable neither to control\r\nnor opposition from any other branch of the government. We learn,\r\nhowever, from the enclosed paper, that the Consul of New York, in the\r\nfirst instance, and yourself in a subsequent one, forbid an officer of\r\njustice to serve the process with which he was charged from his court,\r\non the British brig William Tell, taken by a French armed vessel within\r\na mile of our shores, as has been deposed on oath, and brought into New\r\nYork, and that you had even given orders to the French squadron there,\r\nto protect the vessel against any person who should attempt to take\r\nher from their custody. If this opposition were founded, as is there\r\nsuggested, on the indulgence of the letters before cited, it was\r\nextending that to a case not within their purview; and even had it been\r\nprecisely the case to which they were to be applied, is it possible to\r\nimagine you might assert it within the body of the country by force of\r\narms?\r\n\r\nI forbear to make the observations which such a measure must suggest,\r\nand cannot but believe that a moment’s reflection will evince to you\r\nthe depth of the error committed in this opposition to an officer of\r\njustice, and in the means proposed to be resorted to in support of it.\r\nI am therefore charged to declare to you, expressly, that the President\r\nexpects and requires that the officer of justice be not obstructed in\r\nfreely and peaceably serving the process of his court, and that in the\r\nmean time, the vessel and her cargo be not suffered to depart till the\r\njudiciary, if it will undertake it, or himself if not, shall decide\r\nwhether the seizure has been made within the limits of our protection.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXX.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, September 11, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 11, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge yours of May the 19th and 29th, and July 20th;\r\nbeing Nos. 72, 73, and 76. It is long since I wrote to you, because I\r\nknow you must be where you could not receive my letters: and perhaps it\r\nmay be some time before I write to you again, on account of a contagious\r\nand mortal fever which has arisen here, and is driving us all away. It\r\nis called a yellow fever, but is like nothing known or read of by the\r\nphysicians. The week before last the deaths were about forty; the last\r\nweek about eighty; and this week, I think they will be two hundred; and\r\nit goes on spreading. All persons who can find asylum elsewhere, are\r\nflying from the city: this will doubtless extend it to other towns, and\r\nspread it through the country, unless an early winter should stop it.\r\nColonel Hamilton is ill of it, but is on the recovery.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have refused to meet our commissioners unless they would\r\nagree to the Ohio as our boundary, by way of preliminary article. This\r\nbeing impossible, because of the army locations and sales to individuals\r\nbeyond the Ohio, the war is to go on, and we may soon expect to hear of\r\nGeneral Wayne’s being in motion.\r\n\r\nThe President set out yesterday for Mount Vernon, according to\r\nan arrangement of some time ago. General Knox is setting out for\r\nMassachusetts, and I am thinking to go to Virginia in some days. When\r\nand where we shall re-assemble, will depend on the course of this\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem and respect, Dear\r\nSir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXI.--TO MR. GENET, October 3, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 3, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn a former letter which I had the honor of writing you, I mentioned\r\nthat information had been received that M. Duplaine, Vice-Consul of\r\nFrance, at Boston, had been charged with an opposition to the laws of\r\nthe land, of such a character, as, if true, would render it the duty\r\nof the President immediately to revoke the Exequatur, whereby he is\r\npermitted to exercise the functions of Vice-Consul in these United\r\nStates. The fact has been since inquired into, and I now enclose you\r\ncopies of the evidence establishing it; whereby you will perceive how\r\ninconsistent with peace and order it would be, to permit, any longer,\r\nthe exercise of functions in these United States by a person capable\r\nof mistaking their legitimate extent so far, as to oppose, by force of\r\narms, the course of the laws within the body of the country. The\r\nwisdom and justice of the government of France, and their sense of the\r\nnecessity in every government, of preserving the course of the laws\r\nfree and unobstructed, render us confident that they will approve this\r\nnecessary arrestation of the proceedings of one of their agents; as we\r\nwould certainly do in the like case, were any Consul or Vice-Consul\r\nof ours to oppose with an armed force, the course of their laws within\r\ntheir own limits. Still, however, indispensable as this act has been,\r\nit is with the most lively concern, the President has seen that the evil\r\ncould not be arrested otherwise than by an appeal to the authority of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXII.--TO MR. GENET, November 8,1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nGermantown, November 8,1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have now to acknowledge and answer your letter of September the\r\n13th, wherein you desire that we may define the extent of the line of\r\nterritorial protection on the coasts of the United States, observing\r\nthat governments and jurisconsults have different views on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that heretofore, they have been much divided in opinion,\r\nas to the distance from their sea-coast to which they might reasonably\r\nclaim a right of prohibiting the commitment of hostilities. The greatest\r\ndistance to which any respectable assent among nations has been at any\r\ntime given, has been the extent of the human sight, estimated at upwards\r\nof twenty miles; and the smallest distance, I believe, claimed by any\r\nnation whatever, is the utmost range of a cannon ball, usually stated at\r\none sea league. Some intermediate distances have also been insisted\r\non, and that of three sea leagues has some authority in its favor.\r\nThe character of our coast, remarkable in considerable parts of it for\r\nadmitting no vessels of size to pass the shores, would entitle us\r\nin reason to as broad a margin of protected navigation as any nation\r\nwhatever. Not proposing, however, at this time, and without a\r\nrespectful and friendly communication with the powers interested in this\r\nnavigation, to fix on the distance to which we may ultimately insist\r\non the right of protection, the President gives instructions to the\r\nofficers acting under his authority, to consider those heretofore given\r\nthem as restrained, for the present, to the distance of one sea league,\r\nor three geographical miles, from the sea-shore. This distance can admit\r\nof no opposition, as it is recognised by treaties between some of the\r\npowers with whom we are connected in commerce and navigation, and is as\r\nlittle or less than is claimed by any of them on their own coasts.\r\n\r\nFuture occasions will be taken to enter into explanations with them,\r\nas to the ulterior extent to which we may reasonably carry our\r\njurisdiction. For that of the rivers and bays of the United States, the\r\nlaws of the several States are understood to have made provision, and\r\nthey are moreover, as being land-locked, within the body of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nExamining by this rule the case of the British brig Fanny, taken on the\r\n8th of May last, it appears from the evidence that the capture was made\r\nfour or five miles from the land; and consequently, without the line\r\nprovisionally adopted by the President, as before mentioned.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIII.--TO MR. GENET, November 22, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nGermantown, November 22, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of October the 2nd, I took the liberty of noticing to\r\nyou, that the commission of Consul to M. Dannery, ought to have been\r\naddressed to the President of the United States. He being the only\r\nchannel of communication between this country and foreign nations, it is\r\nfrom him alone that foreign nations, or their agents, are to learn what\r\nis or has been the will of the nation, and whatever he communicates as\r\nsuch, they have a right and are bound to consider as the expression\r\nof the nation, and no foreign agent can be allowed to question it, to\r\ninterpose between him and any other branch of government, under the\r\npretext of either’s transgressing their functions, nor to make himself\r\nthe umpire and final judge between them. I am, therefore, Sir, not\r\nauthorized to enter into any discussions with you on the meaning of our\r\nconstitution in any part of it, or to prove to you that it has ascribed\r\nto him alone the admission or interdiction of foreign agents. I inform\r\nyou of the fact by authority from the President. I had observed to you,\r\nthat we were persuaded, in the case of the Consul Dannery, the error in\r\nthe address had proceeded from no intention in the Executive Council\r\nof France to question the functions of the President, and therefore no\r\ndifficulty was made in issuing the commissions. We are still under the\r\nsame persuasion. But in your letter of the 14th instant, you personally\r\nquestion the authority of the President, and in consequence of that,\r\nhave not addressed to him the commission of Messrs. Pennevert and\r\nChervi. Making a point of this formality on your part, it becomes\r\nnecessary to make a point of it on ours also; and I am therefore charged\r\nto return you those commissions, and to inform you, that bound to\r\nenforce respect to the order of things established by our constitution,\r\nthe President will issue no Exequatur to any Consul or Vice-Consul, not\r\ndirected to him in the usual form, after the party from whom it comes\r\nhas been apprized that such should be the address.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with respect, Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIV.--TO MR. GENET, December 9, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 9, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant,\r\nwhich has been duly laid before the President.\r\n\r\nWe are very far from admitting your principle, that the government\r\non either side has no other right, on the presentation of a consular\r\ncommission, than to certify, that having examined it, they find it\r\naccording to rule. The governments of both nations have a right, and\r\nthat of yours has exercised it as to us, of considering the character\r\nof the person appointed, the place for which he is appointed, and other\r\nmaterial circumstances; and of taking precautions as to his conduct,\r\nif necessary: and this does not defeat the general object of the\r\nconvention, which, in stipulating that consuls shall be permitted\r\non both sides, could not mean to supersede reasonable objections to\r\nparticular persons, who might at the moment be obnoxious to the nation\r\nto which they were sent, or whose conduct might render them so at any\r\ntime after. In fact, every foreign agent depends on the double will of\r\nthe two governments, of that which sends him, and of that which is to\r\npermit the exercise of his functions within their territory; and when\r\neither of these wills is refused or withdrawn, his authority to\r\nact within that territory becomes incomplete. By what member of the\r\ngovernment the right of giving or withdrawing permission is to be\r\nexercised here, is a question on which no foreign agent can be permitted\r\nto make himself the umpire. It is sufficient for him, under our\r\ngovernment, that he is informed of it by the executive.\r\n\r\nOn an examination of the commissions from your nation, among our\r\nrecords, I find that before the late change in the form of our\r\ngovernment, foreign agents were addressed, sometimes to the United\r\nStates, and sometimes to the Congress of the United States, that body\r\nbeing then executive as well as legislative. Thus the commissions\r\nof Messrs. L’Etombe, Holker, Dauneraanis, Marbois, Crevecoeur and\r\nChateaufort, have all this clause, ‘_Prions et requerons nos tres chers\r\net grands amis et allies, les Etat-Unis de l’Amerique Septentrionale,\r\nleurs gouverneurs, et autres officiers, &c. de laisser jouir, &c. le dit\r\nsieur, &c. de la charge de notre Consul,_’ &c. On the change in the form\r\nof our government, foreign nations, not undertaking to decide to what\r\nmember of the new government their agents should be addressed, ceased to\r\ndo it to Congress, and adopted the general address to the United States,\r\nbefore cited. This was done by the government of your own nation, as\r\nappears by the commissions of Messrs. Mangourit and La Forest, which\r\nhave in them the clause before cited. So your own commission was, not as\r\nM. Gerond’s and Luzerne’s had been, ‘_a nos tres chers, &c. le President\r\net membres du Congres general des Etats-Unis_,’ &c. but ‘_a nos tres\r\nchers, &c. les Etats-Unis de l’Amerique_,’ &c. Under this general\r\naddress, the proper member of the government was included, and could\r\ntake it up. When, therefore, it was seen in the commissions of Messrs.\r\nDupont and Hauterive, that your executive had returned to the ancient\r\naddress to Congress, it was conceived to be an inattention, insomuch,\r\nthat I do not recollect (and I do not think it material enough to\r\ninquire) whether I noticed it to you either verbally or by letter. When\r\nthat of M. Dannery was presented with the like address, being obliged\r\nto notice to you an inaccuracy of another kind, I then mentioned that\r\nof the address, not calling it an innovation, but expressing my\r\nsatisfaction, which is still entire, that it was not from any design in\r\nyour Executive Council. The Exequatur was therefore sent. That they will\r\nnot consider our notice of it as an innovation, we are perfectly\r\nsecure. No government can disregard formalities more than ours. But\r\nwhen formalities are attacked with a view to change principles, and to\r\nintroduce an entire independence of foreign agents on the nation with\r\nwhom they reside, it becomes material to defend formalities. They would\r\nbe no longer trifles, if they could, in defiance of the national will,\r\ncontinue a foreign agent among us, whatever might be his course of\r\naction. Continuing, therefore, the refusal to receive any commission\r\nfrom yourself, addressed to an improper member of the government, you\r\nare left free to use either the general one to the United States, as in\r\nthe commissions of Messrs. Mangourit and La Forest before cited, or the\r\nspecial one, to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with respect, Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXV.--TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE U.S., December 18, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 18, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe Minister Plenipotentiary of France has enclosed to me a copy of a\r\nletter of the 16th instant, which he addressed to you, stating that\r\nsome libellous publications had been made against him by Mr. Jay, Chief\r\nJustice of the United States, and Mr. King, one of the Senators for\r\nthe State of New York, and desiring that they might be prosecuted. This\r\nletter has been laid before the President, according to the request of\r\nthe Minister; and the President, never doubting your readiness on\r\nall occasions to perform the functions of your office, yet thinks it\r\nincumbent on him to recommend it specially on the present occasion, as\r\nit concerns a public character peculiarly entitled to the protection of\r\nthe laws. On the other hand, as our citizens ought not to be vexed with\r\ngroundless prosecutions, duty to them requires it to be added, that if\r\nyou judge the prosecution in question to be of that nature, you consider\r\nthis recommendation as not extending to it; its only object being to\r\nengage you to proceed in this case according to the duties of your\r\noffice, the laws of the land, and the privileges of the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVI.--TO E. RANDOLPH, February 3, 1794\r\n\r\nTO E. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 3, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for the transmission of the letters from General\r\nGates, La Motte, and Hauterive. I perceive by the latter, that the\r\npartisans of the one or the other principle (perhaps of both) have\r\nthought my name a convenient cover for declarations of their own\r\nsentiments. What those are to which Hauterive alludes, I know not,\r\nhaving never seen a newspaper since I left Philadelphia (except those\r\nof Richmond), and no circumstances authorize him to expect that I should\r\ninquire into them, or answer him. I think it is Montaigne who has said,\r\nthat ignorance is the softest pillow on which a man can rest his head.\r\nI am sure it is true as to every thing political, and shall endeavor to\r\nestrange myself to every thing of that character. I indulge myself on\r\none political topic only, that is, in declaring to my countrymen the\r\nshameless corruption of a portion of the Representatives in the first\r\nand second Congresses, and their implicit devotion to the treasury. I\r\nthink I do good in this, because it may produce exertions to reform the\r\nevil, on the success of which the form of the government is to depend.\r\n\r\nI am sorry La Motte has put me to the expense of one hundred and forty\r\nlivres for a French translation of an English poem, as I make it a rule\r\nnever to read translations where I can read the original. However,\r\nthe question now is, how to get the book brought here, as well as the\r\ncommunications with Mr. Hammond which you were so kind as to promise me.\r\n\r\nThis is the first letter I have written to Philadelphia since my arrival\r\nat home, and yours the only ones I have received.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my sincere esteem and respect. Yours\r\naffectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 3, 1794\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 3, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOur post having ceased to ride ever since the inoculation began in\r\nRichmond, till now, I received three days ago, and all together, your\r\nfriendly favors of March the 2nd, 9th, 12th, 14th, and Colonel Monroe’s\r\nof March the 3rd and 16th. I have been particularly gratified by the\r\nreceipt of the papers containing yours and Smith’s discussion of your\r\nregulating propositions. These debates had not been seen here but in a\r\nvery short and mutilated form. I am at no loss to ascribe Smith’s\r\nspeech to its true father. Every tittle of it is Hamilton’s except the\r\nintroduction. There is scarcely any thing there which I have not heard\r\nfrom him in our various private, though official discussions. The very\r\nturn of the arguments is the same, and others will see as well as myself\r\nthat the style is Hamilton’s. The sophistry is too fine, too ingenious,\r\neven to have been comprehended by Smith, much less devised by him.\r\nHis reply shows he did not understand his first speech; as its general\r\ninferiority proves its legitimacy, as evidently as it does the bastardy\r\nof the original. You know we had understood that Hamilton had prepared a\r\ncounter report, and that some of his humble servants in the Senate were\r\nto move a reference to him in order to produce it. But I suppose they\r\nthought it would have a better effect, if fired off in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. I find the report, however, so fully justified, that\r\nthe anxieties with which I left it are perfectly quieted. In this\r\nquarter, all espouse your propositions with ardor, and without a\r\ndissenting voice.\r\n\r\nThe rumor of a declaration of war has given an opportunity of seeing,\r\nthat the people here, though attentive to the loss of value of their\r\nproduce in such an event, yet find in it a gratification of some other\r\npassions, and particularly of their ancient hatred to Great Britain.\r\nStill I hope it will not come to that; but that the proposition will\r\nbe carried, and justice be done ourselves in a peaceable way. As to the\r\nguarantee of the French islands, whatever doubts may be entertained of\r\nthe moment at which we ought to interpose, yet I have no doubt but that\r\nwe ought to interpose at a proper time, and declare both to England and\r\nFrance, that these islands are to rest with France, and that we will\r\nmake a common cause with the latter for that object. As to the naval\r\narmament, the land armament, and the marine fortifications which are in\r\nquestion with you, I have no doubt they will all be carried. Not that\r\nthe monocrats and papermen in Congress want war; but they want armies\r\nand debts; and though we may hope that the sound part of Congress is\r\nnow so augmented as to insure a majority in cases of general interest\r\nmerely, yet I have always observed that in questions of expense, where\r\nmembers may hope either for offices or jobs for themselves or their\r\nfriends, some few will be debauched, and that is sufficient to turn the\r\ndecision where a majority is, at most, but small. I have never seen a\r\nPhiladelphia paper since I left it, till those you enclosed me; and\r\nI feel myself so thoroughly weaned from the interest I took in the\r\nproceedings there, while there, that I have never had a wish to see one,\r\nand believe that I never shall take another newspaper of any sort. I\r\nfind my mind totally absorbed in my rural occupations.\r\n\r\nAccept sincere assurances of affection.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVIII.--TO TENCH COXE, May 1,1794\r\n\r\nTO TENCH COXE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 1,1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour several favors of February the 22nd, 27th, and March the 16th,\r\nwhich had been accumulating in Richmond during the prevalence of the\r\nsmall pox in that place, were lately brought to me, on the permission\r\ngiven the post to resume his communication. I am particularly to\r\nthank you for your favor in forwarding the Bee. Your letters give a\r\ncomfortable view of French affairs, and later events seem to confirm it.\r\nOver the foreign powers I am convinced they will triumph completely, and\r\nI cannot but hope that that triumph, and the consequent disgrace of the\r\ninvading tyrants, is destined, in the order of events, to kindle the\r\nwrath of the people of Europe against those who have dared to embroil\r\nthem in such wickedness, and to bring at length, kings, nobles, and\r\npriests to the scaffolds which they have been so long deluging with\r\nhuman blood. I am still warm whenever I think of these scoundrels,\r\nthough I do it as seldom as I can, preferring infinitely to contemplate\r\nthe tranquil growth of my lucerne and potatoes. I have so completely\r\nwithdrawn myself from these spectacles of usurpation and misrule, that I\r\ndo not take a single newspaper, nor read one a month: and I feel myself\r\ninfinitely the happier for it.\r\n\r\nWe are alarmed here with the apprehensions of war; and sincerely anxious\r\nthat it may be avoided; but not at the expense either of our faith or\r\nhonor. It seems much the general opinion here, the latter has been too\r\nmuch wounded not to require reparation, and to seek it even in war, if\r\nthat be necessary. As to myself, I love peace, and I am anxious that we\r\nshould give the world still another useful lesson, by showing to them\r\nother modes of punishing injuries than by war, which is as much a\r\npunishment to the punisher as to the sufferer. I love therefore, Mr.\r\nClarke’s proposition of cutting off all communication with the nation\r\nwhich has conducted itself so atrociously. This you will say may bring\r\non war. If it does, we will meet it like men; but it may not bring on\r\nwar, and then the experiment will have been a happy one. I believe this\r\nwar would be vastly more unanimously approved than any one we ever were\r\nengaged in; because the aggressions have been so wanton and bare-faced,\r\nand so unquestionably against our desire. I am sorry Mr. Cooper and\r\nPriestley did not take a more general survey of our country before they\r\nfixed themselves. I think they might have promoted their own advantage\r\nby it, and have aided the introduction of improvement where it is more\r\nwanting. The prospect of wheat for the ensuing year is a bad one. This\r\nis all the sort of news you can expect from me. From you I shall be glad\r\nto hear all sorts of news, and particularly any improvements in the arts\r\napplicable to husbandry or household manufacture.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere affection, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIX.--TO THE PRESIDENT, May 14, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 14, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am honored with your favor of April the 24th, and received at the\r\nsame time Mr. Bertrand’s agricultural prospectus. Though he mentions my\r\nhaving seen him at a particular place, yet I remember nothing of it,\r\nand observing that he intimates an application for lands in America, I\r\nconceive his letter meant for me as Secretary of State, and therefore\r\nI now send it to the Secretary of State. He has given only the heads of\r\nhis demonstrations, so that nothing can be conjectured of their details.\r\nLord Kaims once proposed an essence of dung, one pint of which should\r\nmanure an acre. If he or Mr. Bertrand could have rendered it so\r\nportable, I should have been one of those who would have been greatly\r\nobliged to them. I find on a more minute examination of my lands that\r\nthe short visits heretofore made to them, permitted, that a ten years’\r\nabandonment of them to the ravages of overseers, has brought on them a\r\ndegree of degradation far beyond what I had expected. As this obliges me\r\nto adopt a milder course of cropping, so I find that they have enabled\r\nme to do it, by having opened a great deal of lands during my absence. I\r\nhave therefore determined on a division of my farms into six fields, to\r\nbe put under this rotation: first year, wheat; second, corn, potatoes,\r\npeas; third, rye, or wheat, according to circumstances; fourth and\r\nfifth, clover where the fields will bring it, and buckwheat dressings\r\nwhere they will not; sixth, folding, and buckwheat dressings. But it\r\nwill take me from three to six years to get this plan under way. I am\r\nnot yet satisfied that my acquisition of overseers from the head of\r\nElk has been a happy one, or that much will be done this year towards\r\nrescuing my plantations from their wretched condition. Time, patience,\r\nand perseverance must be the remedy: and the maxim of your letter, ‘slow\r\nand sure,’ is not less a good one in agriculture than in politics. I\r\nsincerely wish it may extricate us from the event of a war, if this\r\ncan be done saving our faith and our rights. My opinion of the British\r\ngovernment is, that nothing will force them to do justice but the\r\nloud voice of their people, and that this can never be excited but by\r\ndistressing their commerce. But I cherish tranquillity too much, to\r\nsuffer political things to enter my mind at all. I do not forget that\r\nI owe you a letter for Mr. Young; but I am waiting to get full\r\ninformation. With every wish for your health and happiness, and my most\r\nfriendly respects for Mrs. Washington, I have the honor to be, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXX.--TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE, September 7, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 7, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of August the 28th finds me in bed under a paroxysm of the\r\nrheumatism which has now kept me for ten days in constant torment, and\r\npresents no hope of abatement. But the express and the nature of the\r\ncase requiring immediate answer, I write to you in this situation. No\r\ncircumstances, my Dear Sir, will ever more tempt me to engage in any\r\nthing public. I thought myself perfectly fixed in this determination\r\nwhen I left Philadelphia, but every day and hour since has added to its\r\ninflexibility. It is a great pleasure to me to retain the esteem and\r\napprobation of the President, and this forms the only ground of any\r\nreluctance at being unable to comply with every wish of his. Pray convey\r\nthese sentiments and a thousand more to him, which my situation does\r\nnot permit me to go into. But however suffering by the addition of every\r\nsingle word to this letter, I must add a solemn declaration that neither\r\nMr. J. nor Mr. ------- ever mentioned to me one word of any want of\r\ndecorum in Mr. Carmichael, nor any thing stronger or more special than\r\nstated in my notes of the conversation. Excuse my brevity, my dear Sir,\r\nand accept assurances of the sincere esteem and respect, with which I\r\nhave the honor to be your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXI.--TO JAMES MADISON, December 28, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 28, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have kept Mr. Jay’s letter a post or two, with an intention of\r\nconsidering attentively the observations it contains: but I have really\r\nnow so little stomach for any thing of that kind, that I have not\r\nresolution enough even to endeavor to understand the observations. I\r\ntherefore return the letter, not to delay your answer to it, and beg\r\nyou in answering for yourself, to assure him of my respects and thankful\r\nacceptance of Chalmers’ Treaties, which I do not possess, and if you\r\npossess yourself of the scope of his reasoning, make any answer to it\r\nyou please for me. If it had been on the rotation of my crops, I would\r\nhave answered myself, lengthily perhaps, but certainly _con gusto_.\r\n\r\nThe denunciation of the democratic societies is one of the extraordinary\r\nacts of boldness of which we have seen so many from the faction of\r\nmonocrats. It is wonderful indeed, that the President should have\r\npermitted himself to be the organ of such an attack on the freedom of\r\ndiscussion, the freedom of writing, printing, and publishing. It must be\r\na matter of rare curiosity to get at the modifications of these rights\r\nproposed by them, and to see what line their ingenuity would draw\r\nbetween democratical societies, whose avowed object is the nourishment\r\nof the republican principles of our constitution, and the society of\r\nthe Cincinnati, a self-created one, carving out for itself hereditary\r\ndistinctions, lowering over our constitution eternally, meeting together\r\nin all parts of the Union, periodically, with closed doors, accumulating\r\na capital in their separate treasury, corresponding secretly and\r\nregularly, and of which society the very persons denouncing the\r\ndemocrats are themselves the fathers, founders, and high officers.\r\nTheir sight must be perfectly dazzled by the glittering of crowns and\r\ncoronets, not to see the extravagance of the proposition to suppress the\r\nfriends of general freedom, while those who wish to confine that freedom\r\nto the few are permitted to go on in their principles and practices.\r\nI here put out of sight the persons whose misbehavior has been taken\r\nadvantage of to slander the friends of popular rights; and I am happy\r\nto observe, that as far as the circle of my observation and information\r\nextends, every body has lost sight of them, and views the abstract\r\nattempt on their natural and constitutional rights in all its nakedness.\r\nI have never heard, or heard of, a single expression or opinion which\r\ndid not condemn it as an inexcusable aggression. And with respect to the\r\ntransactions against the excise law, it appears to me that you are all\r\nswept away in the torrent of governmental opinions, or that we do not\r\nknow what these transactions have been. We know of none which, according\r\nto the definitions of the law, have been any thing more than riotous.\r\nThere was indeed a meeting to consult about a separation. But to consult\r\non a question does not amount to a determination of that question in the\r\naffirmative, still less to the acting on such a determination: but we\r\nshall see, I suppose, what the court lawyers, and courtly judges, and\r\nwould-be ambassadors will make of it. The excise law is an infernal one.\r\nThe first error was to admit it by the constitution; the second, to act\r\non that admission; the third and last will be, to make it the instrument\r\nof dismembering the Union, and setting us all afloat to choose what part\r\nof it we will adhere to. The information of our militia, returned from\r\nthe westward, is uniform, that though the people there let them pass\r\nquietly, they were objects of their laughter, not of their fear; that\r\none thousand men could have cut off their whole force in a thousand\r\nplaces of the Allegany; that their detestation of the excise law is\r\nuniversal, and has now associated to it a detestation of the government;\r\nand that separation which perhaps was a very distant and problematical\r\nevent, is now near, and certain, and determined in the mind of every\r\nman. I expected to have seen some justification of arming one part of\r\nthe society against another; of declaring a civil war the moment before\r\nthe meeting of that body which has the sole right of declaring war; of\r\nbeing so patient of the kicks and scoffs of our enemies, and rising at a\r\nfeather against our friends; of adding a million to the public debt and\r\nderiding us with recommendations to pay it if we can, &c. &c. But the\r\npart of the speech which was to be taken as a justification of the\r\narmament, reminded me of Parson Saunders’s demonstration why minus into\r\nminus makes plus. After a parcel of shreds of stuff from Æsop’s fables\r\nand Tom Thumb, he jumps all at once into his ergo, minus multiplied\r\ninto minus makes phis. Just so the fifteen thousand men enter after the\r\nfables, in the speech.\r\n\r\nHowever, the time is coming when we shall fetch up the leeway of our\r\nvessel. The changes in your House, I see, are going on for the better,\r\nand even the Augean herd over your heads are slowly purging off their\r\nimpurities. Hold on then, my dear friend, that we may not shipwreck\r\nin the mean while. I do not see, in the minds of those with whom I\r\nconverse, a greater affliction than the fear of your retirement; but\r\nthis must not be, unless to a more splendid and a more efficacious post.\r\nThere I should rejoice to see you; I hope I may say, I shall rejoice to\r\nsee you. I have long had much in my mind to say to you on that subject.\r\nBut double delicacies have kept me silent. I ought perhaps to say, while\r\nI would not give up my own retirement for the empire of the universe,\r\nhow I can justify wishing one whose happiness I have so much at heart\r\nas yours, to take the front of the battle which is fighting for my\r\nsecurity. This would be easy enough to be done, but not at the heel of a\r\nlengthy epistle.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Madison, and pray her to keep you where\r\nyou are for her own satisfaction and the public good, and accept the\r\ncordial affections of us all. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXII.--TO M. D’IVERNOIS, February 6,1795\r\n\r\nTO M. D’IVERNOIS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 6,1795.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour several favors on the affairs of Geneva found me here, in the\r\nmonth of December last. It is now more than a year that I have withdrawn\r\nmyself from public affairs, which I never liked in my life, but was\r\ndrawn into by emergencies which threatened our country with slavery, but\r\nended in establishing it free. I have returned, with infinite appetite,\r\nto the enjoyment of my farm, my family, and my books, and had determined\r\nto meddle in nothing beyond their limits. Your proposition, however, for\r\ntransplanting the college of Geneva to my own country, was too analogous\r\nto all my attachments to science, and freedom, the first-born daughter\r\nof science, not to excite a lively interest in my mind, and the essays\r\nwhich were necessary to try its practicability. This depended altogether\r\non the opinions and dispositions of our State legislature, which was\r\nthen in session. I immediately communicated your papers to a member of\r\nthe legislature, whose abilities and zeal pointed him out as proper\r\nfor it, urging him to sound as many of the leading members of the\r\nlegislature as he could, and if he found their opinions favorable, to\r\nbring forward the proposition; but if he should find it desperate, not\r\nto hazard it: because I thought it best not to commit the honor either\r\nof our State or of your college, by an useless act of eclat. It was not\r\ntill within these three days that I have had an interview with him, and\r\nan account of his proceedings. He communicated the papers to a great\r\nnumber of the members, and discussed them maturely, but privately, with\r\nthem. They were generally well disposed to the proposition, and some\r\nof them warmly: however, there was no difference of opinion in the\r\nconclusion, that it could not be effected. The reasons which they\r\nthought would with certainty prevail against it, were, 1. that our\r\nyouth, not familiarized but with their mother tongue, were not prepared\r\nto receive instructions in any other; 2. that the expense of the\r\ninstitution would excite uneasiness in their constituents, and endanger\r\nits permanence; and 3. that its extent was disproportioned to the\r\nnarrow state of the population with us. Whatever might be urged on these\r\nseveral subjects, yet as the decision rested with others, there remained\r\nto us only to regret that circumstances were such, or were thought to be\r\nsuch, as to disappoint your and our wishes.\r\n\r\nI should have seen with peculiar satisfaction the establishment of such\r\na mass of science in my country, and should probably have been tempted\r\nto approach myself to it, by procuring a residence in its neighborhood,\r\nat those seasons of the year at least when the operations of agriculture\r\nare less active and interesting. I sincerely lament the circumstances\r\nwhich have suggested this emigration. I had hoped that Geneva was\r\nfamiliarized to such a degree of liberty, that they might without\r\ndifficulty or danger fill up the measure to its maximum; a term, which,\r\nthough in the insulated man, bounded only by his natural powers, must,\r\nin society, be so far restricted as to protect himself against the\r\nevil passions of his associates, and consequently, them against him.\r\nI suspect that the doctrine, that small States alone are fitted to be\r\nrepublics, will be exploded by experience, with some other brilliant\r\nfallacies accredited by Montesquieu and other political writers. Perhaps\r\nit will be found, that to obtain a just republic (and it is to secure\r\nour just rights that we resort to government at all) it must be so\r\nextensive as that local egoisms may never reach its greater part; that\r\non every particular question a majority may be found in its councils\r\nfree from particular interests, and giving, therefore, an uniform\r\nprevalence to the principles of justice. The smaller the societies, the\r\nmore violent and more convulsive their schisms. We have chanced to\r\nlive in an age which will probably be distinguished in history, for its\r\nexperiments in government on a larger scale than has yet taken place.\r\nBut we shall not live to see the result. The grosser absurdities, such\r\nas hereditary magistracies, we shall see exploded in our day, long\r\nexperience having already pronounced condemnation against them. But what\r\nis to be the substitute? This our children or grandchildren will answer.\r\nWe may be satisfied with the certain knowledge that none can ever be\r\ntried, so stupid, so unrighteous, so oppressive, so destructive of every\r\nend for which honest men enter into government, as that which their\r\nforefathers had established, and their fathers alone venture to tumble\r\nheadlong from the stations they have so long abused. It is unfortunate,\r\nthat the efforts of mankind to recover the freedom of which they have\r\nbeen so long deprived, will be accompanied with violence, with errors,\r\nand even with crimes. But while we weep over the means we must pray for\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nBut I have been insensibly led, by the general complexion of the times,\r\nfrom the particular case of Geneva, to those to which it bears no\r\nsimilitude. Of that we hope good things. Its inhabitants must be too\r\nmuch enlightened, too well experienced in the blessings of freedom and\r\nundisturbed industry, to tolerate long a contrary state of things. I\r\nshall be happy to hear that their government perfects itself, and leaves\r\nroom for the honest, the industrious, and wise; in which case, your own\r\ntalents, and those of the persons for whom you have interested yourself,\r\nwill, I am sure, find welcome and distinction. My good wishes will\r\nalways attend you, as a consequence of the esteem and regard with which\r\nI am, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 27, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 27, 1795.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of March the 23rd came to hand the 7th of April, and\r\nnotwithstanding the urgent reasons for answering a part of it\r\nimmediately, yet as it mentioned that you would leave Philadelphia\r\nwithin a few days, I feared that the answer might pass you on the road.\r\nA letter from Philadelphia by the last post having announced to me your\r\nleaving that place the day preceding its date, I am in hopes this will\r\nfind you in Orange. In mine, to which yours of March the 23rd was an\r\nanswer, I expressed my hope of the only change of position I ever wished\r\nto see you make, and I expressed it with entire sincerity, because there\r\nis not another person in the United States, who being placed at the helm\r\nof our affairs, my mind would be so completely at rest for the fortune\r\nof our political bark. The wish too was pure, and unmixed with any thing\r\nrespecting myself personally.\r\n\r\nFor as to myself, the subject had been thoroughly weighed and decided\r\non, and my retirement from office had been meant from all office, high\r\nor low, without exception. I can say, too, with truth, that the subject\r\nhad not been presented to my mind by any vanity of my own. I know myself\r\nand my fellow citizens too well to have ever thought of it. But the idea\r\nwas forced upon me by continual insinuations in the public papers, while\r\nI was in office. As all these came from a hostile quarter, I knew that\r\ntheir object was to poison the public mind as to my motives, when they\r\nwere not able to charge me with facts. But the idea being once presented\r\nto me, my own quiet required that I should face it and examine it. I did\r\nso thoroughly, and had no difficulty to see that every reason which\r\nhad determined me to retire from the office I then held, operated more\r\nstrongly against that which was insinuated to be my object. I decided\r\nthen on those general grounds which could alone be present to my mind\r\nat that time, that is to say, reputation, tranquillity, labor; for as\r\nto public duty, it could not be a topic of consideration in my case. If\r\nthese general considerations were sufficient to ground a firm resolution\r\nnever to permit myself to think of the office, or be thought of for it,\r\nthe special ones, which have supervened on my retirement, still more\r\ninsuperably bar the door to it. My health is entirely broken down within\r\nthe last eight months; my age requires that I should place my affairs\r\nin a clear state; these are sound if taken care of, but capable of\r\nconsiderable dangers if longer neglected; and above all things, the\r\ndelights I feel in the society of my family, and in the agricultural\r\npursuits in which I am so eagerly engaged. The little spice of ambition\r\nwhich I had in my younger days has long since evaporated, and I set\r\nstill less store by a posthumous than present name. In stating to you\r\nthe heads of reasons which have produced my determination, I do not mean\r\nan opening for future discussion, or that I may be reasoned out of it.\r\nThe question is for ever closed with me; my sole object is to avail\r\nmyself of the first opening ever given me from a friendly quarter (and I\r\ncould not with decency do it before) of preventing any division or loss\r\nof votes, which might be fatal to the republican interest. If that has\r\nany chance of prevailing, it must be by avoiding the loss of a single\r\nvote, and by concentrating all its strength on one object. Who this\r\nshould be, is a question I can more freely discuss with any body than\r\nyourself. In this I painfully feel the loss of Monroe. Had he been here,\r\nI should have been at no loss for a channel through which to make\r\nmyself understood; if I have been misunderstood by any body through the\r\ninstrumentality of Mr. Fenno and his abettors. I long to see you. I am\r\nproceeding in my agricultural plans with a slow but sure step. To\r\nget under full way will require four or five years. But patience and\r\nperseverance, will accomplish it. My little essay in red-clover, the\r\nlast year, has had the most encouraging success. I sowed then about\r\nforty acres. I have sowed this year about one hundred and twenty, which\r\nthe rain now falling comes very opportunely on. From one hundred and\r\nsixty to two hundred acres, will be my yearly sowing. The seed-box\r\ndescribed in the agricultural transactions of New York, reduces the\r\nexpense of seeding from six shillings to two shillings and three pence\r\nthe acre, and does the business better than is possible to be done by\r\nthe human hand. May we hope a visit from you? If we may, let it be after\r\nthe middle of May, by which time I hope to be returned from Bedford. I\r\nhave had a proposition to meet Mr. Henry there this month, to confer on\r\nthe subject of a convention, to the calling of which he is now become\r\na convert. The session of our district court furnished me a just excuse\r\nfor the time; but the impropriety of my entering into consultation on a\r\nmeasure in which I would take no part, is a permanent one.\r\n\r\nPresent my most respectful compliments to Mrs. Madison, and be assured\r\nof the warm attachment of, Dear Sir, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIV.--TO WILLIAM B. GILES, April 27, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 27, 1795,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 16th came to hand by the last post. I sincerely\r\ncongratulate you on the great prosperities of our two first allies, the\r\nFrench and Dutch. If I could but see them now at peace with the rest of\r\ntheir continent, I should have little doubt of dining with Pichegru\r\nin London, next autumn; for I believe I should be tempted to leave my\r\nclover for a while, to go and hail the dawn of liberty and republicanism\r\nin that island. I shall be rendered very happy by the visit you promise\r\nme. The only thing wanting to make me completely so, is the more\r\nfrequent society of my friends. It is the more wanting, as I am become\r\nmore firmly fixed to the glebe. If you visit me as a farmer, it must be\r\nas a condisciple: for I am but a learner; an eager one indeed, but yet\r\ndesperate, being too old now to learn a new art. However, I am as much\r\ndelighted and occupied with it, as if I was the greatest adept. I shall\r\ntalk with you about it from morning till night, and put you on\r\nvery short allowance as to political aliment. Now and then a pious\r\nejaculation for the French and Dutch republicans, returning with\r\ndue despatch to clover, potatoes, wheat, &c. That I may not lose the\r\npleasure promised me, let it not be till the middle of May, by which\r\ntime I shall be returned from a trip I meditate to Bedford.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXV.--TO MANN PAGE, August 30, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO MANN PAGE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 30, 1795.\r\n\r\nIt was not in my power to attend at Fedricksburg according to the kind\r\ninvitation in your letter, and in that of Mr. Ogilvie. The heat of\r\nthe weather, the business of the farm, to which I have made myself\r\nnecessary, forbade it; and to give one round reason for all, _maturè\r\nsanus_, I have laid up my Rosinante in his stall, before his unfitness\r\nfor the road shall expose him faltering to the world. But why did not I\r\nanswer you in time? Because, in truth, I am encouraging myself to grow\r\nlazy, and I was sure you would ascribe the delay to any thing sooner\r\nthan a want of affection or respect to you, for this was not among the\r\npossible causes. In truth, if any thing could ever induce me to sleep\r\nanother night out of my own house, it would have been your friendly\r\ninvitation and my solicitude for the subject of it, the education of our\r\nyouth. I do most anxiously wish to see the highest degrees of education\r\ngiven to the higher degrees of genius, and to all degrees of it, so much\r\nas may enable them to read and understand what is going on in the world,\r\nand to keep their part of it going on right: for nothing can keep it\r\nright but their own vigilant and distrustful superintendence. I do not\r\nbelieve with the Rochefoucaults and Montaignes, that fourteen out of\r\nfifteen men are rogues: I believe a great abatement from that proportion\r\nmay be made in favor of general honesty. But I have always found that\r\nrogues would be uppermost, and I do not know that the proportion is,\r\ntoo strong for the higher orders, and for those who, rising above the\r\nswinish multitude, always contrive to nestle themselves into the places\r\nof power and profit. These rogues set out with stealing the peoples’\r\ngood opinion, and then steal from them the right of withdrawing it,\r\nby contriving laws and associations against the power of the people\r\nthemselves. Our part of the country is in considerable fermentation on\r\nwhat they suspect to be a recent roguery of this kind. They say that\r\nwhile all hands were below deck mending sails, splicing ropes, and every\r\none at his own business, and the captain in his cabin attending to his\r\nlog-book and chart, a rogue of a pilot has run them into an enemy’s\r\nport. But metaphor apart, there is much dissatisfaction with Mr. Jay\r\nand his treaty. For my part, I consider myself now but as a passenger,\r\nleaving the world and its government to those who are likely to live\r\nlonger in it. That you may be among the longest of these, is my sincere\r\nprayer. After begging you to be the bearer of my compliments and\r\napologies to Mr. Ogilvie, I bid you an affectionate farewell, always\r\nwishing to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVI.--TO JAMES MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 21,1795.\r\n\r\nI received, about three weeks ago, a box containing six dozen volumes,\r\nof two hundred and eighty-three pages, 12mo. with a letter from Lambert,\r\nBeckley’s clerk, that they came from Mr. Beckley, and were to be divided\r\nbetween yourself, J. Walker, and myself. I have sent two dozen to J.\r\nWalker, and shall be glad of a conveyance for yours. In the mean time,\r\nI send you by post, the title-page, table of contents, and one of the\r\npieces, Curtius, lest it should not have come to you otherwise. It is\r\nevidently written by Hamilton, giving a first and general view of the\r\nsubject, that the public mind might be kept a little in check, till he\r\ncould resume the subject more at large from the beginning, under his\r\nsecond signature of Camillas. The piece called ‘The Features of the\r\nTreaty,’ I do not send, because you have seen it in the newspapers. It\r\nis said to be written by Coxe, but I should rather suspect by Beckley.\r\nThe antidote is certainly not strong enough for the poison of Curtius.\r\nIf I had not been informed the present came from Beckley, I should\r\nhave suspected it from Jay or Hamilton. I gave a copy or two, by way of\r\nexperiment, to honest, sound-hearted men of common understanding, and\r\nthey were not able to parry the sophistry of Curtius. I have ceased,\r\ntherefore, to give them. Hamilton is really a colossus to the\r\nanti-republican party. Without numbers, he is an host within himself.\r\nThey have got themselves into a defile, where they might be finished;\r\nbut too much security on the republican part will give time to his\r\ntalents and indefatigableness to extricate them. We have had only\r\nmiddling performances to oppose to him. In truth when he comes forward,\r\nthere is nobody but yourself who can meet him. His adversaries having\r\nbegun the attack, he has the advantage of answering them, and remains\r\nunanswered himself. A solid reply might yet completely demolish what was\r\ntoo feebly attacked, and has gathered strength from the weakness of\r\nthe attack. The merchants were certainly (except those of them who are\r\nEnglish) as open-mouthed at first against the treaty, as any. But the\r\ngeneral expression of indignation has alarmed them for the strength of\r\nthe government. They have feared the shock would be too great, and have\r\nchosen to tack about and support both treaty and government, rather than\r\nrisk the government. Thus it is, that Hamilton, Jay, &c. in the boldest\r\nact they ever ventured on to undermine the government, have the address\r\nto screen themselves, and direct the hue and cry against those who\r\nwished to drag them into light. A bolder party-stroke was never struck.\r\nFor it certainly is an attempt of a party, who find they have lost their\r\nmajority in one branch of the legislature, to make a law by the aid of\r\nthe other branch and of the executive, under color of a treaty, which\r\nshall bind up the hands of the adverse branch from ever restraining the\r\ncommerce of their patron-nation. There appears a pause at present in\r\nthe public sentiment, which may be followed by a revulsion. This is the\r\neffect of the desertion of the merchants, of the President’s chiding\r\nanswer to Boston and Richmond, of the writings of Curtius and Camillus,\r\nand of the quietism into which people naturally fall after first\r\nsensations are over. For God’s sake take up your pen, and give a\r\nfundamental reply to Curtius and Camillus. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVII.--TO EDWARD RUTLEDGE, November 30, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 30, 1795,\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received your favor of October the 12th by your son, who has been kind\r\nenough to visit me here, and from whose visit I have received all that\r\npleasure which I do from whatever comes from you, and especially from\r\na subject so deservedly dear to you. He found me in a retirement I\r\ndoat on, living like an antediluvian patriarch among my children\r\nand grandchildren, and tilling my soil. As he had lately come from\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, &c. he was able to give me a great deal of\r\ninformation of what is passing in the world, and I pestered him with\r\nquestions pretty much as our friends Lynch, Nelson, &c. will us, when we\r\nstep across the Styx, for they will wish to know what has been passing\r\nabove ground since they left us. You hope I have not abandoned entirely\r\nthe service of our country. After five and twenty years’ continual\r\nemployment in it, I trust it will be thought I have fulfilled my tour,\r\nlike a punctual soldier, and may claim my discharge. But I am glad of\r\nthe sentiment from you, my friend, because it gives a hope you will\r\npractise what you preach, and come forward in aid of the public vessel.\r\nI will not admit your old excuse, that you are in public service though\r\nat home. The campaigns which are fought in a man’s own house are not to\r\nbe counted. The present situation of the President, unable to get the\r\noffices filled, really calls with uncommon obligation on those whom\r\nnature has fitted for them. I join with you in thinking the treaty an\r\nexecrable thing. But both negotiators must have understood, that as\r\nthere were articles in it which could not be carried into execution\r\nwithout the aid of the legislatures on both sides, therefore it must be\r\nreferred to them, and that these legislatures, being free agents, would\r\nnot give it their support if they disapproved of it. I trust the popular\r\nbranch of our legislature will disapprove of it, and thus rid us of this\r\ninfamous act, which is really nothing more than a treaty of alliance\r\nbetween England and the Anglomen of this country, against the\r\nlegislature and people of the United States. I am, my dear friend, yours\r\naffectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVIII.--TO WILLIAM B. GILES, December 31, 1795\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 31, 1795.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of December the 15th and 20th came to hand by the last post.\r\nI am well pleased with the manner in which your House have testified\r\ntheir sense of the treaty: while their refusal to pass the original\r\nclause of the reported answer proved their condemnation of it, the\r\ncontrivance to let it disappear silently respected appearances in favor\r\nof the President, who errs as other men do, but errs with integrity.\r\nRandolph seems to have hit upon the true theory of our constitution;\r\nthat when a treaty is made, involving matters confided by the\r\nconstitution to the three branches of the legislature conjointly,\r\nthe Representatives are as free as the President and Senate were, to\r\nconsider whether the national interest requires or forbids their giving\r\nthe forms and force of law to the articles over which they have a power.\r\nI thank you much for the pamphlet. His narrative is so straight and\r\nplain, that even those who did not know him will acquit him of the\r\ncharge of bribery. Those who knew him had done it from the first. Though\r\nhe mistakes his own political character in the aggregate, yet he gives\r\nit to you in the detail. Thus he supposes himself a man of no party\r\n(page 57); that his opinions not containing any systematic adherence to\r\nparty, fell sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other (page 58).\r\nYet he gives you these facts, which show that they fall generally on\r\nboth sides, and are complete inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n1. He never gave an opinion in the cabinet against the rights of\r\nthe people (page 97); yet he advised the denunciation of the popular\r\nsocieties (page 67).\r\n\r\n2. He would not neglect the overtures of a commercial treaty with France\r\n(page 79); yet he always opposed it while Attorney General, and never\r\nseems to have proposed it while Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n3. He concurs in resorting to the militia to quell the pretended\r\ninsurrections in the west (page 81), and proposes an augmentation from\r\ntwelve thousand five hundred to fifteen thousand, to march against men\r\nat their ploughs (page 80); yet on the 5th of August he is against their\r\nmarching (pages 83, 101), and on the 25th of August he is for it (page\r\n84).\r\n\r\n4. He concurs in the measure of a mission extraordinary to London (as is\r\ninferred from page 58), but objects to the men, to wit, Hamilton and Jay\r\n(page 50).\r\n\r\n5. He was against granting commercial powers to Mr. Jay (page 58); yet\r\nhe besieged the doors of the Senate to procure their advice to ratify.\r\n\r\n6. He advises the President to a ratification on the merits of the\r\ntreaty (page 97), but to a suspension till the provision order is\r\nrepealed (page 98). The fact is, that he has generally given his\r\nprinciples to the one party, and his practice to the other; the oyster\r\nto one, the shell to the other. Unfortunately, the shell was generally\r\nthe lot of his friends, the French and republicans, and the oyster of\r\ntheir antagonists. Had he been firm to the principles he professes\r\nin the year 1793, the President would have been kept from an habitual\r\nconcert with the British and anti-republican party. But at that time,\r\nI do not know which R. feared most, a British fleet, or French\r\ndisorganizers. Whether his conduct is to be ascribed to a superior\r\nview of things, and adherence to right without regard to party, as he\r\npretends, or to an anxiety to trim between both, those who know his\r\ncharacter and capacity will decide. Were parties here divided merely by\r\na greediness for office, as in England, to take a part with either would\r\nbe unworthy of a reasonable or moral man. But where the principle of\r\ndifference is as substantial, and as strongly pronounced, as between the\r\nrepublicans and the monocrats of our country, I hold it as honorable to\r\ntake a firm and decided part, and as immoral to pursue a middle line, as\r\nbetween the parties of honest men and rogues, into which every country\r\nis divided.\r\n\r\nA copy of the pamphlet came by this post to Charlottesville. I suppose\r\nwe shall be able to judge soon what kind of impression it is likely to\r\nmake. It has been a great treat to me, as it is a continuation of that\r\ncabinet history, with the former part of which I was intimate. I remark,\r\nin the reply of the President, a small travestie of the sentiment\r\ncontained in the answer of the Representatives. They acknowledge that he\r\nhas contributed a great share to the national happiness by his services.\r\nHe thanks them for ascribing to his agency a great share of those\r\nbenefits. The former keeps in view the co-operation of others towards\r\nthe public good. The latter presents to view his sole agency. At a\r\ntime when there would have been less anxiety to publish to the people\r\na strong approbation from your House, this strengthening of your\r\nexpression would not have been noticed.\r\n\r\nOur attentions have been so absorbed by the first manifestation of\r\nthe sentiments of your House, that we have lost sight of our own\r\nlegislature; insomuch, that I do not know whether they are sitting\r\nor not. The rejection of Mr. Rutledge by the Senate is a bold thing;\r\nbecause they cannot pretend any objection to him but his disapprobation\r\nof the treaty. It is, of course, a declaration that they will receive\r\nnone but tories hereafter into any department of the government. I\r\nshould not wonder if Monroe were to be recalled, under the idea of his\r\nbeing of the partisans of France, whom the President considers as the\r\npartisans of war and confusion, in his letter of July the 31st, and as\r\ndisposed to excite them to hostile measures, or at least to unfriendly\r\nsentiments; a most infatuated blindness to the true character of the\r\nsentiments entertained in favor of France. The bottom of my page\r\nwarns me that it is time to end my commentaries on the facts you have\r\nfurnished me. You would of course, however, wish to know the sensations\r\nhere on those facts.\r\n\r\nMy friendly respects to Mr. Madison, to whom the next week’s dose will\r\nbe directed. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIX.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 6, 1796\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 6, 1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you February the 21st, since which I have received yours of the\r\nsame day. Indeed, mine of that date related only to a single article in\r\nyours of January the 31st and February the 7th. I do not at all wonder\r\nat the condition in which the finances of the United States are found.\r\nHamilton’s object from the beginning, was to throw them into forms which\r\nshould be utterly undecipherable. I ever said he did not understand\r\ntheir condition himself, nor was able to give a clear view of the excess\r\nof our debts beyond our credits, nor whether we were diminishing or\r\nincreasing the debt. My own opinion was, that from the commencement of\r\nthis government to the time I ceased to attend to the subject, we had\r\nbeen increasing our debt about a million of dollars annually. If Mr.\r\nGallatin would undertake to reduce this chaos to order, present us with\r\na clear view of our finances, and put them into a form as simple as they\r\nwill admit, he will merit immortal honor. The accounts of the United\r\nStates ought to be, and may be, made as simple as those of a common\r\nfarmer, and capable of being understood by common farmers.\r\n\r\nDisapproving, as I do, of the unjustifiable largess to the demands\r\nof the Count de Grasse, I will certainly not propose to rivet it by a\r\nsecond example on behalf of M. de Chastellux’s son. It will only be done\r\nin the event of such a repetition of the precedent, as will give every\r\none a right to share in the plunder. It is, indeed, surprising you have\r\nnot yet received the British treaty in form. I presume you would never\r\nreceive it were not your cooperation on it necessary. But this will\r\noblige the formal notification of it to you.\r\n\r\nMy salutations to Mrs. Madison, friendly esteem to Mr. Giles, Page, &c.\r\nI am, with sincere affection, yours,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. Have you considered all the consequences of your proposition\r\nrespecting post-roads? I view it as a source of boundless patronage to\r\nthe executive, jobbing to members of Congress and their friends, and a\r\nbottomless abyss of public money. You will begin by only appropriating\r\nthe surplus of the post-office revenues: but the other revenues will\r\nsoon be called in to their aid, and it will be a source of eternal\r\nscramble among the members, who can get the most money wasted in their\r\nState; and they will always get most who are meanest. We have thought,\r\nhitherto, that the roads of a State could not be so well administered\r\neven by the State legislature as by the magistracy of the county, on the\r\nspot. How will they be when a member of New Hampshire is to mark out a\r\nroad for Georgia? Does the power to establish post-roads, given you by\r\nthe constitution, mean that you shall make the roads, or only select\r\nfrom those already made those on which there shall be a post? If the\r\nterm be equivocal (and I really do not think it so), which is the safest\r\nconstruction; that which permits a majority of Congress to go to cutting\r\ndown mountains and bridging of rivers, or the other, which if too\r\nrestricted may be referred to the States for amendment, securing still\r\ndue measures and proportion among us, and providing some means of\r\ninformation to the members of Congress tantamount to that ocular\r\ninspection, which, even in our county determinations, the magistrate\r\nfinds cannot be supplied by any other evidence? The fortification\r\nof harbors was liable to great objection. But national circumstances\r\nfurnished some color. In this case there is none. The roads of America\r\nare the best in the world, except those of France and England. But does\r\nthe state of our population, the extent of our internal commerce, the\r\nwant of sea and river navigation, call for such expense on roads here,\r\nor are our means adequate to it? Think of all this, and a great deal\r\nmore which your good judgment will suggest, and pardon my freedom. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXC.--TO WILLIAM B. GILES, March 19,1796.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\nI know not when I have received greater satisfaction than on reading the\r\nspeech of Dr. Leib, in the Pennsylvania Assembly. He calls himself a new\r\nmember. I congratulate honest republicanism on such an acquisition, and\r\npromise myself much from a career which begins on such elevated ground.\r\nWe are in suspense here to see the fate and effect of Mr. Pitt’s bill\r\nagainst democratic societies. I wish extremely to get at the true\r\nhistory of this effort to suppress freedom of meeting, speaking,\r\nwriting, and printing. Your acquaintance with Sedgwick will enable you\r\nto do it. Pray get the outlines of the bill he intended to have brought\r\nin for this purpose. This will enable us to judge whether we have the\r\nmerit of the invention; whether we were really beforehand with the\r\nBritish Minister on this subject; whether he took his hint from our\r\nproposition, or whether the concurrence in sentiment is merely the\r\nresult of the general truth that great men will think alike and act\r\nalike, though without intercommunication. I am serious in desiring\r\nextremely the outlines of the bill intended for us. From the debates on\r\nthe subject of our seamen, I am afraid as much harm as good will be done\r\nby our endeavors to arm our seamen against impressments. It is proposed\r\nto register them and give them certificates. But these certificates\r\nwill be lost in a thousand ways: a sailor will neglect to take his\r\ncertificate: he is wet twenty times in a voyage; if he goes ashore\r\nwithout it, he is impressed; if with it, he gets drunk, it is lost,\r\nstolen from him, taken from him, and then the want of it gives authority\r\nto impress, which does not exist now. After ten years’ attention to the\r\nsubject, I have never been able to devise any thing effectual, but\r\nthat the circumstance of an American bottom be made, _ipso facto_, a\r\nprotection for a number of seamen proportioned to her tonnage; that\r\nAmerican captains be obliged, when called on by foreign officers, to\r\nparade the men on deck, which would show whether they exceeded their own\r\nquota, and allow the foreign officer to send two or three persons aboard\r\nand hunt for any suspected to be concealed. This, Mr. Pinckney was\r\ninstructed to insist upon with Great Britain; to accept of nothing\r\nshort of it; and, most especially, not to agree that a certificate of\r\ncitizenship should be requirable from our seamen; because it would\r\nbe made a ground for the authorized impressment of them. I am still\r\nsatisfied that such a protection will place them in a worse situation\r\nthan they are at present. It is true, the British Minister has not shown\r\nany disposition to accede to my proposition; but it was not totally\r\nrejected: and if he still refuses, lay a duty of one penny sterling a\r\nyard on British oznaburgs, to make a fund for paying the expenses of\r\nthe agents you are obliged to employ to seek out our suffering seamen. I\r\ncongratulate you on the arrival of Mr. Ames and the British treaty.\r\nThe newspapers had said they would arrive together. We have had a fine\r\nwinter. Wheat looks well. Corn is scarce and dear. Twenty-two shillings\r\nhere, thirty shillings in Amherst. Our blossoms are but just opening.\r\nI have begun the demolition of my house, and hope to get through its\r\nre-edification in the course of the summer. We shall have the eye of\r\na brick-kiln to poke you into, or an octagon to air you in. Adieu\r\naffectionately. March 19,1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCI.--TO COLONEL MONROE, March 21, 1796\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 21, 1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 2nd instant, and now take the liberty of troubling\r\nyou, in order to have the enclosed letter to M. Gautier safely handed to\r\nhim. I will thank you for information that it gets safely to hand, as it\r\nis of considerable importance to him, to the United States, to the State\r\nof Virginia, and to myself, by conveying to him the final arrangement of\r\nthe accounts of Grand and company with all those parties.\r\n\r\nThe British treaty has been formally, at length, laid before Congress.\r\nAll America is a tiptoe to see what the House of Representatives will\r\ndecide on it. We conceive the constitutional doctrine to be, that though\r\nthe President and Senate have the general power of making treaties, yet\r\nwherever they include in a treaty matters confided by the constitution\r\nto the three branches of legislature, an act of legislation will\r\nbe requisite to confirm these articles, and that the House of\r\nRepresentatives, as one branch of the legislature, are perfectly free to\r\npass the act or to refuse it, governing themselves by their own judgment\r\nwhether it is for the good of their constituents to let the treaty\r\ngo into effect or not. On the precedent now to be set will depend the\r\nfuture construction of our constitution, and whether the powers of\r\nlegislation shall be transferred from the President, Senate, and\r\nHouse of Representatives, to the President and Senate, and Piamingo or\r\nany-other Indian, Algerine, or other chief. It is fortunate that the\r\nfirst decision is to be in a case so palpably atrocious, as to have been\r\npredetermined by all America. The appointment of Elsworth Chief Justice,\r\nand Chase one of the judges, is doubtless communicated to you. My\r\nfriendly respects to Mrs. Monroe. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCII.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 27,1796\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 27,1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with Mr. Gallatin’s speech in Bache’s paper of March\r\nthe 14th. It is worthy of being printed at the end of the Federalist, as\r\nthe only rational commentary on the part of the constitution to which\r\nit relates. Not that there may not be objections, and difficult ones,\r\nto it, and which I shall be glad to see his answers to; but if they are\r\nnever answered, they are more easily to be gulped down than those which\r\nlie to the doctrines of his opponents, which do in fact annihilate\r\nthe whole of the powers given by the constitution to the legislature.\r\nAccording to the rule established by usage and common sense, of\r\nconstruing one part of the instrument by another, the objects on which\r\nthe President and Senate may exclusively act by treaty are much\r\nreduced, but the field on which they may act with the sanction of the\r\nlegislature, is large enough: and I see no harm in rendering their\r\nsanction necessary, and not much harm in annihilating the whole\r\ntreaty-making power, except as to making peace. If you decide in favor\r\nof your right to refuse co-operation in any case of treaty, I should\r\nwonder on what occasion it is to be used, if not in one where the\r\nrights, the interest, the honor, and faith of our nation are so grossly\r\nsacrificed; where a faction has entered into a conspiracy with the\r\nenemies of their country to chain down the legislature at the feet of\r\nboth; where the whole mass of your constituents have condemned this work\r\nin the most unequivocal manner, and are looking to you as their last\r\nhope to save them from the effects of the avarice and corruption of\r\nthe first agent, the revolutionary machinations of others, and the\r\nincomprehensible acquiescence of the only honest man who has assented to\r\nit. I wish that his honesty and his political errors may not furnish a\r\nsecond occasion to exclaim, ‘Curse on his virtues, they have undone his\r\ncountry.’ Cold weather, mercury at twenty degrees in the morning. Corn\r\nfallen at Richmond to twenty shillings; stationary here. Nicholas sure\r\nof his election, R. Jouett and Jo. Monroe in competition for the other\r\nvote of the county. Affection to Mrs. M. and yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 19, 1796\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 4th instant came to hand the day before yesterday. I have\r\nturned to the Conventional history, and enclose you an exact copy of\r\nwhat is there on the subject you mentioned. I have also turned to my own\r\npapers, and send you some things extracted from them, which show\r\nthat the recollection of the President has not been accurate, when he\r\nsupposed his own opinion to have been uniformly that declared in his\r\nanswer of March the 30th. The records of the Senate will vouch for this.\r\nMy respects to Mrs. Madison. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The papers referred to in the preceding.]\r\n\r\n_Extract, verbatim, from last page but one and the last page_.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. King suggested that the journals of the Convention should be either\r\ndestroyed, or deposited in the custody of the President. He thought, if\r\nsuffered to be made public, a bad use would be made of them by those who\r\nwould wish to prevent the adoption of the constitution.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Wilson preferred the second expedient. He had at one time liked the\r\nfirst best: but as false suggestions may be propagated, it should not be\r\nmade impossible to contradict them.\r\n\r\n‘A question was then put on depositing the journals and other papers of\r\nthe Convention in the hands of the President, on which New Hampshire,\r\naye, Massachusetts, aye, Connecticut, aye, New Jersey, aye,\r\nPennsylvania, aye, Delaware, aye, Maryland, no, Virginia, aye, North\r\nCarolina, aye, South Carolina, aye, and Georgia, aye. This negative\r\nof Maryland was occasioned by the language of the instructions to the\r\nDeputies of that State, which required them to report to the State the\r\nproceedings of the Convention.\r\n\r\n‘The President having asked what the Convention meant should be done\r\nwith the journals, &c. whether copies were to be allowed to the members,\r\nif applied for, it was resolved _nem. con_., “that he retain the\r\njournals and other papers subject to the order of the Congress, if ever\r\nformed under the constitution.”\r\n\r\n‘The members then proceeded to sign the instrument,’ &c.\r\n\r\n‘In Senate, February 1, 1791.\r\n\r\n‘The committee, to whom was referred that part of the speech of the\r\nPresident of the United States, at the opening of the session, which\r\nrelates to the commerce of the Mediterranean, and also the letter from\r\nthe Secretary of State, dated the 20th of January, 1791, with the papers\r\naccompanying the same, reported; whereupon,\r\n\r\n‘Resolved, That the Senate do advise and consent, that the President of\r\nthe United States take such measures as he may think necessary for the\r\nredemption of the citizens of the United States, now in captivity at\r\nAlgiers, provided the expense shall not exceed forty thousand dollars,\r\nand also, that measures be taken to confirm the treaty now existing\r\nbetween the United States and the Emperor of Morocco.’\r\n\r\nThe above is a copy of a resolve of the Senate, referred to me by the\r\nPresident, to propose an answer to, and I find immediately following\r\nthis, among my papers, a press copy, from an original written fairly in\r\nmy own hand, ready for the President’s signature, and to be given in to\r\nthe Senate, of the following answer.\r\n\r\n‘Gentlemen of the Senate,\r\n\r\n‘I will proceed to take measures for the ransom of our citizens in\r\ncaptivity at Algiers, in conformity with your resolution of advice of\r\nthe 1st instant, so soon as the monies necessary shall be appropriated\r\nby the legislature, and shall be in readiness.\r\n\r\n‘The recognition of our treaty with the new Emperor of Morocco requires\r\nalso previous appropriation and provision. The importance of this last\r\nto the liberty and property of our citizens, induces me to urge it on\r\nyour earliest attention.’\r\n\r\nThough I have no memorandum of the delivery of this to the Senate, yet\r\nI have not the least doubt it was given in to them, and will be found\r\namong their records.\r\n\r\nI find, among my press copies, the following in my hand-writing.\r\n\r\n‘The committee to report, that the President does not think that\r\ncircumstances will justify, in the present instance, his entering into\r\nabsolute engagements for the ransom of our captives in Algiers, nor\r\ncalling for money from the treasury, nor raising it by loan, without\r\nprevious authority from both branches of the legislature.\r\n\r\n‘April 9, 1792.’\r\n\r\nI do not recollect the occasion of the above paper with certainty; but\r\nI think there was a committee appointed by the Senate to confer with\r\nthe President on the subject of the ransom, and to advise what is there\r\ndeclined, and that a member of the committee advising privately with\r\nme as to the report they were to make to the House, I minuted down the\r\nabove, as the substance of what he observed to be the proper report,\r\nafter what had passed with the President, and gave the original to the\r\nmember, preserving the press copy. I think the member was either Mr.\r\nIzard or Mr. Butler, and have no doubt such a report will be found on\r\nthe files of the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May following, in consequence of questions proposed by the\r\nPresident to the Senate, they came to a resolution, on which a mission\r\nwas founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCIV.*--TO P. MAZZEI, April 24, 1796\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. MAZZEI.\r\n\r\nMonticello, April 24, 1796.\r\n\r\nMr Dear Friend,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[* The first part of this letter is on private business, and is\r\ntherefore omitted.]\r\n\r\nThe aspect of our politics has wonderfully changed since you left us.\r\nIn place of that noble love of liberty and republican government which\r\ncarried us triumphantly through the war, an Anglican monarchical and\r\naristocratical party has sprung up, whose avowed object is to draw over\r\nus the substance, as they have already done the forms, of the British\r\ngovernment. The main body of our citizens, however, remain true to their\r\nrepublican principles: the whole landed interest is republican, and so\r\nis a great mass of talents. Against us are the executive, the judiciary,\r\ntwo out of three branches of the legislature, all the officers of the\r\ngovernment, all who want to be officers, all timid men who prefer the\r\ncalm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty, British merchants\r\nand Americans trading on British capitals, speculators and holders in\r\nthe banks and public funds, a contrivance invented for the purposes of\r\ncorruption, and for assimilating us in all things to the rotten as well\r\nas the sound parts of the British model. It would give you a fever, were\r\nI to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies, men\r\nwho were Samsons in the field and Solomons in the council, but who have\r\nhad their heads shorn by the harlot England. In short, we are likely\r\nto preserve the liberty we have obtained only by unremitting labors and\r\nperils. But we shall preserve it; and our mass of weight and wealth on\r\nthe good side is so great, as to leave no danger that force will ever\r\nbe attempted against us. We have only to awake and snap the Lilliputian\r\ncords with which they have been entangling us during the first sleep\r\nwhich succeeded our labors.\r\n\r\nI will forward the testimonial of the death of Mrs. Mazzei, which I can\r\ndo the more incontrovertibly as she is buried in my grave-yard, and I\r\npass her gravel daily. The formalities of the proof you require, will\r\noccasion delay. I begin to feel the effects of age. My health has\r\nsuddenly broken down, with symptoms which give me to believe I shall not\r\nhave much to encounter of the _tedium vita_. While it remains, however,\r\nmy heart will be warm in its friendships, and, among these, will\r\nalways foster the affections with which I am, Dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, June 12, 1796\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 12, 1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nCongress have risen. You will have seen by their proceedings the truth\r\nof what I always observed to you, that one man outweighs them all in\r\ninfluence over the people, who have supported his judgment against their\r\nown and that of their representatives. Republicanism must lie on its\r\noars, resign the vessel to its pilot, and themselves to the course he\r\nthinks best for them. I had always conjectured, from such facts as I\r\ncould get hold of, that our public debt was increasing about a million\r\nof dollars a year. You will see by Gallatin’s speeches that the thing\r\nis proved. You will see farther, that we are completely saddled and\r\nbridled, and that the bank is so firmly mounted on us that we must\r\ngo where they will guide. They openly publish a resolution, that the\r\nnational property being increased in value, they must by an increase\r\nof circulating medium furnish an adequate representation of it, and\r\nby further additions of active capital promote the enterprises of our\r\nmerchants. It is supposed that the paper in circulation in and around\r\nPhiladelphia amounts to twenty millions of dollars, and that in the\r\nwhole Union, to one hundred millions. I think the last too high. All\r\nthe imported commodities are raised about fifty per cent. by the\r\ndepreciation of the money. Tobacco shares the rise, because it has\r\nno competition abroad. Wheat has been extraordinarily high from other\r\ncauses. When these cease, it must fall to its ancient nominal price,\r\nnotwithstanding the depreciation of that, because it must contend in\r\nmarket with foreign wheats. Lands have risen within the vortex of the\r\npaper, and as far out as that can influence. They have not risen at all\r\nhere. On the contrary, they are lower than they were twenty years ago.\r\nThose I had mentioned to you, to wit, Carter’s and Colle, were sold\r\nbefore your letter came. Colle at two dollars the acre. Carter’s had\r\nbeen offered me for two French crowns (13s. 2d.) Mechanics here get from\r\na dollar to a dollar and a half a day, yet are much worse off than at\r\nthe old prices.\r\n\r\nVolney is with me at present. He is on his way to the Illinois. Some\r\nlate appointments, judiciary and diplomatic, you will have heard,\r\nand stared at. The death of R. Jouett is the only small news in our\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nOur best affections attend Mrs. Monroe, Eliza, and yourself. Adieu\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCVI.--TO THE PRESIDENT, June 19, 1796\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nIn Bache’s Aurora of the 9th instant, which came here by the last post,\r\na paper appears, which having been confided, as I presume, to but few\r\nhands, makes it truly wonderful how it should have got there. I cannot\r\nbe satisfied as to my own part, till I relieve my mind by declaring, and\r\nI attest every thing sacred and honorable to the declaration, that it\r\nhas got there neither through me nor the paper confided to me. This has\r\nnever been from under my own lock and key, or out of my own hands.\r\nNo mortal ever knew from me, that these questions had been proposed.\r\nPerhaps I ought to except one person, who possesses all my confidence,\r\nas he has possessed yours. I do not remember, indeed, that I\r\ncommunicated it even to him. But as I was in the habit of unlimited\r\ntrust and counsel with him, it is possible I may have read it to him; no\r\nmore: for the quire of which it makes a part was never in any hand but\r\nmy own, nor was a word ever copied or taken down from it, by any body. I\r\ntake on myself, without fear, any divulgation on his part. We both know\r\nhim incapable of it. From myself, then, or my paper, this publication\r\nhas never been derived. I have formerly mentioned to you, that from a\r\nvery early period of my life, I had laid it down as a rule of conduct\r\nnever to write a word for the public papers. From this, I have never\r\ndeparted in a single instance; and on a late occasion, when all the\r\nworld seemed to be writing, besides a rigid adherence to my own rule, I\r\ncan say with truth, that not a line for the press was ever communicated\r\nto me, by any other, except a single petition referred for my\r\ncorrection; which I did not correct, however, though the contrary, as\r\nI have heard, was said in a public place, by one person through error,\r\nthrough malice by another. I learn that this last has thought it worth\r\nhis while to try to sow tares between you and me, by representing me as\r\nstill engaged in the bustle of politics, and in turbulence and intrigue\r\nagainst the government. I never believed for a moment that this could\r\nmake any impression on you, or that your knowledge of me would not\r\noverweigh the slander of an intriguer, dirtily employed in sifting the\r\nconversations of my table, where alone he could hear of me; and seeking\r\nto atone for his sins against you by sins against another, who had\r\nnever done him any other injury than that of declining his confidences.\r\nPolitical conversations I really dislike, and therefore avoid where\r\nI can without affectation. But when urged by others, I have never\r\nconceived that having been in public life requires me to belie my\r\nsentiments, or even to conceal them. When I am led by conversation to\r\nexpress them, I do it with the same independence here, which I have\r\npractised every where, and which is inseparable from my nature. But\r\nenough of this miserable tergiversator, who ought indeed either to have\r\nbeen of more truth, or less trusted by his country.*\r\n\r\n     [* Here, in the margin of the copy, is written, apparently\r\n     at a later date, * General H. Lee.’]\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of papers, permit me to ask one from you. You\r\nremember the difference of opinion between Hamilton and Knox on the one\r\npart, and myself on the other, on the subject of firing on the Little\r\nSarah, and that we had exchanged opinions and reasons in writing. On\r\nyour arrival in Philadelphia I delivered you a copy of my reasons, in\r\nthe presence of Colonel Hamilton. On our withdrawing, he told me he had\r\nbeen so much engaged that he had not been able to prepare a copy of his\r\nand General Knox’s for you, and that if I would send you the one he had\r\ngiven me, he would replace it in a few days. I immediately sent it to\r\nyou, wishing you should see both sides of the subject together. I often\r\nafter applied to both the gentlemen, but could never obtain another\r\ncopy. I have often thought of asking this one, or a copy of it, back\r\nfrom you, but have not before written on subjects of this kind to you.\r\nThough I do not know that it will ever be of the least importance to me,\r\nyet one loves to possess arms, though they hope never to have occasion\r\nfor them. They possess my paper in my own hand-writing. It is just I\r\nshould possess theirs. The only thing amiss is, that they should have\r\nleft me to seek a return of the paper, or a copy of it, from you.\r\n\r\nI put away this disgusting dish of old fragments, and talk to you of my\r\npease and clover. As to the latter article, I have great encouragement\r\nfrom the friendly nature of our soil. I think I have had, both the last\r\nand present year, as good clover from common grounds, which had brought\r\nseveral crops of wheat and corn without ever having been manured, as I\r\never saw on the lots around Philadelphia. I verily believe that a field\r\nof thirty-four acres, sowed on wheat April was twelvemonth, has given me\r\na ton to the acre at its first cutting this spring. The stalks extended,\r\nmeasured three and a half feet long very commonly. Another field, a year\r\nolder, and which yielded as well the last year, has sensibly fallen off\r\nthis year. My exhausted fields bring a clover not high enough for\r\nhay, but I hope to make seed from it. Such as these, however, I shall\r\nhereafter put into pease in the broadcast, proposing that one of my\r\nsowings of wheat shall be after two years of clover, and the other after\r\ntwo years of pease. I am trying the white boiling pea of Europe (the\r\nAlbany pea) this year, till I can get the hog-pea of England, which is\r\nthe most productive of all. But the true winter-vetch is what we want\r\nextremely. I have tried this year the Caroline drill. It is absolutely\r\nperfect. Nothing can be more simple, nor perform its office more\r\nperfectly for a single row. I shall try to make one to sow four rows at\r\na time of wheat or peas, at twelve inches distance. I have one of the\r\nScotch threshing-machines nearly finished. It is copied exactly from\r\na model of Mr. Pinckney sent me, only that I have put the whole works\r\n(except the horse-wheel) into a single frame, moveable from one field\r\nto another on the two axles of a wagon. It will be ready in time for the\r\nharvest which is coming on, which will give it a full trial. Our\r\nwheat and rye are generally fine, and the prices talked of bid fair to\r\nindemnify us for the poor crops of the two last years.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of putting under your cover a letter to the son of\r\nthe Marquis de la Fayette, not exactly knowing where to direct to him.\r\n\r\nWith very affectionate compliments to Mrs. Washington, I have the honor\r\nto be, with great and sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCVII.--TO M. DE LA FAYETTE, June 19, 1796\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, June 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe inquiries of Congress were the first intimation which reached my\r\nretirement of your being in this country, and from M. Volney, now\r\nwith me, I first learned where you are. I avail myself of the earliest\r\nmoments of this information, to express to you the satisfaction with\r\nwhich I learn that you are in the land of safety, where you will meet in\r\nevery person the friend of your worthy father and family. Among these I\r\nbeg leave to mingle my own assurances of sincere attachment to him, and\r\nmy desire to prove it by every service I can render you. I know, indeed,\r\nthat you are already under too good a patronage to need any other, and\r\nthat my distance and retirement render my affections unavailing to you.\r\nThey exist, nevertheless, in all their purity and warmth towards your\r\nfather and every one embraced by his love; and no one has wished with\r\nmore anxiety to see him once more in the bosom of a nation, who, knowing\r\nhis works and his worth, desire to make him and his family for ever\r\ntheir own. You were, perhaps, too young to remember me personally when\r\nin Paris. But I pray you to remember, that should any occasion offer\r\nwherein I can be useful to you, there is no one on whose friendship and\r\nzeal you may more confidently count. You will, some day perhaps, take a\r\ntour through these States. Should any thing in this part of them attract\r\nyour curiosity, it would be a circumstance of great gratification to me\r\nto receive you here, and to assure you in person of those sentiments of\r\nesteem, and attachment with which I am, Dear Sir, your friend and humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCVIII.--TO JONATHAN WILLIAMS, July 3,1796\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JONATHAN WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 3,1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI take shame to myself for having so long left unanswered your valuable\r\nfavor on the subject of the mountains. But in truth, I am become lazy as\r\nto every thing except agriculture. The preparations for harvest, and\r\nthe length of the harvest itself, which is not yet finished, would have\r\nexcused the delay however, at all times and under all dispositions. I\r\nexamined, with great satisfaction, your barometrical estimate of the\r\nheights of our mountains; and with the more, as they corroborated\r\nconjectures on this subject which I had made before. My estimates\r\nhad made them a little higher than yours (I speak of the Blue Ridge.)\r\nMeasuring with a very nice instrument the angle subtended vertically\r\nby the highest mountain of the Blue Ridge opposite to my own house,\r\na distance of about eighteen miles south westward, I made the highest\r\nabout two thousand feet, as well as I remember, for I can no longer find\r\nthe notes I made. You make the south side of the mountain near Rockfish\r\nGap, one thousand seven hundred and twenty-two feet above Woods. You\r\nmake the other side of the mountain seven hundred and sixty-seven feet.\r\nMr. Thomas Lewis, deceased, an accurate man, with a good quadrant, made\r\nthe north side of the highest mountain opposite my house something more\r\n(I think) than one thousand feet; but the mountain estimated by him and\r\nmyself is probably higher than that next Rockfish Gap. I do not remember\r\nfrom what principles I estimated the Peaks of Otter at four thousand\r\nfeet; but some late observations of Judge Tucker’s coincided very nearly\r\nwith my estimate. Your measures confirm another opinion of mine that\r\nthe Blue Ridge, on its south side, is the highest ridge in our country\r\ncompared with its base. I think your observations on these mountains\r\nwell worthy of being published, and hope you will not scruple to let\r\nthem be communicated to the world.\r\n\r\nYou wish me to present to the Philosophical Society the result of my\r\nphilosophical researches since my retirement. But, my good Sir, I have\r\nmade researches into nothing but what is connected with agriculture.\r\nIn this way, I have a little matter to communicate, and will do it ere\r\nlong. It is the form of a mould-board of least resistance. I had some\r\nyears ago conceived the principles of it, and I explained them to Mr.\r\nRittenhouse. I have since reduced the thing to practice, and have reason\r\nto believe the theory fully confirmed. I only wish for one of those\r\ninstruments used in England for measuring the force exerted in the\r\ndraughts of different ploughs, &c, that I might compare the resistance\r\nof my mould-board with that, of others. But these instruments are not\r\nto be had here. In a letter of this date to Mr. Rittenhouse, I mention\r\na discovery in animal history very signal indeed, of which I shall\r\nlay before the Society the best account I can, as soon as I shall have\r\nreceived some other materials collecting for me.\r\n\r\nI have seen, with extreme indignation, the blasphemies lately vended\r\nagainst the memory of the father of American philosophy. But his memory\r\nwill be preserved and venerated as long as the thunder of heaven shall\r\nbe heard or feared.\r\n\r\nWith good wishes to all of his family, and sentiments of great respect\r\nand esteem for yourself, I am, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCIX.--TO COLONEL MONROE, July 10, 1796\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, July 10, 1796.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe campaign of Congress has closed. Though the Anglomen have in the end\r\ngot their treaty through, and so far have triumphed over the cause of\r\nrepublicanism, yet it has been to them a dear-bought victory. It has\r\ngiven the most radical shock to their party which it has ever received:\r\nand, there is no doubt, they would be glad to be replaced on the ground\r\nthey possessed the instant before Jay’s nomination extraordinary. They\r\nsee that nothing can support them but the colossus of the President’s\r\nmerits with the people, and the moment he retires, that his successor,\r\nif a monocrat, will be overborne by the republican sense of his\r\nconstituents; if a republican, he will of course give fair play to that\r\nsense, and lead things into the channel of harmony between the governors\r\nand governed. In the mean time, patience.\r\n\r\nAmong your neighbors there is nothing new. Mr. Rittenhouse is lately\r\ndead. We have had the finest harvest ever known in this part of the\r\ncountry. Both the quantity and quality of wheat are extraordinary. We\r\ngot fifteen shillings a bushel for the last crop, and hope two thirds of\r\nthat at least for the present one.\r\n\r\nMost assiduous court is paid to Patrick Henry. He has been offered every\r\nthing which they knew he would not accept. Some impression is thought to\r\nbe made, but we do not believe it is radical. If they thought they could\r\ncount upon him, they would run him for their Vice-President; their first\r\nobject being to produce a schism in the State. As it is, they will run\r\nMr. Pinckney; in which they regard his southern position rather than\r\nhis principles. Mr. Jay and his advocate Camillus are completely\r\ntreaty-foundered.\r\n\r\nWe all join in love to Mrs. Monroe; and accept for yourself assurances\r\nof sincere and affectionate friendship. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CC.--TO JAMES MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 17, 1796.\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 5th came to hand last night. The first wish of my\r\nheart was, that you should have been proposed for the administration\r\nof the government. On your declining it, I wish any body rather than\r\nmyself: and there is nothing I so anxiously hope, as that my name may\r\ncome out either second or third. These would be indifferent to me;\r\nas the last would leave me at home the whole year, and the other, two\r\nthirds of it. I have no expectation that the eastern States will suffer\r\nthemselves to be so much outwitted, as to be made the tools for bringing\r\nin P. instead of A. I presume they will throw away their second vote.\r\nIn this case, it begins to appear possible, that there may be an equal\r\ndivision where I had supposed the republican vote would have been\r\nconsiderably minor. It seems also possible, that the Representatives\r\nmay be divided. This is a difficulty from which the constitution has\r\nprovided no issue. It is both my duty and inclination, therefore, to\r\nrelieve the embarrassment, should it happen: and in that case, I pray\r\nyou and authorize you fully, to solicit on my behalf that Mr. Adams may\r\nbe preferred. He has always been my senior, from the commencement of\r\nour public life, and the expression of the public will being equal, this\r\ncircumstance ought to give him the preference. And when so many motives\r\nwill be operating to induce some of the members to change their vote,\r\nthe addition of my wish may have some effect to preponderate the scale.\r\nI am really anxious to see the speech. It must exhibit a very different\r\npicture of our foreign affairs from that presented in the adieu, or it\r\nwill little correspond with my views of them. I think they never wore\r\nso gloomy an aspect since the year 1783. Let those come to the helm who\r\nthink they can steer clear of the difficulties. I have no confidence in\r\nmyself for the undertaking.\r\n\r\nWe have had the severest weather ever known in November. The thermometer\r\nwas at twelve degrees here and in Goochland, and I suppose generally.\r\nIt arrested my buildings very suddenly, when eight days more would\r\nhave completed my walls, and permitted us to cover in. The drought is\r\nexcessive. From the middle of October to the middle of December, not\r\nrain enough to lay the dust. A few days ago there fell a small rain, but\r\nthe succeeding cold has probably prevented it from sprouting the grain\r\nsown during the drought.\r\n\r\nPresent me in friendly terms to Messrs. Giles, Venable, and Page. Adieu\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCI.--TO EDWARD RUTLEDGE, December 27, 1796\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 27, 1796.\r\n\r\nMr Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nYou have seen my name lately tacked to so much of eulogy and of abuse,\r\nthat I dare say you hardly thought it meant your old acquaintance of\r\n‘76. In truth, I did not know myself under the pens either of my friends\r\nor foes. It is unfortunate for our peace that unmerited abuse wounds,\r\nwhile unmerited praise has not the power to heal. These are hard wages\r\nfor the services of all the active and healthy years of one’s life. I\r\nhad retired after five and twenty years of constant occupation in public\r\naffairs, and total abandonment of my own. I retired much poorer than\r\nwhen I entered the public service, and desired nothing but rest and\r\noblivion. My name, however, was again brought forward, without concert\r\nor expectation on my part; (on my salvation I declare it.) I do not as\r\nyet know the result, as a matter of fact; for in my retired canton we\r\nhave nothing later from Philadelphia than of the second week of this\r\nmonth. Yet I have never one moment doubted the result I knew it was\r\nimpossible Mr. Adams should lose a vote north of the Delaware, and that\r\nthe free and moral agency of the south would furnish him an abundant\r\nsupplement. On principles of public respect I should not have refused;\r\nbut I protest before my God that I shall, from the bottom of my heart,\r\nrejoice at escaping. I know well that no man will ever bring out of that\r\noffice the reputation which carries him into it. The honey-moon would be\r\nas short in that case as in any other, and its moments of extacy would\r\nbe ransomed by years of torment and hatred. I shall highly value indeed,\r\nthe share which I may have had in the late vote, as an evidence of the\r\nshare I hold in the esteem of my countrymen. But in this point of view,\r\na few votes more or less will be little sensible, and in every other,\r\nthe minor will be preferred by me to the major vote. I have no ambition\r\nto govern men; no passion which would lead me to delight to ride in a\r\nstorm. _Flumina amo sylvasque, inglorius_. My attachment to my home has\r\nenabled me to make the calculation with rigor, perhaps with partiality,\r\nto the issue which keeps me there. The newspapers will permit me to\r\nplant my corn, pease, &c. in hills or drills as I please (and my\r\noranges by the bye when you send them), while our eastern friend will\r\nbe struggling with the storm which is gathering over us; perhaps be\r\nshipwrecked in it. This is certainly not a moment to covet the helm.\r\n\r\nI have often doubted whether most to praise or to blame your line of\r\nconduct. If you had lent to your country the excellent talents you\r\npossess, on you would have fallen those torrents of abuse which have\r\nlately been poured forth on me. So far, I praise the wisdom which has\r\ndescried and steered clear of a waterspout ahead. But now for the\r\nblame. There is a debt of service due from every man to his country,\r\nproportioned to the bounties which nature and fortune have measured to\r\nhim. Counters will pay this from the poor of spirit; but from you, my\r\nfriend, coin was due. There is no bankrupt-law in heaven, by which you\r\nmay get off with shillings in the pound; with rendering to a single\r\nState what you owed to the whole confederacy. I think it was by the\r\nRoman law that a father was denied sepulture, unless his son would pay\r\nhis debts. Happy for you and us, that you have a son whom genius and\r\neducation have qualified to pay yours. But as you have been a good\r\nfather in every thing else, be so in this also. Come forward and\r\npay your own debts. Your friends, the Mr. Pinckneys, have at length\r\nundertaken their tour. My joy at this would be complete if you were in\r\ngear with them. I love to see honest and honorable men at the helm, men\r\nwho will not bend their politics to their purses, nor pursue measures by\r\nwhich they may profit, and then profit by their measures. _Au diable les\r\nBougres!_ I am at the end of my curse and bottom of my page, so God bless\r\nyou and yours. _Adieu_ affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, December 28,1796\r\n\r\nMonticello, December 28,1796.\r\n\r\n_Statement, from memory, of a Letter I wrote to John Adams; copy omitted\r\nto be retained_.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe public, and the public papers, have been much occupied lately in\r\nplacing us in a point of opposition to each other. I confidently trust\r\nwe have felt less of it ourselves. In the retired canton where I\r\nlive, we know little of what is passing. Our last information from\r\nPhiladelphia is of the 16th instant. At that date, the issue of the\r\nlate election seems not to have been known as a matter of fact. With me,\r\nhowever, its issue was never doubted. I knew the impossibility of your\r\nlosing a single vote north of the Delaware; and even if you should lose\r\nthat of Pennsylvania in the mass, you would get enough south of it to\r\nmake your election sure. I never for a single moment expected any other\r\nissue, and though I shall not be believed, yet it is not the less true,\r\nthat I never wished any other. My neighbors, as my compurgators, could\r\naver this fact, as seeing my occupations and my attachment to them. It\r\nis possible, indeed, that even you may be cheated of your succession\r\nby a trick worthy the subtlety of your arch friend of New York, who has\r\nbeen able to make of your real friends tools for defeating their and\r\nyour just wishes. Probably, however, he will be disappointed as to\r\nyou; and my inclinations put me out of his reach. I leave to others the\r\nsublime delights of riding in the storm, better pleased with sound sleep\r\nand a warmer birth below it, encircled with the society of my neighbors,\r\nfriends, and fellow-laborers of the earth, rather than with spies and\r\nsycophants. Still, I shall value highly the share I may have had in\r\nthe late vote, as a measure of the share I hold in the esteem of my\r\nfellow-citizens. In this point of view, a few votes less are but little\r\nsensible, while a few more would have been in their effect very sensible\r\nand oppressive to me. I have no ambition to govern men. It is a painful\r\nand thankless office. And never since the day you signed the treaty of\r\nParis, has our horizon been so overcast. I devoutly wish you may be able\r\nto shun for us this war, which will destroy our agriculture, commerce,\r\nand credit. If you do, the glory will be all your own. And that your\r\nadministration may be filled with glory and happiness to yourself, and\r\nadvantage to us, is the sincere prayer of one, who, though in the course\r\nof our voyage, various little incidents have happened or been contrived\r\nto separate us, yet retains for you the solid esteem of the times when\r\nwe were working for our independence, and sentiments of sincere respect\r\nand attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCIII.--to James Madison, January 1, 1797\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 1, 1797.\r\n\r\n_Statement, from memory, of a Letter I wrote to James Madison; copy\r\nomitted to be retained_.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of December the 19th is safely received. I never entertained a\r\ndoubt of the event of the election. I knew that the eastern troops\r\nwere trained in the schools of their town-meetings, to sacrifice little\r\ndifferences of opinion to the solid advantages of operating in phalanx,\r\nand that the more free and moral agency of the other States would fully\r\nsupply their deficiency. I had no expectation, indeed, that the vote\r\nwould have approached so near an equality. It is difficult to obtain\r\nfull credit to declarations of disinclination to honors, and most so\r\nwith those who still remain in the world. But never was there a more\r\nsolid unwillingness, founded on rigorous calculation, formed in the mind\r\nof any man, short of peremptory refusal. No arguments, therefore, Were\r\nnecessary to reconcile me to a relinquishment of the first office, or\r\nacceptance of the second. No motive could have induced me to undertake\r\nthe first, but that of putting our vessel upon her republican tack, and\r\npreventing her being driven too far to leeward of her true principles.\r\nAnd the second is the only office in the world about which I cannot\r\ndecide in my own mind, whether I had rather have it or not have it.\r\nPride does not enter into the estimate. For I think with the Romans of\r\nold, that the General of to-day should be a common soldier to-morrow, if\r\nnecessary. But as to Mr. Adams, particularly, I could have no feelings\r\nwhich would revolt at being placed in a secondary station to him. I\r\nam his junior in life, I was his junior in Congress, his junior in the\r\ndiplomatic line, and lately his junior in our civil government. I had\r\nwritten him the enclosed letter before the receipt of yours. I had\r\nintended it for some time, but had put it off, from time to time, from\r\nthe discouragement of despair to make him believe me sincere. As the\r\ninformation by the last post does not make it necessary to change any\r\nthing in the letter, I enclose it open for your perusal, as well that\r\nyou may be possessed of the true state of dispositions between us,\r\nas that if there be any circumstance which might render its delivery\r\nineligible, you may return it to me. If Mr. Adams could be induced to\r\nadminister the government on its true principles, quitting his bias for\r\nan English constitution, it would be worthy consideration whether it\r\nwould not be for the public good, to come to a good understanding with\r\nhim as to his future elections. He is the only sure barrier against\r\nHamilton’s getting in.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe Political Progress is a work of value and of a singular complexion.\r\nThe author’s eye seems to be a natural achromatic, divesting every\r\nobject of the glare of color. The former work of the same title\r\npossessed the same kind of merit. They disgust one, indeed, by opening\r\nto his view the ulcerated state of the human mind. But to cure an ulcer\r\nyou must go to the bottom of it, which no author does more radically\r\nthan this. The reflections into which it leads us are not very\r\nflattering to the human species. In the whole animal kingdom I\r\nrecollect no family but man, steadily and systematically employed in the\r\ndestruction of itself. Nor does what is called civilization produce any\r\nother effect than to teach him to pursue the principle of the _bellum\r\nomnium in omnia_ on a greater scale, and instead of the little contests\r\nbetween tribe and tribe, to comprehend all the quarters of the earth\r\nin the same work of destruction. If to this we add, that, as to other\r\nanimals, the lions and tigers are mere lambs compared with man as a\r\ndestroyer, we must conclude that nature has been able to find in man\r\nalone a sufficient barrier against the too great multiplication of other\r\nanimals and of man himself, an equilibrating power against the fecundity\r\nof generation. While, in making these observations, my situation points\r\nmy attention to the warfare of man in the physical world, yours may\r\nperhaps present him as equally warring in the moral one.\r\n\r\nAdieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCIV.--TO MR. VOLNEY, January 8, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VOLNEY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 8, 1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your two favors of December the 26th and 29th. Your\r\nimpatience to receive your valise and its key was natural: and it is we\r\nwho have been to blame; Mr. Randolph, for not taking information of the\r\nvessel and address to which your valise was committed, and myself, for\r\nhaving waited till I heard of your being again immerged into the land of\r\nnewspapers before forwarded your key. However, as you have at length got\r\nthem safe, I claim absolution under the proverb, that ‘all is well which\r\nends well.’\r\n\r\nAbout the end of 1793, I received from Mr. Dombey (then at Lyons)\r\na letter announcing his intention to come here. And in May, 1794, I\r\nreceived one from a M. L’Epine, dated from New York, and stating himself\r\nto be master of the brig De Boon, Captain Brown, which had sailed from\r\nHavre with Mr. Dombey on board, who had sealed up his baggage and wrote\r\nmy address on them, to save them in case of capture; and that when they\r\nwere taken, the address did in fact protect them. He mentioned then\r\nthe death of Mr. Dombey, and that he had delivered his baggage to the\r\nCustom-House at New York. I immediately wrote to M. L’Epine, disclaiming\r\nany right or interest in the packages under my address, and authorizing,\r\nas far as depended on me, the Consul at New York, or any person the\r\nrepresentative of Mr. Dombey to open the packages and dispose of them\r\naccording to right. I enclosed this letter open to Mr. Randolph, then\r\nSecretary of State, to get his interference for the liberation of the\r\neffects. It may have happened that he failed to forward the letter, or\r\nthat M. L’Epine may have gone before it reached New York. In any event,\r\nI can do no more than repeat my disclaimer of any right to Mr. Dombey’s\r\neffects, and add all the authority which I can give to yourself, or to\r\nthe Consul of France at New York, to do with those effects whatever I\r\nmight do. Certainly it would be a great gratification to me to receive\r\nthe Mètre and Grave committed to Mr. Dombey for me, and that you\r\nwould be so good as to be the channel of my acknowledgments to Bishop\r\nGregoire, or any one else to whom I should owe this favor.\r\n\r\nYou wish to know the state of the air here during the late cold spell,\r\nor rather the present one, for it is at this moment so cold that the ink\r\nfreezes in my pen, so that my letter will scarcely be legible.\r\n\r\nThe following is copied from my diary:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page342]\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1779-80, the mercury in Fahrenheit’s thermometer fell\r\nat Williamsburg once to six degrees above zero. In 1783-84, I was at\r\nAnnapolis without a thermometer, and I do not know that there was one\r\nin that State: I heard from Virginia, that the mercury was again down to\r\nsix degrees. In 1789-90, I was at Paris. The mercury here was as low\r\nas eighteen degrees below zero, of Fahrenheit. These have been the most\r\nremarkably cold winters ever known in America. We are told, however,\r\nthat in 1762, at Philadelphia, it was twenty-two degrees below zero: in\r\nDecember, 1793, it was three degrees below zero there by my thermometer.\r\nOn the 31st of January, 1796, it was one and three-fourth degrees above\r\nzero at Monticello. I shall therefore have to change the maximum of our\r\ncold, if ever I revise the Notes on Virginia; as six degrees above zero\r\nwas the greatest which had ever been observed.\r\n\r\nIt seems possible, from what we hear of the votes at the late election,\r\nthat you may see me in Philadelphia about the beginning of March,\r\nexactly in that character which, if I were to re-appear at Philadelphia,\r\nI would prefer to all others; for I change the sentiment of Clorinda to\r\n‘_L’alte temo, l’humili non sdegno_.’ I have no inclination to govern\r\nmen. I should have no views of my own in doing it; and as to those of\r\nthe governed, I had rather that their disappointment (which must always\r\nhappen) should be pointed to any other cause, real or supposed, than to\r\nmyself. I value the late vote highly; but it is only as the index of the\r\nplace I hold in the esteem of my fellow citizens. In this point of\r\nview, the difference between sixty-eight and seventy-one votes is\r\nlittle sensible, and still less that between the real vote, which was\r\nsixty-nine and seventy; because one real elector in Pennsylvania was\r\nexcluded from voting by the miscarriage of the votes, and one who was\r\nnot an elector was admitted to vote. My farm, my family, my books, and\r\nmy building give me much more pleasure than any public office would,\r\nand, especially, one which would keep me constantly from them. I had\r\nhoped, when you were here, to have finished the walls of my house in the\r\nautumn, and to have covered it early in winter. But we did not finish\r\nthem at all. I have to resume the work, therefore, in the spring, and to\r\ntake off the roof of the old part during the summer, to cover the\r\nwhole. This will render it necessary for me to make a very short stay in\r\nPhiladelphia, should the late vote have given me any public duty there.\r\nMy visit there will be merely out of respect to the public, and to the\r\nnew President.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you have received so little information on the subject of our\r\nwinds. I had once (before our revolutionary war) a project on the same\r\nsubject. As I had then an extensive acquaintance over this State, I\r\nmeant to have engaged some person in every county of it, giving them\r\neach a thermometer, to observe that and the winds twice a day, for one\r\nyear, to wit, at sunrise and at four P. M. (the coldest and the warmest\r\npoint of the twenty-four hours) and to communicate their observations to\r\nme at the end of the year. I should then have selected the days in which\r\nit appeared that the winds blew to a centre within the State, and\r\nhave made a map of them, and seen how far they had analogy with the\r\ntemperature of the air. I meant this to be merely a specimen to be\r\ncommunicated to the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, in order to\r\nengage them, by means of their correspondents, to have the same thing\r\ndone in every State, and through a series of years. By seizing the days\r\nwhen the winds centred in any part of the United States, we might, in\r\ntime, have come at some of the causes which determine the direction\r\nof the winds, which I suspect to be very various. But this long-winded\r\nproject was prevented by the war which came upon us, and since that\r\nI have been far otherwise engaged. I am sure you will have viewed the\r\nsubject from much higher ground, and I shall be happy to learn your\r\nviews in some of the hours of _délassement_, which I hope we are yet\r\nto pass together. To this must be added your observations on the new\r\ncharacter of man, which you have seen in your journey, as he is in all\r\nhis shapes a curious animal, on whom no one is better qualified to judge\r\nthan yourself; and no one will be more pleased to participate of\r\nyour views of him than one, who has the pleasure of offering you his\r\nsentiments of sincere respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCV.--TO HENRY TAZEWELL, January 16, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY TAZEWELL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 16, 1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAs far as the public papers are to be credited, I may suppose that the\r\nchoice of Vice-President has fallen on me. On this hypothesis I trouble\r\nyou, and only pray, if it be wrong, that you will consider this letter\r\nas not written. I believe it belongs to the Senate to notify the\r\nVice-President of his election. I recollect to have heard, that on\r\nthe first election of President and Vice-President, gentlemen of\r\nconsiderable office were sent to notify the parties chosen. But this was\r\nthe inauguration of our new government, and ought not to be drawn into\r\nexample. At the second election, both gentlemen were on the spot and\r\nneeded no messengers. On the present occasion, the President will be\r\non the spot, so that what is now to be done respects myself alone: and\r\nconsidering that the season of notification will always present one\r\ndifficulty, that the distance in the present case adds a second, not\r\ninconsiderable, and which may in future happen to be sometimes much more\r\nconsiderable, I hope the Senate will adopt that method of notification,\r\nwhich will always be least troublesome and most certain. The channel\r\nof the post is certainly the least troublesome, is the most rapid, and,\r\nconsidering also that it may be sent by duplicates and triplicates,\r\nis unquestionably the most certain. Indorsed to the postmaster at\r\nCharlottesville, with an order to send it by express, no hazard\r\ncan endanger the notification. Apprehending, that should there be\r\na difference of opinion on this subject in the senate, my ideas of\r\nself-respect might be supposed by some to require something more formal\r\nand inconvenient, I beg leave to avail myself of your friendship to\r\ndeclare, if a different proposition should make it necessary, that I\r\nconsider the channel of the post-office as the most eligible in every\r\nrespect, and that it is to me the most desirable; which I take the\r\nliberty of expressing, not with a view of encroaching on the respect\r\ndue to that discretion which the Senate have a right to exercise on the\r\noccasion, but to render them the more free in the exercise of it, by\r\ntaking off whatsoever weight the supposition of a contrary desire in me\r\nmight have on the mind of any member.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere respect, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCVI.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 16, 1797\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 16, 1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe several accidents of the winter, ice, floods, rains, prevented the\r\nOrange post from coming to Charlottesville the last post-day, so that\r\nwe have nothing from Philadelphia the last week. I see however, by the\r\nRichmond papers, a probability that the choice of Vice-President has\r\nfallen on me. I have written the enclosed letter therefore to Mr.\r\nTazewell, as a private friend, and have left it open for your perusal.\r\nIt will explain its own object, and I pray you and Mr. Tazewell to\r\ndecide in your own discretion how it may best be used for its object, so\r\nas to avoid the imputation of an indecent forwardness in me.\r\n\r\nI observe doubts are still expressed as to the validity of the Vermont\r\nelection. Surely, in so great a case, substance, and not form, should\r\nprevail. I cannot suppose that the Vermont constitution has been strict\r\nin requiring particular forms of expressing the legislative will. As far\r\nas my disclaimer may have any effect, I pray you to declare it on every\r\noccasion, foreseen or not foreseen by me, in favor of the choice of\r\nthe people substantially expressed, and to prevent the phenomenon of a\r\npseudo-President at so early a day. Adieu. Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 22, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 8th came to hand yesterday. I was not aware of any\r\nnecessity of going on to Philadelphia immediately, yet I had determined\r\nto do it as a mark of respect to the public, and to do away the doubts\r\nwhich have spread, that I should consider the second office as beneath\r\nmy acceptance. The journey, indeed, for the month of February, is a\r\ntremendous undertaking for me, who have not been seven miles from home\r\nsince my re-settlement. I will see you about the rising of Congress; and\r\npresume I need not stay there a week. Your letters written before the\r\n7th of February will still find me here. My letters inform me that Mr.\r\nAdams speaks of me with great friendship, and with satisfaction in the\r\nprospect of administering the government in concurrence with me. I am\r\nglad of the first information, because though I saw that our ancient\r\nfriendship was affected by a little leaven, produced partly by his\r\nconstitution, partly by the contrivance of others, yet I never felt\r\na diminution of confidence in his integrity, and retained a solid\r\naffection for him. His principles of government I knew to be\r\nchanged, but conscientiously changed. As to my participating in the\r\nadministration, if by that he meant the executive cabinet, both duty and\r\ninclination will shut that door to me. I cannot have a wish to see the\r\nscenes of 1793 revived as to myself, and to descend daily into the arena\r\nlike a gladiator, to suffer martyrdom in every conflict. As to duty, the\r\nconstitution will know me only as the member of a legislative body: and\r\nits principle is, that of a separation of legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary functions, except in cases specified. If this principle be\r\nnot expressed in direct terms, yet it is clearly the spirit of the\r\nconstitution, and it ought to be so commented and acted on by every\r\nfriend to free government.\r\n\r\nI sincerely deplore the situation of our affairs with France. War\r\nwith them, and consequent alliance with Great Britain, will completely\r\ncompass the object of the executive council, from the commencement of\r\nthe war between France and England; taken up by some of them from that\r\nmoment, by others, more latterly. I still, however, hope it will be\r\navoided. I do not believe Mr. Adams wishes war with France; nor do I\r\nbelieve he will truckle to England as servilely as has been done. If\r\nhe assumes this front at once, and shows that he means to attend to\r\nself-respect and national dignity with both the nations, perhaps the\r\ndepredations of both on our commerce may be amicably arrested. I think\r\nwe should begin first with those who first began with us, and, by an\r\nexample on them, acquire a right to re-demand the respect from which the\r\nother party has departed.\r\n\r\nI suppose you are informed of the proceeding commenced by the\r\nlegislature of Maryland, to claim the south branch of the Potomac as\r\ntheir boundary, and thus of Albemarle, now the central county of the\r\nState, to make a frontier. As it is impossible, upon any consistent\r\nprinciples, and after such a length of undisturbed possession, that they\r\ncan expect to establish their claim, it can be ascribed to no other than\r\nan intention to irritate and divide; and there can be no doubt from what\r\nbow the shaft is shot. However, let us cultivate Pennsylvania, and we\r\nneed not fear the universe. The Assembly have named me among those\r\nwho are to manage this controversy. But I am so averse to motion and\r\ncontest, and the other members are so fully equal to the business, that\r\nI cannot undertake to act in it. I wish you were added to them. Indeed,\r\nI wish and hope you may consent to be added to our Assembly itself.\r\nThere is no post where you can render greater services, without going\r\nout of your State. Let but this block stand firm on its basis, and\r\nPennsylvania do the same, our Union will be perpetual, and our General\r\nGovernment kept within the bounds and form of the constitution. Adieu\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCVIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 30, 1797\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON,\r\n\r\nMonticello, January 30, 1797.\r\n\r\nYours of the 18th came to hand yesterday. I am very thankful for the\r\ndiscretion you have exercised over the letter. That has happened to be\r\nthe case, which I knew to be possible, that the honest expression of\r\nmy feelings towards Mr. Adams might be rendered mal-apropos from\r\ncircumstances existing, and known at the seat of government, but not\r\nknown by me in my retired situation. Mr. Adams and myself were cordial\r\nfriends from the beginning of the revolution. Since our return from\r\nEurope, some little incidents have happened, which were capable of\r\naffecting a jealous mind like his. His deviation from that line of\r\npolitics on which we had been united, has not made me less sensible\r\nof the rectitude of his heart: and I wished him to know this, and also\r\nanother truth, that I am sincerely pleased at having escaped the late\r\ndraught for the helm, and have not a wish which he stands in the way of.\r\nThat he should be convinced of these truths, is important to our mutual\r\nsatisfaction, and perhaps to the harmony and good of the public service.\r\nBut there was a difficulty in conveying them to him, and a possibility\r\nthat the attempt might do mischief there or somewhere else; and I would\r\nnot have hazarded the attempt, if you had not been in place to decide\r\nupon its expediency. It has now become unnecessary to repeat it by a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nI have turned to the constitution and laws, and find nothing to warrant\r\nthe opinion that I might not have been qualified here, or wherever else\r\nI could meet with a Senator; any member of that body being authorized\r\nto administer the oath, without being confined to time or place, and\r\nconsequently to make a record of it, and to deposit it with the records\r\nof the Senate. However, I shall come on, on the principle which had\r\nfirst determined me, respect to the public. I hope I shall be made a\r\npart of no ceremony whatever. I shall escape into the city as covertly\r\nas possible. If Governor Mifflin should show any symptoms of ceremony,\r\npray contrive to parry them. We have now fine mild weather here. The\r\nthermometer is above the point which renders fires necessary. Adieu\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCIX.--TO JAMES SULLIVAN, February 9, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, February 9, 1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have many acknowledgments to make for the friendly anxiety you\r\nare pleased to express in your letter of January the 12th, for my\r\nundertaking the office to which I have been elected. The idea that I\r\nwould accept the office of President, but not that of Vice-President\r\nof the United States, had not its origin with me. I never thought of\r\nquestioning the free exercise of the right of my fellow-citizens, to\r\nmarshal those whom they call into their service according to their\r\nfitness, nor ever presumed that they were not the best judges of that.\r\nHad I indulged a wish in what manner they should dispose of me, it would\r\nprecisely have coincided with what they have done. Neither the splendor,\r\nnor the power, nor the difficulties, nor the fame, or defamation, as may\r\nhappen, attached to the first magistracy, have any attractions for me.\r\nThe helm of a free government is always arduous, and never was ours more\r\nso, than at a moment when two friendly people are like to be committed\r\nin war by the ill temper of their administrations. I am so much attached\r\nto my domestic situation, that I would not have wished to leave it at\r\nall. However, if I am to be called from it, the shortest absences and\r\nmost tranquil station suit me best. I value highly, indeed, the part\r\nmy fellow-citizens gave me in their late vote, as an evidence of their\r\nesteem, and I am happy in the information you are so kind as to give,\r\nthat many in the eastern quarter entertain the same sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhere a constitution, like ours, wears a mixed aspect of monarchy and\r\nrepublicanism, its citizens will naturally divide into two classes\r\nof sentiment, according as their tone of body or mind, their habits,\r\nconnections, and callings, induce them to wish to strengthen either the\r\nmonarchical or the republican features of the constitution. Some\r\nwill consider it as an elective monarchy, which had better be made\r\nhereditary, and therefore endeavor to lead towards that all the\r\nforms and principles of its administration. Others will view it as an\r\nenergetic republic, turning in all its points on the pivot of free\r\nand frequent elections. The great body of our native citizens are\r\nunquestionably of the republican sentiment. Foreign education, and\r\nforeign connections of interest, have produced some exceptions in every\r\npart of the Union, north and south; and perhaps other circumstances in\r\nyour quarter, better known to you, may have thrown into the scale of\r\nexceptions a greater number of the rich. Still there, I believe, and\r\nhere, I am sure, the great mass is republican. Nor do any of the forms\r\nin which the public disposition has been pronounced in the last half\r\ndozen years, evince the contrary. All of them, when traced to their true\r\nsource, have only been evidences of the preponderant popularity of\r\na particular great character. That influence once withdrawn, and our\r\ncountrymen left to the operation of their own unbiassed good sense, I\r\nhave no doubt we shall see a pretty rapid return of general harmony, and\r\nour citizens moving in phalanx in the paths of regular liberty, order,\r\nand a sacrosanct adherence to the constitution. Thus I think it will\r\nbe, if war with France can be avoided. But if that untoward event comes\r\nathwart us in our present point of deviation, no body, I believe, can\r\nforesee into what port it will drive us.\r\n\r\nI am always glad of an opportunity of inquiring after my most ancient\r\nand respected friend Mr. Samuel Adams. His principles, founded on the\r\nimmovable basis of equal right and reason, have continued pure and\r\nunchanged. Permit me to place here my sincere veneration for him, and\r\nwishes for his health and happiness; and to assure yourself of the\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect, with which I am, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCX.--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY, May 13, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 13, 1797.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 4th instant came to hand yesterday. That of the 4th of\r\nApril, with the one for Monroe, has never been received. The first, of\r\nMarch the 27th, did not reach me till April the 21st, when I was within\r\na few days of setting out for this place, and I put off acknowledging\r\nit till I should come here. I entirely commend your dispositions towards\r\nMr. Adams; knowing his worth as intimately and esteeming it as much as\r\nany one, and acknowledging the preference of his claims, if any I could\r\nhave had, to the high office conferred on him. But in truth, I had\r\nneither claims nor wishes on the subject, though I know it will be\r\ndifficult to obtain belief of this. When I retired from this place and\r\nthe office of Secretary of State, it was in the firmest contemplation\r\nof never more returning here. There had indeed been suggestions in\r\nthe public papers, that I was looking towards a succession to the\r\nPresident’s chair, but feeling a consciousness of their falsehood, and\r\nobserving that the suggestions came from hostile quarters, I considered\r\nthem as intended merely to excite public odium against me. I never in\r\nmy life exchanged a word with any person on the subject, till I found my\r\nname brought forward generally, in competition with that of Mr. Adams.\r\nThose with whom I then communicated, could say, if it were necessary,\r\nwhether I met the call with desire, or even with a ready acquiescence,\r\nand whether from the moment of my first acquiescence, I did not devoutly\r\npray that the very thing might happen which has happened. The second\r\noffice of this government is honorable and easy, the first is but a\r\nsplendid misery.\r\n\r\nYou express apprehensions that stratagems will be used, to produce a\r\nmisunderstanding between the President and myself. Though not a word\r\nhaving this tendency has ever been hazarded to me by any one, yet I\r\nconsider as a certainty that nothing will be left untried to alienate\r\nhim from me. These machinations will proceed from the Hamiltonians by\r\nwhom he is surrounded, and who are only a little less hostile to him\r\nthan to me. It cannot but damp the pleasure of cordiality, when we\r\nsuspect that it is suspected. I cannot help thinking, that it is\r\nimpossible for Mr. Adams to believe that the state of my mind is what it\r\nreally is; that he may think I view him as an obstacle in my way. I have\r\nno supernatural power to impress truth on the mind of another, nor he\r\nany to discover that the estimate which he may form, on a just view\r\nof the human mind as generally constituted, may not be just in its\r\napplication to a special constitution. This may be a source of private\r\nuneasiness to us; I honestly confess that it is so to me at this time.\r\nBut neither of us is capable of letting it have effect on our public\r\nduties. Those who may endeavor to separate us, are probably excited by\r\nthe fear that I might have influence on the executive councils: but when\r\nthey shall know that I consider my office as constitutionally confined\r\nto legislative functions, and that I could not take any part whatever in\r\nexecutive consultations, even were it proposed, their fears may perhaps\r\nsubside, and their object be found not worth a machination.\r\n\r\nI do sincerely wish with you, that we could take our stand on a ground\r\nperfectly neutral and independent towards all nations. It has been my\r\nconstant object through my public life: and with respect to the English\r\nand French, particularly, I have too often expressed to the former\r\nmy wishes, and made to them propositions verbally and in writing,\r\nofficially and privately, to official and private characters, for them\r\nto doubt of my views, if they would be content with equality. Of this\r\nthey are in possession of several written and formal proofs, in my own\r\nhand-writing. But they have wished a monopoly of commerce and influence\r\nwith us; and they have in fact obtained it. When we take notice that\r\ntheirs is the workshop to which we go for all we want; that with them\r\ncentre either immediately or ultimately all the labors of our hands and\r\nlands; that to them belongs either openly or secretly the great mass of\r\nour navigation; that even the factorage of their affairs here, is kept\r\nto themselves by factitious citizenships; that these foreign and false\r\ncitizens now constitute the great body of what are called our merchants,\r\nfill our sea-ports, are planted in every little town and district of\r\nthe interior country, sway every thing in the former places by their\r\nown votes, and those of their dependents, in the latter, by their\r\ninsinuations and the influence of their ledgers; that they are advancing\r\nfast to a monopoly of our banks and public funds, and thereby placing\r\nour public finances under their control; that they have in their\r\nalliance the most influential characters in and out of office; when they\r\nhave shown that by all these bearings on the different branches of the\r\ngovernment, they can force it to proceed in whatever direction they\r\ndictate, and bend the interests of this country entirely to the will of\r\nanother; when all this, I say, is attended to, it is impossible for us\r\nto say we stand on independent ground, impossible for a free mind not\r\nto see and to groan under the bondage in which it is bound. If anything\r\nafter this could excite surprise, it would be that they have been able\r\nso far to throw dust in the eyes of our own citizens, as to fix on those\r\nwho wish merely to recover self-government the charge of subserving one\r\nforeign influence because they resist submission to another. But they\r\npossess our printing presses, a powerful engine in their government of\r\nus. At this very moment, they would have drawn us into a war on the side\r\nof England, had it not been for the failure of her bank. Such was their\r\nopen and loud cry, and that of their gazettes, till this event. After\r\nplunging us in all the broils of the European nations, there would\r\nremain but one act to close our tragedy, that is, to break up our union;\r\nand even this they have ventured seriously and solemnly to propose\r\nand maintain by arguments in a Connecticut paper. I have been happy,\r\nhowever, in believing, from the stifling of this effort, that that dose\r\nwas found too strong, and excited as much repugnance there as it did\r\nhorror in other parts of our country, and that whatever follies we may\r\nbe led into as to foreign nations, we shall never give up our Union,\r\nthe last anchor of our hope, and that alone which is to prevent this\r\nheavenly country from becoming an arena of gladiators. Much as I abhor\r\nwar, and view it as the greatest scourge of mankind, and anxiously as\r\nI wish to keep out of the broils of Europe, I would yet go with my\r\nbrethren into these, rather than separate from them. But I hope we may\r\nstill keep clear of them, notwithstanding our present thraldom, and\r\nthat time may be given us to reflect on the awful crisis we have passed\r\nthrough, and to find some means of shielding ourselves in future from\r\nforeign influence, political, commercial, or in whatever other form it\r\nmay be attempted. I can scarcely withhold myself from joining in the\r\nwish of Silas Deane, that there were an ocean of fire between us and the\r\nold world.\r\n\r\nA perfect confidence that you are as much attached to peace and union\r\nas myself, that you equally prize independence of all nations and the\r\nblessings of self-government, has induced me freely to unbosom myself\r\nto you, and let you see the light in which I have viewed what has been\r\npassing among us from the beginning of the war. And I shall be happy,\r\nat all times, in an intercommunication of sentiments with you, believing\r\nthat the dispositions of the different parts of our country have been\r\nconsiderably misrepresented and misunderstood in each part, as to\r\nthe other, and that nothing but good can result from an exchange of\r\ninformation and opinions between those whose circumstances and morals\r\nadmit no doubt of the integrity of their views.\r\n\r\nI remain, with constant and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXI.--TO GENERAL GATES, May 30,1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 30,1797.\r\n\r\nDear General,\r\n\r\nI thank you for the pamphlet of Erskine enclosed in your favor of the\r\n9th instant, and still more for the evidence which your letter affords\r\nme of the health of your mind, and I hope of your body also. Erskine has\r\nbeen reprinted here, and has done good. It has refreshed the memory\r\nof those who had been willing to forget how the war between France\r\nand England had been produced; and who, aping St. James’s, called it a\r\ndefensive war on the part of England. I wish any events could induce\r\nus to cease to copy such a model, and to assume the dignity of being\r\noriginal. They had their paper system, stockjobbing, speculations,\r\npublic debt, monied interest, &c, and all this was contrived for us.\r\nThey raised their cry against jacobinism and revolutionists, we against\r\ndemocratic societies and anti-federalists; their alarmists sounded\r\ninsurrection, ours marched an army to look for one, but they could\r\nnot find it. I wish the parallel may stop here, and that we may avoid,\r\ninstead of imitating, a general bankruptcy and disastrous war.\r\n\r\nCongress, or rather the Representatives, have been a fortnight debating\r\nbetween a more or less irritating answer to the President’s speech.\r\nThe latter was lost yesterday, by forty-eight against fifty-one or\r\nfifty-two. It is believed, however, that when they come to propose\r\nmeasures leading directly to war, they will lose some of their numbers.\r\nThose who have no wish but for the peace of their country, and its\r\nindependence of all foreign influence, have a hard struggle indeed,\r\noverwhelmed by a cry as loud and imposing as if it were true, of being\r\nunder French influence, and thus raised by a faction composed of\r\nEnglish subjects residing among us, or such as are English in all their\r\nrelations and sentiments. However, patience will bring all to rights,\r\nand we shall both live to see the mask taken from their faces, and\r\nour citizens sensible on which side true liberty and independence are\r\nsought. Should any circumstance draw me further from home, I shall with\r\ngreat cordiality pay my respects to you at Rose-Hill, and am not without\r\nhope of meeting you here some time.\r\n\r\nHere, there, and every where else, I am, with great and sincere\r\nattachment and respect, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXII.--TO JAMES MADISON, June 1, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 1, 1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir, I wrote you on the 18th of May. The address of the Senate was\r\nsoon after that. The first draught was responsive to the speech, and\r\nhigher toned. Mr. Henry arrived the day it was reported; the addressers\r\nhad not yet their strength around them. They listened therefore to\r\nhis objections, recommitted the papers, added him and Tazewell to the\r\ncommittee, and it was reported with considerable alterations; but\r\none great attack was made on it, which was to strike out the clause\r\napproving every thing heretofore done by the executive. This clause\r\nwas retained by a majority of four. They received a new accession\r\nof members, held a caucus, took up all the points recommended in the\r\nspeech, except the raising money, agreed the list of every committee,\r\nand on Monday passed the resolutions and appointed the committees, by an\r\nuniform vote of seventeen to eleven. (Mr. Henry was accidentally absent;\r\nRoss not then come.) Yesterday they took up the nomination of John\r\nQuincy Adams to Berlin, which had been objected to as extending our\r\ndiplomatic establishment. It was approved by eighteen to fourteen. (Mr.\r\nTatnall accidentally absent.) From the proceedings we are able to see,\r\nthat eighteen on the one side and ten on the other, with two wavering\r\nvotes, will decide every question. Schuyler is too ill to come this\r\nsession, and Gunn has not yet come. Pinckney (the General), John\r\nMarshall, and Dana are nominated Envoys Extraordinary to France. Charles\r\nLee consulted a member from Virginia, to know whether Marshall would be\r\nagreeable. He named you, as more likely to give satisfaction. The answer\r\nwas,’ Nobody of Mr. Madison’s way of thinking will be appointed.’\r\n\r\nThe representatives have not yet got through their addresses. An\r\namendment of Mr. Nicholas’s, which you will have seen in the papers, was\r\nlost by a division of forty-six to fifty-two. A clause by Mr. Dayton,\r\nexpressing a wish that France might be put on an equal footing with\r\nother nations, was inserted by fifty-two against forty-seven. This vote\r\nis most worthy of notice, because the moderation and justice of the\r\nproposition being unquestionable, it shows that there are forty-seven\r\ndecided to go to all lengths to\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThey have received a new orator from the district of Mr. Ames. He is the\r\nson of the Secretary of the Senate. They have an accession from South\r\nCarolina also, that State being exactly divided. In the House of\r\nRepresentatives I learned the following facts, which give me real\r\nconcern. When the British treaty arrived at Charleston, a meeting, as\r\nyou know, was called, and a committee of seventeen appointed, of whom\r\nGeneral Pinckney was one. He did not attend. They waited for him, sent\r\nfor him: he treated the mission with great hauteur, and disapproved of\r\ntheir meddling. In the course of subsequent altercations, he declared\r\nthat his brother T. Pinckney, approved of every article of the treaty,\r\nunder the existing circumstances, and since that time the politics of\r\n\r\n     [* A few lines ave here unintelligible.]\r\n\r\nCharleston have been assuming a different hue. Young Rutledge joining\r\nSmith and Harper, is an ominous fact as to that whole interest.\r\n\r\nTobacco is at nine dollars, and flour very dull of sale. A great\r\nstagnation in commerce generally. During the present bankruptcy in\r\nEngland, the merchants seem disposed to lie on their oars. It is\r\nimpossible to conjecture the rising of Congress, as it will depend on\r\nthe system they decide on; whether of preparation for war, or inaction.\r\nIn the vote of forty-six to fifty-two, Morgan, Machir, and Evans were of\r\nthe majority, and Clay kept his seat, refusing to vote with either.\r\nIn that of forty-seven to fifty-two, Evans was the only one of our\r\ndelegation who voted against putting France on an equal footing with\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nP. M. So far I had written in the morning. I now take up my pen to add,\r\nthat the addresses having been reported to the House, it was moved to\r\ndisagree to so much of the amendment as went to the putting France on an\r\nequal footing with other nations, and Morgan and Machir turning tail (in\r\nconsequence, as is said, of having been closeted last night by Charles\r\nLee), the vote was forty-nine to fifty. So the principle was saved by a\r\nsingle vote. They then proposed that compensations for spoliations shall\r\nbe a _sine qua non_, and this will be decided on to-morrow,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXIII.--TO COLONEL BURR, June 17,1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 17,1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe newspapers give, so minutely what is passing in Congress, that\r\nnothing of detail can be wanting for your information. Perhaps, however,\r\nsome general view of our situation and prospects, since you left us,\r\nmay not be unacceptable. At any rate, it will give me an opportunity of\r\nrecalling myself to your memory, and of evidencing my esteem for you.\r\nYou well know how strong a character of division had been impressed\r\non the Senate by the British treaty. Common error, common censure, and\r\ncommon efforts of defence had formed the treaty majority into a common\r\nband, which feared to separate even on other subjects. Towards the close\r\nof the last Congress, however, it had been hoped that their ties began\r\nto loosen, and their phalanx to separate a little.\r\n\r\nThis hope was blasted at the very opening of the present session, by\r\nthe nature of the appeal which the President made to the nation; the\r\noccasion for which had confessedly sprung from the fatal British treaty.\r\nThis circumstance rallied them again to their standard, and hitherto we\r\nhave had pretty regular treaty votes on all questions of principle. And\r\nindeed I fear, that as long as the same individuals remain, so long we\r\nshall see traces of the same division. In the House of Representatives\r\nthe republican body has also lost strength. The non-attendance of five\r\nor six of that description has left the majority very equivocal indeed.\r\nA few individuals of no fixed system at all, governed by the panic\r\nor the prowess of the moment, flap as the breeze blows against the\r\nrepublican or the aristocratic bodies, and give to the one or the other\r\na preponderance entirely accidental. Hence the dissimilar aspect of the\r\naddress, and of the proceedings subsequent to that. The inflammatory\r\ncomposition of the speech excited sensations of resentment which had\r\nslept under British injuries, threw the wavering into the war scale, and\r\nproduced the war address. Bonaparte’s victories and those on the Rhine,\r\nthe Austrian peace, British bankruptcy, mutiny of the seamen, and Mr.\r\nKing’s exhortations to pacific measures, have cooled them down again,\r\nand the scale of peace preponderates. The threatening propositions\r\ntherefore, founded in the address, are abandoned one by one, and the cry\r\nbegins now to be, that we have been called together to do nothing. The\r\ntruth is, there is nothing to do, the idea of war being scouted by the\r\nevents of Europe: but this only proves that war was the object for which\r\nwe were called. It proves that the executive temper was for war; and\r\nthat the convocation of the Representatives was an experiment of the\r\ntemper of the nation, to see if it was in unison. Efforts at negotiation\r\nindeed were promised; but such a promise was as difficult to withhold,\r\nas easy to render nugatory. If negotiation alone had been meant, that\r\nmight have been pursued without so much delay, and without calling the\r\nRepresentatives; and if strong and earnest negotiation had been meant,\r\nthe additional nomination would have been of persons strongly and\r\nearnestly attached to the alliance of 1778. War then was intended.\r\nWhether abandoned or not, we must judge from future indications and\r\nevents: for the same secrecy and mystery are affected to be observed by\r\nthe present, which marked the former administration. I had always hoped,\r\nthat the popularity of the late President being once withdrawn from\r\nactive effect, the natural feelings of the people towards liberty\r\nwould restore the equilibrium between the executive and legislative\r\ndepartments, which had been destroyed by the superior weight and effect\r\nof that popularity; and that their natural feelings of moral obligation\r\nwould discountenance the ungrateful predilection of the executive in\r\nfavor of Great Britain. But unfortunately, the preceding measures had\r\nalready alienated the nation who were the object of them, had excited\r\nreaction from them, and this reaction has on the minds of our citizens\r\nan effect which supplies that of the Washington popularity. This effect\r\nwas sensible on some of the late congressional elections, and this it is\r\nwhich has lessened the republican majority in Congress. When it will be\r\nreinforced, must depend on events, and these are so incalculable, that I\r\nconsider the future character of our republic as in the air; indeed its\r\nfuture fortune will be in the air, if war is made on us by France, and\r\nif Louisiana becomes a Gallo-American colony.\r\n\r\nI have been much pleased to see a dawn of change in the spirit of\r\nyour State. The late elections have indicated something, which, at a\r\ndistance, we do not understand. However, what with the English influence\r\nin the lower, and the Patroon influence in the upper parts of your\r\nState, I presume little is to be hoped. If a prospect could be once\r\nopened upon us of the penetration of truth into the Eastern States: if\r\nthe people there, who are unquestionably republicans, could discover\r\nthat they have been duped into the support of measures calculated to\r\nsap the very foundations of republicanism, we might still hope for\r\nsalvation, and that it would come, as of old, from the East. But will\r\nthat region ever awake to the true state of things? Can the middle,\r\nsouthern, and western States hold on till they awake? These are painful\r\nand doubtful questions: and if, in assuring me of your health, you can\r\ngive me a comfortable solution of them, it will relieve a mind devoted\r\nto the preservation of our republican government in the true form\r\nand spirit in which it was established, but almost oppressed with\r\napprehensions that fraud will at length effect what force could not, and\r\nthat what with currents and counter-currents, we shall in the end, be\r\ndriven back to the land from which we launched twenty years ago. Indeed,\r\nmy dear Sir, we have been but a sturdy fish on the hook of a dexterous\r\nangler who letting us flounce till we have spent Our force, brings us up\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nI am tired of the scene, and this day se’nnight shall change it for\r\none, where, to tranquillity of mind, may be added pursuits of private\r\nutility, since none public are admitted by the state of things. I am\r\nwith great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. Since writing the above, we have received a report that the French\r\nDirectory has proposed a declaration of war against the United States to\r\nthe Council of Ancients, who have rejected it. Thus we see two nations\r\nwho love one another affectionately, brought by the ill temper of their\r\nexecutive administrations, to the very brink of a necessity to imbrue\r\ntheir hands in the blood of each other. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXIV.--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY, June 21, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 21, 1797.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nIt was with infinite joy to me, that you were yesterday announced to the\r\nSenate, as Envoy Extraordinary, jointly with General Pinckney and Mr.\r\nMarshall, to the French republic. It gave me certain assurances that\r\nthere would be a preponderance in the mission, sincerely disposed to be\r\nat peace with the French government and nation. Peace is undoubtedly\r\nat present the first object of our nation. Interest and honor are also\r\nnational considerations. But interest, duly weighed, is in favor of\r\npeace even at the expense of spoliations past and future; and honor\r\ncannot now be an object. The insults and injuries committed on, us by\r\nboth the belligerent parties, from, the beginning of 1793 to this day,\r\nand still continuing, cannot now be wiped off by engaging in war\r\nwith one of them. As there is great reason to expect this is the last\r\ncampaign in Europe, it would certainly be better for us to rub through\r\nthis year, as we have done through the four preceding ones, and hope\r\nthat, on the restoration of peace, we may be able to establish some plan\r\nfor our foreign connections more likely to secure our peace, interest,\r\nand honor, in future. Our countrymen have divided themselves by such\r\nstrong affections, to the French and the English, that nothing will\r\nsecure us internally but a divorce from both nations; and this must be\r\nthe object of every real American, and its attainment is practicable\r\nwithout much self-denial. But, for this, peace is necessary. Be assured\r\nof this, my dear Sir, that if we engage in a war during our present\r\npassions, and our present weakness in some quarters, our Union runs the\r\ngreatest risk of not coming out of that war in the shape in which it\r\nenters it. My reliance for our preservation is in your acceptance\r\nof this mission. I know the tender circumstances which will oppose\r\nthemselves to it. But its duration will be short, and its reward long.\r\nYou have it in your power, by accepting and determining the character\r\nof the mission, to secure the present peace and eternal union of your\r\ncountry. If you decline, on motives of private pain, a substitute may be\r\nnamed who has enlisted his passions in the present contest, and by the\r\npreponderance of his vote in the mission may entail on us calamities,\r\nyour share in which, and your feelings, will outweigh whatever pain a\r\ntemporary absence from your family could give you. The sacrifice will\r\nbe short, the remorse would be never-ending. Let me then, my dear\r\nSir, conjure your acceptance, and that you will, by this act, seal the\r\nmission with the confidence of all parties. Your nomination has given a\r\nspring to hope, which was dead before.\r\n\r\nI leave this place in three days, and therefore shall not here have\r\nthe pleasure of learning your determination. But it will reach me in my\r\nretirement, and enrich the tranquillity of that scene. It will add to\r\nthe proofs which have convinced me that the man who loves his country on\r\nits own account, and not merely for its trappings of interest or power,\r\ncan never be divorced from it, can never refuse to come forward when he\r\nfinds that she is engaged in dangers which he has the means of warding\r\noff. Make then an effort, my friend, to renounce your domestic comforts\r\nfor a few months, and reflect that to be a good husband and good father\r\nat this moment, you must be also a good citizen. With sincere wishes for\r\nyour acceptance and success, I am, with unalterable esteem, Dear Sir,\r\nyour affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXV.--TO EDWARD RUTLEDGE, June 24, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 24, 1797.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge your two favors of May the 4th and 19th, and\r\nto thank you for your attentions to the commissions for the pease and\r\noranges, which I learn have arrived in Virginia. Your draft I hope will\r\nsoon follow on Mr. John Barnes, merchant here, who, as I before advised\r\nyou, is directed to answer it.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress first met, the assemblage of facts presented in the\r\nPresident’s speech, with the multiplied accounts of spoliations by\r\nthe French West-Indians, appeared, by sundry votes on the address, to\r\nincline a majority to put themselves in a posture of war. Under this\r\ninfluence the address was formed, and its spirit would probably have\r\nbeen pursued by corresponding measures, had the events of Europe been of\r\nan ordinary train. But this has been so extraordinary, that numbers have\r\ngone over to those, who, from the first, feeling with sensibility the\r\nFrench insults, as they had felt those of England before, thought now\r\nas they thought then, that war measures should be avoided, and those\r\nof peace pursued. Their favorite engine, on the former occasion,\r\nwas commercial regulations, in preference to negotiations, to war\r\npreparation, and increase of debt. On the latter, as we have no commerce\r\nwith France, the restriction of which could press on them, they wished\r\nfor negotiation. Those of the opposite sentiment had, on the former\r\noccasion, preferred negotiation, but at the same time voted for\r\ngreat war preparations, and increase of debt: now also they were for\r\nnegotiation, war preparations, and debt. The parties have in debate\r\nmutually charged each other with inconsistency, and with being governed\r\nby an attachment to this or that of the belligerent nations, rather than\r\nthe dictates of reason and pure Americanism. But in truth, both have\r\nbeen consistent: the same men having voted for war measures who did\r\nbefore, and the same against them now who did before. The events of\r\nEurope coming to us in astonishing and rapid succession, to wit, the\r\npublic bankruptcy of England, Bonaparte’s successes, the successes\r\non the Rhine, the Austrian peace, mutiny of the British fleet, Irish\r\ninsurrection, a demand of forty-three millions for the current services\r\nof the year, and above all, the warning voice, as is said, of Mr. King,\r\nto abandon all thought of connection with Great Britian, that she is\r\ngoing down irrecoverably, and will sink us also, if we do not clear\r\nourselves, have brought over several to the pacific party, so as, at\r\npresent, to give majorities against all threatening measures. They go on\r\nwith frigates and fortifications, because they were going on with them\r\nbefore. They direct eighty thousand of their militia to hold themselves\r\nin readiness for service. But they reject the propositions to raise\r\ncavalry, artillery, and a provisional army, and to trust private ships\r\nwith arms in the present combustible state of things. They believe the\r\npresent is the last campaign of Europe, and wish to rub through this\r\nfragment of a year as they have through the four preceding ones,\r\nopposing patience to insult, and interest to honor. They will,\r\ntherefore, immediately adjourn. This is indeed a most humiliating state\r\nof things, but it commenced in 1793. Causes have been adding to causes,\r\nand effects accumulating on effects, from that time to this. We had, in\r\n1793, the most respectable character in the universe. What the neutral\r\nnations think of us now, I know not; but we are low indeed with the\r\nbelligerents. Their kicks and cuffs prove their contempt. If we weather\r\nthe present storm, I hope we shall avail ourselves of the calm of peace,\r\nto place our foreign connections under a new and different arrangement.\r\nWe must make the interest of every nation stand surety for their\r\njustice, and their own loss to follow injury to us, as effect follows\r\nits cause. As to every thing except commerce, we ought to divorce\r\nourselves from them all. But this system would require time, temper,\r\nwisdom, and occasional sacrifice of interest: and how far all of these\r\nwill be ours, our children may see, but we shall not. The passions are\r\ntoo high at present, to be cooled in our day. You and I have formerly\r\nseen warm debates and high political passions. But gentlemen of\r\ndifferent politics would then speak to each other, and separate the\r\nbusiness of the Senate from that of society. It is not so now. Men who\r\nhave been intimate all their lives, cross the streets to avoid meeting,\r\nand turn their heads another way, lest they should be obliged to touch\r\ntheir hats. This may do for young men with whom passion is enjoyment.\r\nBut it is afflicting to peaceable minds. Tranquillity is the old man’s\r\nmilk. I go to enjoy it in a few days, and to exchange the roar and\r\ntumult of bulls and bears, for the prattle of my grand-children and\r\nsenile rest. Be these yours, my dear friend, through long years, with\r\nevery other blessing, and the attachment of friends as warm and sincere,\r\nas yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER, CCXVI.--TO JAMES MADISON, August 3, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 3, 1797.\r\n\r\nI scribbled you a line on the 24th ultimo: it missed of the post, and\r\nso went by a private hand. I perceive from yours by Mr. Bringhurst, that\r\nyou had not received it. In fact, it was only an earnest exhortation to\r\ncome here with Monroe, which I still hope you will do. In the mean time,\r\nI enclose you a letter from him, and wish your opinion on its principal\r\nsubject. The variety of other topics the day I was with you, kept out\r\nof sight the letter to Mazzei imputed to me in the papers, the general\r\nsubstance of which is mine, though the diction has been considerably\r\naltered and varied in the course of its translations from English into\r\nItalian, from Italian into French, and from French into English. I first\r\nmet with it at Bladensburg, and for a moment conceived I must take the\r\nfield of the public papers. I could not disavow it wholly, because the\r\ngreatest part was mine in substance, though not in form. I could not\r\navow it as it stood, because the form was not mine, and, in one place,\r\nthe substance very materially falsified. This, then, would render\r\nexplanations necessary; nay, it would render proofs of the whole\r\nnecessary, and draw me at length into a publication of all (even the\r\nsecret) transactions of the administration, while I was of it: and\r\nembroil me personally with every member of the executive, with the\r\njudiciary, and with others still. I soon decided in my own mind, to be\r\nentirely silent. I consulted with several friends at Philadelphia, who,\r\nevery one of them, were clearly against my avowing or disavowing, and\r\nsome of them conjured me most earnestly to let nothing provoke me to it.\r\nI corrected in conversation with them, a substantial misrepresentation\r\nin the copy published. The original has a sentiment like this (for\r\nI have it not before me), ‘They are endeavoring to submit us to the\r\nsubstance, as they already have to the forms of the British government;’\r\nmeaning by forms, the birth-days, levees, processions to parliament,\r\ninauguration pomposities, fee. But the copy published says, ‘as they\r\nhave already submitted us to the form of the British,’ &c.; making me\r\nexpress hostility to the form of our government, that is to say, to the\r\nconstitution itself. For this is really the difference of the word form,\r\nused in the singular or plural, in that phrase, in the English language.\r\nNow it would be impossible for me to explain this publicly, without\r\nbringing on a personal difference between General Washington and myself,\r\nwhich nothing before the publication of this letter has ever done. It\r\nwould embroil me also with all those with whom his character is still\r\npopular, that is to say, nine tenths of the people of the United States;\r\nand what good would be obtained by avowing the letter with the necessary\r\nexplanations? Very little indeed, in my opinion, to counterbalance\r\na good deal of harm. From my silence in this instance, it cannot be\r\ninferred that I am afraid to own the general sentiments of the letter.\r\nIf I am subject to either imputation, it is to that of avowing such\r\nsentiments too frankly both in private and public, often when there\r\nis no necessity for it, merely because I disdain every thing like\r\nduplicity. Still, however, I am open to conviction. Think for me on the\r\noccasion, and advise me what to do, and confer with Colonel Monroe on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nLet me entreat you again to come with him; there are other important\r\nthings to consult on. One will be his affair. Another is the subject of\r\nthe petition now enclosed to you, to be proposed to our district, on the\r\nlate presentment of our representative by the grand jury: the idea it\r\nbrings forward is still confined to my own breast. It has never been\r\nmentioned to any mortal, because I first wish your opinion on the\r\nexpediency of the measure. If you approve it, I shall propose to ------\r\nor some other, to father it, and to present it to the counties at their\r\ngeneral muster. This will be in time for our Assembly. The presentment\r\ngoing in the public papers just at the moment when Congress was\r\ntogether, produced a great effect both on its friends and foes in that\r\nbody, very much to the disheartening and mortification of the latter.\r\nI wish this petition, if approved, to arrive there under the same\r\ncircumstances, to produce the counter effect so wanting for their\r\ngratification. I could have wished to receive it from you again at our\r\ncourt on Monday, because ------ and ------ will be there, and might also\r\nbe consulted, and commence measures for putting it into motion. If you\r\ncan return it then, with your opinion, it will be of importance. Present\r\nme affectionately to Mrs. Madison, and convey to her my entreaties to\r\ninterpose her good offices and persuasives with you to bring her\r\nhere, and before we uncover our house, which will yet be some weeks.\r\nSalutations and adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXVII.--TO COLONEL ARTHUR CAMPBELL, September 1, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL ARTHUR CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 1, 1797.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of July the 4th, and to\r\nrecognise in it the sentiments you have ever held, and worthy of the day\r\non which it is dated. It is true that a party has risen up among us, or\r\nrather has come among us, which is endeavoring to separate us from all\r\nfriendly connection with France, to unite our destinies with those of\r\nGreat Britian, and to assimilate our government to theirs. Our lenity\r\nin permitting the return of the old tories, gave the first body to\r\nthis party; they have been increased by large importations of British\r\nmerchants and factors, by American merchants dealing on British capital,\r\nand by stock-dealers and banking-companies, who, by the aid of a paper\r\nsystem are enriching themselves to the ruin of our country, and swaying\r\nthe government by their possession of the printing-presses, which\r\ntheir wealth commands, and by other means, not always honorable to the\r\ncharacter of our countrymen. Hitherto, their influence and their system\r\nhave been irresistible, and they have raised up an executive power which\r\nis too strong for the legislature. But I flatter myself they have passed\r\ntheir zenith. The people, while these things were doing, were lulled\r\ninto rest and security from a cause which no longer exists. No\r\nprepossessions now will shut their ears to truth. They begin to see to\r\nwhat port their leaders were steering during their slumbers, and there\r\nis yet time to haul in, if we can avoid a war with France. All can be\r\ndone peaceably, by the people confining their choice of Representatives\r\nand Senators to persons attached to republican government and the\r\nprinciples of 1776, not office-hunters, but farmers, whose interests\r\nare entirely agricultural. Such men are the true representatives of the\r\ngreat American interest, and are alone to be relied on for expressing\r\nthe proper American sentiments. We owe gratitude to France, justice to\r\nEngland, good-will to all, and subservience to none. All this must be\r\nbrought about by the people, using their elective rights with prudence\r\nand self-possession, and not suffering themselves to be duped by\r\ntreacherous emissaries. It was by the sober sense of our citizens that\r\nwe were safely and steadily conducted from monarchy to republicanism,\r\nand it is by the same agency alone we can be kept from falling back. I\r\nam happy in this occasion of reviving the memory of old things, and of\r\nassuring you of the continuance of the esteem and respect of, Dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXVIII.--TO JAMES MONROE, September 7, 1797\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 7, 1797.\r\n\r\nThe doubt which you suggest as to our jurisdiction over the case of the\r\nGrand Jury vs. Cabell had occurred to me, and naturally occurs on first\r\nview of the question. But I knew, that to send the petition to the House\r\nof Representatives in Congress, would make bad worse; that a majority\r\nof that House would pass a vote of approbation. On examination of the\r\nquestion, too, it appeared to me that we could maintain the authority of\r\nour own government over it.\r\n\r\nA right of free correspondence between citizen and citizen, on their\r\njoint interests, whether public or private, and under whatsoever laws\r\nthese interests arise (to wit, of the State, of Congress, of France,\r\nSpain, or Turkey), is a natural right: it is not the gift of any\r\nmunicipal law, either of England, of Virginia, or of Congress: but in\r\ncommon with all our other natural rights, it is one of the objects\r\nfor the protection of which society is formed, and municipal laws\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe courts of this commonwealth (and among them the General Court, as a\r\ncourt of impeachment) are originally competent to the cognizance of all\r\ninfractions of the rights of one citizen by another citizen: and they\r\nstill retain all their judiciary cognizances not expressly alienated by\r\nthe federal constitution.\r\n\r\nThe federal constitution alienates from them all cases arising, 1st,\r\nunder the constitution; 2ndly, under the laws of Congress; 3rdly, under\r\ntreaties, &c. But this right of free correspondence, whether with a\r\npublic representative in General Assembly, in Congress, in France, in\r\nSpain, or with a private one charged with pecuniary trust, or with a\r\nprivate friend, the object of our esteem, or any other, has not been\r\ngiven to us under, 1st, the federal constitution; 2ndly, any law of\r\nCongress; or 3rdly, any treaty; but, as before observed, by nature.\r\nIt is therefore not alienated, but remains under the protection of our\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nWere the question even doubtful, that is no reason for abandoning it.\r\nThe system of the General Government is to seize all doubtful ground. We\r\nmust join in the scramble, or get nothing. Where first occupancy is to\r\ngive right, he who lies still loses all. Besides, it is not right for\r\nthose who are only to act in a preliminary form, to let their own doubts\r\npreclude the judgment of the court of ultimate decision. We ought to\r\nlet it go to the House of Delegates for their consideration, and they,\r\nunless the contrary be palpable, ought to let it go to the General\r\nCourt, who are ultimately to decide on it.\r\n\r\nIt is of immense consequence that the States retain as complete\r\nauthority as possible over their own citizens. The withdrawing\r\nthemselves under the shelter of a foreign jurisdiction, is so subversive\r\nof order and so pregnant of abuse, that it may not be amiss to consider\r\nhow far a law of _præmunire_ should be revised and modified, against\r\nall citizens who attempt to carry their causes before any other than the\r\nState courts, in cases where those other courts have no right to their\r\ncognizance. A plea to the jurisdiction of the courts of their State,\r\nor a reclamation of a foreign jurisdiction, if adjudged valid, would be\r\nsafe; but if adjudged invalid, would be followed by the punishment of\r\n_præmunire_ for the attempt.\r\n\r\nThink further of the preceding part of this letter, and we will have\r\nfurther conference on it. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. Observe, that it is not the breach of Mr. Cabell’s privilege which\r\nwe mean to punish: that might lie with Congress. It is the wrong done to\r\nthe citizens of our district. Congress have no authority to punish\r\nthat wrong. They can only take cognizance of it in vindication of their\r\nmember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXIX.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 3, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 3, 1798\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 25th came to hand yesterday. I shall observe your\r\ndirection with respect to the post-day. I have spoken with the Deputy\r\nPostmaster-General on the subject of our Fredericksburg post. He never\r\nknew before that the Fredericksburg printer had taken the contract of\r\nthe rider. He will be glad, if either in your neighborhood or ours, some\r\ngood person will undertake to ride from April next. The price given this\r\nyear is three hundred and thirty dollars, and it will go to the lowest\r\nbidder, who can be depended on. I understand (though not from him) that\r\nWyatt will be changed; and in general they determine that printers shall\r\nnot be postmasters or riders.\r\n\r\nOur weather has been, here as with you, cold and dry. The thermometer\r\nhas been at eight degrees. The river closed here the first week of\r\nDecember, which has caught a vast number of vessels destined for\r\ndeparture. It deadens also the demand for wheat. The price at New York\r\nis one dollar seventy-five cents, and of flour eight dollars fifty cents\r\nto nine dollars; tobacco eleven to twelve dollars; there need be no\r\ndoubt of greater prices. The bankruptcies here continue: the prison\r\nis full of the most reputable merchants, and it is understood that the\r\nscene has not yet got to its height. Prices have fallen greatly. The\r\nmarket is cheaper than it has been for four years. Labor and house-rent\r\nmuch reduced. Dry goods somewhat. It is expected that they will fall\r\ntill they get nearly to old prices. Money scarce beyond all example.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives have rejected the President’s proposition for\r\nenabling him to prorogue them. A law has passed putting off the\r\nstamp-act till July next. The land-tax will not be brought on. The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury says he has money enough. No doubt these two\r\nmeasures may be taken up more boldly at the next session, when most\r\nof the elections will be over. It is imagined the stamp-act will be\r\nextended or attempted on every possible object. A bill has passed\r\nthe Representatives to suspend for three years the law arresting the\r\ncurrency of foreign coins. The Senate propose an amendment, continuing\r\nthe currency of the foreign gold only. Very possibly the bill may be\r\nlost. The object of opposing the bill is to make the French crowns\r\na subject of speculation (for it seems they fell on the President’s\r\nproclamation to a dollar in most of the States), and to force bank-paper\r\n(for want of other medium) through all the States generally. Tench Coxe\r\nis displaced, and no reason even spoken of. It is therefore understood\r\nto be for his activity during the late election. It is said that the\r\npeople from hence, quite to the eastern extremity, are beginning to\r\nbe sensible, that their government has been playing a foul game. In\r\nVermont, Chipman was elected Senator by a majority of one, against the\r\nrepublican candidate. In Maryland, Loyd by a majority of one, against\r\nWinder, the republican candidate. Tichenor chosen Governor of Vermont\r\nby a very small majority. The House of Representatives of this State has\r\nbecome republican by a firm majority of six. Two counties, it is said,\r\nhave come over generally to the republican side. It is thought\r\nthe republicans have also a majority in the New York House of\r\nRepresentatives. Hard elections are expected there between Jay\r\nand Livingston, and here between Ross and M’Kean. In the House of\r\nRepresentatives of Congress, the republican interest has at present, on\r\nstrong questions, a majority of about half a dozen, as is conjectured,\r\nand there are as many of their firmest men absent; not one of the\r\nanti-republicans is from his post. The bill for permitting private\r\nvessels to arm, was put off to the first Monday in February by a sudden\r\nvote, and a majority of five. It was considered as an index of their\r\ndispositions on that subject, though some voted both ways on other\r\nground. It is most evident that the anti-republicans wish to get rid of\r\nBlount’s impeachment. Many metaphysical niceties are handing about in\r\nconversation, to show that it cannot be sustained. To show the contrary,\r\nit is evident, must be the task of the republicans, or of nobody.\r\nMonroe’s book is considered as masterly by all those who are not opposed\r\nin principle, and it is deemed unanswerable. An answer, however, is\r\ncommenced in Fenno’s paper of yesterday, under the signature of Scipio.\r\nThe real author not yet conjectured. As I take these papers merely to\r\npreserve them, I will forward them to you, as you can easily return them\r\nto me on my arrival at home; for I shall not see you on my way, as I\r\nmean to go by the Eastern Shore and Petersburg. Perhaps the paragraphs\r\nin some of these abominable papers may draw from you now and then a\r\nsquib. A pamphlet of Fauchet’s appeared yesterday. I send you a copy\r\nunder another cover. A hand-bill has just arrived here from New York,\r\nwhere they learn from a vessel which left Havre about the 9th of\r\nNovember, that the Emperor had signed the definitive articles, given up\r\nMantua, evacuated Mentz, agreed to give passage to the French troops\r\nto Hanover, and that the Portuguese ambassador had been ordered to quit\r\nParis, on account of the seizure of fort St. Julian’s by the, English,\r\nsupposed with the connivance of Portugal. Though this is ordinary\r\nmercantile news, it looks like truth. The latest official intelligence\r\nfrom Paris, is from Talleyrand to the French Consul here (Lastombe),\r\ndated September the 28th, saying that our Envoys were arrived, and would\r\nfind every disposition on the part of his government to accommodate with\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMy affectionate respects to Mrs. Madison; to yourself, health and\r\nfriendship. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXX.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 25, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 25, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 2nd instant, on which day I received yours of\r\nDecember the 25th. I have not resumed my pen, because there has\r\nreally been nothing worth writing about, but what you would see in the\r\nnewspapers. There is, as yet, no certainty what will be the aspect\r\nof our affairs with France. Either the Envoys have not written to\r\nthe government, or their communications are hushed up. This last is\r\nsuspected, because so many arrivals have happened from Bordeaux and\r\nHavre. The letters from American correspondents in France have been\r\nalways to Boston: and the experience we had last summer of their\r\nadroitness in counterfeiting this kind of intelligence, inspires doubts\r\nas to their late paragraphs. A letter is certainly received here by an\r\nindividual, from Talleyrand, which says our Envoys have been heard, that\r\ntheir pretensions are high, that possibly no arrangement may take place,\r\nbut that there will be no declaration of war by France. It is said that\r\nBournonville has written that he has hopes of an accommodation (three\r\naudiences having then, November, been had), and to be himself a member\r\nof a new diplomatic mission to this country. On the whole, I am entirely\r\nsuspended as to what is to be expected. The Representatives have been\r\nseveral days in debate on the bill for foreign intercourse. A motion has\r\nbeen made to reduce it to what it was before the extension of 1796. The\r\ndebate will probably have good effects, in several ways, on the public\r\nmind, but the advocates for the reformation expect to lose the question.\r\nThey find themselves deceived in the expectation entertained in the\r\nbeginning of the session, that they had a majority. They now think the\r\nmajority is on the other side by two or three, and there are moreover\r\ntwo or three of them absent. Blount’s affair is to come on next. In the\r\nmean time, the Senate have before them a bill for regulating proceedings\r\nin impeachment. This will be made the occasion of offering a clause for\r\nthe introduction of juries into these trials. (Compare the paragraph\r\nin the constitution which says, that all crimes, except in cases of\r\nimpeachment, shall be by jury, with the eighth amendment, which says,\r\nthat in all criminal prosecutions, the trial shall be by jury.) There is\r\nno expectation of carrying this; because the division in the Senate is\r\nof two to one, but it will draw forth the principles of the parties, and\r\nconcur in accumulating proofs on which side all the sound principles are\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nVery acrimonious altercations are going on between the Spanish Minister\r\nand the executive, and at the Natchez something worse than mere\r\naltercation. If hostilities have not begun there, it has not been\r\nfor want of endeavors to bring them on, by our agents. Marshall,\r\nof Kentucky, this day proposed in Senate some amendments to the\r\nconstitution. They were barely read just as we were adjourning, and not\r\na word of explanation given. As far as I caught them in my ear,\r\nthey went only to modifications of the elections of President and\r\nVice-President, by authorizing voters to add the office for which they\r\nname each, and giving to the Senate the decision of a disputed election\r\nof President, and to the Representatives that of Vice-President. But\r\nI am apprehensive I caught the thing imperfectly, and probably\r\nincorrectly. Perhaps this occasion may be taken of proposing again the\r\nVirginia amendments, as also to condemn elections by the legislatures,\r\nthemselves to transfer the power of trying impeachments from the Senate\r\nto some better constituted court, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nGood tobacco here is thirteen dollars, flour eight dollars and fifty\r\ncents, wheat one dollar and fifty cents, but dull, because only the\r\nmillers buy. The river, however, is nearly open, and the merchants will\r\nnow come to market and give a spur to the price. But the competition\r\nwill not be what it has been. Bankruptcies thicken, and the height of\r\nthem has by no means yet come on. It is thought this, winter will be\r\nvery trying.\r\n\r\nFriendly salutations to Mrs. Madison. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 28. I enclose Marshall’s propositions. They have been this\r\nday postponed to the 1st of June, chiefly by the vote of the\r\nanti-republicans, under the acknowledged fear that other amendments\r\nwould be also proposed, and that this is not the time for agitating the\r\npublic mind. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXI.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 8, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 8, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 25th ultimo; since which yours of the 21st has\r\nbeen received. Bache had put five hundred copies of Monroe’s book on\r\nboard a vessel, which was stopped by the early and unexpected freezing\r\nof the river. He tried in vain to get them carried by fifties at a time,\r\nby the stage. The river is now open here, the vessels are falling down,\r\nand if they can get through the ice below, the one with Bache’s packet\r\nwill soon be at Richmond. It is surmised here that Scipio is written by\r\nC. Lee. Articles of impeachment were yesterday given in against Blount.\r\nBut many great preliminary questions will arise. Must not a formal law\r\nsettle the oath of the Senators, form of pleadings, process against\r\nperson or goods, &c. May he not appear by attorney? Must he not be tried\r\nby a jury? Is a Senator impeachable? Is an ex-Senator impeachable? You\r\nwill readily conceive that these questions, to be settled by twenty-nine\r\nlawyers, are not likely to come to speedy issue. A very disagreeable\r\nquestion of privilege has suspended all other proceedings for some days.\r\nYou will see this in the newspapers. The question of arming vessels came\r\non, on Monday last; that morning, the President sent in an inflammatory\r\nmessage about a vessel taken and burnt by a French privateer, near\r\nCharleston. Of this he had been possessed some time, and it had been\r\nthrough all the newspapers. It seemed to come in now apropos for\r\nspurring on the disposition to arm. However, the question has not come\r\non. In the mean time the general spirit, even of the merchants, is\r\nbecoming adverse to it. In New Hampshire and Rhode Island they are\r\nunanimously against arming; so in Baltimore. This place is becoming more\r\nso. Boston divided and desponding. I know nothing of New York; but I\r\nthink there is no danger of the question being carried, unless something\r\nfavorable to it is received from our Envoys. From them we hear nothing.\r\nYet it seems reasonably believed that the executive has heard, and that\r\nit is something which would not promote their views of arming. For every\r\naction of theirs shows they are panting to come to blows. Giles has\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nMy friendly salutations to Mrs. Madison. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXII.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 15, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 15, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 8th. We have still not a word from our Envoys.\r\nThis long silence (if they have been silent) proves things are not\r\ngoing on very roughly. If they have not been silent, it proves their\r\ninformation, if made public, would check the disposition to arm. I had\r\nflattered myself, from the progress of the public sentiment against\r\narming, that the same progress had taken place in the legislature. But\r\nI am assured by those who have better opportunities of forming a good\r\njudgment, that if the question against arming is carried at all, it will\r\nnot be by more than a majority of two: and particularly, that there will\r\nnot be more than four votes against it from the five eastern states, or\r\nfive votes at the utmost. You will have perceived that Dayton has gone\r\nover completely. He expects to be appointed Secretary of War in the\r\nroom of M’Henry, who it is said will retire. He has been told, as report\r\ngoes, that they would not have confidence enough in him to appoint him.\r\nThe desire of inspiring them with more, seems the only way to account\r\nfor the eclat which he chooses to give to his conversion. You will have\r\nseen the disgusting proceedings in the case of Lyon: if they would have\r\naccepted even of a commitment to the Serjeant it might have been\r\nhad. But to get rid of his vote was the most material object. These\r\nproceedings must degrade the General Government, and lead the people\r\nto lean more on their State governments, which have been sunk under the\r\nearly popularity of the former. This day the question of the jury in\r\ncases of impeachment comes on. There is no doubt how it will go. The\r\ngeneral division of the Senate is twenty-two and ten; and under the\r\nprobable prospect of what it will for ever be, I see nothing in the\r\nmode of proceeding by impeachment but the most formidable weapon for the\r\npurposes of dominant faction that ever was contrived. It would be the\r\nmost effectual one of getting rid of any man whom they consider as\r\ndangerous to their views, and I do not know that we could count on one\r\nthird in an emergency. All depends then on the House of Representatives,\r\nwho are the impeachers; and there the majorities are of one, two, or\r\nthree only; and these sometimes one way and sometimes another: in a\r\nquestion of pure party they have the majority, and we do not know what\r\ncircumstances may turn up to increase that majority temporarily, it not\r\npermanently. I know of no solid purpose of punishment which the\r\ncourts of law are not equal to, and history shows, that, in England,\r\nimpeachment has been an engine more of passion than justice. A great\r\nball is to be given here on the 22nd, and in other great towns of the\r\nUnion. This is, at least, very indelicate, and probably excites uneasy\r\nsensations in some. I see in it, however, this useful deduction,\r\nthat the birth-days which have been kept, have been, not those of the\r\nPresident, but of the General. I enclose, with the newspapers, the two\r\nacts of parliament passed on the subject of our commerce, which\r\nare interesting. The merchants here, say, that the effect of the\r\ncountervailing tonnage on American vessels, will throw them completely\r\nout of employ as soon as there is peace. The eastern members say nothing\r\nbut among themselves. But it is said that it is working like grave\r\nin their stomachs. Our only comfort is, that they have brought it on\r\nthemselves. My respectful salutations to Mrs. Madison; and to yourself,\r\nfriendship and adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXIII.--TO GENERAL GATES, February 21, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 21, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear General,\r\n\r\nI received duly your welcome favor of the 15th, and had an opportunity\r\nof immediately delivering the one it enclosed to General Kosciusko. I\r\nsee him often, and with great pleasure mixed with commiseration. He is\r\nas pure a son of liberty as I have ever known, and of that liberty which\r\nis to go to all, and not to the few or the rich alone. We are here under\r\ngreat anxiety to hear from our Envoys.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI agree with you that some of our merchants have been milking the cow:\r\nyet the great mass of them have become deranged, they are daily falling\r\ndown by bankruptcies, and on the whole, the condition of our commerce\r\nfar less firm and really prosperous, than it would have been by the\r\nregular operations and steady advances which a state of peace would have\r\noccasioned. Were a war to take place, and throw our agriculture into\r\nequal convulsions with our commerce, our business would be done at both\r\nends. But this I hope will not be. The good news from the Natchez has\r\ncut off the fear of a breach in that quarter, where a crisis was brought\r\non which has astonished every one. How this mighty duel is to end\r\nbetween Great Britain and France, is a momentous question. The sea which\r\ndivides them makes it a game of chance; but it is narrow, and all the\r\nchances are not on one side. Should they make peace, still our fate is\r\nproblematical.\r\n\r\nThe countervailing acts of Great Britain, now laid before Congress,\r\nthreaten, in the opinion of merchants, the entire loss of our navigation\r\nto England. It makes a difference, from the present state of things, of\r\nfive hundred guineas on a vessel of three hundred and fifty tons. If,\r\nas the newspapers have told us, France has renewed her _Arrêt_ of\r\n1789, laying a duty of seven livres a hundred on all tobacco brought in\r\nforeign bottoms (even our own), and should extend it to rice and other\r\ncommodities, we are done, as navigators, to that country also. In fact,\r\nI apprehend that those two great nations will think it their interest\r\nnot to permit us to be navigators. France had thought otherwise, and had\r\nshown an equal desire to encourage our navigation as her own, while\r\nshe hoped its weight would at least not be thrown into the scale of\r\nher enemies. She sees now that that is not to be relied on, and\r\nwill probably use her own means, and those of the nations under her\r\ninfluence, to exclude us from the ocean. How far it may lessen our\r\nhappiness to be rendered merely agricultural, how far that state is more\r\nfriendly to principles of virtue and liberty, are questions yet to be\r\nsolved. Kosciusko has been disappointed by the sudden peace between\r\nFrance and Austria. A ray of hope seemed to gleam on his mind for a\r\nmoment, that the extension of the revolutionary spirit through Italy and\r\nGermany, might so have occupied the remnants of monarchy there, as that\r\nhis country might have risen again. I sincerely rejoice to find that you\r\npreserve your health so well. That you may so go on to the end of\r\nthe chapter, and that it may be a long one, I sincerely pray. Make\r\nmy friendly salutations acceptable to Mrs. Gates, and accept yourself\r\nassurances of the great and constant esteem and respect of, Dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXIV.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 22, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 22, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 12th is received. I wrote you last on the 15th, but the\r\nletter getting misplaced, will only go by this post. We still hear\r\nnothing from our Envoys. Whether the executive hear, we know not. But if\r\nwar were to be apprehended, it is impossible our Envoys should not find\r\nmeans of putting us on our guard, or that the executive should hold back\r\ntheir information. No news, therefore, is good news. The countervailing\r\nact, which I sent you by the last post, will, confessedly, put American\r\nbottoms out of employ in our trade with Great Britain. So say well\r\ninformed merchants. Indeed, it seems probable, when we consider that\r\nhitherto, with the advantage of our foreign tonnage, our vessels could\r\nonly share with the British, and the countervailing duties will, it is\r\nsaid, make a difference of five hundred guineas to our prejudice on a\r\nship of three hundred and fifty tons. Still the eastern men say nothing.\r\nEvery appearance and consideration render it probable, that on the\r\nrestoration of peace, both France and Britain will consider it their\r\ninterest to exclude us from the ocean, by such peaceable means as are in\r\ntheir power. Should this take place, perhaps it may be thought just and\r\npolitic to give to our native capitalists the monopoly of our internal\r\ncommerce. This may at once relieve us from the dangers of wars abroad\r\nand British thraldom at home. The news from the Natchez, of the delivery\r\nof the posts, which you will see in the papers, is to be relied on. We\r\nhave escaped a dangerous crisis there. The great contest between Israel\r\nand Morgan, of which you will see the papers full, is to be decided this\r\nday. It is snowing fast at this time, and the most sloppy walking I ever\r\nsaw. This will be to the disadvantage of the party which has the most\r\ninvalids. Whether the event will be known this evening, I am uncertain.\r\nI rather presume not, and, therefore, that you will not learn it till\r\nnext post.\r\n\r\nYou will see in the papers, the ground on which the introduction of the\r\njury into the trial by impeachment was advocated by Mr. Tazewell, and\r\nthe fate of the question. Reader’s motion, which I enclosed you,\r\nwill probably be amended and established, so as to declare a Senator\r\nunimpeachable, absolutely; and yesterday an opinion was declared, that\r\nnot only officers of the State governments, but every private citizen\r\nof the United States, are impeachable. Whether they will think this the\r\ntime to make the declaration, I know not; but if they bring it on, I\r\nthink there will be not more than two votes north of the Potomac against\r\nthe universality of the impeaching power. The system of the Senate may\r\nbe inferred from their transactions heretofore, and from the following\r\ndeclaration made to me personally by their oracle.* ‘No republic Can\r\never be of any duration without a Senate, and a Senate deeply and\r\nstrongly rooted, strong enough to bear up against all popular storms\r\nand passions. The only fault in the constitution of our Senate is, that\r\ntheir term of office is not durable enough. Hitherto they have done\r\nwell, but probably they will be forced to give way in time.’ I suppose\r\ntheir having done well hitherto, alluded to the stand they made on the\r\nBritish treaty. This declaration may be considered as their text: that\r\nthey consider themselves as the bulwarks of the government, and will be\r\nrendering that the more secure, in proportion as they can assume greater\r\npowers. The foreign intercourse bill is set for to-day: but the parties\r\nare so equal on that in the House of Representatives, that they seem\r\nmutually to fear the encounter.\r\n\r\nMy friendly salutations to Mrs. Madison and the family. To\r\n\r\nyourself, friendly adieus.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [* Here, in the margin of the copy filed, is written by the\r\n     author, in pencil, ‘Mr, Adams.’]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXV.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 2, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 2, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote to you last on the 22nd ultimo; since which I have received\r\nyours without date, but probably of April the 18th or 19th. An arrival\r\nto the eastward brings us some news, which you will see detailed in the\r\npapers. The new partition of Europe is sketched, but how far authentic\r\nwe know not. It has some probability in its favor. The French appear\r\nbusy in their preparations for the invasion of England; nor is there any\r\nappearance of movements on the part of Russia and Prussia which might\r\ndivert them from it.\r\n\r\nThe late birth-night has certainly sown tares among the exclusive\r\nfederalists. It has winnowed the grain from the chaff. The sincerely\r\nAdamites did not go. The Washingtonians went religiously, and took\r\nthe secession of the others in high dudgeon. The one sect threatens to\r\ndesert the levees, the other the parties. The whigs went in number, to\r\nencourage the idea that the birth-nights hitherto kept had been for the\r\nGeneral and not the President, and of course that time would bring an\r\nend to them. Goodhue, Tracy, Sedgwick, &c. did not attend; but the three\r\nSecretaries and Attorney General did.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised, the last week, with a symptom of a disposition to\r\nrepeal the stamp act. Petitions for that purpose had come from Rhode\r\nIsland and Virginia, and had been committed to rest with the Ways\r\nand Means. Mr. Harper, the chairman, in order to enter on the law for\r\namending it, observed it would be necessary first to put the petitions\r\nfor repeal out of the way, and moved an immediate decision on this. The\r\nRhode-Islanders begged and prayed for a postponement; that not knowing\r\nthat this was the next question to be called up, they were not at all\r\nprepared: but Harper would show no mercy; not a moment’s delay would be\r\nallowed. It was taken up, and, on question without debate, determined in\r\nfavor of the petitions by a majority of ten. Astonished and confounded,\r\nwhen an order to bring in a bill for revisal was named, they began in\r\nturn to beg for time; two weeks, one week, three days, one day; not a\r\nmoment would be yielded. They made three attempts for adjournment. But\r\nthe majority appeared to grow. It was decided, by a majority of sixteen,\r\nthat the bill should be brought in. It was brought in the next day, and\r\non the day after passed and was sent up to the Senate, who instantly\r\nsent it back rejected by a vote of fifteen to twelve. Rhode Island and\r\nNew Hampshire voted for the repeal in Senate. The act will therefore go\r\ninto operation July the 1st, but probably without amendments. However,\r\nI am persuaded it will be shortlived. It has already excited great\r\ncommotion in Vermont, and grumblings in Connecticut. But they are so\r\npriest-ridden, that nothing is to be expected from them, but the most\r\nbigoted passive obedience.\r\n\r\nNo news yet from our commissioners; but their silence is admitted to\r\naugur peace. There is no talk yet of the time of adjourning, though it\r\nis admitted we have nothing to do, but what could be done in a\r\nfortnight or three weeks. When the spring opens, and we hear from our\r\ncommissioners, we shall probably draw pretty rapidly to a conclusion.\r\nA friend of mine here wishes to get a copy of Mazzei’s ‘Recherches\r\nHistoriques et Politiques.’ Where are they?\r\n\r\nSalutations and adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXVI.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 15, 1798\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 15, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 2nd instant. Yours of the 4th is now at hand.\r\nThe public papers will give you the news of Europe. The French decree\r\nmaking the vessel friendly or enemy, according to the hands by which\r\nthe cargo was manufactured, has produced a great sensation among the\r\nmerchants here. Its operation is not yet perhaps well understood; but\r\nprobably it will put our shipping out of competition, because British\r\nbottoms, which can come under convoy, will alone be trusted with return\r\ncargoes. Ours, losing this benefit, would need a higher freight out, in\r\nwhich, therefore, they will be underbid by the British. They must then\r\nretire from the competition. Some no doubt will try other channels of\r\ncommerce, and return cargoes from other countries. This effect would be\r\nsalutary. A very well informed merchant, too, (a Scotchman, entirely in\r\nthe English trade) told me, bethought it would have another good effect,\r\nby checking and withdrawing our extensive commerce and navigation (the\r\nfruit of our natural position) within those bounds to which peace must\r\nnecessarily bring them. That this being done by degrees, will probably\r\nprevent those numerous failures produced generally by a peace coming on\r\nsuddenly. Notwithstanding this decree, the sentiments of the merchants\r\nbecome more and more cooled and settled down against arming. Yet it\r\nis believed the Representatives do not cool; and though we think the\r\nquestion against arming will be carried, yet probably by a majority\r\nof only four or five. Their plan is to have convoys furnished for our\r\nvessels going to Europe, and smaller vessels for the coasting defence.\r\nOn this condition, they will agree to fortify southern harbors and build\r\nsome galleys. It has been concluded among them, that if war takes place,\r\nWolcott is to be retained in office, that the President must give up\r\nM’Henry, and as to Pickering they are divided, the eastern men being\r\ndetermined to retain him, their middle and southern brethren wishing\r\nto get rid of him. They have talked of General Pinckney as successor\r\nto M’Henry. This information is certain. However, I hope we shall avoid\r\nwar, and save them the trouble of a change of ministry. The President\r\nhas nominated John Quincy Adams Commissioner Plenipotentiary to renew\r\nthe treaty with Sweden. Tazewell made a great stand against it, on the\r\ngeneral ground that we should let our treaties drop, and remain without\r\nany. He could only get eight votes against twenty. A trial will be made\r\ntoday in another form, which he thinks will give ten or eleven against\r\nsixteen or seventeen, declaring the renewal inexpedient. In this case,\r\nnotwithstanding the nomination has been confirmed, it is supposed the\r\nPresident would perhaps not act under it, on the probability that more\r\nthan the third would be against the ratification. I believe, however,\r\nthat he would act, and that a third could not be got to oppose the\r\nratification. It is acknowledged we have nothing to do but to decide the\r\nquestion about arming. Yet not a word is said about adjourning; and some\r\neven talk of continuing the session permanently; others talk of July and\r\nAugust. An effort, however, will soon be made for an early adjournment.\r\nMy friendly salutations to Mrs. Madison; to yourself an affectionate\r\nadieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 21, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 21, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 15th; since that, yours of the 12th has been\r\nreceived. Since that, too, a great change has taken place in the\r\nappearance of our political atmosphere. The merchants, as before,\r\ncontinue, a respectable part of them, to wish to avoid arming. The\r\nFrench decree operated on them as a sedative, producing more alarm than\r\nresentment: on the Representatives, differently. It excited indignation\r\nhighly in the war party, though I do not know that it had added any\r\nnew friends, to that side of the question. We still hoped a majority\r\nof about four: but the insane message which you will see in the public\r\npapers has had great effect. Exultation on the one side, and a certainty\r\nof victory; while the other is petrified with astonishment. Our Evans,\r\nthough his soul is wrapt up in the sentiments of this message, yet\r\nafraid to give a vote openly for it, is going off to-morrow, as is said.\r\nThose who count, say there are still two members of the other side who\r\nwill come over to that of peace. If so, the members will be for war\r\nmeasures, fifty-two, against them fifty-three; if all are present except\r\nEvans. The question is, what is to be attempted, supposing we have a\r\nmajority: I suggest two things: 1. As the President declares he has\r\nwithdrawn the executive prohibition to arm, that Congress should pass a\r\nlegislative one. If that should fail in the Senate, it would heap\r\ncoals of fire on their heads. 2. As, to do nothing and to gain time is\r\neverything with us, I propose, that they shall come to a resolution of\r\nadjournment, ‘in order to go home and consult their constituents on the\r\ngreat crisis of American affairs now existing.’ Besides gaining time\r\nenough by this, to allow the descent on England to have its effect here\r\nas well as there, it will be a means of exciting the whole body of the\r\npeople from the state of inattention in which they are; it will require\r\nevery member to call for the sense of his district by petition or\r\ninstruction; it will show the people with which side of the House their\r\nsafety as well as their rights rest, by showing them which is for\r\nwar and which for peace; and their representatives will return here\r\ninvigorated by the avowed support of the American people. I do not\r\nknow, however, whether this will be approved, as there has been little\r\nconsultation on the subject. We see a new instance of the inefficiency\r\nof constitutional guards.\r\n\r\nWe had relied with great security on that provision, which requires two\r\nthirds of the legislature to declare war. But this is completely eluded\r\nby a majority’s taking such measures as will be sure to produce war.\r\nI wrote you in my last, that an attempt was to be made on that day in\r\nSenate, to declare the inexpediency of renewing our treaties. But the\r\nmeasure is put off under the hope of its being attempted under better\r\nauspices. To return to the subject of war, it is quite impossible, when\r\nwe consider all the existing circumstances, to find any reason in its\r\nfavor resulting from views either of interest or honor, and plausible\r\nenough to impose even on the weakest mind; and especially, when it would\r\nbe undertaken by a majority of one or two only. Whatever then be our\r\nstock of charity or liberality, we must resort to other views. And those\r\nso well known to have been entertained at Annapolis, and afterwards at\r\nthe grand convention, by a particular set of men, present themselves\r\nas those alone which can account for so extraordinary a degree of\r\nimpetuosity. Perhaps, instead of what was then in contemplation,\r\na separation of the Union, which has been so much the topic to the\r\neastward of late, may be the thing aimed at. I have written so far,\r\ntwo days before the departure of the post. Should any thing more occur\r\nto-day or to-morrow, it shall be added. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXVIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 29, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 29, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 21st. Yours of the 12th, therein acknowledged,\r\nis the last received. The measure I suggested in mine, of adjourning for\r\nconsultation with their constituents, was not brought forward; but on\r\nTuesday three resolutions were moved, which you will see in the public\r\npapers. They were offered in committee to prevent their being suppressed\r\nby the previous question, and in the committee on the state of the\r\nUnion, to put it out of their power, by the rising of the committee and\r\nnot sitting again, to get rid of them. They were taken by surprise,\r\nnot expecting to be called to vote on such a proposition as ‘that it\r\nis inexpedient to resort to war against the French republic’. After\r\nspending the first day in seeking on every side some hole to get out\r\nat, like an animal first put into a cage, they gave up their resource.\r\nYesterday they came forward boldly, and openly combated the proposition.\r\nMr. Harper and Mr. Pinckney pronounced bitter philippics against France,\r\nselecting such circumstances and aggravations as to give the worst\r\npicture they could present. The latter, on this, as in the affair of\r\nLyon and Griswold, went far beyond that moderation he has on other\r\noccasions recommended. We know not how it will go. Some think the\r\nresolution will be lost, some, that it will be carried; but neither way,\r\nby a majority of more than, one or two. The decision of the Executive,\r\nof two thirds of the Senate, and half the House of Representatives, is\r\ntoo much for the other half of that House. We therefore fear it will be\r\nborne down, and are under the most gloomy apprehensions. In fact, the\r\nquestion of war and peace depends now on a toss of cross and pile. If\r\nwe could but gain this season, we should be saved. The affairs of Europe\r\nwould of themselves save us. Besides this, there can be no doubt that a\r\nrevolution of opinion in Massachusetts and Connecticut is working. Two\r\nwhig presses have been set up in each of those States. There has\r\nbeen for some days a rumor, that a treaty of alliance, offensive and\r\ndefensive with Great Britain, has arrived. Some circumstances have\r\noccasioned it to be listened to; to wit, the arrival of Mr. King’s\r\nsecretary, which is affirmed, the departure of Mr. Liston’s secretary,\r\nwhich I know is to take place on Wednesday next, the high tone of the\r\nexecutive measures at the last, and present session, calculated to raise\r\nthings to the unison of such a compact, and supported so desperately in\r\nboth Houses in opposition to the pacific wishes of the people, and\r\nat the risk of their approbation at the ensuing election. Langdon\r\nyesterday, in debate, mentioned this current report. Tracy, in reply,\r\ndeclared he knew of no such thing, did not believe it, nor would be its\r\nadvocate.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to get the Quakers to come forward with a\r\npetition, to aid with the weight of their body the feeble band of peace.\r\nThey have, with some effort, got a petition signed by a few of their\r\nsociety; the main body of their society refuse it. M’Lay’s peace motion\r\nin the Assembly of Pennsylvania was rejected with an unanimity of the\r\nQuaker vote, and it seems to be well understood, that their attachment\r\nto England is stronger than to their principles or their country. The\r\nrevolution war was a first proof of this. Mr. White, from the federal\r\ncity, is here, soliciting money for the buildings at Washington. A\r\nbill for two hundred thousand dollars has passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and is before the Senate, where its fate is entirely\r\nuncertain. He has become perfectly satisfied that Mr. Adams is radically\r\nagainst the government’s being there. Goodhue (his oracle) openly said\r\nin committee, in presence of White, that he knew the government was\r\nobliged to go there, but they would not be obliged to stay there. Mr.\r\nAdams said to White, that it would be better that the President should\r\nrent a common house there, to live in; that no President would live in\r\nthe one now building. This harmonizes with Goodhue’s idea of a short\r\nresidence. I wrote this in the morning, but need not part with it till\r\nnight. If any thing occurs in the day, it shall be added. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXIX.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 5, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 5, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 29th ultimo; since which I have no letter from\r\nyou. These acknowledgments regularly made and attended to will show\r\nwhether any of my letters are intercepted, and the impression of my seal\r\non wax (which shall be constant hereafter) will discover whether they\r\nare opened by the way. The nature of some of my communications furnishes\r\nground of inquietude for their safe conveyance. The bill for the federal\r\nbuildings labors hard in Senate, though, to lessen opposition, the\r\nMaryland Senator himself proposed to reduce the two hundred thousand\r\ndollars to one third of that sum. Sedgwick and Hill-house violently\r\noppose it. I conjecture that the votes will be either thirteen for and\r\nfifteen against it, or fourteen and fourteen. Every member declares he\r\nmeans to go there, but though charged with an intention to come\r\naway again, not one of them disavow it. This will engender incurable\r\ndistrust. The debate on Mr. Sprigg’s resolutions has been interrupted\r\nby a motion to call for papers. This was carried by a great majority.\r\nIn this case, there appeared a separate squad, to wit, the Pinckney\r\ninterest, which is a distinct thing, and will be seen sometimes to lurch\r\nthe President. It is in truth the Hamilton party, whereof Pinckney is\r\nonly made the stalking-horse. The papers have been sent in and read, and\r\nit is now under debate in both Houses, whether they shall be published.\r\nI write in the morning, and if determined in the course of the day in\r\nfavor of publication, I will add in the evening a general idea of their\r\ncharacter. Private letters from France, by a late vessel which sailed\r\nfrom Havre, February the 5th, assure us that France, classing us in her\r\nmeasures with the Swedes and Danes, has no more notion of declaring\r\nwar against us than them. You will see a letter in Bache’s paper of\r\nyesterday, which came addressed to me. Still the fate of Spring’s\r\nresolutions seems in perfect _equilibrio_. You will see in Fenno, two\r\nnumbers of a paper signed Marcellus. They promise much mischief, and are\r\nascribed, without any difference of opinion, to Hamilton. You must, my\r\ndear Sir, take up your pen against this champion. You know the ingenuity\r\nof his talents; and there is not a person but yourself who can foil him.\r\nFor Heaven’s sake, then, take up your pen, and do not desert the public\r\ncause altogether. Thursday evening. The Senate have, to-day, voted\r\nthe publication of the communications from our Envoys. The House\r\nof Representatives decided against the publication by a majority of\r\nseventy-five to twenty-four. The Senate adjourned, over to-morrow (good\r\nFriday), to Saturday morning: but as the papers cannot be printed within\r\nthat time, perhaps the vote of the House of Representatives may induce\r\nthe Senate to reconsider theirs. For this reason, I think it my duty to\r\nbe silent on them. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXX.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 6, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 6, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSo much of the communications from our Envoys has got abroad, and so\r\npartially, that there can now be no ground for reconsideration with the\r\nSenate. I may therefore, consistently with duty do what every member of\r\nthe body is doing. Still, I would rather you would use the communication\r\nwith reserve till you see the whole papers. The first impressions\r\nfrom them are very disagreeable and confused. Reflection, however, and\r\nanalysis resolve them into this. Mr. Adams’s speech to Congress in May\r\nis deemed such a national affront, that no explanation on other\r\ntopics can be entered on till that, as a preliminary, is wiped away by\r\nhumiliating disavowals or acknowledgments. This working hard with\r\nour Envoys, and indeed seeming impracticable for want of that sort\r\nof authority, submission to a heavy amercement (upwards of a million\r\nsterling) was, at an after meeting, suggested as an alternative, which\r\nmight be admitted if proposed by us. These overtures had been through\r\ninformal agents; and both the alternatives bringing the Envoys to their\r\n_ne plus_, they resolve to have no more communication through inofficial\r\ncharacters, but to address a letter directly to the government, to\r\nbring forward their pretensions. This letter had not yet, however,\r\nbeen prepared. There were interwoven with these overtures some base\r\npropositions on the part of Talleyrand, through one of his agents, to\r\nsell his interest and influence with the Directory towards soothing\r\ndifficulties with them, in consideration of a large sum (fifty thousand\r\npounds sterling); and the arguments to which his agent resorted to\r\ninduce compliance with this demand were very unworthy of a great nation\r\n(could they be imputed to them), and calculated to excite disgust and\r\nindignation in Americans generally, and alienation in the republicans\r\nparticularly, whom they so far mistake, as to presume an attachment\r\nto France and hatred to the federal party, and not the love of their\r\ncountry, to be their first passion. No difficulty was expressed\r\ntowards an adjustment of all differences and misunderstandings, or even\r\nultimately a payment for spoliations, if the insult from our executive\r\nshould be first wiped away. Observe, that I state all this from only\r\na single hearing of the papers, and therefore it may not be rigorously\r\ncorrect. The little slanderous imputation before mentioned, has been the\r\nbait which hurried the opposite party into this publication. The first\r\nimpressions with the people will be disagreeable, but the last and\r\npermanent one will be, that the speech in May is now the only obstacle\r\nto accommodation, and the real cause of war, if war takes place. And\r\nhow much will be added to this by the speech of November, is yet to be\r\nlearned. It is evident however, on reflection, that these papers do not\r\noffer one motive the more for our going to war. Yet such is their effect\r\non the minds of wavering characters, that I fear, that, to wipe off\r\nthe imputation of being French partisans, they will go over to the war\r\nmeasures so furiously pushed by the other party. It seems, indeed, as\r\nif they were afraid they should not be able to get into war till Great\r\nBritain shall be blown up, and the prudence of our countrymen from that\r\ncircumstance, have, influence enough to prevent it. The most artful\r\nmisrepresentations of the contents of these papers were published\r\nyesterday, and produced such a shock in the republican mind, as had\r\nnever been seen since our independence. We are to dread the effects of\r\nthis dismay till their fuller information. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXXI.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 12, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 12, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir, I wrote you two letters on the 5th and 6th instant; since\r\nwhich I have received yours of the 2nd. I send you, in a separate\r\npackage, the instructions to our Envoys and their communications. You\r\nwill find that my representation of their contents from memory,\r\nwas substantially just. The public mind appears still in a state of\r\nastonishment. There never was a moment in which the aid of an able pen\r\nwas so important to place things in their just attitude. On this depend\r\nthe inchoate movement in the eastern mind, and the fate of the elections\r\nin that quarter, now beginning and to continue through the summer. I\r\nwould not propose to you such a task on any ordinary occasion. But be\r\nassured that a well digested analysis of these papers would now decide\r\nthe future turn of things, which are at this moment on the creen. The\r\nmerchants here are meeting under the auspices of Fitzsimmons, to address\r\nthe President and approve his propositions. Nothing will be spared on\r\nthat side. Sprigg’s first resolution against the expediency of war,\r\nproper at the time it was moved, is now postponed as improper, because\r\nto declare that, after we have understood it has been proposed to us\r\nto try peace, would imply an acquiescence under that proposition. All.\r\ntherefore, which the advocates of peace can now attempt, is to prevent\r\nwar measures externally, consenting to every rational measure of\r\ninternal defence and preparation. Great expenses will be incurred;\r\nand it will be left to those whose measures render them necessary, to\r\nprovide to meet them. They already talk of stopping all payments of\r\ninterest, and of a land-tax. These will probably not be opposed. The\r\nonly question will be, how to modify the land-tax. On this there may\r\nbe a great diversity of sentiment. One party will want to make it a new\r\nsource of patronage and expense. If this business is taken up, it will\r\nlengthen our session. We had pretty generally, till now, fixed on the\r\nbeginning of May for adjournment. I shall return by my usual routes,\r\nand not by the Eastern-shore, on account of the advance of the season.\r\nFriendly salutations to Mrs. Madison and yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXXII.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 26, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON,\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 26, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe bill for the naval armament (twelve vessels) passed by a majority of\r\nabout four to three in the House of Representatives: all restrictions\r\non the objects for which the vessels should be used were struck out. The\r\nbill for establishing a department of Secretary of the Navy was tried\r\nyesterday, on its passage to the third reading, and prevailed by\r\nforty-seven against forty-one. It will be read the third time to-day.\r\nThe provisional army of twenty thousand men will meet some difficulty.\r\nIt would surely be rejected if our members were all here. Giles,\r\nClopton, Cabell, and Nicholas have gone, and Clay goes to-morrow. He\r\nreceived here news of the death of his wife. Parker has completely gone\r\nover to the war-party. In this state of things they will carry what they\r\nplease. One of the war-party, in a fit of unguarded passion, declared\r\nsome time ago they would pass a citizen-bill, an alien-bill, and a\r\nsedition-bill: accordingly, some days ago, Coit laid a motion on the\r\ntable of the House of Representatives for modifying the citizen-law.\r\nTheir threats pointed at Gallatin, and it is believed they will endeavor\r\nto reach him by this bill. Yesterday Mr. Hillhouse laid on the table of\r\nthe Senate a motion for giving power to send away suspected aliens. This\r\nis understood to be meant for Volney and Collot. But it will not\r\nstop there when it gets into a course of execution. There is now\r\nonly wanting, to accomplish the whole declaration before mentioned, a\r\nsedition-bill, which we shall certainly soon see proposed. The object\r\nof that, is the suppression of the whig presses. Bache’s has been\r\nparticularly named. That paper and also Carey’s totter for want of\r\nsubscriptions. We should really exert ourselves to procure them, for if\r\nthese papers fall, republicanism will be entirely brow-beaten. Carey’s\r\npaper comes out three times a week, at five dollars. The meeting of the\r\npeople which was called at New York, did nothing. It was found that the\r\nmajority would be against the address. They therefore chose to circulate\r\nit individually. The committee of Ways and Means have voted a land-tax.\r\nAn additional tax on salt will certainly be proposed in the House, and\r\nprobably prevail to some degree. The stoppage of interest on the public\r\ndebt will also, perhaps, be proposed, but not with effect. In the mean\r\ntime, that paper cannot be sold. Hamilton is coming on as Senator from\r\nNew York. There have been so much contrivance and combination in that,\r\nas to show there is some great object in hand. Troup, the district judge\r\nof New York, resigns towards the close of the session of their Assembly.\r\nThe appointment of Mr. Hobart, then Senator, to succeed Troup, is not\r\nmade by the President till after the Assembly had risen. Otherwise,\r\nthey would have chosen the Senator in place of Hobart. Jay then names\r\nHamilton Senator, but not till a day or two before his own election as\r\nGovernor was to come on, lest the unpopularity of the nomination should\r\nbe in time to affect his own election. We shall see in what all this\r\nis to end; but surely in something. The popular movement in the Eastern\r\nStates is checked, as we expected, and war addresses are showering in\r\nfrom New Jersey and the great trading towns. However, we still trust\r\nthat a nearer view of war and a land-tax will oblige the great mass of\r\nthe people to attend. At present, the war-hawks talk of septembrizing,\r\ndeportation, and the examples for quelling sedition set by the French\r\nexecutive. All the firmness of the human mind is now in a state of\r\nrequisition.\r\n\r\nSalutations to Mrs. Madison; and to yourself, friendship and adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXXIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, May 3, 1798\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 3, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 26th; since which yours of the 22nd of April\r\nhas been received, acknowledging mine of the 12th; so that all appear to\r\nhave been received to that date. The spirit kindled up in the towns is\r\nwonderful. These and New Jersey are pouring in their addresses, offering\r\nlife and fortune. Even these addresses are not the worst things. For\r\nindiscreet declarations and expressions of passion may be pardoned to a\r\nmultitude acting from the impulse of the moment. But we cannot expect\r\na foreign nation to show that apathy to the answers of the President,\r\nwhich are more thrasonic than the addresses. Whatever chance for peace\r\nmight have been left us after the publication of the despatches, is\r\ncompletely lost by these answers. Nor is it France alone, but his own\r\nfellow-citizens, against whom his threats are uttered. In Fenno, of\r\nyesterday, you will see one, wherein he says to the address from\r\nNewark, ‘The delusions and misrepresentations which have misled so\r\nmany citizens, must be discountenanced by authority as well as by\r\nthe citizens at large’; evidently alluding to those letters from the\r\nRepresentatives to their constituents, which they have been in the habit\r\nof seeking after and publishing: while those sent by the tory part\r\nof the House to their constituents, are ten times more numerous, and\r\nreplete with the most atrocious falsehoods and calumnies. What new\r\nlaw they will propose on this subject, has not yet leaked out. The\r\ncitizen-bill sleeps. The alien-bill, proposed by the Senate, has not yet\r\nbeen brought in. That proposed by the House of Representatives has been\r\nso moderated, that it will not answer the passionate purposes of the war\r\ngentlemen. Whether, therefore, the Senate will push their bolder plan, I\r\nknow not. The provisional army does not go down so smoothly in the House\r\nas it did in the Senate. They are whittling away some of its choice\r\ningredients; particularly that of transferring their own constitutional\r\ndiscretion over the raising of armies to the President. A committee of\r\nthe Representatives have struck out his discretion, and hang the\r\nraising of the men on the contingencies of invasion, insurrection, or\r\ndeclaration of war. Were all our members here, the bill would not pass.\r\nBut it will, probably, as the House now is. Its expense is differently\r\nestimated, from five to eight millions of dollars a year. Their purposes\r\nbefore voted, require two millions above all the other taxes, which,\r\ntherefore, are voted to be raised on lands, houses, and slaves. The\r\nprovisional army will be additional to this. The threatening appearances\r\nfrom the alien-bills have so alarmed the French who are among us, that\r\nthey are going off. A ship, chartered by themselves for this purpose,\r\nwill sail within about a fortnight for France, with as many as she can\r\ncarry. Among these I believe will be Volney, who has in truth been the\r\nprincipal object aimed at by the law.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unfavorableness of the late impressions, it is\r\nbelieved the New York elections, which are over, will give us two or\r\nthree republicans more than we now have. But it is supposed Jay is\r\nre-elected. It is said Hamilton declines coming to the Senate. He very\r\nsoon stopped his Marcellus. It was rather the sequel which was feared\r\nthan what actually appeared. He comes out on a different plan in\r\nhis Titus Manlius, if that be really his. The appointments to the\r\nMississippi were so abominable that the Senate could not swallow them.\r\nThey referred them to a committee to inquire into characters, and the\r\nPresident withdrew the nomination.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing material now to be proposed, we generally expect to\r\nrise in about three weeks. However, I do not venture to order my horses.\r\n\r\nMy respectful salutations to Mrs. Madison. To yourself affectionate\r\nfriendship, and adieu,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. Perhaps the President’s expression before quoted, may look to the\r\nsedition-bill which has been spoken of, and which may be meant to put\r\nthe printing-presses under the imprimatur of the executive. Bache is\r\nthought a main object of it. Cabot, of Massachusetts, is appointed\r\nSecretary of the Navy. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXXIV.--TO JAMES LEWIS, JUNIOR, May 9, 1798\r\n\r\nTO JAMES LEWIS, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 9, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am much obliged by your friendly letter of the 4th instant. As soon as\r\nI saw the first of Mr. Martin’s letters, I turned to the newspapers\r\nof the day, and found Logan’s speech, as translated by a common Indian\r\ninterpreter. The version I had used, had been made by General Gibson.\r\nFinding from Mr. Martin’s style, that his object was not merely truth,\r\nbut to gratify party passions, I never read another of his letters. I\r\ndetermined to do my duty by searching into the truth, and publishing it\r\nto the world, whatever it should be. This I shall do at a proper season.\r\nI am much indebted to many persons, who, without any acquaintance with\r\nme, have voluntarily sent me information on the subject. Party passions\r\nare indeed high. Nobody has more reason to know it than myself. I\r\nreceive daily bitter proofs of it from people who never saw me, nor know\r\nany thing of me but through Porcupine and Fenno. At this moment all the\r\npassions are boiling over, and one who keeps himself cool and clear of\r\nthe contagion, is so far below the point of ordinary conversation, that\r\nhe finds himself insulated in every society. However, the fever will\r\nnot last. War, land-tax, and stamp-tax are sedatives which must cool its\r\nardor. They will bring on reflection, and that, with information, is\r\nall which our countrymen need, to bring themselves and their affairs to\r\nrights. They are essentially republicans. They retain unadulterated\r\nthe principles of ‘75, and those who are conscious of no change in\r\nthemselves have nothing to fear in the long run. It is our duty still to\r\nendeavor to avoid war: but if it shall actually take place, no matter\r\nby whom brought on, we must defend ourselves. If our house be on fire,\r\nwithout inquiring whether it was fired from within or without, we must\r\ntry to extinguish it. In that, I have no doubt, we shall act as one man.\r\nBut if we can ward off actual war till the crisis of England is over, I\r\nshall hope we may escape it altogether.\r\n\r\nI am, with much esteem, Dear Sir, your must obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXXV.--TO JAMES MADISON, May 31, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 31, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 24th; since which yours of the 20th has been\r\nreceived. I must begin by correcting two errors in my last. It was false\r\narithmetic to say, that two measures therein mentioned to have been\r\ncarried by majorities of eleven, would have failed if the fourteen\r\nabsentees (wherein a majority of six is ours) had been present. Six\r\ncoming over from the other side would have turned the scale, and this\r\nwas the idea floating in my mind, which produced the mistake. The second\r\nerror was in the version of Mr. Adams’s expression, which I stated to\r\nyou. His real expression was, ‘that he would not unbrace a single nerve\r\nfor any treaty France could offer; such was their entire want of faith,\r\nmorality, &c.’\r\n\r\nThe bill from the Senate for capturing French armed vessels found\r\nhovering on our coast, was passed in two days by the lower House,\r\nwithout a single alteration; and the Ganges, a twenty-gun sloop, fell\r\ndown the river instantly to go on a cruise. She has since been ordered\r\nto New York, to convoy a vessel from that to this port. The alien-bill\r\nwill be ready to-day, probably, for its third reading in the Senate.\r\nIt has been considerably modified, particularly by a proviso saving the\r\nrights of treaties. Still, it is a most detestable thing. I was glad, in\r\nyesterday’s discussion, to hear it admitted on all hands, that laws of\r\nthe United States, subsequent to a treaty, control its operation, and\r\nthat the legislature is the only power which can control a treaty. Both\r\npoints are sound beyond doubt. This bill will unquestionably pass\r\nthe House of Representatives; the majority there being very decisive,\r\nconsolidated, and bold enough to do any thing. I have no doubt from the\r\nhints dropped, they will pass a bill to declare the French treaty void.\r\nI question if they will think a declaration of war prudent, as it might\r\nalarm, and all its effects are answered by the act authorizing captures.\r\nA bill is brought in for suspending all communication with the dominions\r\nof France, which will no doubt pass. It is suspected they mean to borrow\r\nmoney of individuals in London, on the credit of our land-tax, and\r\nperhaps the guarantee of Great Britain. The land-tax was yesterday\r\ndebated, and a majority of six struck out the thirteenth section of the\r\nclassification of houses, and taxed them by a different scale from the\r\nlands. Instead of this, is to be proposed a valuation of the houses\r\nand lands together. Macon yesterday laid a motion on the table for\r\nadjourning on the 14th. Some think they do not mean to adjourn; others,\r\nthat they wait first the return of the Envoys, for whom it is now avowed\r\nthe brig Sophia was sent. It is expected she would bring them off about\r\nthe middle of this month. They may, therefore, be expected here about\r\nthe second week of July. Whatever be their decision as to adjournment,\r\nI think it probable my next letter will convey orders for my horses, and\r\nthat I shall leave this place from the 20th to the 25th of June: for\r\nI have no expectation they will actually adjourn sooner. Volney and a\r\nship-load of others sail on Sunday next. Another ship-load will go off\r\nin about three weeks. It is natural to expect they go under irritations\r\ncalculated to fan the flame. Not so Volney. He is most thoroughly\r\nimpressed with the importance of preventing war, whether considered\r\nwith reference to the interests of the two countries, of the cause of\r\nrepublicanism, or of man on the broad scale. But an eagerness to render\r\nthis prevention impossible, leaves me without any hope. Some of those\r\nwho have insisted that it was long since war on the part of France, are\r\ncandid enough to admit that it is now begun on our part also. I enclose\r\nfor your perusal a poem on the alien-bill, written by Mr. Marshall. I\r\ndo this, as well for your amusement, as to get you to take care of\r\nthis copy for me till I return; for it will be lost by lending it, if\r\nI retain it here, as the publication was suppressed after the sale of\r\na few copies, of which I was fortunate enough to get one. Your locks\r\nhinges, &c. shall be immediately attended to.\r\n\r\nMy respectful salutations and friendship to Mrs. Madison, to the family,\r\nand to yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. The President, it is said, has refused an Exequatur to the Consul\r\nGeneral of France, Dupont. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXXVI.--TO JOHN TAYLOR, June 1, 1798\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 1, 1798.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nMr. New showed me your letter on the subject of the patent, which gave\r\nme an opportunity of observing what you said as to the effect, with you,\r\nof public proceedings, and that it was not unwise now to estimate the\r\nseparate mass of Virginia and North Carolina, with a view to their\r\nseparate existence. It is true that we are completely under the saddle\r\nof Massachusetts and Connecticut, and that they ride us very hard,\r\ncruelly insulting our feelings, as well as exhausting our strength and\r\nsubsistence. Their natural friends, the three other eastern States,\r\njoin them from a sort of family pride, and they have the art to divide\r\ncertain other parts of the Union so as to make use of them to govern the\r\nwhole. This is not new, it is the old practice of despots; to use a part\r\nof the people to keep the rest in order. And those who have once got an\r\nascendency, and possessed themselves of all the resources of the nation,\r\ntheir revenues and offices, have immense means for retaining their\r\nadvantage. But our present situation is not a natural one. The\r\nrepublicans, through every part of the Union, say, that it was the\r\nirresistible influence and popularity of General Washington played\r\noff by the cunning of Hamilton, which turned the government over to\r\nanti-republican hands, or turned the republicans chosen by the people\r\ninto anti-republicans. He delivered it over to his successor in this\r\nstate, and very untoward events since, improved with great artifice,\r\nhave produced on the public mind the impressions we see. But still I\r\nrepeat it, this is not the natural state. Time alone would bring\r\nround an order of things more correspondent to the sentiments of our\r\nconstituents. But are there no events impending, which will do it within\r\na few months? The crisis with England, the public and authentic avowal\r\nof sentiments hostile to the leading principles of our constitution, the\r\nprospect of a war, in which we shall stand alone, land-tax, stamp-tax,\r\nincrease of public debt, &c. Be this as it may, in every free and\r\ndeliberating society, there must, from the nature of man, be opposite\r\nparties, and violent dissensions and discords; and one of these, for\r\nthe most part, must prevail over the other for a longer or shorter time.\r\nPerhaps this party division is necessary to induce each to watch and\r\ndelate to the people the proceedings of the other. But if on a temporary\r\nsuperiority of the one party, the other is to resort to a scission of\r\nthe Union, no federal government can ever exist. If to rid ourselves of\r\nthe present rule of Massachusetts and Connecticut, we break the Union,\r\nwill the evil stop there? Suppose the New England States alone cut off,\r\nwill our natures be changed? Are we not men still to the south of\r\nthat, and with all the passions of men? Immediately, we shall see a\r\nPennsylvania and a Virginia party arise in the residuary confederacy,\r\nand the public mind will be distracted with the same party-spirit.\r\nWhat a game too will the one party have in their hands, by eternally\r\nthreatening the other, that unless they do so and so, they will join\r\ntheir northern neighbors. If we reduce our Union to Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, immediately the conflict will be established between the\r\nrepresentatives of these two States, and they will end by breaking into\r\ntheir simple units. Seeing, therefore, that an association of men who\r\nwill not quarrel with one another is a thing which never yet existed,\r\nfrom the greatest confederacy of nations down to a town-meeting or a\r\nvestry; seeing that we must have somebody to quarrel with, I had rather\r\nkeep our New England associates for that purpose, than to see our\r\nbickerings transferred to others. They are circumscribed within such\r\nnarrow limits, and their population so full, that their numbers will\r\never be the minority, and they are marked, like the Jews, with such a\r\nperversity of character, as to constitute, from that circumstance, the\r\nnatural division of our parties. A little patience, and we shall see\r\nthe reign of witches pass over, their spells dissolved, and the people\r\nrecovering their true sight, restoring their government to its true\r\nprinciples. It is true, that in the mean time, we are suffering deeply\r\nin spirit, and incurring the horrors of a war, and long oppressions\r\nof enormous public debt. But who can say what would be the evils of a\r\nscission, and when and where they would end? Better keep together as we\r\nare, haul off from Europe as soon as we can, and from all attachments to\r\nany portions of it; and if they show their powers just sufficiently\r\nto hoop us together, it will be the happiest situation in which we\r\ncan exist. If the game runs sometimes against us at home, we must have\r\npatience till luck turns, and then we shall have an opportunity of\r\nwinning back the principles we have lost For this is a game where\r\nprinciples are the stake. Better luck, therefore, to us all, and health,\r\nhappiness, and friendly salutations to yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. It is hardly necessary to caution you to let nothing of mine get\r\nbefore the public; a single sentence got hold of by the Porcupines, will\r\nsuffice to abuse and persecute me in their papers for months.

I was happy in observing, for many days after your departure, that\r\nour winds were favorable for you.

Your departure is not yet known, or even suspected.*\r\nNiemsevioz was much affected. He is now at the federal city. He desired\r\nme to have some things taken care of for you.

Some letters came for you soon after your\r\ndeparture: the person who delivered them said there were enclosed in\r\nthem some for your friend whom you left here, and desired I would open\r\nthem. I did so in his presence, found only one letter for your friend,\r\ntook it out and sealed the letters again in the presence of the same\r\nperson, without reading a word or looking who they were from. I now\r\nforward them to you, as I do this to my friend.\r\n\r\n     [* Shortly before, Mr. Jefferson had obtained passports for\r\n     General Kosciusko, under an assumed name, from the foreign\r\n     ministers in this country.

Our alien-bill struggles hard for a\r\npassage. It has been considerably mollified. It is not yet through\r\nthe Senate. We are proceeding further and further in war-measures. I\r\nconsider that event as almost inevitable. I am extremely anxious to hear\r\nfrom you, to know what sort of a passage you had, how you find yourself\r\nand the state and prospect of things in Europe. I hope I shall not be\r\nlong without hearing from you. The first dividend which will be drawn\r\nfor you and remitted, will be in January, and as the winter passages are\r\ndangerous, it will not be forwarded till April: after that, regularly,\r\nfrom six months to six months. This will be done by Mr. Barnes. I shall\r\nleave this place in three weeks. The times do not permit an indulgence\r\nin political disquisitions. But they forbid not the effusion of\r\nfriendship, and not my warmest towards you, which no time will alter.\r\nYour principles and dispositions were made to be honored, revered, and\r\nloved.

Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXXXVIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, June 21, 1798\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 21, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of the 10th instant is received. I expected mine of the 14th would\r\nhave been my last from hence, as I had proposed to set out on the 20th;\r\nbut on the morning of the 19th, we heard of the arrival of Marshall\r\nat New York, and I concluded to stay and see whether that circumstance\r\nwould produce any new projects. No doubt he there received more than\r\nhints from Hamilton as to the tone required to be assumed. Yet I\r\napprehend he is not hot enough for his friends. Livingston came with\r\nhim from New York. Marshall told him they had no idea in France of a war\r\nwith us. That Talleyrand sent passports to him and Pinckney, but none\r\nfor Gerry. Upon this, Gerry stayed, without explaining to them the\r\nreason. He wrote, however, to the President by Marshall, who knew\r\nnothing of the contents of the letter. So that there must have been\r\na previous understanding between Talleyrand and Gerry. Marshall was\r\nreceived here with the utmost eclat. The Secretary of State and many\r\ncarriages, with all the city cavalry, went to Frankfort to meet him,\r\nand on his arrival here in the evening, the bells rung till late in the\r\nnight, and immense crowds were collected to see and make part of the\r\nshow, which was circuitously paraded through the streets before he was\r\nset down at the City tavern. All this was to secure him to their views,\r\nthat he might say nothing which would oppose the game they have been\r\nplaying. Since his arrival I can hear of nothing directly from him,\r\nwhile they are disseminating through the town, things, as from him,\r\ndiametrically opposite to what he said to Livingston. Doctor Logan,\r\nabout a fortnight ago, sailed for Hamburgh. Though for a twelvemonth\r\npast he had been intending to go to Europe as soon as he could get money\r\nenough to carry him there, yet when he had accomplished this, and fixed\r\na time for going, he very unwisely made a mystery of it; so that his\r\ndisappearance without notice excited conversation. This was seized by\r\nthe war-hawks, and given out as a secret mission from the Jacobins here\r\nto solicit an army from France, instruct them as to their landing,\r\nhe. This extravagance produced a real panic among the citizens; and\r\nhappening just when Bache published Talleyrand’s letter, Harper, on\r\nthe 18th, gravely announced to the House of Representatives, that there\r\nexisted a traitorous correspondence between the Jacobins here and the\r\nFrench Directory; that he had got hold of some threads and clues of it,\r\nand would soon be able to develope the whole. This increased the alarm;\r\ntheir libelists immediately set to work, directly and indirectly to\r\nimplicate whom they pleased. Porcupine gave me a principal share in it,\r\nas I am told, for I never read his papers. This state of things added to\r\nmy reasons for not departing at the time I intended. These follies seem\r\nto have died away in some degree already. Perhaps I may renew my purpose\r\nby the 25th. Their system is, professedly, to keep up an alarm. Tracy,\r\nat the meeting of the joint committee for adjournment, declared it\r\nnecessary for Congress to stay together to keep up the inflammation\r\nof the public mind; and Otis has expressed a similar sentiment since.\r\nHowever, they will adjourn. The opposers of an adjournment in Senate,\r\nyesterday agreed to adjourn on the 10th of July. But I think the 1st of\r\nJuly will be carried. That is one of the objects which detain myself, as\r\nwell as one or two more of the Senate, who had got leave of absence. I\r\nimagine it will be decided tomorrow or next day. To separate Congress\r\nnow, will be withdrawing the fire from under a boiling pot.\r\n\r\nMy respectful salutations to Mrs. Madison, and cordial friendship to\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.M. A message to both Houses this day from the President, with the\r\nfollowing communications.\r\n\r\nMarch 23. Pickering’s letter to the Envoys, directing them, if they are\r\nnot actually engaged in negotiation with authorized persons, or if it is\r\nnot conducted _bonâ fide_, and not merely for procrastination, to break\r\nup and come home, and at any rate to consent to no loan.\r\n\r\nApril 3. Talleyrand to Gerry. He supposes the other two gentlemen,\r\nperceiving that their known principles are an obstacle to negotiation,\r\nwill leave the republic, and proposes to renew the negotiations with\r\nGerry immediately.\r\n\r\nApril 4. Gerry to Talleyrand. Disclaims a power to conclude any thing\r\nseparately, can only confer informally and as an unaccredited person or\r\nindividual, reserving to lay every thing before the government of the\r\nUnited States for approbation.\r\n\r\nApril 14. Gerry to the President. He communicates the preceding, and\r\nhopes the President will send other persons instead of his colleagues\r\nand himself, if it shall appear that any thing can be done.\r\n\r\nThe President’s message says, that as the instructions were not to\r\nconsent to any loan, he considers the negotiation as at an end, and that\r\nhe will never send another minister to France, until he shall be assured\r\nthat he will be received and treated with the respect due to a great,\r\npowerful, free, and independent nation.\r\n\r\nA bill was brought into the Senate this day, to declare the treaties\r\nwith France void, prefaced by a list of grievances in the style of a\r\nmanifesto. It passed to the second reading by fourteen to five.\r\n\r\nA bill for punishing forgeries of bank-paper passed to the third reading\r\nby fourteen to six.

I shall notice these facts. The writer says, that ‘the day after the\r\nlast despatches were communicated to Congress, Bache, Leib, &c, and a\r\nDr. Reynolds, were closeted with me.’ If the receipt of visits in my\r\npublic room, the door continuing free to every one who should call\r\nat the same time, may be called closeting, then it is true that I was\r\ncloseted with every person who visited me; in no other sense is it true\r\nas to any person. I sometimes received visits from Mr. Bache and Dr.\r\nLeib. I received them always with pleasure, because they are men of\r\nabilities, and of principles the most friendly to liberty and our\r\npresent form of government. Mr. Bache has another claim on my respect,\r\nas being the grandson of Dr. Franklin, the greatest man and ornament\r\nof the age and country in which he lived. Whether I was visited by Mr.\r\nBache or Dr. Leib the day after the communication referred to, I do not\r\nremember. I know that all my motions at Philadelphia, here, and every\r\nwhere, are watched and recorded. Some of these spies, therefore, may\r\nremember, better than I do, the dates of these visits. If they say these\r\ntwo gentlemen visited me the day after the communication, as their trade\r\nproves their accuracy, I shall not contradict them, though I affirm\r\nthat I do not recollect it. However, as to Dr. Reynolds, I can be\r\nmore particular, because I never saw him but once, which was on an\r\nintroductory visit he was so kind as to pay me. This, I well remember,\r\nwas before the communication alluded to, and that during the short\r\nconversation I had with him, not one word was said on the subject of any\r\nof the communications. Not that I should not have spoken freely on\r\ntheir subject to Dr. Reynolds, as I should also have done to the\r\nletter-writer, or to any other person who should have introduced the\r\nsubject. I know my own principles to be pure, and therefore am not\r\nashamed of them. On the contrary, I wish them known, and therefore\r\nwillingly express them to every one. They are the same I have acted on\r\nfrom the year 1775 to this day, and are the same, I am sure, with\r\nthose of the great body of the American people. I only wish the real\r\nprinciples of those who censure mine were also known. But warring\r\nagainst those of the people, the delusion of the people is necessary\r\nto the dominant party. I see the extent to which that delusion has been\r\nalready carried, and I see there is no length to which it may not\r\nbe pushed by a party in possession of the revenues and the legal\r\nauthorities of the United States, for a short time indeed, but yet long\r\nenough to admit much particular mischief. There is no event, therefore,\r\nhowever atrocious, which may not be expected. I have contemplated every\r\nevent which the Maratists of the day can perpetrate, and am prepared to\r\nmeet every one in such a way, as shall not be derogatory either to the\r\npublic liberty or my own personal honor. This letter-writer says, I am\r\n‘for peace; but it is only with France.’ He has told half the truth. He\r\nwould have told the whole, if he had added England. I am for peace\r\nwith both countries. I know that both of them have given, and are\r\ndaily giving, sufficient cause of war; that in defiance of the laws\r\nof nations, they are every day trampling on the rights of the neutral\r\npowers, whenever they can thereby do the least injury, either to the\r\nother. But, as I view a peace between France and England the ensuing\r\nwinter to be certain, I have thought it would have been better for us to\r\nhave continued to bear from France through the present summer, what we\r\nhave been bearing both from her and England these four years, and still\r\ncontinue to bear from England, and to have required indemnification in\r\nthe hour of peace, when I verily believe it would have been yielded\r\nby both. This seems to be the plan of the other neutral nations; and\r\nwhether this, or the commencing war on one of them, as we have done,\r\nwould have been wisest, time and events must decide. But I am quite at\r\na loss on what ground the letter-writer can question the opinion, that\r\nFrance had no intention of making war on us, and was willing to treat\r\nwith Mr. Gerry, when we have this from Talleyrand’s letter, and from the\r\nwritten and verbal information of our Envoys. It is true then, that,\r\nas with England, we might of right have chosen either war or peace, and\r\nhave chosen peace, and prudently in my opinion, so with France, we might\r\nalso of right have chosen either peace or war, and we have chosen war.\r\nWhether the choice may be a popular one in the other States, I know not.\r\nHere it certainly is not; and I have no doubt the whole American people\r\nwill rally ere long to the same sentiment, and re-judge those, who, at\r\npresent, think they have all judgment in their own hands.\r\n\r\nThese observations will show you how far the imputations in the\r\nparagraph sent me approach the truth. Yet they are not intended for a\r\nnewspaper. At a very early period of my life, I determined never to\r\nput a sentence into any newspaper. I have religiously adhered to the\r\nresolution through my life, and have great reason to be contented with\r\nit. Were I to undertake to answer the calumnies of the newspapers, it\r\nwould be more than all my own time and that of twenty aids could effect.\r\nFor while I should be answering one, twenty new ones would be invented.\r\nI have thought it better to trust to the justice of my countrymen, that\r\nthey would judge me by what they see of my conduct on the stage where\r\nthey have placed me, and what they knew of me before the epoch, since\r\nwhich a particular party has supposed it might answer some view of\r\ntheirs to vilify me in the public eye. Some, I know, will not reflect\r\nhow apocryphal is the testimony of enemies so palpably betraying the\r\nviews with which they give it. But this is an injury to which duty\r\nrequires every one to submit whom the public think proper to call into\r\nits councils. I thank you, my dear Sir, for the interest you have for me\r\non this occasion. Though I have made up my mind not to suffer calumny\r\nto disturb my tranquillity, yet I retain all my sensibilities for the\r\napprobation of the good and just. That is, indeed, the chief consolation\r\nfor the hatred of so many, who, without the least personal knowledge,\r\nand on the sacred evidence of Porcupine and Fenno alone, cover me with\r\ntheir implacable hatred. The only return I will ever make them, will be\r\nto do them all the good I can, in spite of their teeth.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you that all your friends in this quarter\r\nare well, and to assure you of the sentiments of sincere esteem and\r\nrespect with which I am, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXL.--TO A. H. ROWAN, September 26, 1798\r\n\r\nTO A. H. ROWAN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 26, 1798.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nTo avoid the suspicions and curiosity of the post-office, which would\r\nhave been excited by seeing your name and mine on the back of a letter,\r\nI have delayed acknowledging the receipt of your favor of July last,\r\ntill an occasion to write to an inhabitant of Wilmington gives me an\r\nopportunity of putting my letter under cover to him. The system of alarm\r\nand jealousy which has been so powerfully played off in England, has\r\nbeen mimicked here, not entirely without success. The most long-sighted\r\npolitician could not, seven years ago, have imagined that the people of\r\nthis wide extended country could have been enveloped in such delusion,\r\nand made so much afraid of themselves and their own power, as to\r\nsurrender it spontaneously to those who are manoeuvring them into a\r\nform of government, the principal branches of which may be beyond their\r\ncontrol. The commerce of England, however, has spread its roots over\r\nthe whole face of our country. This is the real source of all the\r\nobliquities of the public mind: and I should have had doubts of the\r\nultimate term they might attain; but happily, the game, to be worth\r\nthe playing of those engaged in it, must flush them with money. The\r\nauthorized expenses of this year are beyond those of any year in the\r\nlate war for independence, and they are of a nature to beget great\r\nand constant expenses. The purse of the people is the real seat of\r\nsensibility. It is to be drawn upon largely, and they will then listen\r\nto truths which could not excite them through any other organ. In this\r\nState, however, the delusion has not prevailed. They are sufficiently on\r\ntheir guard to have justified the assurance, that should you choose it\r\nfor your asylum, the laws of the land, administered by upright judges,\r\nwould protect you from any exercise of power unauthorized by the\r\nconstitution of the United States. The _habeas corpus_ secures every man\r\nhere, alien or citizen, against every thing which is not law, whatever\r\nshape it may assume. Should this, or any other circumstance, draw your\r\nfootsteps this way, I shall be happy to be among those who may have\r\nan opportunity of testifying, by every attention in our power, the\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect which the circumstances of your history\r\nhave inspired, and which are peculiarly felt by, Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLI.--TO STEPHENS THOMPSON MASON, October 11, 1798\r\n\r\nTO STEPHENS THOMPSON MASON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, October 11, 1798.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for your favor of July the 6th, from Philadelphia.\r\nI did not immediately acknowledge it, because I knew you would have come\r\naway. The X. Y. Z. fever has considerably abated through the country, as\r\nI am informed, and the alien and sedition laws are working hard. I fancy\r\nthat some of the State legislatures will take strong ground on this\r\noccasion. For my own part, I consider those laws as merely an experiment\r\non the American mind, to see how far it will bear an avowed violation of\r\nthe constitution. If this goes down, we shall immediately see attempted\r\nanother act of Congress, declaring that the President shall continue in\r\noffice during life, reserving to another occasion the transfer of the\r\nsuccession to his heirs, and the establishment of the Senate for life.\r\nAt least, this may be the aim of the Oliverians, while Monk and the\r\nCavaliers (who are perhaps the strongest) may be playing their game\r\nfor the restoration of his Most Gracious Majesty George the Third.\r\nThat these things are in contemplation, I have no doubt; nor can I be\r\nconfident of their failure, after the dupery of which our countrymen\r\nhave shown themselves susceptible.\r\n\r\nYou promised to endeavor to send me some tenants. I am waiting for them,\r\nhaving broken up two excellent farms with twelve fields in them of forty\r\nacres each, some of which I have sowed with small grain. Tenants of\r\nany size may be accommodated with the number of fields suited to their\r\nforce. Only send me good people, and write me what they are. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLII.--TO JOHN TAYLOR, November 26, 1798\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 26, 1798,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nWe formerly had a debtor and creditor account of letters on farming: but\r\nthe high price of tobacco, which is likely to continue for some short\r\ntime, has tempted me to go entirely into that culture, and in the mean\r\ntime, my farming schemes are in abeyance, and my farming fields at nurse\r\nagainst the time of my resuming them. But I owe you a political letter.\r\nYet the infidelities of the post-office and the circumstances of\r\nthe times are against my writing fully and freely, whilst my own\r\ndispositions are as much against mysteries, innuendoes, and half\r\nconfidences. I know not which mortifies me most, that I should fear\r\nto write what I think, or my country bear such a state of things. Yet\r\nLyon’s judges, and a jury of all nations, are objects of national\r\nfear. We agree in all the essential ideas of your letter. We agree\r\nparticularly in the necessity of some reform, and of some better\r\nsecurity for civil liberty. But perhaps we do not see the existing\r\ncircumstances in the same point of view. There are many considerations\r\n_dehors_ of the State, which will occur to you without enumeration. I\r\nshould not apprehend them, if all was sound within. But there is a most\r\nrespectable part of our State who have been enveloped in the X. Y. Z.\r\ndelusion, and who destroy our unanimity for the present moment. This\r\ndisease of the imagination will pass over, because the patients are\r\nessentially republicans. Indeed, the Doctor is now on his way to cure\r\nit, in the guise of a tax-gatherer. But give time for the medicine\r\nto work, and for the repetition of stronger doses, which must be\r\nadministered. The principle of the present majority is excessive\r\nexpense, money enough to fill all their maws, or it will not be worth\r\nthe risk of their supporting. They cannot borrow a dollar in Europe, or\r\nabove two or three millions in America. This is not the fourth of the\r\nexpenses of this year, unprovided for. Paper money would be perilous\r\neven to the paper men. Nothing then but excessive taxation can get us\r\nalong: and this will carry reason and reflection to every man’s door,\r\nand particularly in the hour of election.\r\n\r\nI wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our\r\nconstitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the\r\nreduction of the administration of our government to the genuine\r\nprinciples of its constitution; I mean an additional article, taking\r\nfrom the federal government the power of borrowing. I now deny their\r\npower of making paper money or any thing else a legal tender. I know\r\nthat to pay all proper expenses within the year, would, in case of war,\r\nbe hard on us. But not so hard as ten wars instead of one. For wars\r\nwould be reduced in that proportion; besides that the State governments\r\nwould be free to lend their credit in borrowing quotas. For the present,\r\nI should be for resolving the alien and sedition laws to be against the\r\nconstitution and merely void, and for addressing the other States to\r\nobtain similar declarations; and I would not do any thing at this moment\r\nwhich should commit us further, but reserve ourselves to shape our\r\nfuture measures or no measures, by the events which may happen. It is a\r\nsingular phenomenon, that while our State governments are the very best\r\nin the world, without exception or comparison, our General Government\r\nhas, in the rapid course of nine or ten years, become more arbitrary,\r\nand has swallowed more of the public liberty, than even that of England.\r\nI enclose you a column, cut out of a London paper, to show you that the\r\nEnglish, though charmed with our making their enemies our enemies, yet\r\nblush and weep over our sedition-law. But I enclose you something\r\nmore important. It is a petition for a reformation in the manner of\r\nappointing our juries, and a remedy against the jury of all nations,\r\nwhich is handing about here for signature, and will be presented to your\r\nHouse. I know it will require but little ingenuity to make objections\r\nto the details of its execution; but do not be discouraged by small\r\ndifficulties; make it as perfect as you can at a first essay, and depend\r\non amending its defects as they develope themselves in practice. I hope\r\nit will meet with your approbation and patronage. It is the only thing\r\nwhich can yield us a little present protection against the dominion of\r\na faction, while circumstances are maturing for bringing and keeping the\r\ngovernment in real unison with the spirit of their constituents. I\r\nam aware that the act of Congress has directed that juries shall be\r\nappointed by lot or otherwise, as the laws now (at the date of the act)\r\nin force in the several States provide. The New England States have\r\nalways had them elected by their selectmen, who are elected by the\r\npeople. Several or most of the other States have a large number\r\nappointed (I do not know how) to attend, out of whom twelve for each\r\ncause are taken by lot. This provision of Congress will render it\r\nnecessary for our Senators or Delegates to apply for an amendatory law,\r\naccommodated to that prayed for in the petition. In the mean time, I\r\nwould pass the law as if the amendatory one existed, in reliance, that\r\nour select jurors attending, the federal judge will under a sense of\r\nright direct the juries to be taken from among them. If he does not,\r\nor if Congress refuses to pass the amendatory law, it will serve as\r\neye-water for their constituents. Health, happiness, safety, and esteem\r\nto yourself and my ever honored and ancient friend Mr. Pendleton. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 3, 1799\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 3, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have suffered the post hour to come so nearly on me, that I must\r\nhuddle over what I have more than appears in the public papers. I\r\narrived here on Christmas day, not a single bill or other article of\r\nbusiness having yet been brought into Senate. The President’s speech, so\r\nunlike himself in point of moderation, is supposed to have been written\r\nby the military conclave, and particularly Hamilton. When the Senate\r\ngratuitously hint Logan to him, you see him in his reply come out in his\r\ngenuine colors. The debates on that subject and Logan’s declaration you\r\nwill see in the papers. The republican spirit is supposed to be gaining\r\nground in this State and Massachusetts. The tax-gatherer has already\r\nexcited discontent. Gerry’s correspondence with Talleyrand, promised by\r\nthe President at the opening of the session, is still kept back. It is\r\nknown to show France in a very conciliatory attitude, and to contradict\r\nsome executive assertions. Therefore, it is supposed they will get\r\ntheir war measures well taken before they will produce this damper.\r\nVans Murray writes them, that the French government is sincere in their\r\novertures for reconciliation, and have agreed, if these fail, to admit\r\nthe mediation offered by the Dutch government.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox has become bankrupt for four hundred thousand dollars, and\r\nhas resigned his military commission. He took in General Lincoln for one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars, which breaks him. Colonel Jackson\r\nalso sunk with him. It seems generally admitted, that several cases of\r\nthe yellow fever still exist in the city, and the apprehension is, that\r\nit will re-appear early in the spring. You promised me a copy of McGee’s\r\nbill of prices. Be so good as to send it on to me here. Tell Mrs.\r\nMadison her friend Madame d’Yrujo is as well as one can be so near to\r\na formidable crisis. Present my friendly respects to her, and accept\r\nyourself my sincere and affectionate salutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP.S. I omitted to mention that a petition has been presented to the\r\nPresident, signed by several thousand persons in Vermont, praying a\r\nremitment of Lyon’s fine. He asked the bearer of the petition if Lyon\r\nhimself had petitioned, and being answered in the negative, said,\r\n‘Penitence must precede pardon.’ T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLIV.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 16, 1799\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 16, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe forgery lately attempted to be played off by Mr. H. on the House\r\nof Representatives, of a pretended memorial presented by Logan to the\r\nFrench government, has been so palpably exposed, as to have thrown\r\nridicule on the whole of the clamors they endeavored to raise as to that\r\ntransaction. Still, however, their majority will pass the bill. The\r\nreal views in the importance they have given to Logan’s enterprise\r\nare mistaken by nobody. Mr. Gerry’s communications relative to his\r\ntransactions after the departure of his colleagues, though he has now\r\nbeen returned five months, and they have been promised to the House six\r\nor seven weeks, are still kept back. In the mean time, the paper of this\r\nmorning promises them from the Paris papers. It is said, they leave\r\nnot a possibility to doubt the sincerity and the anxiety of the French\r\ngovernment to avoid the spectacle of a war with us. Notwithstanding\r\nthis is well understood, the army and a great addition to our navy are\r\nsteadily intended. A loan of five millions is opened at eight per cent.\r\ninterest!\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIn a society of members, between whom and yourself are great mutual\r\nesteem and respect, a most anxious desire is expressed that you would\r\npublish your debates of the convention. That these measures of the army,\r\nnavy, and direct-tax, will bring about a revolution of public sentiment\r\nis thought certain and that the constitution will then receive\r\na different explanation. Could those debates be ready to appear\r\ncritically, their effect would be decisive. I beg of you to turn this\r\nsubject in your mind. The arguments against it will be personal; those\r\nin favor of it moral; and something is required from you as a set-off\r\nagainst the sin of your retirement. Your favor of December the 29th came\r\nto hand January the 5th; seal sound. I pray you always to examine the\r\nseals of mine to you, and the strength of the impression. The suspicions\r\nagainst the government on this subject are strong. I wrote you\r\nJanuary the 5th. Accept for yourself and Mrs. Madison my affectionate\r\nsalutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLV.--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 26, 1799.\r\n\r\nMr Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of November the 12th was safely delivered to me by Mr.\r\nBinney; but not till December the 28th, as I arrived here only three\r\ndays before that date. It was received with great satisfaction. Our\r\nvery long intimacy as fellow-laborers in the same cause, the recent\r\nexpressions of mutual confidence which had preceded your mission, the\r\ninteresting course which that had taken, and particularly and personally\r\nas it regarded yourself, made me anxious to hear from you on your\r\nreturn. I was the more so too, as I had myself during the whole of your\r\nabsence, as well as since your return, been a constant butt for every\r\nshaft of calumny which malice and falsehood could form, and the presses,\r\npublic speakers, or private letters disseminate. One of these, too,\r\nwas of a nature to touch yourself; as if, wanting confidence in your\r\nefforts, I had been capable of usurping powers committed to you, and\r\nauthorizing negotiations private and collateral to yours. The real truth\r\nis, that though Doctor Logan, the pretended missionary, about four or\r\nfive days before he sailed for Hamburg, told me he was going there, and\r\nthence to Paris, and asked and received from me a certificate of\r\nhis citizenship, character, and circumstances of life, merely as\r\na protection, should he be molested on his journey in the present\r\nturbulent and suspicious state of Europe, yet I had been led to consider\r\nhis object as relative to his private affairs; and though, from an\r\nintimacy of some standing, he knew well my wishes for peace and my\r\npolitical sentiments in general, he nevertheless received then no\r\nparticular declaration of them, no authority to communicate them to any\r\nmortal, nor to speak to any one in my name, or in any body’s name, on\r\nthat, or any other subject whatever; nor did I write by him a scrip of\r\na pen to any person whatever. This he has himself honestly and publicly\r\ndeclared since his return; and from his well known character and every\r\nother circumstance, every candid man must perceive that his\r\nenterprise was dictated by his own enthusiasm, without consultation or\r\ncommunication with any one; that he acted in Paris on his own ground,\r\nand made his own way. Yet to give some color to his proceedings, which\r\nmight implicate the republicans in general, and myself particularly,\r\nthey have not been ashamed to bring forward a supposititious paper,\r\ndrawn by one of their own party in the name of Logan, and falsely\r\npretended to have been presented by him to the government of France;\r\ncounting that the bare mention of my name therein, would connect that in\r\nthe eye of the public with this transaction. In confutation of these\r\nand all future calumnies, by way of anticipation, I shall make to you a\r\nprofession of my political faith; in confidence that you will consider\r\nevery future imputation on me of a contrary complexion, as bearing on\r\nits front the mark of falsehood and calumny.\r\n\r\nI do then, with sincere zeal, wish an inviolable preservation of our\r\npresent federal constitution, according to the true sense in which\r\nit was adopted by the States, that in which it was advocated by its\r\nfriends, and not that which its enemies apprehended, who, therefore,\r\nbecame its enemies: and I am opposed to the monarchizing its features\r\nby the forms of its administration, with a view to conciliate a first\r\ntransition to a President and Senate for life, and from that to an\r\nhereditary tenure of these offices, and thus to worm out the elective\r\nprinciple. I am for preserving to the States the powers not yielded\r\nby them to the Union, and to the legislature of the Union its\r\nconstitutional share, in the division of powers; and I am not for\r\ntransferring all the powers of the States to the General Government,\r\nand all those of that government to the executive branch. I am for\r\na government rigorously frugal and simple, applying all the possible\r\nsavings of the public revenue to the discharge of the national debt:\r\nand not for a multiplication of officers and salaries merely to make\r\npartisans, and for increasing, by every device, the public debt, on the\r\nprinciple of its being a public blessing. I am for relying, for internal\r\ndefence, on our militia solely, till actual invasion, and for such\r\na naval force only as may protect our coasts and harbors from such\r\ndepredations as we have experienced: and not for a standing army in time\r\nof peace, which may overawe the public sentiment; nor for a navy, which,\r\nby its own expenses and the eternal wars in which it will implicate us,\r\nwill grind us with public burthens, and sink us under them. I am for\r\nfree commerce with all nations; political connection with none;\r\nand little or no diplomatic establishment. And I am not for linking\r\nourselves by new treaties with the quarrels of Europe; entering\r\nthat field of slaughter to preserve their balance, or joining in the\r\nconfederacy of kings to war against the principles of liberty. I am for\r\nfreedom of religion, and against all manoeuvres to bring about a legal\r\nascendency of one sect over another: for freedom of the press and\r\nagainst all violations of the constitution to silence by force and not\r\nby reason the complaints or criticisms, just or unjust, of our citizens\r\nagainst the conduct of their agents. And I am for encouraging the\r\nprogress of science in all its branches: and not for raising a hue and\r\ncry against the sacred name of philosophy; for awing the human mind by\r\nstories of raw-head and bloody-bones to a distrust of its own vision,\r\nand to repose implicitly on that of others; to go backwards instead of\r\nforwards to look for improvement; to believe that government, religion,\r\nmorality, and every other science were in the highest perfection in\r\nages of the darkest ignorance, and that nothing can ever be devised more\r\nperfect than what was established by our forefathers. To these I will\r\nadd, that I was a sincere well-wisher to the success of the French\r\nrevolution, and still wish it may end in the establishment of a free\r\nand well-ordered republic: but I have not been insensible under the\r\natrocious depredations they have committed on our commerce. The first\r\nobject of my heart is my own country. In that is embarked my family, my\r\nfortune, and my own existence. I have not one farthing of interest, nor\r\none fibre of attachment out of it, nor a single motive of preference\r\nof anyone nation to another, but in proportion as they are more or less\r\nfriendly to us. But though deeply feeling the injuries of France, I did\r\nnot think war the surest means of redressing them. I did believe, that\r\na mission, sincerely disposed to preserve peace, would obtain for us a\r\npeaceable and honorable settlement and retribution; and I appeal to you\r\nto say, whether this might not have been obtained, if either of your\r\ncolleagues had been of the same sentiment with yourself.\r\n\r\nThese, my friend, are my principles; they are unquestionably the\r\nprinciples of the great body of our fellow-citizens, and I know there is\r\nnot one of them which is not yours also. In truth, we never differed but\r\non one ground, the funding system; and as, from the moment of its being\r\nadopted by the constituted authorities, I became religiously principled\r\nin the sacred discharge of it to the uttermost farthing, we are united\r\nnow even on that single ground of difference.\r\n\r\nI turn now to your inquiries. The enclosed paper will answer one\r\nof them. But you also ask for such political information as may be\r\npossessed by me, and interesting to yourself in regard to your embassy.\r\nAs a proof of my entire confidence in you, I shall give it fully and\r\ncandidly. When Pinckney, Marshall, and Dana were nominated to settle\r\nour differences with France, it was suspected by many, from what was\r\nunderstood of their dispositions, that their mission would not result in\r\na settlement of differences; but would produce circumstances tending to\r\nwiden the breach, and to provoke our citizens to consent to a war\r\nwith that nation, and union with England. Dana’s resignation and your\r\nappointment gave the first gleam of hope of a peaceable issue to\r\nthe mission. For it was believed that you were sincerely disposed to\r\naccommodation: and it was not long after your arrival there, before\r\nsymptoms were observed of that difference of views which had been\r\nsuspected to exist. In the mean time, however, the aspect of our\r\ngovernment towards the French republic had become so ardent, that the\r\npeople of America generally took the alarm. To the southward, their\r\napprehensions were early excited. In the Eastern States also, they at\r\nlength began to break out. Meetings were held in many of your towns, and\r\naddresses to the government agreed on in opposition to war. The example\r\nwas spreading like a wild-fire. Other meetings were called in other\r\nplaces, and a general concurrence of sentiment against the apparent\r\ninclinations of the government was imminent; when, most critically for\r\nthe government, the despatches of October the 22nd, prepared by your\r\ncolleague Marshall, with a view to their being made public, dropped into\r\ntheir laps. It was truly a God-send to them, and they made the most of\r\nit. Many thousands of copies were printed and dispersed gratis, at the\r\npublic expense; and the zealots for war co-operated so heartily, that\r\nthere were instances of single individuals who printed and dispersed ten\r\nor twelve thousand copies at their own expense. The odiousness of\r\nthe corruption supposed in those papers excited a general and high\r\nindignation among the people. Unexperienced in such manoeuvres, they\r\ndid not permit themselves even to suspect that the turpitude of private\r\nswindlers might mingle itself unobserved, and give its own hue to the\r\ncommunications of the French government, of whose participation there\r\nwas neither proof nor probability. It served, however, for a time,\r\nthe purpose intended. The people, in many places, gave a loose to the\r\nexpressions of their warm indignation, and of their honest preference of\r\nwar to dishonor. The fever was long and successfully kept up, and in the\r\nmean time, war measures as ardently crowded. Still, however, as it\r\nwas known that your colleagues were coming away, and yourself to stay,\r\nthough disclaiming a separate power to conclude a treaty, it was\r\nhoped by the lovers of peace, that a project of treaty would have been\r\nprepared, ad referendum, on principles which would have satisfied our\r\ncitizens, and overawed any bias of the government towards a different\r\npolicy. But the expedition of the Sophia, and, as was supposed, the\r\nsuggestions of the person charged with your despatches, and his probable\r\nmisrepresentations of the real wishes of the American people, prevented\r\nthese hopes. They had then only to look forward to your return for such\r\ninformation, either through the executive, or from yourself, as might\r\npresent to our view the other side of the medal. The despatches of\r\nOctober 22nd, 1797, had presented one face. That information, to a\r\ncertain degree, is now received, and the public will see from your\r\ncorrespondence with Talleyrand, that France, as you testify, ‘was\r\nsincere and anxious to obtain a reconciliation, not wishing us to break\r\nthe British treaty, but only to give her equivalent stipulations; and in\r\ngeneral, was disposed to a liberal treaty.’ And they will judge whether\r\nMr. Pickering’s report shows an inflexible determination to believe no\r\ndeclarations the French government can make, nor any opinion which you,\r\njudging on the spot and from actual view, can give of their sincerity,\r\nand to meet their designs of peace with operations of war. The alien and\r\nsedition acts have already operated in the south as powerful sedatives\r\nof the X. Y. Z. inflammation. In your quarter, where violations of\r\nprinciple are either less regarded or more concealed, the direct tax is\r\nlikely to have the same effect, and to excite inquiries into the\r\nobject of the enormous expenses and taxes we are bringing on. And your\r\ninformation supervening, that we might have a liberal accommodation if\r\nwe would, there can be little doubt of the reproduction of that general\r\nmovement which had been changed, for a moment, by the despatches of\r\nOctober the 22nd. And though small checks and stops, like Logan’s\r\npretended embassy, may be thrown in the way, from time to time, and\r\nmay a little retard its motion, yet the tide is already turned and will\r\nsweep before it all the feeble obstacles of art. The unquestionable\r\nrepublicanism of the American mind will break through the mist under\r\nwhich it has been clouded, and will oblige its agents to reform the\r\nprinciples and practices of their administration.\r\n\r\nYou suppose, that you have been abused by both parties. As far as has\r\ncome to my knowledge, you are misinformed. I have never seen or heard a\r\nsentence of blame uttered against you by the republicans; unless we were\r\nso to construe their wishes that you had more boldly co-operated in a\r\nproject of a treaty, and would more explicitly state, whether there was\r\nin your colleagues that flexibility, which persons earnest after peace\r\nwould have practised. Whether, on the contrary, their demeanor was not\r\ncold, reserved, and distant, at least, if not backward; and whether, if\r\nthey had yielded to those informal conferences which Talleyrand seems to\r\nhave courted, the liberal accommodation you suppose, might not have been\r\neffected, even with their agency. Your fellow-citizens think they have a\r\nright to full information, in a case of such great concernment to them.\r\nIt is their sweat which is to earn all the expenses of the war, and\r\ntheir blood which is to flow in expiation of the causes of it. It may\r\nbe in your power to save them from these miseries by full communications\r\nand unrestrained details, postponing motives of delicacy to those of\r\nduty. It rests with you to come forward independently; to make your\r\nstand on the high ground of your own character; to disregard\r\ncalumny, and to be borne above it on the shoulders of your grateful\r\nfellow-citizens; or to sink into the humble oblivion to which the\r\nfederalists (self-called) have secretly condemned you; and even to be\r\nhappy if they will indulge you with oblivion, while they have beamed\r\non your colleagues meridian splendor. Pardon me, my dear Sir, if my\r\nexpressions are strong. My feelings are so much more so, that it is\r\nwith difficulty I reduce them even to the tone I use. If you doubt the\r\ndispositions towards you, look into the papers, on both sides, for the\r\ntoasts which were given throughout the States on the fourth of July.\r\nYou will there see whose hearts were with you, and whose were ulcerated\r\nagainst you. Indeed, as soon as it was known that you had consented to\r\nstay in Paris, there was no measure observed in the execrations of\r\nthe war-party. They openly wished you might be guillotined, or sent to\r\nCayenne, or any thing else. And these expressions were finally stifled\r\nfrom a principle of policy only, and to prevent you from being urged\r\nto a justification of yourself. From this principle alone proceed the\r\nsilence and cold respect they observe towards you. Still, they cannot\r\nprevent at times the flames bursting from under the embers, as Mr.\r\nPickering’s letters, report, and conversations testify, as well as the\r\nindecent expressions respecting you, indulged by some of them in the\r\ndebate on these despatches. These sufficiently show that you are never\r\nmore to be honored or trusted by them, and that they wait to crush you\r\nfor ever, only till they can do it without danger to themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I sat down to answer your letter, but two courses presented\r\nthemselves, either to say nothing or every thing; for half confidences\r\nare not in my character. I could not hesitate which was due to you. I\r\nhave unbosomed myself fully; and it will certainly be highly gratifying\r\nif I receive like confidence from you. For even if we differ in\r\nprinciple more than I believe we do, you and I know too well the texture\r\nof the human mind, and the slipperiness of human reason, to consider\r\ndifferences of opinion otherwise than differences of form or feature.\r\nIntegrity of views, more than their soundness, is the basis of esteem. I\r\nshall follow your direction in conveying this by a private hand; though\r\nI know not as yet when one worthy of confidence will occur. And my\r\ntrust in you leaves me without a fear that this letter, meant as a\r\nconfidential communication of my impressions, may ever go out of your\r\nown hand, or be suffered in any wise to commit my name. Indeed, besides\r\nthe accidents which might happen to it even under your care, considering\r\nthe accident of death to which you are liable, I think it safest to pray\r\nyou, after reading it as often as you please, to destroy at least the\r\nsecond and third leaves. The first contains principles only, which I\r\nfear not to avow; but the second and third contain facts stated for your\r\ninformation, and which, though sacredly conformable to my firm belief,\r\nyet would be galling to some, and expose me to illiberal attacks. I\r\ntherefore repeat my prayer to burn the second and third leaves. And did\r\nwe ever expect to see the day, when, breathing nothing but sentiments\r\nof love to our country and its freedom and happiness, our correspondence\r\nmust be as secret as if we were hatching its destruction? Adieu, my\r\nfriend, and accept my sincere and affectionate salutations. I need not\r\nadd my signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLVI.--TO EDMUND PENDLETON, January 29, 1799\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND PENDLETON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 29, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour patriarchal address to your country is running through all the\r\nrepublican papers, and has a very great effect on the people. It is\r\nshort, simple, and presents things in a view they readily comprehend.\r\nThe character and circumstances too of the writer leave them without\r\ndoubts of his motives. If, like the patriarch of old, you had but one\r\nblessing to give us, I should have wished it directed to a particular\r\nobject. But I hope you have one for this also. You know what a wicked\r\nuse has been made of the French negotiation; and particularly, the X. Y.\r\nZ. dish, cooked up by ------ , where the swindlers are made to appear as\r\nthe French government. Art and industry combined, have certainly wrought\r\nout of this business a wonderful effect on the people. Yet they have\r\nbeen astonished more than they have understood it, and now that Gerry’s\r\ncorrespondence comes out, clearing the French government of that\r\nturpitude, and showing them ‘sincere in their dispositions for peace,\r\nnot wishing us to break the British treaty, and willing to arrange a\r\nliberal one with us,’ the people will be disposed to suspect they have\r\nbeen duped. But these communications are too voluminous for them, and\r\nbeyond their reach. A recapitulation is now wanting of the whole story,\r\nstating every thing according to what we may now suppose to have been\r\nthe truth, short, simple, and levelled to every capacity. Nobody in\r\nAmerica can do it so well as yourself, in the same character of the\r\nfather of your country, or any form you like better, and so concise, as,\r\nomitting nothing material, may yet be printed in handbills, of which\r\nwe could print and disperse ten or twelve thousand copies under letter\r\ncovers, through all the United States, by the members of Congress when\r\nthey return home. If the understanding of the people could be rallied\r\nto the truth on this subject, by exposing the dupery practised on them,\r\nthere are so many other things about to bear on them favorably for\r\nthe resurrection of their republican spirit, that a reduction of the\r\nadministration to constitutional principles cannot fail to be the\r\neffect. These are the alien and sedition laws, the vexations of the\r\nstamp-act, the disgusting particularities of the direct tax, the\r\nadditional army without an enemy, and recruiting officers lounging at\r\nevery Court-House to decoy the laborer from his plough, a navy of fifty\r\nships, five millions to be raised to build it, on the usurious interest\r\nof eight per cent., the perseverance in war on our part, when the French\r\ngovernment shows such an anxious desire to keep at peace with us, taxes\r\noften millions now paid by four millions of people, and yet a necessity,\r\nin a year or two, of raising five millions more for annual expenses.\r\nThese things will immediately be bearing on the public mind, and if it\r\nremain not still blinded by a supposed necessity, for the purposes of\r\nmaintaining our independence and defending our country, they will set\r\nthings to rights. I hope you will undertake this statement. If any body\r\nelse had possessed your happy talent for this kind of recapitulation,\r\nI would have been the last to disturb you with the application; but it\r\nwill really be rendering our country a service greater than it is in\r\nthe power of any other individual to render. To save you the trouble of\r\nhunting the several documents from which this statement is to be taken,\r\nI have collected them here completely, and enclose them to you.\r\n\r\nLogan’s bill has passed. On this subject it is hardly necessary for me\r\nto declare to you, on every thing sacred, that the part they ascribed to\r\nme was entirely a calumny. Logan called on me, four or five days before\r\nhis departure, and asked and received a certificate (in my private\r\ncapacity) of his citizenship and circumstances of life, merely as a\r\nprotection, should he be molested in the present turbulent state of\r\nEurope. I have given such to an hundred others, and they have been much\r\nmore frequently asked and obtained by tories than whigs.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAccept my sincere prayers for long and happy years to you still, and my\r\naffectionate salutations and adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 5, 1799\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 5, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 30th of January; since which yours of the 25th\r\nhas been received.\r\n\r\n*********\r\n\r\nThe bill for continuing the suspension of intercourse with France and\r\nher dependencies, is still before the Senate, but will pass by a very\r\ngreat vote. An attack is made on what is called the Toussaint’s clause,\r\nthe object of which, as is charged by the one party and admitted by the\r\nother, is to facilitate the separation of the island from France.\r\nThe clause will pass, however, by about nineteen to eight, or perhaps\r\neighteen to nine. Rigaud, at the head of the people of color, maintains\r\nhis allegiance. But they are only twenty-five thousand souls, against\r\nfive hundred thousand, the number of the blacks. The treaty made with\r\nthem by Maitland is (if they are to be separated from France) the best\r\nthing for us. They must get their provisions from us. It will indeed be\r\nin English bottoms, so that we shall lose the carriage. But the English\r\nwill probably forbid them the ocean, confine them to their island, and\r\nthus prevent their becoming an American Algiers. It must be admitted,\r\ntoo, that they may play them off on us when they please. Against this\r\nthere is no remedy but timely measures on our part, to clear ourselves,\r\nby degrees, of the matter on which that lever can work.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nA piece published in Bache’s paper on foreign influence, has had the\r\ngreatest currency and effect. To an extraordinary first impression, they\r\nhave been obliged to make a second, and of an extraordinary number. It\r\nis such things as these the public want. They say so from all quarters,\r\nand that they wish to hear reason instead of disgusting blackguardism.\r\nThe public sentiment being now on the creen, and many heavy\r\ncircumstances about to fall into the republican scale, we are sensible\r\nthat this summer is the season for systematic energies and sacrifices.\r\nThe engine is the press. Every man must lay his purse and his pen under\r\ncontribution. As to the former, it is possible I may be obliged to\r\nassume something for you. As to the latter, let me pray and beseech you\r\nto set apart a certain portion of every post-day to write what may be\r\nproper for the public. Send it to me while here, and when I go away\r\nI will let you know to whom you may send, so that your name shall be\r\nsacredly secret. You can render such incalculable services in this way,\r\nas to lessen the effect of our loss of your presence here. I shall see\r\nyou on the 5th or 6th of March.\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations to Mrs. Madison and yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLVIII.--TO EDMUND PENDLETON, February 14, 1799\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND PENDLETON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 14, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you a petition on the 29th of January. I know the extent of this\r\ntrespass on your tranquillity, and how indiscreet it would have been\r\nunder any other circumstances. But the fate of this country, whether it\r\nshall be irretrievably plunged into a form of government rejected by the\r\nmakers of the constitution, or shall get back to the true principles\r\nof that instrument, depends on the turn which things may take within a\r\nshort period of time ensuing the present moment. The violations of\r\nthe constitution, propensities to war, to expense, and to a particular\r\nforeign connection, which we have lately seen, are becoming evident\r\nto the people, and are dispelling that mist which X. Y. Z. had spread\r\nbefore their eyes. This State is coming forward with a boldness not yet\r\nseen. Even the German counties of York and Lancaster, hitherto the most\r\ndevoted, have come about, and by petitions with four thousand signers\r\nremonstrate against the alien and sedition laws, standing armies, and\r\ndiscretionary powers in the President. New York and Jersey are\r\nalso getting into great agitation. In this State, we fear that the\r\nill-designing may produce insurrection. Nothing could be so fatal. Any\r\nthing like force would check the progress of the public opinion and\r\nrally them round the government. This is not the kind of opposition the\r\nAmerican people will permit. But keep away all show of force, and\r\nthey will bear down the evil propensities of the government, by the\r\nconstitutional means of election and petition. If we can keep quiet,\r\ntherefore, the tide now turning will take a steady and proper direction.\r\nEven in New Hampshire there are strong symptoms of a rising inquietude.\r\nIn this state of things, my dear Sir, it is more in your power than\r\nany other man’s in the United States, to give the coup de grace to\r\nthe ruinous principles and practices we have seen. In hopes you have\r\nconsented to it, I shall furnish to you some additional matter which has\r\narisen since my last.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a part of a speech of Mr. Gallatin on the naval bill. The\r\nviews he takes of our finances, and of the policy of our undertaking to\r\nestablish a great navy, may furnish some hints. I am told, something on\r\nthe same subject from Mr. J. Nicholas will appear in the Richmond and\r\nFredericksburg papers. I mention the real author, that you may respect\r\nit duly, for I presume it will be anonymous. The residue of Gallatin’s\r\nspeech shall follow when published. A recent fact proving the anxiety of\r\nFrance for a reconciliation with us, is the following. You know that one\r\nof the armed vessels which we took from her was refitted by us, sent to\r\ncruise against her, re-captured, and carried into Guadaloupe under the\r\nname of the Retaliation. ‘On the arrival there of Desfourneaux, the\r\nnew commissioner, he sent Victor Hughes home in irons; called up our\r\ncaptain; told him that he found he had a regular commission as an\r\nofficer of the United States; that his vessel was then lying in the\r\nharbor; that he should inquire into no fact preceding his own arrival\r\n(by this he avoided noticing that the vessel was really French\r\nproperty), and that, therefore, himself and crew were free to depart\r\nwith their vessel; that as to the differences between France and the\r\nUnited States, commissioners were coming out to settle them, and, in the\r\nmean time, no injury should be done on their part. The captain insisted\r\non being a prisoner; the other disclaimed; and so he arrived here with\r\nvessel and crew the day before yesterday. Within an hour after this\r\nwas known to the Senate, they passed the retaliation bill, of which\r\nI enclose you a copy. This was the more remarkable, as the bill was\r\nfounded expressly on the _Arrêt_ of October the 29th, which had been\r\ncommunicated by the President as soon as received, and he remarked,\r\n‘that it could not be too soon communicated to the two Houses and the\r\npublic’. Yet he almost in the same instant received, through the same\r\nchannel, Mr. King’s information that that _Arrêt_ was suspended, and\r\nthough he knew we were making it the foundation of a retaliation\r\nbill, he has never yet communicated it. But the Senate knew the fact\r\ninformally from the Secretary of State, and knowing it, passed the bill.\r\n\r\nThe President has appointed, and the Senate approved, Rufus King,\r\nto enter into a treaty of commerce with the Russians, at London,\r\nand William Smith (Phocion), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary, to go to Constantinople to make one with the Turks. So\r\nthat as soon as there is a coalition of Turks, Russians, and English,\r\nagainst France, we seize that moment to countenance it as openly as we\r\ndare, by treaties, which we never had with them before. All this helps\r\nto fill up the measure of provocation towards France, and to get from\r\nthem a declaration of war, which we are afraid to be the first in\r\nmaking. It is certain the French have behaved atrociously towards\r\nneutral nations, and us particularly; and though we might be disposed\r\nnot to charge them with all the enormities committed in their name in\r\nthe West Indies, yet they are to be blamed for not doing more to prevent\r\nthem. A just and rational censure ought to be expressed on them, while\r\nwe disapprove the constant billingsgate poured on them officially. It\r\nis at the same time true, that their enemies set the first example of\r\nviolating neutral rights, and continue it to this day: insomuch, that it\r\nis declared on all hands, and particularly by the insurance companies,\r\nand denied by none, that the British spoliations have considerably\r\nexceeded the French during the last six months. Yet not a word of these\r\nthings is said officially to the legislature.\r\n\r\nStill further, to give the devil his due (the French), it should be\r\nobserved that it has been said without contradiction, and the people\r\nmade to believe, that their refusal to receive our Envoys was contrary\r\nto the law of nations, and a sufficient cause of war: whereas every\r\none who ever read a book on the law of nations knows, that it is an\r\nunquestionable right in every power, to refuse to receive any minister\r\nwho is personally disagreeable. Martens, the latest and a very respected\r\nwriter, has laid it down so clearly and shortly in his ‘Summary of\r\nthe Law of Nations,’ B. 7. ch. 2. sect. 9. that I will transcribe the\r\npassage verbatim. ‘Section 9. Of choice in the person of the minister.\r\nThe choice of the person to be sent as minister depends of right on the\r\nsovereign who sends him, leaving the right, however, of him to whom he\r\nis sent, of refusing to acknowledge any one, to whom he has a personal\r\ndislike, or who is inadmissible by the laws and usages of the country.’\r\nAnd he adds notes proving by instances, &c. This is the whole section.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these appearances of peace from France, we are,\r\nbesides our existing army of five thousand men, and additional army\r\nof nine thousand (now officered and levying), passing a bill for\r\nan eventual army of thirty regiments (thirty thousand) and for\r\nrigimenting, brigading, officering, and exercising at the public\r\nexpense our volunteer army, the amount of which we know not. I enclose\r\nyou a copy of the bill, which has been twice read and committed in\r\nSenate. To meet this expense, and that of the six seventy-fours and six\r\neighteens, part of the proposed fleet, we have opened a loan of five\r\nmillions at eight per cent., and authorize another of two millions: and,\r\nat the same time, every man voting for these measures acknowledges\r\nthere is no probability of an invasion by France. While speaking of the\r\nrestoration of our vessel, I omitted to add, that it is said that our\r\ngovernment contemplate restoring the Frenchmen taken originally in the\r\nsame vessel, and kept at Lancaster as prisoners. This has furnished the\r\nidea of calling her a cartel vessel, and pretending that she came as\r\nsuch for an exchange of prisoners, which is false. She was delivered\r\nfree and without condition, but it does not suit to let any new evidence\r\nappear of the desire of conciliation in France.\r\n\r\nI believe it is now certain that the commissioners on the British debts\r\ncan proceed together no longer. I am told that our two have prepared a\r\nlong report, which will perhaps be made public. The result will be,\r\nthat we must recur again to negotiation, to settle the principles of the\r\nBritish claims. You know that Congress rises on the 3rd of March, and\r\nthat if you have acceded to my prayers, I should hear from you at\r\nleast a week before our rising. Accept my affectionate salutations, and\r\nassurances of the sincere esteem with which I am, Dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXLIX.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 19, 1799\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 19, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 11th; yesterday the bill for the eventual\r\narmy of thirty regiments (thirty thousand) and seventy-five thousand\r\nvolunteers, passed the Senate. By an amendment, the President was\r\nauthorized to use the volunteers for every purpose for which he can\r\nuse militia, so that the militia are rendered completely useless. The\r\nfriends of the bill acknowledge that the volunteers are a militia, and\r\nagreed that they might properly be called the ‘Presidential militia.’\r\nThey are not to go out of their State without their own consent.\r\nConsequently, all service out of the State is thrown on the\r\nconstitutional militia, the Presidential militia being exempted\r\nfrom doing duty with them. Leblane, an agent from Desfourneaux,\r\nof Guadaloupe, came in the Retaliation. You will see in the papers\r\nDesfourneaux’s letter to the President, which will correct some\r\nimmaterial circumstances of the statement in my last. You will see the\r\ntruth of the main fact, that the vessel and crew were liberated without\r\ncondition. Notwithstanding this, they have obliged Leblane to receive\r\nthe French prisoners, and to admit, in the papers, the terms, ‘in\r\nexchange for prisoners taken from us,’ he denying at the same time that\r\nthey consider them as prisoners, or had any idea of exchange. The object\r\nof his mission was not at all relative to that; but they choose to keep\r\nup the idea of a cartel, to prevent the transaction from being used\r\nas evidence of the sincerity of the French government towards a\r\nreconciliation. He came to assure us of a discontinuance of all\r\nirregularities in French privateers from Guadaloupe. He has been\r\nreceived very cavalierly. In the mean time, a Consul General is named to\r\nSt. Domingo: who may be considered as our Minister to Toussaint.\r\n\r\nBut the event of events was announced to the Senate yesterday. It is\r\nthis: it seems that soon after Gerry’s departure, overtures must have\r\nbeen made by Pichon, French _Chargé d’Affaires_ at the Hague, to\r\nMurray. They were so soon matured, that on the 28th of September,\r\n1798, Talleyrand writes to Pichon, approving what had been done, and\r\nparticularly of his having assured Murray that whatever Plenipotentiary\r\nthe government of the United States should send to France to end our\r\ndifferences, would undoubtedly be received with the respect due to the\r\nrepresentative of a free, independent, and powerful nation; declaring\r\nthat the President’s instructions to his Envoys at Paris, if they\r\ncontain the whole of the American government’s intentions, announce\r\ndispositions which have been always entertained by the Directory; and\r\ndesiring him to communicate these expressions to Murray, in order to\r\nconvince him of the sincerity of the French government, and to prevail\r\non him to transmit them to his government. This is dated September the\r\n28th, and may have been received by Pichon October the 1st; and nearly\r\nfive months elapse before it is communicated. Yesterday the President\r\nnominated to the Senate William Vans Murray Minister Plenipotentiary to\r\nthe French republic, and added, that he shall be instructed not to go\r\nto France, without direct and unequivocal assurances from the French\r\ngovernment that he shall be received in character, enjoy the due\r\nprivileges, and a minister of equal rank, title, and power, be appointed\r\nto discuss and conclude our controversy by a new treaty. This had\r\nevidently been kept secret from the federalists of both Houses, as\r\nappeared by their dismay. The Senate have passed over this day without\r\ntaking it up. It is said they are graveled and divided; some are for\r\nopposing, others do not know what to do. But in the mean time, they have\r\nbeen permitted to go on with all the measures of war and patronage, and\r\nwhen the close of the session is at hand it is made known. However,\r\nit silences all arguments against the sincerity of France, and renders\r\ndesperate every further effort towards war. I enclose you a paper with\r\nmore particulars. Be so good as to keep it till you see me, and then\r\nreturn it, as it is the copy of one I sent to another person, and is\r\nthe only copy I have. Since I began my letter I have received yours\r\nof February the 7th and 8th, with its enclosures; that referred to my\r\ndiscretion is precious, and shall be used accordingly.\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations to Mrs. Madison and yourself, and adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCL.--TO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO, February 21, 1799\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 21, 1799.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nOn politics I must write sparingly, lest it should fall into the hands\r\nof persons who do not love either you or me. The wonderful irritation\r\nproduced in the minds of our citizens by the X. Y. Z. story, has in a\r\ngreat measure subsided. They begin to suspect and to see it coolly in\r\nits true light. Mr. Gerry’s communications, with other information,\r\nprove to them that France is sincere in her wishes for reconciliation;\r\nand a recent proposition from that country, through Mr. Murray, puts the\r\nmatter out of doubt. What course the government will pursue, I know not.\r\nBut if we are left in peace, I have no doubt the wonderful turn in the\r\npublic opinion now manifestly taking place and rapidly increasing, will,\r\nin the course of this summer, become so universal and so weighty, that\r\nfriendship abroad and freedom at home will be firmly established by the\r\ninfluence and constitutional powers of the people at large. If we are\r\nforced into war, we must give up political differences of opinion, and\r\nunite as one man to defend our country. But whether at the close of such\r\na war, we should be as free as we are now, God knows. In fine, if war\r\ntakes place, republicanism has every thing to fear; if peace, be assured\r\nthat your forebodings and my alarms will prove vain; and that the spirit\r\nof our citizens now rising as rapidly as it was then running crazy, and\r\nrising with a strength and majesty which show the loveliness of freedom,\r\nwill make this government in practice, what it is in principle, a model\r\nfor the protection of man in a state of freedom and order. May Heaven\r\nhave in store for your country a restoration of these blessings, and you\r\nbe destined as the instrument it will use for that purpose. But if this\r\nbe forbidden by fate, I hope we shall be able to preserve here an asylum\r\nwhere your love of liberty and disinterested patriotism will be for\r\never protected and honored, and where you will find in the hearts of the\r\nAmerican people, a good portion of that esteem and affection which glow\r\nin the bosom of the friend who writes this; and who with sincere prayers\r\nfor your health, happiness, and success, and cordial salutations, bids\r\nyou, for this time, adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLI.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 26, 1799\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 26, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 19th; it acknowledged yours of the 8th. In\r\nmine I informed you of the nomination of Murray. There is evidence that\r\nthe letter of Talleyrand was known to one of the Secretaries, therefore\r\nprobably to all; the nomination, however, is declared by one of them to\r\nhave been kept secret from them all. He added, that he was glad of it,\r\nas, had they been consulted, the advice would have been against making\r\nthe nomination. To the rest of the party, however, the whole was a\r\nsecret till the nomination was announced. Never did a party show a\r\nstronger mortification, and consequently, that war had been their\r\nobject. Dana declared in debate (as I have from those who were present)\r\nthat we had done every thing which might provoke France to war; that we\r\nhad given her insults which no nation ought to have borne; and yet she\r\nwould not declare war. The conjecture as to the executive is, that they\r\nreceived Talleyrand’s letter before or about the meeting of Congress:\r\nthat not meaning to meet the overture effectually, they kept it secret,\r\nand let all the war measures go on; but that just before the separation\r\nof the Senate, the President, not thinking he could justify the\r\nconcealing such an overture, nor indeed that it could be concealed, made\r\na nomination, hoping that his friends in the Senate would take on their\r\nown shoulders the odium of rejecting it; but they did not choose it.\r\nThe Hamiltonians would not, and the others could not, alone. The\r\nwhole artillery of the phalanx, therefore, was played secretly on the\r\nPresident, and he was obliged himself to take a step which should parry\r\nthe overture while it wears the face of acceding to it. (Mark that I\r\nstate this as conjecture; but founded on workings and indications which\r\nhave been under our eyes.) Yesterday, therefore, he sent in a nomination\r\nof Oliver Ellsworth, Patrick Henry, and William Vans Murray, Envoys\r\nExtraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the French Republic, but\r\ndeclaring the two former should not leave this country till they\r\nshould receive from the French Directory assurances that they should be\r\nreceived with the respect due by the law of nations to their character,\r\n&c. This, if not impossible, must at least keep off the day, so hateful\r\nand so fatal to them, of reconciliation, and leave more time for new\r\nprojects of provocation. Yesterday witnessed a scandalous scene in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. It was the day for taking up the report of\r\ntheir committee against the alien and sedition laws, &.c. They held a\r\ncaucus and determined that not a word should be spoken on their side, in\r\nanswer to any thing which should be said on the other. Gallatin took up\r\nthe alien, and Nicholas the sedition law; but after a little while of\r\ncommon silence, they began to enter into loud conversations, laugh,\r\ncough, &c., so that for the last hour of these gentlemen’s speaking,\r\nthey must have had the lungs of a vendue-master to have been heard.\r\nLivingston, however, attempted to speak. But after a few sentences, the\r\nspeaker called him to order, and told him what he was saying was not to\r\nthe question. It was impossible to proceed. The question was taken\r\nand carried in favor of the report, fifty-two to forty-eight; the real\r\nstrength of the two parties is fifty-six to fifty. But two of the\r\nlatter have not attended this session. I send you the report of their\r\ncommittee. I still expect to leave this on the 1st, and be with you on\r\nthe 7th of March. But it is possible I may not set out till the 4th, and\r\nthen shall not be with you till the 10th. Affectionately adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLII.--TO T. LOMAX, March 12, 1799\r\n\r\nTO T. LOMAX.\r\n\r\nMonticello, March 12, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour welcome favor of last month came to my hands in Philadelphia. So\r\nlong a time has elapsed since we have been separated by events, that\r\nit was like a letter from the dead, and recalled to my memory very dear\r\nrecollections. My subsequent journey through life has offered nothing\r\nwhich, in comparison with those, is not cheerless and dreary. It is a\r\nrich comfort sometimes to look back on them.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of enclosing a letter to Mr. Baylor, open, because\r\nI solicit your perusal of it. It will, at the same time, furnish the\r\napology for my not answering you from Philadelphia. You ask for any\r\ncommunication I may be able to make, which may administer comfort to\r\nyou. I can give that which is solid. The spirit of 1776 is not dead.\r\nIt has only been slumbering. The body of the American people is\r\nsubstantially republican. But their virtuous feelings have been played\r\non by some fact with more fiction; they have been the dupes of artful\r\nmanoeuvres, and made for a moment to be willing instruments in forging\r\nchains for themselves. But time and truth have dissipated the delusion,\r\nand opened their eyes. They see now that France has sincerely wished\r\npeace, and their seducers have wished war, as well for the loaves and\r\nfishes which arise out of war expenses, as for the chance of changing\r\nthe constitution, while the people should have time to contemplate\r\nnothing but the levies of men and money. Pennsylvania, Jersey, and\r\nNew York are coming majestically round to the true principles. In\r\nPennsylvania, thirteen out of twenty-two counties had already petitioned\r\non the alien and sedition laws. Jersey and New York had begun the same\r\nmovement, and though the rising of Congress stops that channel for the\r\nexpression of their sentiment, the sentiment is going on rapidly, and\r\nbefore their next meeting those three States will be solidly embodied\r\nin sentiment with the six southern and western ones. The atrocious\r\nproceedings of France towards this country had well nigh destroyed its\r\nliberties. The Anglomen and monocrats had so artfully confounded the\r\ncause of France with that of freedom, that both went down in the same\r\nscale. I sincerely join you in abjuring all political connection with\r\nevery foreign power: and though I cordially wish well to the progress\r\nof liberty in all nations, and would for ever give it the weight of our\r\ncountenance, yet they are not to be touched without contamination, from\r\ntheir other bad principles. Commerce with all nations, alliance with\r\nnone, should be our motto.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of the constant and unaltered affection of, Dear Sir,\r\nyour sincere friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLIII.--TO EDMUND RANDOLPH, August 18, 1799\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 18, 1799\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received only two days ago your favor of the 12th, and as it was on\r\nthe eve of the return of our post, it was not possible to make so prompt\r\na despatch of the answer. Of all the doctrines which have ever been\r\nbroached by the federal government, the novel one, of the common law\r\nbeing in force and cognizable as an existing law in their courts, is to\r\nme the most formidable. All their other assumptions of ungiven powers\r\nhave been in the detail. The bank-law, the treaty-doctrine, the\r\nsedition-act, alien-act, the undertaking to change the State laws of\r\nevidence in the State courts by certain parts of the stamp-act, &c. &c.\r\nhave been solitary, inconsequential, timid things, in comparison with\r\nthe audacious, barefaced, and sweeping pretension to a system of law\r\nfor the United States, without the adoption of their legislature, and\r\nso infinitely beyond their power to adopt. If this assumption be yielded\r\nto, the State courts may be shut up, as there will then be nothing to\r\nhinder citizens of the same State suing each other in the federal courts\r\nin every case, as on a bond for instance, because the common law obliges\r\npayment of it, and the common law they say is their law. I am happy you\r\nhave taken up the subject; and I have carefully perused and considered\r\nthe notes you enclosed, and find but a single paragraph which I do not\r\napprove. It is that wherein (page 2) you say, that laws being emanations\r\nfrom the legislative department, and, when once enacted, continuing\r\nin force from a presumption that their will so continues, that that\r\npresumption fails, and the laws of course fall, on the destruction of\r\nthat legislative department. I do not think this is the true bottom on\r\nwhich laws and the administering them rest. The whole body of the nation\r\nis the sovereign legislative, judiciary, and executive power for itself.\r\nThe inconvenience of meeting to exercise these powers in person, and\r\ntheir inaptitude to exercise them, induce them to appoint special organs\r\nto declare their legislative will, to judge, and to execute it. It is\r\nthe will of the nation which makes the law obligatory; it is their will\r\nwhich creates or annihilates the organ which is to declare and\r\nannounce it. They may do it by a single person, as an Emperor of Russia\r\n(constituting his declarations evidence of their will), or by a few\r\npersons, as the aristocracy of Venice, or by a complication of councils,\r\nas in our former regal government, or our present republican one. The\r\nlaw being law because it is the will of the nation, is not changed by\r\ntheir changing the organ through which they choose to announce their\r\nfuture will; no more than the acts I have done by one attorney lose\r\ntheir obligation by my changing or discontinuing that attorney. This\r\ndoctrine has been, in a certain degree, sanctioned by the federal\r\nexecutive. For it is precisely that on which the continuance of\r\nobligation from our treaty with France was established, and the doctrine\r\nwas particularly developed in a letter to Gouverneur Morris, written\r\nwith the approbation of President Washington and his cabinet. Mercer\r\nonce prevailed on the Virginia Assembly to declare a different doctrine\r\nin some resolutions. These met universal disapprobation in this, as well\r\nas the other States, and if I mistake not, a subsequent Assembly\r\ndid something to do away the authority of their former unguarded\r\nresolutions. In this case, as in all others, the true principle will\r\nbe quite as effectual to establish the just deductions. Before the\r\nrevolution, the nation of Virginia had, by the organs they then thought\r\nproper to constitute, established a system of laws, which they divided\r\ninto three denominations of, 1. common law; 2. statute law; 3. chancery:\r\nor if you please, into two only, of 1. common law; 2. chancery. When\r\nby the Declaration of Independence, they chose to abolish their former\r\norgans of declaring their will, the acts of will already formally and\r\nconstitutionally declared, remained untouched. For the nation was not\r\ndissolved, was not annihilated; its will, therefore, remained in full\r\nvigor: and on the establishing the new organs, first of a convention,\r\nand afterwards a more complicated legislature, the old acts of national\r\nwill continued in force, until the nation should, by its new organs,\r\ndeclare its will changed. The common law, therefore, which was not\r\nin force when we landed here, nor till we had formed ourselves into a\r\nnation, and had manifested by the organs we constituted that the common\r\nlaw was to be our law, continued to be our law; because the nation\r\ncontinued in being, and because, though it changed the organs for\r\nthe future declarations of its will, yet it did not change its former\r\ndeclarations that the common law was its law. Apply these principles to\r\nthe present case. Before the revolution there existed no such nation\r\nas the United States: they then first associated as a nation, but for\r\nspecial purposes only. They had all their laws to make, as Virginia had\r\non her first establishment as a nation. But they did not, as Virginia\r\nhad done, proceed to adopt a whole system of laws ready made to their\r\nhand. As their association as a nation was only for special purposes,\r\nto wit, for the management of their concerns with one another and with\r\nforeign nations, and the States composing the association chose to give\r\nit powers for those purposes and no others, they could not adopt any\r\ngeneral system, because it would have embraced objects on which this\r\nassociation had no right to form or declare a will. It was not the organ\r\nfor declaring a national will in these cases. In the cases confided to\r\nthem, they were free to declare the will of the nation, the law, but\r\ntill it was declared there could be no law. So that the common law did\r\nnot become, _ipso facto_, law on the new association; it could\r\nonly become so by a positive adoption, and so far only as they were\r\nauthorized to adopt.\r\n\r\nI think it will be of great importance, when you come to the proper\r\npart, to portray at full length the consequences of this new doctrine,\r\nthat the common law is the law of the United States and that their\r\ncourts have, of course, jurisdiction co-extensive with that law, that is\r\nto say, general over all cases and persons. But great heavens! Who could\r\nhave conceived in 1789, that within ten years we should have to combat\r\nsuch windmills. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLIV.--TO WILSON C. NICHOLAS, September 5, 1799\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 5, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of August the 30th came duly to hand. It was with great regret\r\nwe gave up the hope of seeing you here, but, could not but consider the\r\nobstacle as legitimate. I had written to Mr. Madison, as I had before\r\ninformed you, and had stated to him some general ideas for consideration\r\nand consultation when we should meet. I thought something essentially\r\nnecessary to be said, in order to avoid the inference of acquiescence;\r\nthat a resolution or declaration should be passed, 1. answering the\r\nreasonings of such of the States as have ventured into the field of\r\nreason, and that of the committee of Congress, taking some notice, too,\r\nof those States who have either not answered at all, or answered\r\nwithout reasoning. 2. Making firm protestation against the precedent and\r\nprinciple, and reserving the right to make this palpable violation of\r\nthe federal compact the ground of doing in future whatever we might now\r\nrightfully do, should repetitions of these and other violations of\r\nthe compact render it expedient. 3. Expressing in affectionate and\r\nconciliatory language our warm attachment to union with our sister\r\nStates, and to the instrument and principles by which we are united;\r\nthat we are willing to sacrifice to this every thing but the rights of\r\nself-government in those important points which we have never yielded,\r\nand in which alone we see liberty, safety, and happiness; that not at\r\nall disposed to make every measure of error or of wrong, a cause of\r\nscission, we are willing to look on with indulgence, and to wait with\r\npatience, till those passions and delusions shall have passed over,\r\nwhich the federal government have artfully excited to cover its own\r\nabuses and conceal its designs, fully confident that the good sense of\r\nthe American people, and their attachment to those very rights which we\r\nare now vindicating, will, before it shall be too late, rally with us\r\nround the true principles of our federal compact. This was only meant to\r\ngive a general idea of the complexion and topics of such an instrument.\r\nMr. M. who came, as had been proposed, does not concur in the\r\nreservation proposed above; and from this I recede readily, not only\r\nin deference to his judgment, but because, as we should never think of\r\nseparation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they\r\noccur, will be cause enough of themselves.\r\n\r\nTo these topics, however, should be added animadversions on the new\r\npretensions to a common law of the United States. I proposed to Mr.\r\nM. to write to you but he observed that you knew his sentiments so\r\nperfectly from a former conference, that it was unnecessary. As to the\r\npreparing any thing, I must decline it, to avoid suspicions (which were\r\npretty strong in some quarters on the late occasion), and because there\r\nremains still (after their late loss) a mass of talents in Kentucky\r\nsufficient for every purpose. The only object of the present\r\ncommunication is to procure a concert in the general plan of action, as\r\nit is extremely desirable that Virginia and Kentucky should pursue the\r\nsame track on this occasion. Besides, how could you better while away\r\nthe road from hence to Kentucky, than in meditating this very subject\r\nand preparing something yourself, than whom nobody will do it better.\r\nThe loss of your brother, and the visit of the apostle ------ to\r\nKentucky, excite anxiety. However, we doubt not that his poisons will\r\nbe effectually counterworked. Wishing you a pleasant journey and happy\r\nreturn, I am with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLV.--TO JAMES MADISON, November 22, 1799\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, November 22, 1799.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have never answered your letter by Mr. Polk, because I expected to\r\nhave paid you a visit. This has been prevented by various causes, till\r\nyesterday. That being the day fixed for the departure of my daughter\r\nEppes, my horses were ready for me to have set out to see you: an\r\naccident postponed her departure to this day, and my visit also. But\r\nColonel Monroe dined with me yesterday, and on my asking his commands\r\nfor you, he entered into the subject of the visit and dissuaded it\r\nentirely, founding the motives on the espionage of the little ------in\r\n------ who would make it a subject of some political slander, and\r\nperhaps of some political injury. I have yielded to his representations,\r\nand therefore shall not have the pleasure of seeing you till my return\r\nfrom Philadelphia. I regret it sincerely, not only on motives of\r\nattention but of affairs. Some late circumstances changing considerably\r\nthe aspect of our situation, must affect the line of conduct to be\r\nobserved. I regret it the more too, because from the commencement of\r\nthe ensuing session, I shall trust the post-offices with nothing\r\nconfidential, persuaded that during the ensuing twelve months they will\r\nlend their inquisitorial aid to furnish matter for newspapers. I shall\r\nsend you as usual printed communications, without saying any thing\r\nconfidential on them. You will of course understand the cause.\r\n\r\nIn your new station let me recommend to you the jury system: as also\r\nthe restoration of juries in the court of chancery, which a law not\r\nlong since repealed, because ‘the trial by jury is troublesome and\r\nexpensive.’ If the reason be good, they should abolish it at common law\r\nalso. If Peter Carr is elected in the room of ------ he will undertake\r\nthe proposing this business, and only need your support. If he is not\r\nelected, I hope you will get it done otherwise. My best respects to Mrs.\r\nMadison, and affectionate salutations to yourself.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLVI.--TO COLONEL MONROE, January 12, 1800\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, January 12, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours of January the 4th was received last night. I had then no\r\nopportunity of communicating to you confidentially information of the\r\nstate of opinions here; but I learn to-night that two Mr. Randolphs will\r\nset out to-morrow morning for Richmond. If I can get this into their\r\nhands I shall send it; otherwise it may wait longer. On the subject of\r\nan election by a general ticket or by districts, most persons here seem\r\nto have made up their minds. All agree that an election by districts\r\nwrould be best, if it could be general: but while ten States choose\r\neither by their legislatures or by a general ticket, it is folly and\r\nworse than folly for the other six not to do it. In these ten States the\r\nminority is certainly unrepresented; and their majorities not only have\r\nthe weight of their whole State in their scale, but have the benefit of\r\nso much of our minorities as can succeed at a district election.\r\nThis is, in fact, insuring to our minorities the appointment of the\r\ngovernment. To state it in another form; it is merely a question,\r\nwhether we will divide the United States into sixteen or one hundred\r\nand thirty-seven districts. The latter being more chequered, and\r\nrepresenting the people in smaller sections, would be more likely to\r\nbe an exact representation of their diversified sentiments. But a\r\nrepresentation of a part by great, and a part by small sections, would\r\ngive a result very different from what would be the sentiment of the\r\nwhole people of the United States, were they assembled together. I have\r\nto-day had a conversation with ------ who has taken a flying trip here\r\nfrom New York. He says, they have really now a majority of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, but, for want of some skilful person to rally round,\r\nthey are disjointed, and will lose every question. In the senate there\r\nis a majority of eight or nine against us. But in the new election which\r\nis to come on in April, three or four in the Senate will be changed in\r\nour favor; and in the House of Representatives the county elections will\r\nstill be better than the last: but still all will depend on the city\r\nelection, which is of twelve members. At present there would be no doubt\r\nof our carrying our ticket there; nor does there seem to be time for any\r\nevents arising to change that disposition. There is therefore the best\r\nprospect possible of a great and decided majority on a joint vote of\r\nthe two Houses. They are so confident of this, that the republican party\r\nthere will not consent to elect either by districts or a general ticket.\r\nThey choose to do it by their legislature. I am told the republicans\r\nof New Jersey are equally confident, and equally anxious against an\r\nelection either by districts or a general ticket. The contest in this\r\nState will end in a separation of the present legislature without\r\npassing any election law (and their former one has expired), and in\r\ndepending on the new one, which will be elected October the 14th,\r\nin which the republican majority will be more decided in the\r\nRepresentatives, and instead of a majority of five against us in the\r\nSenate, will be of one for us. They will, from the necessity of the\r\ncase, choose the electors themselves. Perhaps it will be thought I ought\r\nin delicacy to be silent on this subject. But you, who know me, know\r\nthat my private gratifications would be most indulged by that issue,\r\nwhich should leave me most at home. If any thing supersedes this\r\npropensity, it is merely the desire to see this government brought back\r\nto its republican principles. Consider this as written to Mr. Madison as\r\nmuch as yourself and communicate it, if you think it will do any good\r\nto those possessing our joint confidence or any others where it may be\r\nuseful and safe. Health and affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLVII.--TO SAMUEL ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 26,1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMr. Erving delivered me your favor of January the 31st, and I thank\r\nyou for making me acquainted with him. You will always do me a favor\r\nin giving me an opportunity of knowing gentlemen as estimable in their\r\nprinciples and talents, as I find Mr. Erving to be. I have not yet seen\r\nMr. Winthrop. A letter from you, my respectable friend, after three and\r\ntwenty years of separation, has given me a pleasure I cannot express. It\r\nrecalls to my mind the anxious days we then passed in struggling for the\r\ncause of mankind. Your principles have been tested in the crucible of\r\ntime, and have come out pure. You have proved that it was monarchy, and\r\nnot merely British monarchy, you opposed. A government by representees,\r\nelected by the people at short periods, was our object, and our maxim at\r\nthat day was, ‘Where annual election ends, tyranny begins’; nor have our\r\ndepartures from it been sanctioned by the happiness of their effects.\r\nA debt of an hundred millions growing by usurious interest, and an\r\nartificial paper phalanx overruling the agricultural mass of our\r\ncountry, with other et ceteras, have a portentous aspect.\r\n\r\nI fear our friends on the other side the water, laboring in the same\r\ncause, have yet a great deal of crime and of misery to wade through. My\r\nconfidence had been placed in the head, not in the heart of Bonaparte.\r\nI hoped he would calculate truly the difference between the fame of a\r\nWashington and a Cromwell. Whatever his views may be, he has at least\r\ntransferred the destinies of the republic from the civil to the military\r\narm. Some will use this as a lesson against the practicability of\r\nrepublican government. I read it as a lesson against the danger of\r\nstanding armies. Adieu, my ever respected and venerable friend. May that\r\nkind overruling Providence which has so long spared you to our\r\ncountry, still foster your remaining years with whatever may make them\r\ncomfortable to yourself and soothing to your friends. Accept the cordial\r\nsalutations of your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLVIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 4, 1800\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 4, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have never written to you since my arrival here, for reasons which\r\nwere explained. Yours of December the 29th, January the 4th, 9th, 12th,\r\n18th, and February the 14th, have therefore remained unacknowledged.\r\nI have at different times enclosed to you such papers as seemed\r\ninteresting. To-day I forward Bingham’s amendment to the election bill\r\nformerly enclosed to you, Mr. Pinckney’s proposed amendment to the\r\nconstitution, and the report of the Ways and Means. Bingham’s amendment\r\nwas lost by the usual majority of two to one. A very different one will\r\nbe proposed, containing the true sense of the minority, viz. that\r\nthe two Houses, voting by heads, shall decide such questions as the\r\nconstitution authorizes to be raised. This may probably be taken up in\r\nthe other House under better auspices, for though the federalists have\r\na great majority there, yet they are of a more moderate temper than for\r\nsome time past. The Senate, however, seem determined to yield to nothing\r\nwhich shall give the other House greater weight in the decision on\r\nelections than they have.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney’s motion has been supported, and is likely to have some\r\nvotes which were not expected. I rather believe he will withdraw it, and\r\npropose the same thing in the form of a bill; it being the opinion of\r\nsome that such a regulation is not against the present constitution. In\r\nthis form it will stand a better chance to pass, as a majority only\r\nin both Houses will be necessary. By putting off the building the\r\nseventy-fours and stopping enlistments, the loan will be reduced to\r\nthree and a half millions. But I think it cannot be obtained. For though\r\nno new bankruptcies have happened here for some weeks, or in New York,\r\nyet they continue to happen in Baltimore, and the whole commercial race\r\nare lying on their oars, and gathering in their affairs, not knowing\r\nwhat new failures may put their resources to the proof. In this state of\r\nthings they cannot lend money. Some foreigners have taken asylum among\r\nus, with a good deal of money, who may perhaps choose that deposite.\r\nRobbins’s affair has been under agitation for some days. Livingston made\r\nan able speech of two and a half hours yesterday. The advocates of the\r\nmeasure feel it pressure heavily; and though they may be able to repel\r\nLivingston’s motion of censure, I do not believe they can carry Bayard’s\r\nof approbation. The landing of our Envoys at Lisbon will risk a very\r\ndangerous consequence, insomuch as the news of Truxton’s aggression will\r\nperhaps arrive at Paris before our commissioners will. Had they gone\r\ndirectly there, they might have been two months ahead of that news. We\r\nare entirely without further information from Paris. By letters from\r\nBordeaux, of December the 7th, tobacco was then from twenty-five to\r\ntwenty-seven dollars per hundred. Yet did Marshall maintain on the\r\nnon-intercourse bill, that its price at other markets had never been\r\naffected by that law. While the navigating and provision States, who are\r\nthe majority, can keep open all the markets, or at least sufficient\r\nones for their objects, the cries of the tobacco-makers, who are the\r\nminority, and not at all in favor, will hardly be listened to. It is\r\ntruly the fable of the monkey pulling the nuts out of the fire with the\r\ncat’s paw; and it shows that G. Mason’s proposition in the convention\r\nwas wise, that on laws regulating commerce, two thirds of the votes\r\nshould be requisite to pass them. However, it would have been trampled\r\nunder foot by a triumphant majority.\r\n\r\nMarch 8. My letter has lain by me till now, waiting Mr. Trist’s\r\ndeparture. The question has been decided to-day on Livingston’s\r\nmotion respecting Robbins; thirty-five for it, about sixty against it.\r\nLivingston, Nicholas, and Gallatin distinguished themselves on one side,\r\nand J. Marshall greatly on the other. Still it is believed they will not\r\npush Bayard’s motion of approbation. We have this day also decided in:\r\nSenate on the motion for overhauling the editor of the Aurora. It was\r\ncarried, as usual, by about two to one; H. Marshall voting of course\r\nwith them, as did, and frequently does ------: of ------ , who is\r\nperfectly at market. It happens that the other party are so strong, that\r\nthey do not think either him or ------ worth buying. As the conveyance\r\nis confidential, I can say something on a subject which, to those who do\r\nnot know my real dispositions respecting it, might seem indelicate. The\r\nfederalists begin to be very seriously alarmed about their election next\r\nfall. Their speeches in private, as well as their public and private\r\ndemeanor to me, indicate it strongly. This seems to be the prospect.\r\nKeep out Pennsylvania, Jersey, and New York, and the rest of the States\r\nare about equally divided; and in this estimate it is supposed that\r\nNorth Carolina and Maryland added together are equally divided. Then the\r\nevent depends on the three middle States before mentioned. As to them,\r\nPennsylvania passes no law for an election at the present session.\r\nThey confide that the next election gives a decided majority in the two\r\nhouses when joined together.\r\n\r\nMcKean, therefore, intends to call the legislature to meet immediately\r\nafter the new election, to appoint electors themselves. Still you will\r\nbe sensible there may arise a difficulty between the two Houses about\r\nvoting by heads or by Houses. The republican members here from Jersey\r\nare entirely confident that their two Houses, joined together, have a\r\nmajority of republicans; their Council being republican by six or eight\r\nvotes, and the lower House federal by only one or two; and they have no\r\ndoubt the approaching election will be in favor of the republicans.\r\nThey appoint electors by the two Houses voting together. In New York all\r\ndepends on the success of the city election, which is of twelve members,\r\nand of course makes a difference of twenty-four, which is sufficient to\r\nmake the two Houses, joined together, republican in their vote. Governor\r\nClinton, General Gates, and some other old revolutionary characters,\r\nhave been put on the republican ticket. Burr, Livingston, &c. entertain\r\nno doubt on the event of that election. Still these are the ideas of the\r\nrepublicans only in these three States, and we must make great allowance\r\nfor their sanguine views. Upon the whole, I consider it as rather more\r\ndoubtful than the last election, in which I was not deceived in more\r\nthan a vote or two. If Pennsylvania votes, then either Jersey or New\r\nYork giving a republican vote, decides the election. If Pennsylvania\r\ndoes not vote, then New York determines the election. In any event,\r\nwe may say that if the city election of New York is in favor of the\r\nrepublican ticket, the issue will be republican; if the federal ticket\r\nfor the city of New York prevails, the probabilities will be in favor\r\nof a federal issue, because it would then require a republican vote both\r\nfrom Jersey and Pennsylvania to preponderate against New York, on which\r\nwe could not count with any confidence. The election of New York being\r\nin April, it becomes an early and interesting object. It is probable the\r\nlanding of our Envoys in Lisbon will add a month to our session; because\r\nall that the eastern men are anxious about, is to get away before the\r\npossibility of a treaty’s coming in upon us.\r\n\r\nPresent my respectful salutations to Mrs. Madison, and be assured of my\r\nconstant and affectionate esteem,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLIX.--TO JAMES MADISON, May 12, 1800\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 12, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nCongress will rise to-day or to-morrow. Mr. Nicholas proposing to call\r\non you, you will get from him the Congressional news. On the whole, the\r\nfederalists have not been able to carry a single strong measure in the\r\nlower House the whole session. When they met, it was believed they had\r\na majority of twenty; but many of these were new and moderate men, and\r\nsoon saw the true character of the party to which they had been well\r\ndisposed while at a distance. The tide, too, of public opinion sets so\r\nstrongly against the federal proceedings, that this melted off their\r\nmajority, and dismayed the heroes of the party. The Senate alone\r\nremained undismayed to the last. Firm to their purposes, regardless of\r\npublic opinion, and more disposed to coerce than to court it, not a man\r\nof their majority gave way in the least; and on the election bill they\r\nadhered to John Marshall’s amendment, by their whole number; and if\r\nthere had been a full Senate, there would have been but eleven\r\nvotes against it, which include H. Marshall, who has voted with the\r\nrepublicans this session.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of constant and affectionate esteem to Mrs. Madison\r\nand yourself from, Dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLX.--TO GIDEON GRANGER, August 13, 1800\r\n\r\nTO GIDEON GRANGER.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 13, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received with great pleasure your favor of June the 4th, and am much\r\ncomforted by the appearance of a change of opinion in your State; for\r\nthough we may obtain, and I believe shall obtain a majority in the\r\nlegislature of the United States, attached to the preservation of the\r\nfederal constitution according to its obvious principles, and those on\r\nwhich it was known to be received; attached equally to the preservation\r\nto the States of those rights unquestionably remaining with them;\r\nfriends to the freedom of religion, freedom of the press, trial by jury,\r\nand to economical government; opposed to standing armies, paper systems,\r\nwar, and all connection, other than commerce, with any foreign nation;\r\nin short, a majority firm in all those principles which we have espoused\r\nand the federalists have opposed uniformly; still, should the whole body\r\nof New England continue in opposition to these principles of government,\r\neither knowingly or through delusion, our government will be a very\r\nuneasy one. It can never be harmonious and solid, while so respectable a\r\nportion of its citizens support principles which go directly to a change\r\nof the federal constitution, to sink the State governments, consolidate\r\nthem into one, and to monarchize that. Our country is too large to have\r\nall its affairs directed by a single government. Public servants at such\r\na distance, and from under the eye of their constituents, must, from the\r\ncircumstance of distance, be unable to administer and overlook all the\r\ndetails necessary for the good government of the citizens, and the same\r\ncircumstance, by rendering detection impossible to their constituents,\r\nwill invite the public agents to corruption, plunder, and waste. And I\r\ndo verily believe, that if the principle were to prevail, of a common\r\nlaw being in force in the United States, (which principle possesses the\r\nGeneral Government at once of all the powers of the State governments,\r\nand reduces us to a single consolidated government) it would become the\r\nmost corrupt government on the earth. You have seen the practices by\r\nwhich the public servants have been able to cover their conduct, or,\r\nwhere that could not be done, delusions by which they have varnished it\r\nfor the eye of their constituents. What an augmentation of the field for\r\njobbing, speculating, plundering, office-building, and office-hunting\r\nWould be produced by an assumption of all the State powers into the\r\nhands of the General Government. The true theory of our constitution is\r\nsurely the wisest and best, that the States are independent as to every\r\nthing within themselves, and united as to every thing respecting foreign\r\nnations. Let the General Government be reduced to foreign concerns only,\r\nand let our affairs be disentangled from those of all other nations,\r\nexcept as to commerce, which the merchants will manage the better,\r\nthe more they are left free to manage for themselves, and our General\r\nGovernment may be reduced to a very simple organization, and a very\r\nunexpensive one; a few plain duties to be performed by a few servants.\r\nBut I repeat, that this simple and economical mode of government can\r\nnever be secured, if the New England States continue to support the\r\ncontrary system. I rejoice, therefore, in every appearance of their\r\nreturning to those principles which I had always imagined to be almost\r\ninnate in them. In this State, a few persons were deluded by the X.\r\nY. Z. duperies. You saw the effect of it in our last Congressional\r\nrepresentatives, chosen under their influence. This experiment on their\r\ncredulity is now seen into, and our next representation will be as\r\nrepublican as it has heretofore been. On the whole, we hope, that by a\r\npart of the Union having held on to the principles of the constitution,\r\ntime has been given to the States to recover from the temporary phrenzy\r\ninto which they had been decoyed, to rally round the constitution, and\r\nto rescue it from the destruction with which it had been threatened even\r\nat their own hands. I see copied from the American Magazine two numbers\r\nof a paper signed Don Quixote, most excellently adapted to introduce the\r\nreal truth to the minds even of the most prejudiced.\r\n\r\nI would, with great pleasure, have written the letter you desired in\r\nbehalf of your friend, but there are existing circumstances which\r\nrender a letter from me to that magistrate as improper as it would be\r\nunavailing. I shall be happy, on some more fortunate occasion, to prove\r\nto you my desire of serving your wishes.\r\n\r\nI some time ago received a letter from a Mr. M’Gregory of Derby, in your\r\nState; it is written with such a degree of good sense and appearance\r\nof candor, as entitles it to an answer. Yet the writer being entirely\r\nunknown to me, and the stratagems of the times very multifarious, I\r\nhave thought it best to avail myself of your friendship, and enclose the\r\nanswer to you. You will see its nature. If you find from the character\r\nof the person to whom it is addressed, that no improper use would\r\nprobably be made of it, be so good as to seal and send it. Otherwise\r\nsuppress it.\r\n\r\nHow will the vote of your State and Rhode Island be as to A. and P.?\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXI.--TO URIAH M’GREGORY, August 13, 1800\r\n\r\nTO URIAH M’GREGORY.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 13, 1800.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of July the 19th has been received, and received with the\r\ntribute of respect due to a person, who, unurged by motives of personal\r\nfriendship or acquaintance, and unaided by particular information, will\r\nso far exercise his justice as to advert to the proofs of approbation\r\ngiven a public character by his own State and by the United States,\r\nand weigh them in the scale against the fatherless calumnies he hears\r\nuttered against him. These public acts are known even to those who know\r\nnothing of my private life, and surely are better evidence to a mind\r\ndisposed to truth, than slanders which no man will affirm on his own\r\nknowledge, or ever saw one who would. From the moment that a portion of\r\nmy fellow-citizens looked towards me with a view to one of their highest\r\noffices, the floodgates of calumny have been opened upon me; not where I\r\nam personally known, where their slanders would be instantly judged and\r\nsuppressed, from a general sense of their falsehood; but in the remote\r\nparts of the Union, where the means of detection are not at hand, and\r\nthe trouble of an inquiry is greater than would suit the hearers to\r\nundertake. I know that I might have filled the courts of the United\r\nStates with actions for these slanders, and have ruined perhaps many\r\npersons who are not innocent. But this would be no equivalent to the\r\nloss of character. I leave them, therefore, to the reproof of their own\r\nconsciences. If these do not condemn them, there will yet come a day\r\nwhen the false witness will meet a judge who has not slept over his\r\nslanders. If the reverend Cotton Mather Smith of Shena believed this as\r\nfirmly as I do, he would surely never have affirmed that ‘I had obtained\r\nmy property by fraud and robbery; that in one instance I had defrauded\r\nand robbed a widow and fatherless children of an estate to which I was\r\nexecutor of ten thousand pounds sterling, by keeping the property and\r\npaying them in money at the nominal rate, when it was worth no more than\r\nforty for one: and that all this could be proved.’ Every tittle of it\r\nis fable; there not having existed a single circumstance of my life\r\nto which any part of it can hang. I never was executor but in two\r\ninstances, both of which having taken place about the beginning of the\r\nrevolution, which withdrew me immediately from all private pursuits,\r\nI never meddled in either executorship. In one of the cases only, were\r\nthere a widow and children. She was my sister. She retained and managed\r\nthe estate in her own hands, and no part of it was ever in mine. In the\r\nother, I was a coparcener, and only received on a division the equal\r\nportion allotted me. To neither of these executorships, therefore, could\r\nMr. Smith refer. Again, my property is all patrimonial except about\r\nseven or eight hundred pounds’ worth of lands, purchased by myself and\r\npaid for, not to widows and orphans, but to the very gentleman from whom\r\nI purchased. If Mr. Smith therefore, thinks the precepts of the Gospel\r\nintended for those who preach them as well as for others, he will\r\ndoubtless some day feel the duties of repentance, and of acknowledgment\r\nin such forms as to correct the wrong he has done. Perhaps he will have\r\nto wait till the passions of the moment have passed away. All this is\r\nleft to his own conscience.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are facts, well known to every person in this quarter, which\r\nI have committed to paper for your own satisfaction, and that of those\r\nto whom you may choose to mention them. I only pray that my letter may\r\nnot go out of your own hands, lest it should get into the newspapers,\r\na bear-garden scene into which I have made it a point to enter on no\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXII.--TO DOCTOR RUSH, September 23, 1800\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR RUSH.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 23, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of August the 22nd, and\r\nto congratulate you on the healthiness of your city. Still Baltimore,\r\nNorfolk, and Providence admonish us that we are not clear of our new\r\nscourge. When great evils happen, I am in the habit of looking out for\r\nwhat good may arise from them as consolations to us, and Providence has\r\nin fact so established the order of things, as that most evils are\r\nthe means of producing some good. The yellow fever will discourage\r\nthe growth of great cities in our nation, and I view great cities as\r\npestilential to the morals, the health, and the liberties of man. True,\r\nthey nourish some of the elegant arts, but the useful ones can thrive\r\nelsewhere, and less perfection in the others, with more health, virtue,\r\nand freedom, would be my choice.\r\n\r\nI agree with you entirely, in condemning the mania of giving names to\r\nobjects of any kind after persons still living. Death alone can seal\r\nthe title of any man to this honor, by putting it out of his power to\r\nforfeit it. There is one other mode of recording merit, which I have\r\noften thought might be introduced, so as to gratify the living by\r\npraising the dead. In giving, for instance, a commission of Chief\r\nJustice to Bushrod Washington, it should be in consideration of his\r\nintegrity, and science in the laws, and of the services rendered to our\r\ncountry by his illustrious relation, &c. A commission to a descendant\r\nof Dr. Franklin, besides being in consideration of the proper\r\nqualifications of the person, should add, that of the great services\r\nrendered by his illustrious ancestor, Benjamin Franklin, by the\r\nadvancement of science, by inventions useful to man, &c. I am not sure\r\nthat we ought to change all our names. And, during the regal government,\r\nsometimes indeed they were given through adulation; but often also as\r\nthe reward of the merit of the times, sometimes for services rendered\r\nthe colony. Perhaps, too, a name when given, should be deemed a sacred\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nI promised you a letter on Christianity, which I have not forgotten.\r\nOn the contrary, it is because I have reflected on it, that I find much\r\nmore time necessary for it than I can at present dispose of. I have\r\na view of the subject which ought to displease neither the rational\r\nChristian nor Deist, and would reconcile many to a character they have\r\ntoo hastily rejected. I do not know that it would reconcile the _genus\r\nirritabile vatum_, who are all in arms against me. Their hostility is on\r\ntoo interesting ground to be softened. The delusion into which the X. Y.\r\nZ. plot showed it possible to push the people; the successful experiment\r\nmade under the prevalence of that delusion on the clause of the\r\nconstitution, which, while it secured the freedom of the press, covered\r\nalso the freedom of religion, had given to the clergy a very favorite\r\nhope of obtaining an establishment of a particular form of Christianity\r\nthrough the United States; and as every sect believes its own form\r\nthe true one, every one perhaps hoped for his own, but especially the\r\nEpiscopalians and Congregationalists. The returning good sense of our\r\ncountry threatens abortion to their hopes, and they believe that any\r\nportion of power confided to me, will be exerted in opposition to their\r\nschemes. And they believe rightly: for I have sworn, upon the altar of\r\nGod, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of\r\nman. But this is all they have to fear from me: and enough too in their\r\nopinion. And this is the cause of their printing lying pamphlets against\r\nme, forging conversations for me with Mazzei, Bishop Madison, &c. which\r\nare absolute falsehoods without a circumstance of truth to rest on;\r\nfalsehoods, too, of which I acquit Mazzei and Bishop Madison, for they\r\nare men of truth.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this: it is more than I have before committed to paper on\r\nthe subject of all the lies which have been preached and printed against\r\nme. I have not seen the work of Sonnini which you mention, but I have\r\nseen another work on Africa, Park’s, which I fear will throw cold-water\r\non the hopes of the friends of freedom. You will hear an account of an\r\nattempt at insurrection in this state. I am looking with anxiety to see\r\nwhat will be its effect on our State. We are truly to be pitied. I fear\r\nwe have little chance to see you at the federal city or in Virginia,\r\nand as little at Philadelphia. It would be a great treat to receive you\r\nhere. But nothing but sickness could effect that; so I do not wish it.\r\nFor I wish you health and happiness, and think of you with affection.\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER, CCLXIII.--TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, December 14, 1800\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 14, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour former communications on the subject of the steam-engine, I took\r\nthe liberty of laying before the American Philosophical Society, by whom\r\nthey will be printed in their volume of the present year. I have heard\r\nof the discovery of some large bones, supposed to be of the mammoth,\r\nat about thirty or forty miles distance from you: and among the bones\r\nfound, are said to be some which we have never yet been able to procure.\r\nThe first interesting question is, whether they are the bones of the\r\nmammoth? The second, What are the particular bones, and could I possibly\r\nprocure them? The bones I am most anxious to obtain, are those of the\r\nhead and feet, which are said to be among those found in your State,\r\nas also the _ossa innominata_, and _scapula_. Others would also be\r\ninteresting, though similar ones may be possessed, because they would\r\nshow by their similarity that the set belong to the mammoth. Could I so\r\nfar venture to trouble you on this subject, as to engage some of your\r\nfriends, near the place, to procure for me the bones above mentioned?\r\nIf they are to be bought, I will gladly pay for them whatever you\r\nshall agree to as reasonable; and will place the money in New York as\r\ninstantaneously after it is made known to me, as the post can carry it,\r\nas I will all expenses of package, transportation, &c. to New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, where they may be addressed to John Barnes, whose agent\r\n(he not being on the spot) will take care of them for me.\r\n\r\nBut I have still a more important subject whereon to address you. Though\r\nour information of the votes of the several States be not official, yet\r\nthey are stated on such evidence as to satisfy both parties that the\r\nrepublican vote has been successful. We may, therefore, venture to\r\nhazard propositions on that hypothesis, without being justly subjected\r\nto raillery or ridicule. The constitution, to which we are all attached,\r\nwas meant to be republican, and we believe to be republican according\r\nto every candid interpretation. Yet we have seen it so interpreted and\r\nadministered, as to be truly what the French have called it, a monarchic\r\nmasque. Yet so long has the vessel run on this way and been trimmed to\r\nit, that to put her on her republican tack will require all the skill,\r\nthe firmness, and the zeal of her ablest and best friends. It is a\r\ncrisis which calls on them to sacrifice all other objects, and repair\r\nto her aid in this momentous operation. Not only their skill is wanting,\r\nbut their names also. It is essential to assemble in the outset\r\npersons to compose our administration, whose talents, integrity, and\r\nrevolutionary name and principles may inspire the nation, at once, with\r\nunbounded confidence, and impose an awful silence on all the maligners\r\nof republicanism; as may suppress in embryo the purpose avowed by one\r\nof their most daring and effective chiefs, of beating down the\r\nadministration. These names do not abound at this day. So few are they,\r\nthat yours, my friend, cannot be spared among them without leaving a\r\nblank which cannot be filled. If I can obtain for the public the aid of\r\nthose I have contemplated, I fear nothing. If this cannot be done, then\r\nare we unfortunate indeed! We shall be unable to realize the prospects\r\nwhich have been held out to the people, and we must fall back into\r\nmonarchism, for want of heads, not hands, to help us out of it. This is\r\na common cause, my dear Sir, common to all republicans. Though I have\r\nbeen too honorably placed in front of those who are to enter the breach\r\nso happily made, yet the energies of every individual are necessary, and\r\nin the very place where his energies can most serve the enterprise. I\r\ncan assure you that your colleagues will be most acceptable to you;\r\none of them, whom you cannot mistake, peculiarly so. The part which\r\ncircumstances constrain us to propose to you, is the secretaryship\r\nof the navy. These circumstances cannot be explained by letter.\r\nRepublicanism is so rare in those parts which possess nautical skill,\r\nthat I cannot find it allied there to the other qualifications.\r\nThough you are not nautical by profession, yet your residence and your\r\nmechanical science qualify you as well as a gentleman can possibly\r\nbe, and sufficiently to enable you to choose under-agents perfectly\r\nqualified, and to superintend their conduct. Come forward then, my\r\ndear Sir, and give us the aid of your talents and the weight of your\r\ncharacter towards the new establishment of republicanism; I say, for its\r\nnew establishment; for hitherto, we have seen only its _travestie_. I\r\nhave urged thus far, on the belief that your present office would not be\r\nan obstacle to this proposition. I was informed, and I think it was\r\nby your brother, that you wished to retire from it, and were only\r\nrestrained by the fear that a successor of different principles might\r\nbe appointed. The late change in your council of appointment will remove\r\nthis fear. It will not be improper to say a word on the subject\r\nof expense. The gentlemen who composed General Washington’s first\r\nadministration took up, too universally, a practice of general\r\nentertainment, which was unnecessary, obstructive of business, and\r\nso oppressive to themselves, that it was among the motives for their\r\nretirement. Their successors profited from the experiment, and lived\r\naltogether as private individuals, and so have ever continued to do.\r\nHere, indeed, it cannot be otherwise our situation being so rural, that\r\nduring the vacations of the legislature we shall have no society but of\r\nthe officers of government, and in time of sessions the legislature\r\nis become and becoming so numerous, that for the last half dozen years\r\nnobody but the President has pretended to entertain them. I have been\r\nled to make the application before official knowledge of the result\r\nof our election, because the return of Mr. Van Benthuysen, one of your\r\nelectors and neighbors, offers me a safe conveyance, at a moment when\r\nthe post-offices will be peculiarly suspicious and prying. Your answer\r\nmay come by post without danger, if directed in some other hand-writing\r\nthan your own: and I will pray you to give me an answer as soon as you\r\ncan make up your mind.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of cordial esteem and respect, and my friendly\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXIV.--TO COLONEL BURR, December 15,1800\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 15,1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAlthough we have not official information of the votes for President and\r\nVice-President, and cannot have until the first week in February, yet\r\nthe state of the votes is given on such evidence, as satisfies both\r\nparties that the two republican candidates stand highest. From South\r\nCarolina we have not even heard of the actual vote; but we have learned\r\nwho were appointed electors, and with sufficient certainty how they\r\nwould vote. It is said they would withdraw from yourself one vote. It\r\nhas also been said that a General Smith, of Tennessee, had declared he\r\nwould give his second vote to Mr. Gallatin, not from any indisposition\r\ntowards you, but extreme reverence to the character of Mr. Gallatin. It\r\nis also surmised that the vote of Georgia will not be entire. Yet nobody\r\npretends to know these things of a certainty, and we know enough to be\r\ncertain that what it is surmised will be withheld, will still leave\r\nyou four or five votes at least above Mr. Adams. However, it was badly\r\nmanaged not to have arranged with certainty what seems to have been left\r\nto hazard. It was the more material, because I understand several of the\r\nhighflying federalists have expressed their hope that the two republican\r\ntickets may be equal, and their determination in that case to prevent a\r\nchoice by the House of Representatives (which they are strong enough to\r\ndo) and let the government devolve on a President of the Senate. Decency\r\nrequired that I should be so entirely passive during the late contest,\r\nthat I never once asked whether arrangements had been made to prevent\r\nso many from dropping votes intentionally, as might frustrate half the\r\nrepublican wish; nor did I doubt, till lately, that such had been made.\r\n\r\nWhile I must congratulate you, my dear Sir, on the issue of this\r\ncontest, because it is more honorable, and doubtless more grateful to\r\nyou than any station within the competence of the chief magistrate, yet\r\nfor myself, and for the substantial service of the public, I feel most\r\nsensibly the loss we sustain of your aid in our new administration. It\r\nleaves a chasm in my arrangements, which cannot be adequately filled up.\r\nI had endeavored to compose an administration, whose talents, integrity,\r\nnames, and dispositions, should at once inspire unbounded confidence\r\nin the public mind, and insure a perfect harmony in the conduct of the\r\npublic business. I lose you from the list, and am not sure of all the\r\nothers. Should the gentlemen who possess the public confidence decline\r\ntaking a part in their affairs, and force us to take persons unknown to\r\nthe people, the evil genius of this country may realize his avowal\r\nthat ‘he will beat down the administration.’ The return of Mr.\r\nVan Benthuysen, one of your electors, furnishes me a confidential\r\nopportunity of writing this much to you, which I should not have\r\nventured through the post-office at this prying season. We shall of\r\ncourse see you before the fourth of March. Accept my respectful and\r\naffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXV.--TO JUDGE BRECKENRIDGE, December 18,1800\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE BRECKENRIDGE.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 18,1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received, while at home, the letter you were so kind as to write me.\r\nThe employments of the country have such irresistible attractions for\r\nme, that while I am at home I am not very punctual in acknowledging\r\nthe letters of my friends. Having no refuge here from my room and\r\nwriting-table, it is my regular season for fetching up the lee-way of my\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nBefore you receive this, you will have understood that the State of\r\nSouth Carolina (the only one about which there was uncertainty) has\r\ngiven a republican vote, and saved us from the consequences of the\r\nannihilation of Pennsylvania. But we are brought into dilemma by the\r\nprobable equality of the two republican candidates, The federalists\r\nin Congress mean to take advantage of this, and either to prevent an\r\nelection altogether, or reverse what has been understood to have been\r\nthe wishes of the people as to the President and Vice-President; wishes\r\nwhich the constitution! did not permit them specially to designate.\r\nThe latter alternative still gives us a republican administration; the\r\nformer, a suspension of the federal government, for want of a head.\r\nThis opens to us an abyss at which every sincere patriot must shudder.\r\nGeneral Davie has arrived here with the treaty formed (under the name of\r\na convention) with France. It is now before the Senate for ratification,\r\nand will encounter objections. He believes firmly that a continental\r\npeace in Europe will take place, and that England also may be\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of the great respect of, Dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXVI.--TO JAMES MADISON, December 19,1800\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 19,1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMrs. Brown’s departure for Virginia enables me to write confidentially\r\nwhat I could not have ventured by the post at this prying season.\r\nThe election in South Carolina has in some measure decided the great\r\ncontest. Though as yet we do not know the actual votes of Tennessee,\r\nKentucky, and Vermont, yet we believe the votes to be on the whole, J.\r\nseventy-three, B. seventy-three, A. sixty-five, P. sixty-four. Rhode\r\nIsland withdrew one from P. There is a possibility that Tennessee may\r\nwithdraw one from B., and Burr writes that there may be one vote in\r\nVermont for J. But I hold the latter impossible, and the former not\r\nprobable; and that there will be an absolute parity between the two\r\nrepublican candidates. This has produced great dismay and gloom on the\r\nrepublican gentlemen here, and exultation in the federalists, who openly\r\ndeclare they will prevent an election, and will name a President of\r\nthe Senate, _pro tem_, by what they say would only be a stretch of the\r\nconstitution. The prospect of preventing this, is as follows. Georgia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and New\r\nYork, can be counted on for their vote in the, House of Representatives,\r\nand it is thought by some, that Baer of Maryland, and Linn of New Jersey\r\nwill come over. Some even count on Morris of Vermont. But you must know\r\nthe uncertainty of such a dependence under the operation of caucuses and\r\nother federal engines. The month of February, therefore, will present us\r\nstorms of a new character. Should they have a particular issue, I hope\r\nyou will be here a day or two, at least, before the 4th of March. I\r\nknow that your appearance on the scene before the departure of Congress,\r\nwould assuage the minority, and inspire in the majority confidence and\r\njoy unbounded, which they would spread far and wide on their journey\r\nhome. Let me beseech you then to come with a view of staying perhaps\r\na couple of weeks, within which time things might be put into such a\r\ntrain, as would permit us both to go home for a short time, for removal.\r\nI wrote to R. R. L. by a confidential hand three days ago. The person\r\nproposed for the Treasury has not come yet.\r\n\r\nDavie is here with the convention, as it is called; but it is a real\r\ntreaty, and without limitation of time. It has some disagreeable\r\nfeatures, and will endanger the compromitting us with Great Britain. I\r\nam not at liberty to mention its contents, but I believe it will meet\r\nwith opposition from both sides of the House. It has been a bungling\r\nnegotiation. Ellsworth remains in France for his health. He has resigned\r\nhis office of Chief Justice. Putting these two things together, we\r\ncannot misconstrue his views. He must have had great confidence in\r\nMr. Adams’s continuance to risk such a certainty as he held. Jay was\r\nyesterday nominated Chief Justice. We were afraid of something worse. A\r\nscheme of government for the territory is cooking by a committee of each\r\nHouse, under separate authorities, but probably a voluntary harmony.\r\nThey let out no hints. It is believed that the judiciary system will not\r\nbe pushed, as the appointments, if made by the present administration,\r\ncould not fall on those who create them. But I very much fear the road\r\nsystem will be urged. The mines of Peru would not supply the monies\r\nwhich would be wasted on this object, nor the patience of any people\r\nstand the abuses which would be incontrollably committed under it. I\r\npropose, as soon as the state of the election is perfectly ascertained,\r\nto aim at a candid understanding with Mr. Adams. I do not expect that\r\neither his feelings or his views of interest will oppose it. I hope\r\nto induce in him dispositions liberal and accommodating. Accept my\r\naffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, December 26, 1800\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 26, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAll the votes have now come in, except of Vermont and Kentucky, and\r\nthere is no doubt that the result is a perfect parity between the two\r\nrepublican characters. The federalists appear determined to prevent an\r\nelection, and to pass a bill giving the government to Mr. Jay, appointed\r\nChief Justice, or to Marshall as Secretary of State. Yet I am rather\r\nof opinion that Maryland and Jersey will give the seven republican\r\nmajorities. The French treaty will be violently opposed by the\r\nfederalists; the giving up the vessels is the article they cannot\r\nswallow. They have got their judiciary bill forwarded to commitment. I\r\ndread this above all the measures meditated, because appointments in the\r\nnature of free-hold render it difficult to undo what is done. We expect\r\na report for a territorial government which is to pay little respect to\r\nthe rights of man.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nCordial and affectionate salutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXVIII.--TO COLONEL BURR, February 1, 1801\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 1, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that the enemy would endeavor to sow tares between\r\nus, that they might divide us and our friends. Every consideration\r\nsatisfies me you will be on your guard against this, as I assure you I\r\nam strongly. I hear of one stratagem so imposing and so base, that it is\r\nproper I should notice it to you. Mr. Munford, who is here, says he\r\nsaw at New York before he left it, an original letter of mine to Judge\r\nBreckenridge, in which are sentiments highly injurious to you. He knows\r\nmy hand-writing, and did not doubt that to be genuine. I enclose you a\r\ncopy taken from the press copy of the only letter I ever wrote to Judge\r\nBreckenridge in my life: the press copy itself has been shown to several\r\nof our mutual friends here. Of consequence the letter seen by Mr.\r\nMunford must be a forgery, and if it contains a sentiment unfriendly or\r\ndisrespectful to you, I affirm it solemnly to be a forgery; as also if\r\nit varies, from the copy enclosed. With the common trash of slander I\r\nshould not think of troubling you; but the forgery of one’s hand-writing\r\nis too imposing to be neglected. A mutual knowledge of each other\r\nfurnishes us with the best test of the contrivances which will be\r\npractised by the enemies of both.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXIX.--TO GOVERNOR M’KEAN, February 2, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR M’KEAN.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 2, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have long waited for an opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of\r\nyour favor of December the 15th, as well as that by Dr. Mendenhall. None\r\noccurring, I shall either deliver the present to General Muhlenburg or\r\nput it under cover to Dr. Wistar, to whom I happen to be writing, to\r\nbe sent to your house in Philadelphia, or forwarded confidentially to\r\nLancaster.\r\n\r\nThe event of the election is still in dubio. A strong portion in the\r\nHouse of Representatives will prevent an election if they can. I rather\r\nbelieve they will not be able to do it, as there are six individuals of\r\nmoderate character, any one of whom coming over to the republican vote\r\nwill make a ninth state. Till this is known, it is too soon for me to\r\nsay what should be done in such atrocious cases as those you mention of\r\nfederal officers obstructing the operation of the State governments. One\r\nthing I will say, that as to the future, interferences with elections,\r\nwhether of the State or General Government, by officers of the latter,\r\nshould be deemed cause of removal; because the constitutional remedy by\r\nthe elective principle becomes nothing, if it may be smothered by\r\nthe enormous patronage of the General Government. How far it may be\r\npracticable, prudent, or proper, to look back, is too great a question\r\nto be decided but by the united wisdom of the whole administration when\r\nformed. Our situation is so different from yours, that it may render\r\nproper some differences in the practice. Your State is a single body,\r\nthe majority clearly one way. Ours is of sixteen integral parts, some\r\nof them all one way, some all the other, some divided. Whatever my\r\nbe decided as to the past, they shall give no trouble to the State\r\ngovernments in future, if it shall depend on me; and be assured,\r\nparticularly as to yourself, that I should consider the most perfect\r\nharmony and interchange of accommodations and good offices with those\r\ngovernments as among the first objects.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high consideration, respect, and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXX.--TO TENCH COXE, February 11,1801\r\n\r\nTO TENCH COXE.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 11,1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of January the 25th came to hand some days ago, and yesterday\r\na gentleman put into my hand, at the door of the Senate chamber, the\r\nvolume of the American Museum for 1798. As no letter accompanied it, I\r\ntook it for granted it was to bring under my eye some of its contents. I\r\nhave gone over it with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis is the morning of the election by the House of Representatives.\r\nFor some time past a single individual had declared he would by his vote\r\nmake up the ninth State. On Saturday last he changed, and it stands at\r\npresent eight one way, six the other, and two divided. Which of the two\r\nwill be elected, and whether either, I deem perfectly problematical: and\r\nmy mind has long been equally made up for either of the three events.\r\nIf I can find out the person who brought me the volume for you, I shall\r\nreturn it by him, because I presume it makes one of a set. If not by\r\nhim, I will find some other person who may convey it to Philadelphia if\r\nnot to Lancaster. Very possibly it may go by a different conveyance from\r\nthis letter. Very probably you will learn before the receipt of either,\r\nthe result, or progress at least, of the election. We see already at the\r\nthreshold, that if it falls on me, I shall be embarrassed by finding the\r\noffices vacant, which cannot be even temporarily filled but with advice\r\nof Senate, and that body is called on the fourth of March, when it is\r\nimpossible for the new members of Kentucky, Georgia, and South Carolina\r\nto receive notice in time to be here. The summons for Kentucky, dated,\r\nas all were, January the 31st, could not go hence till the 5th, and\r\nthat for Georgia did not go till the 6th. If the difficulties of the\r\nelection, therefore, are got over, there are more and more behind, until\r\nnew elections shall have regenerated the constituted authorities. The\r\ndefects of our constitution under circumstances like the present, appear\r\nvery great. Accept assurances of the esteem and respect of, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXI.--TO JAMES MONROE, February 15, 1801\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have received several letters from you which have not been\r\nacknowledged. By the post I dare not, and one or two confidential\r\nopportunities have passed me by surprise. I have regretted it the less,\r\nbecause I know you could be more safely and fully informed by others.\r\nMr. Tyler, the bearer of this, will give you a great deal more\r\ninformation personally than can be done by letter. Four days of\r\nballoting have produced not a single change of a vote. Yet it is\r\nconfidently believed by most that to-morrow there is to be a coalition.\r\nI know of no foundation for this belief. However, as Mr. Tyler waits\r\nthe event of it, he will communicate it to you. If they could have been\r\npermitted to pass a law for putting the government into the hands of an\r\nofficer, they would certainly have prevented an election. But we thought\r\nit best to declare openly and firmly, one and all, that the day such an\r\nact passed, the middle States would arm, and that no such usurpation,\r\neven for a single day, should be submitted to. This first shook them;\r\nand they were completely alarmed at the resource for which we declared,\r\nto wit, a convention to re-organize the government, and to amend it.\r\nThe very word convention gives them the horrors, as in the present\r\ndemocratical spirit of America, they fear they should lose some of the\r\nfavorite morsels of the constitution. Many attempts have been made\r\nto obtain terms and promises from me. I have declared to them\r\nunequivocally, that I would not receive the government on capitulation,\r\nthat I would not go into it with my hands tied. Should they yield\r\nthe election, I have reason to expect in the outset the greatest\r\ndifficulties as to nominations. The late incumbents running away from\r\ntheir offices and leaving them vacant, will prevent my filling them\r\nwithout the _previous_ advice of Senate. How this difficulty is to be\r\ngot over I know not. Accept for Mrs. Monroe and yourself my affectionate\r\nsalutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXII.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 18,1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 18,1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the suspected infidelity of the post, I must hazard\r\nthis communication. The minority of the House of Representatives,\r\nafter seeing the impossibility of electing Burr, the certainty that a\r\nlegislative usurpation would be resisted by arms, and a recourse to a\r\nconvention to re-organize and amend the government, held a consultation\r\non this dilemma, whether it would be better for them to come over in a\r\nbody and go with the tide of the times, or by a negative conduct suffer\r\nthe election to be made by a bare majority, keeping their body entire\r\nand unbroken, to act in phalanx on such ground of opposition as\r\ncircumstances shall offer: and I know their determination on this\r\nquestion only by their vote of yesterday. Morris of Vermont withdrew,\r\nwhich made Lyon’s vote that of his State. The Maryland federalists put\r\nin four blanks, which made the positive ticket of their colleagues the\r\nvote of the State. South Carolina and Delaware put in six blanks. So\r\nthere were ten states for one candidate, four for another, and two\r\nblanks. We consider this, therefore, as a declaration of war, on the\r\npart of this band. But their conduct appears to have brought over to us\r\nthe whole body of federalists, who, being alarmed with the danger of a\r\ndissolution of the government, had been made most anxiously to wish the\r\nvery administration they had opposed, and to view it when obtained, as a\r\nchild of their own.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nMr. A. embarrasses us. He keeps the offices of State and War vacant, but\r\nhas named Bayard Minister Plenipotentiary to France, and has called an\r\nunorganized Senate to meet the fourth of March. As you do not like to\r\nbe here on that day, I wish you would come within a day or two after.\r\nI think that between that and the middle of the month we can so far put\r\nthings under way, as that we may go home to make arrangements for our\r\nfinal removal. Come to Conrad’s, where I will bespeak lodgings for you.\r\nYesterday Mr. A. nominated Baynard to be Minister Plenipotentiary of\r\nthe United States to the French republic; to-day, Theophilus Parsons,\r\nAttorney General of the United States in the room of C. Lee, who, with\r\nKeith Taylor _cum multis aliis_, are appointed judges under the new\r\nsystem. H. G. Otis is nominated a District Attorney. A vessel has been\r\nwaiting for some time in readiness to carry the new Minister to France.\r\nMy affectionate salutations to Mrs. Madison.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXIII.--TO JOHN DICKINSON, March 6, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 6, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nNo pleasure can exceed that which I received from reading your letter\r\nof the 21st ultimo. It was like the joy we expect in the mansions of the\r\nblessed, when received with the embraces of our forefathers, we shall be\r\nwelcomed with their blessing as having done our part not unworthily\r\nof them. The storm through which we have passed, has been tremendous\r\nindeed. The tough sides of our Argosie have been thoroughly tried. Her\r\nstrength has stood the waves into which she was steered, with a view to\r\nsink her. We shall put her on her republican tack, and she will now show\r\nby the beauty of her motion the skill of her builders. Figure apart,\r\nour fellow-citizens have been led hood-winked from their principles by\r\na most extraordinary combination of circumstances. But the band is\r\nremoved, and they now see for themselves. I hope to see shortly a\r\nperfect consolidation, to effect which, nothing shall be spared on my\r\npart, short of the abandonment of the principles of our revolution. A\r\njust and solid republican government maintained here, will be a standing\r\nmonument and example for the aim and imitation of the people of other\r\ncountries; and I join with you in the hope and belief that they will\r\nsee, from our example, that a free government is of all others the most\r\nenergetic; that the inquiry which has been excited among the mass of\r\nmankind by our revolution and its consequences, will ameliorate the\r\ncondition of man over a great portion of the globe. What a satisfaction\r\nhave we in the contemplation of the benevolent effects of our efforts,\r\ncompared with those of the leaders on the other side, who have\r\ndiscountenanced all advances in science as dangerous innovations, have\r\nendeavored to render philosophy and republicanism terms of reproach, to\r\npersuade us that man cannot be governed but by the rod, &c. I shall\r\nhave the happiness of living and dying in the contrary hope. Accept\r\nassurances of my constant and sincere respect and attachment, and my\r\naffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXIV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, March 7, 1801\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 7, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had written the enclosed letter to Mrs. Trist, and was just proceeding\r\nto begin one to you, when your favor of the 6th was put into my hands. I\r\nthank you sincerely for it, and consider the views of it so sound,\r\nthat I have communicated it to my coadjutors as one of our important\r\nevidences of the public sentiment, according to which we must shape\r\nour course. I suspect, partly from this, but more from a letter of J.\r\nTaylor’s which has been put into my hands, that an incorrect idea of my\r\nviews has got abroad. I am in hopes my inaugural address will in some\r\nmeasure set this to rights, as it will present the leading objects to\r\nbe conciliation and adherence to sound principle. This I know is\r\nimpracticable with the leaders of the late faction, whom I abandon as\r\nincurables, and will never turn an inch out of my way to reconcile\r\nthem. But with the main body of the federalists, I believe it very\r\npracticable. You know that the manoeuvres of the year X. Y. Z. carried\r\nover from us a great body of the people, real republicans, and honest\r\nmen under virtuous motives. The delusion lasted a while. At length the\r\npoor arts of tub-plots, &c. were repeated till the designs of the party\r\nbecame suspected. From that moment those who had left us began to\r\ncome back. It was by their return to us that we gained the victory in\r\nNovember, 1800, which we should not have gained in November, 1799. But\r\nduring the suspension of the public mind from the 11th to the 17th of\r\nFebruary, and the anxiety and alarm lest there should be no election,\r\nand anarchy ensue, a wonderful effect was produced on the mass of\r\nfederalists who had not before come over. Those who had before become\r\nsensible of their error in the former change, and only wanted a decent\r\nexcuse for coming back, seized that occasion for doing so. Another body,\r\nand a large one it is, who from timidity of constitution had gone\r\nwith those who wished for a strong executive, were induced by the same\r\ntimidity to come over to us rather than risk anarchy: so that, according\r\nto the evidence we receive from every direction, we may say that the\r\nwhole of that portion of the people which were called federalists, were\r\nmade to desire anxiously the very event they had just before opposed\r\nwith all their energies, and to receive the election which was made, as\r\nan object of their earnest wishes, a child of their own. These people (I\r\nalways exclude their leaders) are now aggregated with us, they look\r\nwith a certain degree of affection and confidence to the administration,\r\nready to become attached to it, if it avoids in the outset acts\r\nwhich might revolt and throw them off. To give time for a perfect\r\nconsolidation seems prudent. I have firmly refused to follow the\r\ncounsels of those who have desired the giving offices to some of their\r\nleaders, in order to reconcile. I have given, and will give, only to\r\nrepublicans, under existing circumstances. But I believe with others,\r\nthat deprivations of office, if made on the ground of political\r\nprinciples alone, would revolt our new converts, and give a body to\r\nleaders who now stand alone. Some, I know, must be made. They must be\r\nas few as possible, done gradually, and bottomed on some malversation\r\nor inherent disqualification. Where we shall draw the line between\r\nretaining all and none, is not yet settled, and will not be till we get\r\nour administration together; and perhaps even then, we shall proceed _à\r\ntatons_, balancing our measures according to the impression we perceive\r\nthem to make.\r\n\r\nThis may give you a general view of our plan. Should you be in Albemarle\r\nthe first week in April, I shall have the pleasure of seeing you there,\r\nand of developing things more particularly, and of profiting by an\r\nintercommunication of views. Dawson sails for France about the 15th, as\r\nthe bearer only of the treaty to Ellsworth and Murray. He has probably\r\nasked your commands, and your introductory letters.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Mrs. Monroe, and accept assurances of my high and\r\naffectionate consideration and attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXV.--TO GOVERNOR M’KEAN, March 9, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR M’KEAN.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 9, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of February the 20th,\r\nand to thank you for your congratulations on the event of the election.\r\nHad it terminated in the elevation of Mr. Burr every republican would,\r\nI am sure, have acquiesced in a moment; because, however it might have\r\nbeen variant from the intentions of the voters, yet it would have\r\nbeen agreeable to the constitution. No man would more cheerfully have\r\nsubmitted than myself, because I am sure the administration would have\r\nbeen republican, and the chair of the Senate permitting me to be at home\r\neight months in the year, would, on that account, have been much more\r\nconsonant to my real satisfaction. But in the event of an usurpation, I\r\nwas decidedly with those who were determined not to permit it. Because\r\nthat precedent, once set, would be artificially reproduced, and end soon\r\nin a dictator. Virginia was bristling up, I believe. I shall know the\r\nparticulars from Governor Monroe, whom I expect to meet in a short visit\r\nI must make home, to select some books, &c. necessary here, and make\r\nother domestic arrangements.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high esteem and regard.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXVI.--TO JOEL BARLOW, March 14, 1801\r\n\r\nTO JOEL BARLOW.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 14, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nNot having my papers here, it is not in my power to acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your letters by their dates, but T am pretty certain I\r\nhave received two in the course of the last twelve months, one of them\r\ncovering your excellent second letter. Nothing can be sounder than the\r\nprinciples it inculcates, and I am not without hopes they will make\r\ntheir way. You have understood that the revolutionary movements in\r\nEurope had, by industry and artifice, been wrought into objects of\r\nterror even to this country, and had really involved a great portion of\r\nour well-meaning citizens in a panic which was perfectly unaccountable,\r\nand during the prevalence of which they were led to support measures\r\nthe most insane. They are now pretty thoroughly recovered from it, and\r\nsensible of the mischief which was done, and preparing to be done,\r\nhad their minds continued a little longer under that derangement. The\r\nrecovery bids fair to be complete, and to obliterate entirely the line\r\nof party division which had been so strongly drawn. Not that their\r\nlate leaders have come over, or ever can come over. But they stand, at\r\npresent, almost without followers. The principal of them have retreated\r\ninto the judiciary, as a strong hold, the tenure of which renders it\r\ndifficult to dislodge them. For all the particulars I must refer you to\r\nMr. Dawson, a member of Congress, fully informed and worthy of entire\r\nconfidence. Give me leave to ask for him your attentions and civilities,\r\nand a verbal communication of such things on your side the water as you\r\nknow I feel a great interest in, and as may not with safety be committed\r\nto paper. I am entirely unable to conjecture the issue of things with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXVII.--TO THOMAS PAINE, March 18, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 18, 1801,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letters of October the 1st, 4th, 6th, and 16th, came duly to hand,\r\nand the papers which they covered were, according to your permission,\r\npublished in the newspapers and in a pamphlet, and under your own name.\r\nThese papers contain precisely our principles, and I hope they will be\r\ngenerally recognised here. Determined as we are to avoid, if possible,\r\nwasting the energies of our people in war and destruction, we shall\r\navoid implicating ourselves with the powers of Europe, even in support\r\nof principles which we mean to pursue. They have so many other interests\r\ndifferent from ours, that we must avoid being entangled in them. We\r\nbelieve we can enforce those principles, as to ourselves, by peaceable\r\nmeans, now that we are likely to have our public councils detached from\r\nforeign views. The return, of our citizens from the phrenzy into which\r\nthey had been wrought, partly by ill conduct in France, partly by\r\nartifices practised on them, is almost entire, and will, I believe,\r\nbecome quite so. But these details, too minute and long for a letter,\r\nwill be better developed by Mr. Dawson, the bearer of this, a member\r\nof the late Congress, to whom I refer you for them. He goes in the\r\nMaryland, a sloop of war, which will wait a few days at Havre to receive\r\nhis letters, to be written on his arrival at Paris. You expressed a\r\nwish to get a passage to this country in a public vessel. Mr. Dawson\r\nis charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland to receive and\r\naccommodate you with a passage back, if you can be ready to depart\r\nat such short warning. Robert R. Livingston is appointed Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary to the republic of France, but will not leave this till\r\nwe receive the ratification of the convention by Mr. Dawson. I am in\r\nhopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of former\r\ntimes. In these it will be your glory to have steadily labored, and with\r\nas much effect as any man living. That you may long live to continue\r\nyour useful labors, and to reap their reward in the thankfulness of\r\nnations, is my sincere prayer.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high esteem and affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXVIII.--TO M. DE REYNEVAL, March 20, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 20, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMr. Pichon, who arrived two days ago, delivered me your favor of January\r\nthe 1st, and I had before received one by Mr. Dupont, dated August the\r\n24th, 1799, both on the subject of lands, claimed on behalf of your\r\nbrother, Mr. Girard, and that of August the 24th containing a statement\r\nof the case. I had verbally explained to Mr. Dupont at the time, what\r\nI presumed to have been the case, which must, I believe, be very much\r\nmistaken in the statement sent with that letter; and I expected he had\r\ncommunicated it to you.\r\n\r\nDuring the regal government, two companies called the Loyal, and the\r\nOhio companies had obtained grants from the crown for eight hundred\r\nthousand, or one million of acres of land, each, on the Ohio, on\r\ncondition of settling them in a given number of years. They surveyed\r\nsome and settled them; but the war of 1755 came on and broke up the\r\nsettlements. After it was over they petitioned for a renewal. Four other\r\nlarge companies then formed themselves, called the Mississippi, the\r\nIllinois, the Wabash, and the Indiana companies, each praying for\r\nimmense quantities of land, some amounting to two hundred miles square,\r\nso that they proposed to cover the whole country north between the\r\nOhio and Mississippi, and a great portion of what is south. All these\r\npetitions were depending, without any answer whatever from the crown,\r\nwhen the revolution war broke out. The petitioners had associated to\r\nthemselves some of the nobility of England, and most of the characters\r\nin America of great influence. When Congress assumed the government,\r\nthey took some of their body in as partners, to obtain their influence;\r\nand I remember to have heard at the time, that one of them took Mr.\r\nGirard as a partner, expecting by that to obtain the influence of the\r\nFrench court; to obtain grants of those lands which they had not been\r\nable to obtain from the British government. All these lands were within\r\nthe limits of Virginia, and that State determined peremptorily, that\r\nthey never should be granted to large companies, but left open equally\r\nto all: and when they passed their land law (which I think was in 1778)\r\nthey confirmed only so much of the lands of the Loyal company as they\r\nhad actually surveyed, which was a very small proportion, and annulled\r\nevery other pretension. And when that State conveyed the lands to\r\nCongress (which was not till 1784), so determined were they to prevent\r\ntheir being granted to these or any other large companies, that they\r\nmade it an express condition of the cession, that they should be applied\r\nfirst towards the soldiers’ bounties, and the residue sold for the\r\npayment of the national debt, and for no other purpose. This disposition\r\nhas been, accordingly, rigorously made, and is still going on, and\r\nCongress considers itself as having no authority to dispose of them\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI sincerely wish, Sir, it had been in my power to have given you a more\r\nagreeable account of this claim. But as the case actually is, the most\r\nsubstantial service is to state it exactly, and not to foster false\r\nexpectations. I remember with great sensibility all the attentions you\r\nwere so good as to render me while I resided in Paris, and shall be made\r\nhappy by every occasion which can be given me of acknowledging them, and\r\nthe expressions of your friendly recollection are particularly soothing\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nAccept, I pray you, the assurances of my high consideration and constant\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXIX.--TO DOCTOR JOSEPH PRIESTLEY, March 21, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JOSEPH PRIESTLEY.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 21, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI learned some time ago that you were in Philadelphia, but that it was\r\nonly for a fortnight; and I supposed you were gone. It was not till\r\nyesterday I received information that you were still there, had been\r\nvery ill, but were on the recovery. I sincerely rejoice that you are\r\nso. Yours is one of the few lives precious to mankind, and for the\r\ncontinuance of which every thinking man is solicitous. Bigots may be\r\nan exception. What an effort, my dear Sir, of bigotry in politics\r\nand religion have we gone through. The barbarians really flattered\r\nthemselves they should be able to bring back the times of Vandalism,\r\nwhen ignorance put every thing into the hands of power and priestcraft.\r\nAll advances in science were proscribed as innovations. They pretended\r\nto praise and encourage education, but it was to be the education of our\r\nancestors. We were to look backwards not forwards for improvement: the\r\nPresident himself declaring in one of his answers to addresses, that\r\nwe were never to expect to go beyond them in real science. This was the\r\nreal ground of all the attacks on you: those who live by mystery and\r\ncharlatanerie, fearing you would render them useless by simplifying the\r\nChristian philosophy, the most sublime and benevolent but most perverted\r\nsystem that ever shone on man, endeavored to crush your well-earned\r\nand well-deserved fame. But it was the Lilliputians upon Gulliver. Our\r\ncountrymen have recovered from the alarm into which art and industry had\r\nthrown them; science and honesty are replaced on their high ground; and\r\nyou, my dear Sir, as their great apostle, are on its pinnacle. It is\r\nwith heartfelt satisfaction that, in the first moments of my public\r\naction, I can hail you with welcome to our land, tender to you the\r\nhomage of its respect and esteem, cover you under the protection of\r\nthose laws which were made for the wise and good like you, and disclaim\r\nthe legitimacy of that libel on legislation, which under the form of a\r\nlaw was for some time placed among them.*\r\n\r\n     [* In the margin, is written by the author, ‘Alien law.’]\r\n\r\nAs the storm is now subsiding and the horizon becoming serene, it is\r\npleasant to consider the phenomenon with attention. We can no longer\r\nsay there is nothing new under the sun. For this whole chapter in the\r\nhistory of man is new. The great extent of our republic is new. Its\r\nsparse habitation is new. The mighty wave of public opinion which has\r\nrolled over it is new. But the most pleasing novelty is, its so quietly\r\nsubsiding over such an extent of surface to its true level again. The\r\norder and good sense displayed in this recovery from delusion, and in\r\nthe momentous crisis which lately arose, really bespeak a strength\r\nof character in our nation which augurs well for the duration of our\r\nrepublic: and I am much better satisfied now of its stability, than I\r\nwas before it was tried, I have been above all things solaced by\r\nthe prospect which opened on us, in the event of a non-election of a\r\nPresident; in which case, the federal government would have been in the\r\nsituation of a clock or watch run down. There was no idea of force, nor\r\nof any occasion for it. A convention, invited by the republican members\r\nof Congress with the virtual President and Vice-President, would have\r\nbeen on the ground in eight weeks, would have repaired the constitution\r\nwhere it was defective, and wound it up again. This peaceable and\r\nlegitimate resource, to which we are in the habit of implicit obedience,\r\nsuperseding all appeal to force, and being always within our reach,\r\nshows a precious principle of self-preservation in our composition, till\r\na change of circumstances shall take place, which is not within prospect\r\nat any definite period.\r\n\r\nBut I have got into a long disquisition on politics when I only meant to\r\nexpress my sympathy in the state of your health, and to tender you all\r\nthe affections of public and private hospitality. I should be very happy\r\nindeed to see you here. I leave this about the 30th instant, to return\r\nabout the 25th of April. If you do not leave Philadelphia before that,\r\na little excursion hither would help your health. I should be much\r\ngratified with the possession of a guest I so much esteem, and should\r\nclaim a right to lodge you, should you make such an excursion.\r\n\r\nAccept the homage of my high consideration and respect, and assurances\r\nof affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXX.--TO MOSES ROBINSON, March 23,1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MOSES ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 23,1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 3rd instant, and\r\nto thank you for the friendly expressions it contains. I entertain real\r\nhope that the whole body of your fellow-citizens (many of whom had been\r\ncarried away by the X. Y. Z. business) will shortly be consolidated\r\nin the same sentiments. When they examine the real principles of both\r\nparties, I think they will find little to differ about. I know, indeed,\r\nthat there are some of their leaders who have so committed themselves,\r\nthat pride, if no other passion, will prevent their coalescing. We must\r\nbe easy with them. The eastern States will be the last to come over\r\non account of the dominion of the clergy, who had got a smell of union\r\nbetween Church and State, and began to indulge reveries which can never\r\nbe realized in the present state of science. If, indeed, they could\r\nhave prevailed on us to view all advances in science as dangerous\r\ninnovations, and to look back to the opinions and practices of our\r\nforefathers, instead of looking forward, for improvement, a promising\r\ngroundwork would have been laid. But I am in hopes their good sense will\r\ndictate to them, that since the mountain will not come to them, they\r\nhad better go to the mountain: that they will find their interest in\r\nacquiescing in the liberty and science of their country, and that\r\nthe Christian religion, when divested of the rags in which they have\r\nenveloped it, and brought to the original purity and simplicity of its\r\nbenevolent institutor, is a religion of all others most friendly to\r\nliberty, science, and the freest expansion of the human mind.\r\n\r\nI sincerely wish with you, we could see our government so secured as to\r\ndepend less on the character of the person in whose hands it is trusted.\r\nBad men will sometimes get in, and, with such an immense patronage, may\r\nmake great progress in corrupting the public mind and principles. This\r\nis a subject with which wisdom and patriotism should be occupied.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept assurances of my high respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXI.--TO WILLIAM B. GILES, March 23, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 23, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received two days ago your favor of the 16th, and thank you for your\r\nkind felicitations on my election: but whether it will be a subject of\r\nfelicitation permanently, will be for chapters of future history to\r\nsay. The important subjects of the government I meet with some degree\r\nof courage and confidence, because I do believe the talents to be\r\nassociated with me, the honest line of conduct we will religiously\r\npursue at home and abroad, and the confidence of my fellow-citizens\r\ndawning on us, will be equal to these objects.\r\n\r\nBut there is another branch of duty which I must meet with courage\r\ntoo, though I cannot without pain; that is, the appointments and\r\ndisappointments as to offices. Madison and Gallatin being still absent,\r\nwe have not yet decided on our rules of conduct as to these. That some\r\nought to be removed from office, and that all ought not, all mankind\r\nwill agree. But where to draw the line, perhaps no two will agree.\r\nConsequently, nothing like a general approbation on this subject can be\r\nlooked for. Some principles have been the subject of conversation, but\r\nnot of determination; e.g. all appointments to civil offices during\r\npleasure, made after the event of the election was certainly known\r\nto Mr. Adams, are considered as nullities. I do not view the persons\r\nappointed as even candidates for the office, but make others without\r\nnoticing or notifying them. Mr. Adams’s best friends have agreed this\r\nis right. 2. Officers who have been guilty of official mal-conduct are\r\nproper subjects of removal. 3. Good men, to whom there is no objection\r\nbut a difference of political principle, practised on only as far as\r\nthe right of a private citizen will justify, are not proper subjects of\r\nremoval, except in the case of attorneys and marshals. The courts being\r\nso decidedly federal and irremovable, it is believed that republican\r\nattorneys and marshals, being the doors of entrance into the courts,\r\nare indispensably necessary as a shield to the republican part of our\r\nfellow-citizens, which, I believe, is the main body of the people.\r\n\r\nThese principles are yet to be considered of, and I sketch them to\r\nyou in confidence. Not that there is objection to your mooting them as\r\nsubjects of conversation, and as proceeding from yourself, but not as\r\nmatters of executive determination. Nay, farther, I will thank you for\r\nyour own sentiments and those of others on them. If received before the\r\n20th of April, they will be in time for our deliberation on the subject.\r\nYou know that it was in the year X. Y. Z. that so great a transition\r\nfrom us to the other side took place, and with as real republicans as we\r\nwere ourselves; that these, after getting over that delusion, have been\r\nreturning to us, and that it is to that return we owe a triumph in 1800,\r\nwhich in 1799 would have been the other way. The week’s suspension\r\nof the election before Congress, seems almost to have completed that\r\nbusiness, and to have brought over nearly the whole remaining mass. They\r\nnow find themselves with us, and separated from their quondam leaders.\r\nIf we can but avoid shocking their feelings by unnecessary acts of\r\nseverity against their late friends, they will in a little time cement\r\nand from one mass with us, and by these means harmony and union be\r\nrestored to our country, which would be the greatest good we could\r\neffect. It was a conviction that these people did not differ from us\r\nin principle, which induced me to define the principles which I deemed\r\northodox, and to urge a re-union on these principles; and I am induced\r\nto hope it has conciliated many. I do not speak of the desperadoes\r\nof the quondam faction in and out of Congress. These I consider as\r\nincurables, on whom all attentions would be lost, and therefore will not\r\nbe wasted. But my wish is, to keep their flock from returning to them.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the marshal of Virginia, I refer you confidentially to\r\nMajor Egglestone for information. I leave this about this day se’nnight,\r\nto make some arrangements at home preparatory to my final removal to\r\nthis place, from which I shall be absent about three weeks.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant esteem and high consideration and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXII.--TO SAMUEL ADAMS, March 29, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 29, 1801.\r\n\r\nI addressed a letter to you, my very dear and ancient friend, on the 4th\r\nof March: not indeed to you by name, but through the medium of some of\r\nmy fellow-citizens, whom occasion called on me to address. In meditating\r\nthe matter of that address, I often asked myself, Is this exactly in\r\nthe spirit of the patriarch, Samuel Adams? Is it as he would express it?\r\nWill he approve of it? I have felt a great deal for our country in the\r\ntimes we have seen. But individually for no one so much as yourself.\r\nWhen I have been told that you were avoided, insulted, frowned on, I\r\ncould but ejaculate, ‘Father, forgive them, for they know not what they\r\ndo.’ I confess I felt an indignation for you, which for myself I have\r\nbeen able, under every trial, to keep entirely passive. However, the\r\nstorm is over, and we are in port. The ship was not rigged for the\r\nservice she was put on. We will show the smoothness of her motions on\r\nher republican tack. I hope we shall once more see harmony restored\r\namong our citizens, and an entire oblivion of past feuds. Some of the\r\nleaders, who have most committed themselves, cannot come into this.\r\nBut I hope the great body of our fellow-citizens will do it. I will\r\nsacrifice every thing but principle to procure it. A few examples of\r\njustice on officers who have perverted their functions to the oppression\r\nof their fellow-citizens, must, in justice to those citizens, be made.\r\nBut opinion, and the just maintenance of it, shall never be a crime in\r\nmy view; nor bring injury on the individual. Those whose misconduct in\r\noffice ought to have produced their removal even by my predecessor,\r\nmust not be protected by the delicacy due only to honest men. How much\r\nI lament that time has deprived me of your aid. It would have been a\r\nday of glory which should have called you to the first office of the\r\nadministration. But give us your counsel, my friend, and give us your\r\nblessing: and be assured that there exists not in the heart of man a\r\nmore faithful esteem than mine to you, and that I shall ever bear you\r\nthe most affectionate veneration and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXIII..--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY, March 29, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 29, 1801,\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour two letters of January the 5th and February the 24th came safely to\r\nhand, and I thank you for the history of a transaction which will ever\r\nbe interesting in our affairs. It has been very precisely as I had\r\nimagined. I thought, on your return, that if you had come forward\r\nboldly, and appealed to the public by a full statement, it would have\r\nhad a great effect in your favor personally, and that of the republican\r\ncause then oppressed almost unto death. But I judged from a tact of the\r\nsouthern pulse. I suspect that of the north was different, and decided\r\nyour conduct: and perhaps it has been as well. If the revolution of\r\nsentiment has been later, it has perhaps been not less sure. At length\r\nit has arrived. What with the natural current of opinion which has been\r\nsetting over to us for eighteen months, and the immense impetus which\r\nwas given it from the 11th to the 17th of February, we may now say that\r\nthe United States, from New York southwardly, are as unanimous in the\r\nprinciples of ‘76, as they were in ‘76. The only difference is, that the\r\nleaders who remain behind are more numerous and colder than the apostles\r\nof toryism in ‘76. The reason is, that we are now justly more tolerant\r\nthan we could safely have been then, circumstanced as we were. Your part\r\nof the Union, though as absolutely republican as ours, had drunk deeper\r\nof the delusion, and is therefore slower in recovering from it. The\r\naegis of government, and the temples of religion and of justice, have\r\nall been prostituted there to toll us back to the times when we burnt\r\nwitches. But your people will rise again. They will awake like Samson\r\nfrom his sleep, and carry away the gates and the posts of the city. You,\r\nmy friend, are destined to rally them again under their former banners,\r\nand when called to the post, exercise it with firmness and with\r\ninflexible adherence to your own principles. The people will support\r\nyou, notwithstanding the howlings of the ravenous crew from whose jaws\r\nthey are escaping. It will be a great blessing to our country if we can\r\nonce more restore harmony and social love among its citizens. I confess,\r\nas to myself, it is almost the first object of my heart, and one to\r\nwhich I would sacrifice every thing but principle. With the people I\r\nhave hopes of effecting it. But their Coryphæi are incurables. I expect\r\nlittle from them.\r\n\r\nI was not deluded by the eulogiums of the public papers in the first\r\nmoments of change. If they could have continued to get all the loaves\r\nand fishes, that is, if I would have gone over to them, they would\r\ncontinue to eulogize. But I well knew that the moment that such removals\r\nshould take place, as the justice of the preceding administration ought\r\nto have executed, their hue and cry would be set up, and they would\r\ntake their old stand. I shall disregard that also. Mr. Adams’s last\r\nappointments, when he knew he was naming counsellors and aids for me and\r\nnot for himself, I set aside as far as depends on me. Officers who have\r\nbeen guilty of gross abuses of office, such as marshals packing juries,\r\n&c, I shall now remove, as my predecessor ought in justice to have done.\r\nThe instances will be few, and governed by strict rule, and not party\r\npassion. The right of opinion shall suffer no invasion from me. Those\r\nwho have acted well, have nothing to fear, however they may have\r\ndiffered from me in opinion: those who have done ill, however, have\r\nnothing to hope; nor shall I fail to do justice lest it should be\r\nascribed to that difference of opinion. A coalition of sentiments is\r\nnot for the interest of the printers. They, like the clergy, live by the\r\nzeal they can kindle, and the schisms they can create. It is contest\r\nof opinion in politics as well as religion which makes us take great\r\ninterest in them, and bestow our money liberally on those who furnish\r\naliment to our appetite. The mild and simple principles of the Christian\r\nphilosophy would produce too much calm, too much regularity of good,\r\nto extract from its disciples a support for a numerous priesthood, were\r\nthey not to sophisticate it, ramify it, split it into hairs, and\r\ntwist its texts till they cover the divine morality of its author with\r\nmysteries, and require a priesthood to explain them. The Quakers seem to\r\nhave discovered this. They have no priests, therefore no schisms. They\r\njudge of the text by the dictates of common sense and common morality.\r\nSo the printers can never leave us in a state of perfect rest and union\r\nof opinion. They would be no longer useful, and would have to go to\r\nthe plough. In the first moments of quietude which have succeeded the\r\nelection, they seem to have aroused their lying faculties beyond their\r\nordinary state, to re-agitate the public mind. What appointments to\r\noffice have they detailed which had never been thought of, merely to\r\nfound a text for their calumniating commentaries. However, the steady\r\ncharacter of our countrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor:\r\nand notwithstanding the efforts of the papers to disseminate early\r\ndiscontents, I expect that a just, dispassionate, and steady conduct\r\nwill at length rally to a proper system the great body of our country.\r\nUnequivocal in principle, reasonable in manner, we shall be able, I\r\nhope, to do a great deal of good to the cause of freedom and harmony. I\r\nshall be happy to hear from you often, to know your own sentiments\r\nand those of others on the course of things, and to concur with you in\r\nefforts for the common good. Your letters through the post will now\r\ncome safely. Present my best respects to Mrs. Gerry, and accept yourself\r\nassurances of my constant esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXIV.--TO GIDEON GRANGER, May 3, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GIDEON GRANGER.\r\n\r\nWashington, May 3, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 29th of March. Yours of the 25th of that month, with\r\nthe address it covered, had not reached this place on the 1st of April,\r\nwhen I set out on a short visit to my residence in Virginia, where some\r\narrangements were necessary previous to my settlement here. In fact,\r\nyour letter came to me at Monticello only the 24th of April, two\r\ndays before my departure from thence. This, I hope, will sufficiently\r\napologize for the delay of the answer, which those unapprized of these\r\ncircumstances will have thought extraordinary.\r\n\r\nA new subject of congratulation has arisen. I mean the regeneration of\r\nRhode Island. I hope it is the beginning of that resurrection of the\r\ngenuine spirit of New England which rises for life eternal. According\r\nto natural order, Vermont will emerge next, because least, after Rhode\r\nIsland, under the yoke of hierocracy. I have never dreamed that all\r\nopposition was to cease. The clergy, who have missed their union with\r\nthe State, the Anglomen, who have missed their union with England, and\r\nthe political adventurers, who have lost the chance of swindling and\r\nplunder in the waste of public money, will never cease to bawl, on the\r\nbreaking up of their sanctuary. But among the people, the schism is\r\nhealed, and with tender treatment the wound will not re-open. Their\r\nquondam leaders have been astounded with the suddenness of the\r\ndesertion: and their silence and appearance of acquiescence have\r\nproceeded not from a thought of joining us, but the uncertainty\r\nwhat ground to take. The very first acts of the administration, the\r\nnominations, have accordingly furnished something to yelp on; and all\r\nour subsequent acts will furnish them fresh matter, because there is\r\nnothing against which human ingenuity will not be able to find something\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my sincere attachment and high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXV.--TO NATHANIEL MACON, May 14, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATHANIEL MACON.\r\n\r\nWashington, May 14, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of April the 20th and 23rd had been received, and the\r\ncommission made out for Mr. Potts, before I received the letter of the\r\n1st instant. I have still thought it better to forward the commission,\r\nin the hope that reconsideration, or the influence of yourself and\r\nfriends, might induce an acceptance of it. Should it be otherwise, you\r\nmust recommend some other good person, as I had rather be guided by your\r\nopinion than that of the person you refer me to. Perhaps Mr. Potts may\r\nbe willing to stop the gap till you meet and repeal the law. If he does\r\nnot, let me receive a recommendation from you as quickly as possible.\r\nAnd in all cases, when an office becomes vacant in your State, as the\r\ndistance would occasion a great delay, were you to wait to be regularly\r\nconsulted, I shall be much obliged to you to recommend the best\r\ncharacters. There is nothing I am so anxious about as making the best\r\npossible appointments, and no case in which the best men are more liable\r\nto mislead us, by yielding to the solicitations of applicants. For this\r\nreason your own spontaneous recommendation would be desirable. Now to\r\nanswer your particulars, _seriatim_.\r\n\r\nLevees are done away.\r\n\r\nThe first communication to the nest Congress will be, like all\r\nsubsequent ones, by message, to which no answer will be expected.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic establishment in Europe will be reduced to three\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nThe compensations to collectors depend on you, and not on me.\r\n\r\nThe army is undergoing a chaste reformation.\r\n\r\nThe navy will be reduced to the legal establishment by the last of this\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAgencies in every department will be revised.\r\n\r\nWe shall push you to the uttermost in economizing.\r\n\r\nA very early recommendation had been given to the Postmaster-General\r\nto employ no printer, foreigner, or revolutionary tory in any of his\r\noffices. This department is still untouched.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Mr. Gallatin, yesterday, completed the organization of\r\nour administration.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my sincere esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXVI.--TO LEVI LINCOLN, July 11, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 11, 1801,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 15th came to hand on the 25th of June, and conveyed\r\na great deal of that information which I am anxious to receive. The\r\nconsolidation of our fellow-citizens in general is the great object we\r\nought to keep in view; and that being once obtained, while we\r\nassociate with us in affairs, to a certain degree, the federal sect\r\nof republicans, we must strip of all the means of influence the Essex\r\njunto, and their associate monocrats in every part of the Union. The\r\nformer differ from us only in the shades of power to be given to the\r\nexecutive, being, with us, attached to republican government. The latter\r\nwish to sap the republic by fraud, if they cannot destroy it by force,\r\nand to erect an English monarchy in its place; some of them (as Mr.\r\nAdams) thinking its corrupt parts should be cleansed away, others (as\r\nHamilton) thinking that would make it an impracticable machine. We are\r\nproceeding gradually in the regeneration of offices, and introducing\r\nrepublicans to some share in them. I do not know that it will be pushed\r\nfurther than was settled before you went away, except as to Essex men.\r\nI must ask you to make out a list of those in office in yours and the\r\nneighboring States, and to furnish me with it. There is little of\r\nthis spirit south of the Hudson. I understand that Jackson is a very\r\ndetermined one, though in private life amiable and honorable. But\r\namiable monarchists are not safe subjects of republican confidence.\r\nWhat will be the effect of his removal? How should it be timed? Who his\r\nsuccessor? What place can General Lyman properly occupy? Our gradual\r\nreformations seem to produce good effects every where except in\r\nConnecticut. Their late session of legislature has been more intolerant\r\nthan all others. We must meet them with equal intolerance. When they\r\nwill give a share in the State offices, they shall be replaced in a\r\nshare of the General offices. Till then we must follow their example.\r\nMr. Goodrich’s removal has produced a bitter remonstrance, with much\r\npersonality against the two Bishops. I am sincerely sorry to see the\r\ninflexibility of the federal spirit there, for I cannot believe they are\r\nall monarchists.\r\n\r\nI observe your tory papers make much of the Berceau. As that is one of\r\nthe subjects to be laid before Congress, it is material to commit to\r\nwriting, while fresh in memory, the important circumstances. You possess\r\nmore of these than any other person. I pray you, therefore, immediately\r\nto state to me all the circumstances you recollect. I will aid you with\r\nthe following hints, which you can correct and incorporate. Pichon, I\r\nthink, arrived about the 12th of March. I do not remember when he first\r\nproposed the question about the Insurgente and Berceau. On the 20th of\r\nMarch, Mr. Stoddart wrote to his agent at Boston to put the Berceau\r\ninto handsome order to be restored, but whether he did that of his own\r\naccord, or after previous consultation with you or myself, I do not\r\nrecollect. I set out for Monticello April the 1st. About that time\r\nGeneral Smith sent new directions to put her precisely into the state in\r\nwhich she was before the capture. Do you recollect from what fund it\r\nwas contemplated to do this? I had trusted for this to Stoddart who was\r\nfamiliar with all the funds, being myself entirely new in office at that\r\ntime. What will those repairs have cost? Did we not leave to Le Tombe to\r\nmake what allowance he thought proper to the officers, we only advancing\r\nmoney on his undertaking repayment? I shall hope to receive from you as\r\nfull a statement as you can make. It may be useful to inquire into the\r\ntime and circumstances of her being dismantled. When you shall have\r\nretraced the whole matter in your memory, would it not be well to make\r\na summary statement of the important circumstances for insertion in the\r\nChronicle in order to set the minds of the candid part of the public to\r\nrights? Mr. Madison has had a slight bilious attack. I am advising\r\nhim to get off by the middle of this month. We who have stronger\r\nconstitutions shall stay to the end of it. But during August and\r\nSeptember, we also must take refuge in climates rendered safer by our\r\nhabits and confidence. The post will be so arranged as that letters will\r\ngo hence to Monticello, and the answer return here in a week. I hope I\r\nshall continue to hear from you there.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my affectionate esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. The French convention was laid before the Senate December the\r\n16th. I think the Berceau arrived afterwards. If so, she was dismantled\r\nwhen it was known she was to be restored. When did she arrive? By whose\r\norders was she dismantled?

Not because my position\r\ngives me any prejudice on the occasion; for if it be possible to\r\nbe certainly conscious of any thing, I am conscious of feeling no\r\ndifference between writing to the highest and lowest being on earth; but\r\nbecause I have ever thought that forms should yield to whatever should\r\nfacilitate business. Comparing the two governments together, it is\r\nobservable that in all those cases where the independent or reserved\r\nrights of the States are in question, the two executives, if they are\r\nto act together, must be exactly co-ordinate; they are, in these cases,\r\neach the supreme head of an independent government. In other cases, to\r\nwit, those transferred by the constitution to the General Government,\r\nthe general executive is certainly pre-ordinate; e.g. in a question\r\nrespecting the militia, and others easily to be recollected. Were there,\r\ntherefore, to be a stiff adherence to etiquette, I should say that in\r\nthe former cases the correspondence should be between the two heads, and\r\nthat in the latter, the Governor must be subject to receive orders from\r\nthe war department as any other subordinate officer would. And were it\r\nobserved that either party set up unjustifiable pretensions, perhaps\r\nthe other might be right in opposing them by a tenaciousness of his\r\nown rigorous rights. But I think the practice in General Washington’s\r\nadministration was most friendly to business, and was absolutely\r\nequal; sometimes he wrote to the Governors, and sometimes the heads of\r\ndepartments wrote. If a letter is to be on a general subject, I see\r\nno reason why the President should not write; but if it is to go into\r\ndetails, these being known only to the head of the department, it is\r\nbetter he should write directly. Otherwise, the correspondence must\r\ninvolve circuities. If this be practised promiscuously in both classes\r\nof cases, each party setting examples of neglecting etiquette, both will\r\nstand on equal ground, and convenience alone will dictate through whom\r\nany particular communication is to be made. On the whole, I think a free\r\ncorrespondence best, and shall never hesitate to write myself to the\r\nGovernors, in every federal case, where the occasion presents itself to\r\nme particularly. Accept assurances of my sincere and constant affection\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXVIII.--TO A COMMITTEE OF MERCHANTS, July 12, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Elias Shipman and Others, a Committee of the Merchants of New\r\nHaven_.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 12, 1801.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI have received the remonstrance you were pleased to address to me,\r\non the appointment of Samuel Bishop to the office of Collector of New\r\nHaven, lately vacated by the death of David Austin. The right of our\r\nfellow-citizens to represent to the public functionaries their opinion\r\non proceedings interesting to them, is unquestionably a constitutional\r\nright, often useful, sometimes necessary, and will always be\r\nrespectfully acknowledged by me.\r\n\r\nOf the various executive duties, no one excites more anxious concern\r\nthan that of placing the interests of our fellow-citizens in the hands\r\nof honest men, with understandings sufficient for their stations. No\r\nduty, at the same time, is more difficult to fulfil. The knowledge of\r\ncharacters possessed by a single individual is, of necessity, limited.\r\nTo seek out the best through the whole Union, we must resort to other\r\ninformation, which from the best of men, acting disinterestedly and\r\nwith the purest motives, is sometimes incorrect. In the case of Samuel\r\nBishop, however, the subject of your remonstrance, time was taken,\r\ninformation was sought, and such obtained as could leave no room for\r\ndoubt of his fitness. From private sources it was learned that his\r\nunderstanding was sound, his integrity pure, his character unstained.\r\nAnd the offices, confided to him within his own State, are public\r\nevidences of the estimation in which he is held by the State in general,\r\nand the city and township particularly in which he lives. He is said\r\nto be the town clerk, a justice of the peace, mayor of the city of New\r\nHaven, an office held at the will of the legislature, chief judge of the\r\ncourt of common pleas for New Haven county, a court of high criminal and\r\ncivil jurisdiction, wherein most causes are decided without the right\r\nof appeal or review, and sole judge of the court of probate, wherein he\r\nsingly decides all questions of wills, settlement of estates, testate\r\nand intestate, appoints guardians, settles their accounts, and in fact\r\nhas under his jurisdiction and care all the property, real and personal,\r\nof persons dying. The two last offices, in the annual gift of the\r\nlegislature, were given to him in May last. Is it possible that the man\r\nto whom the legislature of Connecticut has so recently committed trusts\r\nof such difficulty and magnitude, is ‘unfit to be the collector of the\r\ndistrict of New Haven,’ though acknowledged in the same writing, to\r\nhave obtained all this confidence ‘by a long life of usefulness?’ It is\r\nobjected, indeed, in the remonstrance, that he is seventy-seven years of\r\nage; but at a much more advanced age, our Franklin was the ornament of\r\nhuman nature. He may not be able to perform in person, all the details\r\nof his office; but if he gives us the benefit of his understanding, his\r\nintegrity, his watchfulness, and takes care that all the details are\r\nwell performed by himself or his necessary assistants, all public\r\npurposes will be answered. The remonstrance, indeed, does not allege\r\nthat the office has been illy conducted, but only apprehends that it\r\nwill be so. Should this happen in event, be assured I will do in it what\r\nshall be just and necessary for the public service. In the mean time, he\r\nshould be tried without being prejudged.\r\n\r\nThe removal, as it is called, of Mr. Goodrich, forms another subject\r\nof complaint. Declarations by myself in favor of political tolerance,\r\nexhortations to harmony and affection in social intercourse, and\r\nto respect for the equal rights of the minority, have, on certain\r\noccasions, been quoted and misconstrued into assurances that the\r\ntenure of offices was to be undisturbed. But could candor apply such a\r\nconstruction? It is not indeed in the remonstrance that we find it;\r\nbut it leads to the explanations which that calls for. When it is\r\nconsidered, that during the late administration, those who were not of\r\na particular sect of politics were excluded from all office; when, by a\r\nsteady pursuit of this measure, nearly the whole offices of the United\r\nStates were monopolized by that sect; when the public sentiment at\r\nlength declared itself, and burst open the doors of honor and confidence\r\nto those whose opinions they more approved; was it to be imagined that\r\nthis monopoly of office was still to be continued in the hands of the\r\nminority? Does it violate their equal rights, to assert some rights in\r\nthe majority also? Is it political intolerance to claim a proportionate\r\nshare in the direction of the public affairs? Can they not harmonize in\r\nsociety unless they have every thing in their own hands? If the will\r\nof the nation, manifested by their various elections, calls for an\r\nadministration of government according with the opinions of those\r\nelected; if, for the fulfilment of that will, displacements are\r\nnecessary, with whom can they so justly begin as with persons appointed\r\nin the last moments of an administration, not for its own aid, but to\r\nbegin a career at the same time with their successors, by whom they had\r\nnever been approved, and who could scarcely expect from them a cordial\r\nco-operation? Mr Goodrich was one of these. Was it proper for him to\r\nplace himself in office, without knowing whether those whose agent he\r\nwas to be, would have confidence in his agency? Can the preference of\r\nanother as the successor to Mr. Austin, be candidly called a removal of\r\nMr. Goodrich? If a due participation of office is a matter of right,\r\nhow are vacancies to be obtained? Those by death are few; by resignation\r\nnone. Can any other mode than that of removal be proposed? This is a\r\npainful office. But it is made my duty, and I meet it as such. I proceed\r\nin the operation with deliberation and inquiry, that it may injure the\r\nbest men least, and effect the purposes of justice and public utility\r\nwith the least private distress; that it may be thrown, as much\r\nas possible, on delinquency, on oppression, on intolerance, on\r\nanti-revolutionary adherence to our enemies.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance laments ‘that a change in the administration must\r\nproduce a change in the subordinate officers;’ in other words, that\r\nit should be deemed necessary for all officers to think with their\r\nprincipal? But on whom does this imputation bear? On those who have\r\nexcluded from office every shade of opinion which was not theirs? Or\r\non those who have been so excluded? I lament sincerely that unessential\r\ndifferences of opinion should ever have been deemed sufficient to\r\ninterdict half the society from, the rights and the blessings of\r\nself-government, to proscribe them as unworthy of every trust. It would\r\nhave been to me a circumstance of great relief, had I found a moderate\r\nparticipation of office in the hands of the majority. I would gladly\r\nhave left to time and accident to raise them to their just share. But\r\ntheir total exclusion calls for prompter corrections. I shall correct\r\nthe procedure: but that done, return with joy to that state of things,\r\nwhen the only questions concerning a candidate shall be, Is he honest?\r\nIs he capable? Is he faithful to the constitution?\r\n\r\nI tender you the homage of my high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCLXXXIX.--TO LEVI LINCOLN, August 26, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 26, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of July the 28th was received here on the 20th instant. The\r\nsuperscription of my letter of July the 11th, by another hand, was to\r\nprevent danger to it from the curious. Your statement respecting\r\nthe Berceau coincided with my own recollection, in the circumstances\r\nrecollected by me, and I concur with you in supposing it may not now\r\nbe necessary to give any explanations on the subject in the papers. The\r\npurchase was made by our predecessors, and the repairs begun by them.\r\nHad she been to continue ours, we were authorized to put and keep her in\r\ngood order out of the fund of the naval contingencies, and when in good\r\norder, we obeyed a law of the land, the treaty, in giving her up. It\r\nis true the treaty was not ratified; but when ratified it is validated\r\nretrospectively. We took on ourselves this risk, but France had put more\r\ninto our hands on the same risk. I do not know whether the clamor, as\r\nto the allowance to the French officers of their regular pay, has\r\nbeen rectified by a statement that it was on the request of the French\r\nConsul, and his promise to repay it. So that they cost the United\r\nStates, on this arrangement, nothing.\r\n\r\nI am glad to learn from you that the answer to New Haven had a good\r\neffect in Massachusetts on the republicans, and no ill effects on\r\nthe sincere federalists. I had foreseen, years ago, that the first\r\nrepublican President who should come into office after all the places\r\nin the government had become exclusively occupied by federalists, would\r\nhave a dreadful operation to perform. That the republicans would\r\nconsent to a continuation of every thing in federal hands, was not to be\r\nexpected, because neither just nor politic. On him then was to devolve\r\nthe office of an executioner, that of lopping off. I cannot say that it\r\nhas worked harder than I expected. You know the moderation of our views\r\nin this business, and that we all concurred in them. We determined to\r\nproceed with deliberation. This produced impatience in the republicans,\r\nand a belief we meant to do nothing. Some occasion of public explanation\r\nwas eagerly desired, when the New Haven remonstrance offered us that\r\noccasion. The answer was meant as an explanation to our friends. It\r\nhas had on them, everywhere, the most wholesome effect. Appearances of\r\nschismatizing from us have been entirely done away. I own I expected\r\nit would check the current, with which the republican federalists were\r\nreturning to their brethren, the republicans. I extremely lamented this\r\neffect. For the moment which should convince me that a healing of\r\nthe nation into one, is impracticable, would be the last moment of my\r\nwishing to remain where I am. (Of the monarchical federalists, I have no\r\nexpectations. They are incurables, to be taken care of in a mad-house\r\nif necessary, and on motives of charity.) I am much pleased, therefore,\r\nwith your information that the republican federalists are still coming\r\nin to the desired union. The eastern newspapers had given me a different\r\nimpression, because I supposed the printers knew the taste of their\r\ncustomers, and cooked their dishes to their palates. The Palladium is\r\nunderstood to be the clerical paper, and from the clergy I expect no\r\nmercy. They crucified their Savior who preached that their kingdom was\r\nnot of this world, and all who practise on that precept must expect the\r\nextreme of their wrath. The laws of the present day withhold their hands\r\nfrom blood. But lies and slander still remain to them.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the heaping of abuse on me personally, has been with\r\nthe design and the hope of provoking me to make a general sweep of all\r\nfederalists out of office. But as I have carried no passion into the\r\nexecution of this disagreeable duty, I shall suffer none to be excited.\r\nThe clamor which has been raised will not provoke me to remove one more,\r\nnor deter me from removing one less, than if not a word had been said on\r\nthe subject. In Massachusetts you may be assured, great moderation will\r\nbe used. Indeed, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nDelaware are the only States where any thing considerable is desired. In\r\nthe course of the summer all which is necessary will be done; and we may\r\nhope that this cause of offence being at an end, the measures we shall\r\npursue and propose for the amelioration of the public affairs, will\r\nbe so confessedly salutary as to unite all men not monarchists in\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nWe have considerable hopes of republican Senators from South Carolina,\r\nMaryland, and Delaware, and some as to Vermont. In any event we are\r\nsecure of a majority in the Senate; and consequently that there will be\r\na concert of action between the legislature and executive. The removal\r\nof excrescences from the judiciary, is the universal demand. We propose\r\nto re-assemble at Washington on the last day of September. Accept\r\nassurances of my affectionate esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXC.--TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, September 9, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\nMonticello, September 9, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou will receive, probably by this post, from the Secretary of State,\r\nhis final instructions for your mission to France. We have not thought\r\nit necessary to say any thing in them on the great question of the\r\nmaritime law of nations, which at present agitates Europe, that is to\r\nsay, whether free ships shall make free goods; because we do not mean to\r\ntake any side in it during the war. But as I had before communicated to\r\nyou some loose thoughts on that subject, and have since considered it\r\nwith somewhat more attention, I have thought it might be useful that you\r\nshould possess my ideas in a more matured form than that in which they\r\nwere before given. Unforeseen circumstances may perhaps oblige you to\r\nhazard an opinion on some occasion or other, on this subject, and it is\r\nbetter that it should not be at variance with Ours. I write this\r\ntoo, myself, that it may not be considered as official, but merely\r\nmy individual opinion, unadvised by those official counsellors whose\r\nopinions I deem my safest guide, and should unquestionably take in form\r\nwere circumstances to call for a solemn decision of the question.\r\n\r\nWhen Europe assumed the general form in which it is occupied by the\r\nnations now composing it, and turned its attention to maritime commerce,\r\nwe find among its earliest practices, that of taking the goods of an\r\nenemy from the ship of a friend; and that into this practice every\r\nmaritime State went sooner or later, as it appeared on the theatre of\r\nthe ocean. If, therefore, we are to consider the practice of nations as\r\nthe sole and sufficient evidence of the law of nature among nations, we\r\nshould unquestionably place this principle among those of the natural\r\nlaws. But its inconveniences, as they affected neutral nations peaceably\r\npursuing their commerce, and its tendency to embroil them with the\r\npowers happening to be at war, and thus to extend the flames of war,\r\ninduced nations to introduce by special compacts, from time to time, a\r\nmore convenient rule; that ‘free ships should make free goods’: and\r\nthis latter principle has by every maritime nation of Europe been\r\nestablished, to a greater or less degree, in its treaties with other\r\nnations; insomuch, that all of them have, more or less frequently,\r\nassented to it, as a rule of action in particular cases. Indeed, it is\r\nnow urged, and I think with great appearance of reason, that this is\r\nthe genuine principle dictated by national morality; and that the first\r\npractice arose from accident, and the particular convenience of the\r\nStates [* Venice and Genoa] which first figured on the water, rather\r\nthan from well digested reflections on the relations of friend and\r\nenemy, on the rights of territorial jurisdiction, and on the dictates of\r\nmoral law applied to these. Thus it had never been supposed lawful, in\r\nthe territory of a friend to seize the goods of an enemy. On an element\r\nwhich nature has not subjected to the jurisdiction of any particular\r\nnation, but has made common to all for the purposes to which it is\r\nfitted, it would seem that the particular portion of it which happens\r\nto be occupied by the vessel of any nation, in the course of its voyage,\r\nis, for the moment, the exclusive property of that nation, and, with\r\nthe vessel, is exempt from intrusion by any other, and from its\r\njurisdiction, as much as if it were lying in the harbor of its\r\nsovereign. In no country, we believe, is the rule otherwise, as to\r\nthe subjects of property common to all. Thus the place occupied by an\r\nindividual in a highway, a church, a theatre, or other public assembly,\r\ncannot be intruded on, while its occupant holds it for the purposes of\r\nits institution. The persons on board a vessel traversing the ocean,\r\ncarrying with them the laws of their nation, have among themselves a\r\njurisdiction, a police, not established by their individual will, but\r\nby the authority of their nation, of whose territory their vessel still\r\nseems to compose a part, so long as it does not enter the exclusive\r\nterritory of another. No nation ever pretended a right to govern by\r\ntheir laws the ships of another nation navigating the ocean. By what law\r\nthen can it enter that ship while in peaceable and orderly use of the\r\ncommon element? We recognise no natural precept for submission to such\r\na right; and perceive no distinction between the movable and immovable\r\njurisdiction of a friend, which would authorize the entering the one and\r\nnot the other, to seize the property of an enemy.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this proves too much, as it proves you cannot\r\nenter the ship of a friend to search for contraband of war. But this is\r\nnot proving too much. We believe the practice of seizing what is called\r\ncontraband of war, is an abusive practice, not founded in natural right.\r\nWar between two nations cannot diminish the rights of the rest of\r\nthe world remaining at peace. The doctrine that the rights of nations\r\nremaining quietly in the exercise of moral and social duties, are to\r\ngive way to the convenience of those who prefer plundering and murdering\r\none another, is a monstrous doctrine; and ought to yield to the more\r\nrational law, that ‘the wrong which two nations endeavor to inflict on\r\neach other, must not infringe on the rights or conveniences of those\r\nremaining at peace.’ And what is contraband, by the law of nature?\r\nEither every thing which may aid or comfort an enemy, or nothing. Either\r\nall commerce which would accommodate him is unlawful, or none is.\r\nThe difference between articles of one or another description, is a\r\ndifference in degree only. No line between them can be drawn. Either\r\nall intercourse must cease between neutrals and belligerents, or all be\r\npermitted. Can the world hesitate to say which shall be the rule?\r\nShall two nations turning tigers, break up in one instant the peaceable\r\nrelations of the whole world? Reason and nature clearly pronounce that\r\nthe neutral is to go on in the enjoyment of all its rights, that its\r\ncommerce remains free, not subject to the jurisdiction of another,\r\nnor consequently its vessels to search, or to inquiries whether their\r\ncontents are the property of an enemy, or are of those which have been\r\ncalled contraband of war.\r\n\r\nNor does this doctrine contravene the right of preventing vessels from\r\nentering a blockaded port. This right stands on other ground. When the\r\nfleet of any nation actually beleaguers the port of its enemy, no other\r\nhas a right to enter their line, any more than their line of battle in\r\nthe open sea, or their lines of circumvallation, or of encampment, or\r\nof battle-array on land. The space included within their lines in any\r\nof those cases, is either the property of their enemy, or it is common\r\nproperty assumed and possessed for the moment, which cannot be intruded\r\non, even by a neutral, without committing the very trespass we are now\r\nconsidering, that of intruding into the lawful possession of a friend.\r\n\r\nAlthough I consider the observance of these principles as of great\r\nimportance to the interests of peaceable nations, among whom I hope the\r\nUnited States will ever place themselves, yet in the present state of\r\nthings they are not worth a war. Nor do I believe war the most certain\r\nmeans of enforcing them. Those peaceable coercions which are in the\r\npower of every nation, if undertaken in concert and in time of peace,\r\nare more likely to produce the desired effect.\r\n\r\nThe opinions I have here given, are those which have generally been\r\nsanctioned by our government. In our treaties with France, the United\r\nNetherlands, Sweden, and Prussia, the principle of free bottom, free\r\ngoods, was uniformly maintained. In the instructions of 1784, given\r\nby Congress to their Ministers appointed to treat with the nations of\r\nEurope generally, the same principle, and the doing away contraband\r\nof war, were enjoined, and were acceded to in the treaty signed\r\nwith Portugal. In the late treaty with England, indeed, that power\r\nperseveringly refused the principle of free bottoms, free goods; and it\r\nwas avoided in the late treaty with Prussia, at the instance of our\r\nthen administration, lest it should seem to take side in a question\r\nthen threatening decision by the sword. At the commencement of the war\r\nbetween France and England, the representative of the French republic\r\nthen residing in the United States, complaining that the British armed\r\nships captured French property in American bottoms, insisted that the\r\nprinciple of ‘free bottoms, free goods,’ was of the acknowledged law of\r\nnations; that the violation of that principle by the British was a wrong\r\ncommitted on us, and such an one as we ought to repel by joining in the\r\nwar against that country. We denied his position, and appealed to the\r\nuniversal practice of Europe, in proof that the principle of ‘free\r\nbottoms, free goods,’ was not acknowledged as of the natural law of\r\nnations, but only of its conventional law. And I believe we may safely\r\naffirm, that not a single instance can be produced where any nation of\r\nEurope, acting professedly under the law of nations alone, unrestrained\r\nby treaty, has, either by its executive or judiciary organs, decided\r\non the principle of ‘free bottoms, free goods.’ Judging of the law of\r\nnations by what has been practised among nations, we were authorized\r\nto say that the contrary principle was their rule, and this but an\r\nexception to it, introduced by special treaties in special cases only;\r\nthat having no treaty with England substituting this instead of the\r\nordinary rule, we had neither the right nor the disposition to go to war\r\nfor its establishment. But though we would not then, nor will we now,\r\nengage in war to establish this principle, we are nevertheless sincerely\r\nfriendly to it. We think that the nations of Europe have originally set\r\nout in error; that experience has proved the error oppressive to the\r\nrights and interests of the peaceable part of mankind; that every nation\r\nbut one has acknowledged this, by consenting to the change, and that one\r\nhas consented in particular cases; that nations have a right to correct\r\nan erroneous principle, and to establish that which is right as their\r\nrule of action; and if they should adopt measures for effecting this in\r\na peaceable way, we shall wish them success, and not stand in their way\r\nto it. But should it become, at any time, expedient for us to co-operate\r\nin the establishment of this principle, the opinion of the executive,\r\non the advice of its constitutional counsellors, must then be given;\r\nand that of the legislature, an independent and essential organ in\r\nthe operation, must also be expressed; in forming which, they will be\r\ngoverned, every man by his own judgment, and may, very possibly, judge\r\ndifferently from the executive. With the same honest views, the most\r\nhonest men often form different conclusions. As far, however, as we can\r\njudge, the principle of ‘free bottoms, free goods,’ is that which would\r\ncarry the wishes of our nation.\r\n\r\nWishing you smooth seas and prosperous gales, with the enjoyment of good\r\nhealth, I tender you the assurances of my constant friendship and high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCI.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, October 3, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 3, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI trusted to Mr. Dawson to give you a full explanation, verbally, on\r\na subject which I find he has but slightly mentioned to you. I shall\r\ntherefore now do it. When I returned from France, after an absence of\r\nsix or seven years, I was astonished at the change which I found had\r\ntaken place in the United States in that time. No more like the same\r\npeople; their notions, their habits and manners, the course of their\r\ncommerce, so totally changed, that I, who stood in those of 1784, found\r\nmyself not at all qualified to speak their sentiments, or forward their\r\nviews in 1790. Very soon, therefore, after entering on the office of\r\nSecretary of State, I recommended to General Washington to establish\r\nas a rule of practice, that no person should be continued on foreign\r\nmission beyond an absence of six, seven, or eight years. He approved it.\r\nOn the only subsequent Missions which took place in my time, the persons\r\nappointed were notified that they could not be continued beyond that\r\nperiod. All returned within it except Humphreys. His term was not\r\nquite out when General Washington went out of office. The succeeding\r\nadministration had no rule for any thing: so he continued. Immediately\r\non my coming to the administration, I wrote to him myself, reminded him\r\nof the rule I had communicated to him on his departure; that he had then\r\nbeen absent about eleven years, and consequently must return. On\r\nthis ground solely he was superseded. Under these circumstances, your\r\nappointment was impossible after an absence of seventeen years. Under\r\nany others, I should never fail to give to yourself and the world proofs\r\nof my friendship for you, and of my confidence in you. Whenever you\r\nshall return, you will be sensible in a greater, of what I was in a\r\nsmaller degree, of the change in this nation from what it was when we\r\nboth left it in 1784. We return like foreigners, and, like them, require\r\na considerable residence here to become Americanized.\r\n\r\nThe state of political opinion continues to return steadily towards\r\nrepublicanism. To judge from the opposition papers, a stranger would\r\nsuppose that a considerable check to it had been produced by certain\r\nremovals of public officers. But this is not the case. All offices\r\nwere in the hands of the federalists. The injustice of having totally\r\nexcluded republicans was acknowledged by every man. To have removed one\r\nhalf, and to have placed republicans in their stead, would have been\r\nrigorously just, when it was known that these composed a very great\r\nmajority of the nation. Yet such was their moderation in most of the\r\nStates that they did not desire it. In these, therefore, no removals\r\ntook place but for malversation. In the middle States the contention had\r\nbeen higher, spirits were more sharpened and less accommodating. It was\r\nnecessary in these to practise a different treatment, and to make a few\r\nchanges to tranquillize the injured party. A few have been made there,\r\na very few still remain to be made. When this painful operation shall be\r\nover, I see nothing else ahead of us which can give uneasiness to any of\r\nour citizens, or retard that consolidation of sentiment so essential to\r\nour happiness and our strength. The tory papers will still find fault\r\nwith every thing. But these papers are sinking daily, from their\r\ndissonance with the sentiments of their subscribers, and very few will\r\nshortly remain to keep up a solitary and ineffectual barking.\r\n\r\nThere is no point in which an American, long absent from his country,\r\nwanders so widely from its sentiments as on the subject of its foreign\r\naffairs. We have a perfect horror at every thing like connecting\r\nourselves with the politics of Europe. It would indeed be advantageous\r\nto us to have neutral rights established on a broad ground; but no\r\ndependence can be placed in any European coalition for that. They have\r\nso many other by-interests of greater weight, that some one or other\r\nwill always be bought off. To be entangled with them would be a much\r\ngreater evil than a temporary acquiescence in the false principles which\r\nhave prevailed. Peace is our most important interest, and a recovery\r\nfrom debt. We feel ourselves strong, and daily growing stronger. The\r\ncensus just now concluded, shows we have added to our population a third\r\nof what it was ten years ago. This will be a duplication in twenty three\r\nor twenty-four years. If we can delay but for a few years the necessity\r\nof vindicating the laws of nature on the ocean, we shall be the more\r\nsure of doing it with effect. The day is within my time as well as\r\nyours, when we may say by what laws other nations shall treat us on the\r\nsea. And we will say it. In the meantime, we wish to let every treaty\r\nwe have drop off without renewal. We call in our diplomatic missions,\r\nbarely keeping up those to the most important nations. There is a\r\nstrong disposition in our countrymen to discontinue even these; and\r\nvery possibly it may be done. Consuls will be continued as usual. The\r\ninterest which European nations feel, as well as ourselves, in the\r\nmutual patronage of commercial intercourse, is a sufficient stimulus\r\non both sides to insure that patronage. A treaty, contrary to that\r\ninterest, renders war necessary to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nI send this by Chancellor Livingston, named to the Senate the day after\r\nI came into office, as our Minister Plenipotentiary to France. I have\r\ntaken care to impress him with the value of your society. You will find\r\nhim an able and honorable man; unfortunately, so deaf that he will have\r\nto transact all his business by writing. You will have known long ago,\r\nthat Mr. Skipwith is reinstated in his consulship, as well as some\r\nothers who had been set aside. I recollect no domestic news interesting\r\nto you. Your letters to your brother have been regularly transmitted,\r\nand I lately forwarded one from him, to be carried you by Mr.\r\nLivingston.\r\n\r\nPresent my best respects to our amiable and mutual friend, and accept\r\nyourself assurances of my sincere and constant affection.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCII.--TO THE HEADS OF THE DEPARTMENTS, November 6, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circular to the Heads of the Departments, and private_.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 6, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nComing all of us into executive office, new, and unfamiliar with the\r\ncourse of business previously practised, it was not to be expected, we\r\nshould, in the first outset, adopt in every part a line of proceeding so\r\nperfect as to admit no amendment. The mode and degrees of communication,\r\nparticularly between the President and heads of departments, have not\r\nbeen practised exactly on the same scale in all of them. Yet it would\r\ncertainly be more safe and satisfactory for ourselves as well as the\r\npublic, that not only the best, but also an uniform course of proceeding\r\nas to manner and degree, should be observed. Having been a member of\r\nthe first administration under General Washington, I can state with\r\nexactness what our course then was. Letters of business came addressed\r\nsometimes to the President, but most frequently to the heads of\r\ndepartments. If addressed to himself, he referred them to the proper\r\ndepartment to be acted on: if to one of the secretaries, the letter, if\r\nit required no answer, was communicated to the President, simply for his\r\ninformation. If an answer was requisite, the secretary of the department\r\ncommunicated the letter and his proposed answer to the President.\r\nGenerally they were simply sent back after perusal; which signified\r\nhis approbation. Sometimes he returned them with an informal note,\r\nsuggesting an alteration or a query. If a doubt of any importance arose,\r\nhe reserved it for conference. By this means, he was always in accurate\r\npossession of all facts and proceedings in every part of the Union, and\r\nto whatsoever department they related; he formed a central point for the\r\ndifferent branches; preserved an unity of object and action among them;\r\nexercised that participation in the gestion of affairs which his office\r\nmade incumbent on him; and met himself the due responsibility for\r\nwhatever was done. During Mr. Adams’s administration, his long and\r\nhabitual absences from the seat of government, rendered this kind\r\nof communication impracticable, removed him from any share in the\r\ntransaction of affairs, and parcelled out the government, in fact, among\r\nfour independent heads, drawing sometimes in opposite directions. That\r\nthe former is preferable to the latter course, cannot be doubted. It\r\ngave, indeed, to the heads of departments the trouble of making up,\r\nonce a day, a packet of all their communications for the perusal of the\r\nPresident; it commonly also retarded one day their despatches by mail.\r\nBut in pressing cases, this injury was prevented by presenting that case\r\nsingly for immediate attention; and it produced us in return the\r\nbenefit of his sanction for every act we did. Whether any change of\r\ncircumstances may render a change in this procedure necessary, a little\r\nexperience will show us. But I cannot withhold recommending to the\r\nheads of departments, that we should adopt this course for the present,\r\nleaving any necessary modifications of it to time and trial. I am sure\r\nmy conduct must have proved, better than a thousand declarations would,\r\nthat my confidence in those whom I am so happy as to have associated\r\nwith me, is unlimited, unqualified, and unabated. I am well satisfied\r\nthat every thing goes on with a wisdom and rectitude which I could not\r\nimprove. If I had the universe to choose from, I could not change one\r\nof my associates to my better satisfaction. My sole motives are those\r\nbefore expressed, as governing the first administration in chalking out\r\nthe rules of their proceeding; adding to them only a sense of obligation\r\nimposed on me by the public will, to meet personally the duties to\r\nwhich they have appointed me. If this mode of proceeding shall meet\r\nthe approbation of the heads of departments, it may go into execution\r\nwithout giving them the trouble of an answer: if any other can be\r\nsuggested which would answer our views and add less to their labors,\r\nthat will be a sufficient reason for my preferring it to my own\r\nproposition, to the substance of which only, and not the form, I attach\r\nany importance.\r\n\r\nAccept for yourself particularly, my Dear Sir, assurances of my constant\r\nand sincere affection and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCIII.--TO JOHN DICKINSON, December 19, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 19, 1801.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe approbation of my ancient friends is above all things the most\r\ngrateful to my heart. They know for what objects we relinquished the\r\ndelights of domestic society, tranquillity, and science, and committed\r\nourselves to the ocean of revolution, to wear out the only life God\r\nhas given us here, in scenes, the benefits of which will accrue only\r\nto those who follow us. Surely we had in view to obtain the theory and\r\npractice of good government; and how any, who seemed so ardent in this\r\npursuit, could as shamelessly have apostatized, and supposed we meant\r\nonly to put our government into other hands, but not other forms, is\r\nindeed wonderful. The lesson we have had will probably be useful to the\r\npeople at large, by showing to them how capable they are of being\r\nmade the instruments of their own bondage. A little more prudence and\r\nmoderation in those who had mounted themselves on their fears, and it\r\nwould have been long and difficult to unhorse them. Their madness had\r\ndone in three years what reason alone acting against them would not have\r\neffected in many; and the more, as they might have gone on forming new\r\nentrenchments for themselves from year to year. My great anxiety at\r\npresent is, to avail ourselves of our ascendency to establish good\r\nprinciples, and good practices: to fortify republicanism behind as many\r\nbarriers as possible, that the outworks may give time to rally and save\r\nthe citadel, should that be again in danger. On their part, they have\r\nretired into the judiciary as a strong hold. There the remains of\r\nfederalism are to be preserved and fed from the treasury, and from that\r\nbattery all the works of republicanism are to be beaten down and\r\nerased. By a fraudulent use of the constitution, which has made judges\r\nirremovable, they have multiplied useless judges merely to strengthen\r\ntheir phalanx.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps have been alarmed, as some have been, at the\r\nproposition to abolish the whole of the internal taxes. But it is\r\nperfectly safe. They are under a million of dollars, and we can\r\neconomize the government two or three millions a year. The impost alone\r\ngives us ten or eleven millions annually, increasing at a compound ratio\r\nof six and two thirds per cent, per annum, and consequently doubling\r\nin ten years. But leaving that increase for contingencies, the present\r\namount will support the government, pay the interest of the public debt,\r\nand discharge the principal in fifteen years. If the increase proceeds,\r\nand no contingencies demand it, it will pay off the principal in a\r\nshorter time. Exactly one half of the public debt, to wit, thirty-seven\r\nmillions of dollars, is owned in the United States. That capital then\r\nwill be set afloat, to be employed in rescuing our commerce from the\r\nhands of foreigners, or in agriculture, canals, bridges, or other useful\r\nenterprises. By suppressing at once the whole internal taxes, we abolish\r\nthree fourths of the offices now existing, and spread over the land.\r\nSeeing the interest you take in the public affairs, I have indulged\r\nmyself in observations flowing from a sincere and ardent desire of\r\nseeing our affairs put into an honest and advantageous train. Accept\r\nassurances of my constant and affectionate esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCIV.--TO ALBERT GALLATIN, April 1,1802\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 1,1802.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have read and considered your report on the operations of the sinking\r\nfund, and entirely approve of it, as the best plan on which we can set\r\nout. I think it an object of great importance, to be kept in view and\r\nto be undertaken at a fit season, to simplify our system of finance, and\r\nbring it within the comprehension of every member of Congress. Hamilton\r\nset out on a different plan. In order that he might have the entire\r\ngovernment of his machine, he determined so to complicate it as that\r\nneither the President nor Congress should be able to understand it, or\r\nto control him. He succeeded in doing this, not only beyond their reach,\r\nbut so that he at length could not unravel it himself. He gave to the\r\ndebt, in the first instance, in funding it, the most artificial and\r\nmysterious form he could devise. He then moulded up his appropriations\r\nof a number of scraps and remnants, many of which were nothing at all,\r\nand applied them to different objects in reversion and remainder, until\r\nthe whole system was involved in impenetrable fog; and while he was\r\ngiving himself the airs of providing for the payment of the debt, he\r\nleft himself free to add to it continually, as he did in fact, instead\r\nof paying it. I like your idea of kneading all his little scraps and\r\nfragments into one batch, and adding to it a complementary sum, which,\r\nwhile it forms it into a single mass from which every thing is to be\r\npaid, will enable us, should a breach of appropriation ever be charged\r\non us, to prove that the sum appropriated, and more, has been applied to\r\nits specific object.\r\n\r\nBut there is a point beyond this, on which I should wish to keep my\r\neye, and to which I should aim to approach by every tack which previous\r\narrangements force on us. That is, to form into one consolidated mass\r\nall the monies received into the treasury, and to marshal the several\r\nexpenditures, giving them a preference of payment according to the order\r\nin which they should be arranged. As for example. 1. The interest of\r\nthe public debt. 2. Such portions of principal as are exigible. 3. The\r\nexpenses of government. 4. Such other portions of principal as, though\r\nnot exigible, we are still free to pay when we please. The last object\r\nmight be made to take up the residuum of money remaining in the treasury\r\nat the end of every year, after the three first objects were complied\r\nwith, and would be the barometer whereby to test the economy of the\r\nadministration. It would furnish a simple measure by which every one\r\ncould mete their merit, and by which every one could decide when\r\ntaxes were deficient or superabundant. If to this can be added a\r\nsimplification of the form of accounts in the treasury department, and\r\nin the organization of its officers, so as to bring every thing to a\r\nsingle centre, we might hope to see the finances of the Union as\r\nclear and intelligible as a merchant’s books, so that every member of\r\nCongress, and every man of any mind in the Union, should be able to\r\ncomprehend them, to investigate abuses, and consequently to control\r\nthem. Our predecessors have endeavored by intricacies of system, and\r\nshuffling the investigator over from one officer to another, to\r\ncover every thing from detection, I hope we shall go in the contrary\r\ndirection, and that, by our honest and judicious reformations, we may be\r\nable, within the limits of our time, to bring things back to that simple\r\nand intelligible system, on which they should have been organized at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nI have suggested only a single alteration in the report, which is merely\r\nverbal and of no consequence. We shall now get rid of the commissioner\r\nof the internal revenue, and superintendant of stamps. It remains to\r\namalgamate the comptroller and auditor into one, and reduce the register\r\nto a clerk of accounts; and then the organization will consist, as it\r\nshould at first, of a keeper of money, a keeper of accounts, and the\r\nhead of the department. This constellation of great men in the treasury\r\ndepartment was of a piece with the rest of Hamilton’s plans. He took his\r\nown stand as a Lieutenant General, surrounded by his Major Generals, and\r\nstationing his Brigadiers and Colonels under the name of Supervisors,\r\nInspectors, &tc. in the different States. Let us deserve well of our\r\ncountry by making her interests the end of all our plans, and not our\r\nown pomp, patronage, and irresponsibility. I have hazarded these hasty\r\nand crude ideas, which occurred on contemplating your report. They\r\nmay be the subject of future conversation and correction. Accept my\r\naffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCV.--TO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO, April 2,1802\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 2,1802.\r\n\r\nDear General,\r\n\r\nIt is but lately that I have received your letter of the 25th Frimaire\r\n(December 15th), wishing to know whether some officers of your country\r\ncould expect to be employed in this country. To prevent a suspense\r\ninjurious to them, I hasten to inform you, that we are now actually\r\nengaged in reducing our military establishment one third, and\r\ndischarging one third of our officers. We keep in service no more than\r\nmen enough to garrison the small posts dispersed at great distances on\r\nour frontiers, which garrisons will generally consist of a captain’s\r\ncompany only, and in no case of more than two or three, in not one, of\r\na sufficient number to require a field-officer; and no circumstance\r\nwhatever can bring these garrisons together, because it would be an\r\nabandonment of their forts. Thus circumstanced, you will perceive the\r\nentire impossibility of providing for the persons you recommend. I wish\r\nit had been in my power to give you a more favorable answer; but next to\r\nthe fulfilling your wishes, the most grateful thing I can do is to give\r\na faithful answer. The session of the first Congress convened since\r\nrepublicanism has recovered its ascendency, is now drawing to a close.\r\nThey will pretty completely fulfil all the desires of the people. They\r\nhave reduced the army and navy to what is barely necessary. They are\r\ndisarming executive patronage and preponderance, by putting down one\r\nhalf the offices of the United States, which are no longer necessary.\r\nThese economies have enabled them to suppress all the internal taxes,\r\nand still to make such provision for the payment of their public debt\r\nas to discharge that in eighteen years. They have lopped off a parasite\r\nlimb, planted by their predecessors on their judiciary body for party\r\npurposes; they are opening the doors of hospitality to the fugitives\r\nfrom the oppressions of other countries; and we have suppressed all\r\nthose public forms and ceremonies which tended to familiarize the public\r\neye to the harbingers of another form of government. The people are\r\nnearly all united; their quondam leaders, infuriated with the sense\r\nof their impotence, will soon be seen or heard only in the newspapers,\r\nwhich serve as chimneys to carry off noxious vapors and smoke, and all\r\nis now tranquil, firm, and well, as it should be. I add no signature\r\nbecause unnecessary for you. God bless you, and preserve you still for a\r\nseason of usefulness to your country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCVI.--TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, April 18, 1802\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 18, 1802.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA favorable and confidential opportunity offering by M. Dupont de\r\nNemours, who is re-visiting his native country, gives me an opportunity\r\nof sending you a cipher to be used between us, which will give you some\r\ntrouble to understand, but once understood, is the easiest to use, the\r\nmost indecipherable, and varied by a new key with the greatest facility,\r\nof any I have ever known. I am in hopes the explanation enclosed will be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nBut writing by Mr. Dupont, I need use no cipher. I require from him to\r\nput this into your own and no other hand, let the delay occasioned by\r\nthat be what it will.\r\n\r\nThe cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France, works most\r\nsorely on the United States. On this subject the Secretary of State has\r\nwritten to you fully, yet I cannot forbear recurring to it personally,\r\nso deep is the impression it makes on my mind. It completely reverses\r\nall the political relations of the United States, and will form a new\r\nepoch in our political course. Of all nations of any consideration,\r\nFrance is the one, which, hitherto, has offered the fewest points on\r\nwhich we could have any conflict of right, and the most points of a\r\ncommunion of interests. From these causes we have ever looked to her as\r\nour natural friend, as one with which we never could have an occasion of\r\ndifference. Her growth, therefore, we viewed as our own, her misfortunes\r\nours. There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is\r\nour natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through which the\r\nproduce of three eighths of our territory must pass to market, and\r\nfrom its fertility it will ere long yield more than half of our whole\r\nproduce, and contain more than half of our inhabitants. France, placing\r\nherself in that door, assumes to us the attitude of defiance. Spain\r\nmight have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific dispositions, her\r\nfeeble state, would induce her to increase our facilities there, so that\r\nher possession of the place would be hardly felt by us, and it would\r\nnot, perhaps, be very long before some circumstances might arise, which\r\nmight make the cession of it to us the price of something of more worth\r\nto her. Not so can it ever be in the hands of France: the impetuosity\r\nof her temper, the energy and restlessness of her character, placed in\r\na point of eternal friction with us, and our character, which, though\r\nquiet and loving peace and the pursuit of wealth, is high-minded,\r\ndespising wealth in competition with insult or injury, enterprising\r\nand energetic as any nation on earth; these circumstances render it\r\nimpossible that France and the United States can continue long friends,\r\nwhen they meet in so irritable a position. They, as well as we, must be\r\nblind, if they do not see this, and we must be very improvident if we do\r\nnot begin to make arrangements on that hypothesis. The day that France\r\ntakes possession of New Orleans, fixes the sentence which is to restrain\r\nher for ever within her low-water mark. It seals the union of two\r\nnations, who, in conjunction, can maintain exclusive possession of the\r\nocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the British fleet and\r\nnation. We must turn all our attentions to a maritime force, for which\r\nour resources place us on very high ground: and having formed and\r\nconnected together a power which may render reinforcement of her\r\nsettlements here impossible to France, make the first cannon which shall\r\nbe fired in Europe the signal for tearing up any settlement she may have\r\nmade, and for holding the two continents of America in sequestration for\r\nthe common purposes of the United British and American nations. This is\r\nnot a state of things we seek or desire. It is one which this measure,\r\nif adopted by France, forces on us as necessarily, as any other cause,\r\nby the laws of nature, brings on its necessary effect. It is not from\r\na fear of France that we deprecate this measure proposed by her. For\r\nhowever greater her force is than ours, compared in the abstract, it is\r\nnothing in comparison of ours, when to be exerted on our soil. But it\r\nis from a sincere love of peace, and a firm persuasion, that, bound to\r\nFrance by the interests and the strong sympathies still existing in the\r\nminds of our citizens, and holding relative positions which insure\r\ntheir continuance, we are secure of a long course of peace. Whereas, the\r\nchange of friends, which will be rendered necessary if France changes\r\nthat position, embarks us necessarily as a belligerent power in the\r\nfirst war of Europe. In that case, France will have held possession of\r\nNew Orleans during the interval of a peace, long or short, at the end of\r\nwhich it will be wrested from her. Will this short-lived possession have\r\nbeen an equivalent to her for the transfer of such a weight into the\r\nscale of her enemy? Will not the amalgamation of a young, thriving\r\nnation, continue to that enemy the health and force which are at present\r\nso evidently on the decline? And will a few years’ possession of New\r\nOrleans add equally to the strength of France? She may say she needs\r\nLouisiana for the supply of her West Indies. She does not need it in\r\ntime of peace, and in war she could not depend on them, because\r\nthey would be so easily intercepted. I should suppose that all these\r\nconsiderations might, in some proper form, be brought into view of the\r\ngovernment of France. Though stated by us, it ought not to give offence;\r\nbecause we do not bring them forward as a menace, but as consequences\r\nnot controllable by us, but inevitable from the course of things. We\r\nmention them, not as things which we desire by any means, but as things\r\nwe deprecate; and we beseech a friend to look forward and to prevent\r\nthem for our common interests.\r\n\r\nIf France considers Louisiana, however, as indispensable for her views,\r\nshe might perhaps be willing to look about for arrangements which might\r\nreconcile it to our interests. If any thing could do this, it would be\r\nthe ceding to us the island of New Orleans and the Floridas. This\r\nwould certainly, in a great degree, remove the causes of jarring and\r\nirritation between us, and perhaps for such a length of time, as might\r\nproduce other means of making the measure permanently conciliatory to\r\nour interests and friendships. It would, at any rate, relieve us from\r\nthe necessity of taking immediate measures for countervailing such\r\nan operation by arrangements in another quarter. But still we should\r\nconsider New Orleans and the Floridas as no equivalent for the risk of a\r\nquarrel with France, produced by her vicinage.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt you have urged these considerations, on every proper\r\noccasion, with the government where you are. They are such as must have\r\neffect, if you can find means of producing thorough reflection on\r\nthem by that government. The idea here is, that the troops sent to St.\r\nDomingo, were to proceed to Louisiana after finishing their work in that\r\nisland. If this were the arrangement, it will give you time to return\r\nagain and again to the charge.\r\n\r\nFor the conquest of St. Domingo will not be a short work. It will take\r\nconsiderable time, and wear down a great number of soldiers. Every eye\r\nin the United States is now fixed on the affairs of Louisiana.\r\nPerhaps nothing, since the revolutionary war, has produced more uneasy\r\nsensations through the body of the nation. Notwithstanding temporary\r\nbickerings have taken place with France, she has still a strong hold on\r\nthe affections of our citizens generally. I have thought it not amiss,\r\nby way of supplement to the letters of the Secretary of State, to write\r\nyou this private one, to impress you with the importance we affix\r\nto this transaction. I pray you to cherish Dupont. He has the best\r\ndispositions for the continuance of friendship between the two nations,\r\nand perhaps you may be able to make a good use of him.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my affectionate esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCVII.--TO GOVERNOR MONROE, July 15, 1802\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 15, 1802.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 7th has been duly received. I am really mortified at\r\nthe base ingratitude of Callender. It presents human nature in a hideous\r\nform. It gives me concern, because I perceive that relief, which was\r\nafforded him on mere motives of charity, may be viewed under the aspect\r\nof employing him as a writer. When the ‘Political Progress of Britain’\r\nfirst appeared in this country, it was in a periodical publication\r\ncalled the ‘Bee,’ where I saw it. I was speaking of it in terms of\r\nstrong approbation to a friend in Philadelphia, when he asked me, if I\r\nknew that the author was then in the city, a fugitive from prosecution\r\non account of that work, and in want of employ for his subsistence. This\r\nwas the first of my learning that Callender was the author of the work.\r\nI considered him as a man of science fled from persecution, and assured\r\nmy friend of my readiness to do whatever could serve him. It was long\r\nafter this before I saw him; probably not till 1798. He had, in the mean\r\ntime, written a second part of the ‘Political Progress,’ much inferior\r\nto the first, and his ‘History of the United States.’ In 1798, I think,\r\nI was applied to by Mr. Lieper to contribute to his relief. I did so. In\r\n1799, I think, S. T. Mason applied for him. I contributed again. He had,\r\nby this time, paid me two or three personal visits. When he fled in a\r\npanic from Philadelphia to General Mason’s, he wrote to me that he was\r\na fugitive in want of employ, wished to know if he could get into a\r\ncounting-house or a school, in my neighborhood or in that of Richmond;\r\nthat he had materials for a volume, and if he could get as much money\r\nas would buy the paper, the profit of the sale would be all his own. I\r\navailed myself of this pretext to cover a mere charity, by desiring him\r\nto consider me a subscriber for as many copies of his book as the money\r\ninclosed (fifty dollars) amounted to; but to send me two copies only, as\r\nthe others might lie till called for. But I discouraged his coming into\r\nmy neighborhood. His first writings here had fallen far short of his\r\noriginal ‘Political Progress,’ and the scurrilities of his subsequent\r\nones began evidently to do mischief. As to myself, no man wished more\r\nto see his pen stopped: but I considered him still as a proper object of\r\nbenevolence. The succeeding year he again wanted money to buy paper for\r\nanother volume. I made his letter, as before, the occasion of giving him\r\nanother fifty dollars. He considers these as proofs of my approbation\r\nof his writings, when they were mere charities, yielded under a strong\r\nconviction that he was injuring us by his writings. It is known to many,\r\nthat the sums given to him were such, and even smaller than I was in\r\nthe habit of giving to others in distress, of the federal as well as the\r\nrepublican party, without attention to political principles. Soon after\r\nI was elected to the government, Callender came on here, wishing to be\r\nmade post-master at Richmond. I knew him to be totally unfit for it: and\r\nhowever ready I was to aid him with my own charities (and I then gave\r\nhim fifty dollars), I did not think the public offices confided to me\r\nto give away as charities. He took it in mortal offence, and from that\r\nmoment has been hauling off to his former enemies, the federalists.\r\nBesides the letter I wrote him in answer to the one from General\r\nMason’s, I wrote him another containing answers to two questions he\r\naddressed to me; 1. whether Mr. Jay received salary as Chief Justice and\r\nEnvoy at the same time; and 2. something relative to the expenses of an\r\nembassy to Constantinople. I think these were the only letters I ever\r\nwrote him in answer to volumes he was perpetually writing to me. This is\r\nthe true state of what has passed between him and me. I do not know that\r\nit can be used without committing me in controversy, as it were, with\r\none too little respected by the public to merit that notice. I leave to\r\nyour judgment what use can be made of these facts. Perhaps it will be\r\nbetter judged of, when we see what use the tories will endeavor to\r\nmake of their new friend. I shall leave this on the 21st, and be at\r\nMonticello probably on the 24th, or within two or three days of that,\r\nand shall hope, ere long, to see you there. Accept assurances of my\r\naffectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCVIII.--TO GOVERNOR MONROE, July 17, 1802\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 17, 1802.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAfter writing you on the 15th, I turned to my letter-file to see what\r\nletters I had written to Callender, and found them to have been of\r\nthe dates of 1798, October the 11th, and 1799, September the 6th, and\r\nOctober the 6th; but on looking for the letters they were not in their\r\nplaces, nor to be found. On recollection, I believe I sent them to you\r\na year or two ago. If you have them, I shall be glad to receive them\r\nat Monticello, where I shall be on this day se’nnight. I enclose you\r\na paper, which shows the tories mean to pervert these charities to\r\nCallender as much as they can. They will probably first represent me as\r\nthe patron and support of the ‘Prospect before Us,’ and other things\r\nof Callender’s, and then picking out all the scurrilities of the author\r\nagainst General Washington, Mr. Adams, and others, impute them to me.\r\nI, as well as most other republicans who were in the way of doing it,\r\ncontributed what I could afford to the support of the republican papers\r\nand printers, paid sums of money for the ‘Bee,’ the ‘Albany Register,’\r\n&c. when they were staggering under the sedition-law, contributed to the\r\nfines of Callender himself, of Holt, Brown, and others, suffering under\r\nthat law. I discharged, when I came into office, such as were under\r\nthe persecution of our enemies, without instituting any prosecutions in\r\nretaliation. They may, therefore, with the same justice, impute to me,\r\nor to every republican contributor, every thing which was ever published\r\nin those papers or by those persons. I must correct a fact in mine\r\nof the 15th. I find I did not enclose the fifty dollars to Callender\r\nhimself while at General Mason’s, but authorized the General to draw on\r\nmy correspondent at Richmond, and to give the money to Callender. So\r\nthe other fifty dollars of which he speaks, were by order on my\r\ncorrespondent at Richmond.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXCIX.--TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, October 10, 1802\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 10, 1802.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe departure of Madame Brugnard for France furnishes me a safe\r\nconveyance of a letter, which I cannot avoid embracing, although I have\r\nnothing particular for the subject of it. It is well, however, to be\r\nable to inform you, generally, through a safe channel, that we stand\r\ncompletely corrected of the error, that either the government or the\r\nnation of France has any remains of friendship for us. The portion of\r\nthat country which forms an exception, though respectable in weight,\r\nis weak in numbers. On the contrary, it appears evident, that an\r\nunfriendly-spirit prevails in the most important individuals of the\r\ngovernment, towards us. In this state of things, we shall so take our\r\ndistance between the two rival nations, as, remaining disengaged till\r\nnecessity compels us, we may haul finally to the enemy of that which\r\nshall make it necessary. We see all the disadvantageous consequences of\r\ntaking a side, and shall be forced into it only by a more disagreeable\r\nalternative; in which event we must countervail the disadvantages\r\nby measures which will give us splendor and power, but not as much\r\nhappiness as our present system. We wish, therefore, to remain well with\r\nFrance. But we see that no consequences, however ruinous to them, can\r\nsecure us with certainty against the extravagance of her present rulers.\r\nI think, therefore, that while we do nothing which the first nation on\r\nearth would deem crouching, we had better give to all our communications\r\nwith them a very mild, complaisant, and even friendly complexion, but\r\nalways independent. Ask no favors, leave small and irritating things to\r\nbe conducted by the individuals interested in them, interfere ourselves\r\nbut in the greatest cases, and then not push them to irritation. No\r\nmatter at present existing between them and us is important enough to\r\nrisk a breach of peace; peace being indeed the most important of all\r\nthings for us, except the preserving an erect and independent attitude.\r\nAlthough I know your own judgment leads you to pursue this line\r\nidentically, yet I thought it just to strengthen it by the concurrence\r\nof my own. You will have seen by our newspapers, that, with the aid of a\r\nlying renegado from republicanism, the federalists have opened all their\r\nsluices of calumny. They say we lied them out of power, and openly avow\r\nthey will do the same by us. But it was not lies or arguments on our\r\npart which dethroned them, but their own foolish acts, sedition-laws,\r\nalien-laws, taxes, extravagancies, and heresies. Porcupine, their\r\nfriend, wrote them down. Callender, their new recruit, will do the same.\r\nEvery decent man among them revolts at his filth: and there cannot be a\r\ndoubt, that were a Presidential election to come on this day, they would\r\ncertainly have but three New England States, and about half a dozen\r\nvotes from Maryland and North Carolina; these two States electing by\r\ndistricts. Were all the States to elect by a general ticket, they would\r\nhave but three out of sixteen States. And these three are coming up\r\nslowly. We do, indeed, consider Jersey and Delaware as rather doubtful.\r\nElections which have lately taken place there, but their event not yet\r\nknown here, will show the present point of their varying condition.\r\n\r\nMy letters to you being merely private, I leave all details of business\r\nto their official channel.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant friendship and high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. We have received your letter announcing the arrival of Mr. Dupont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCC.--TO ALBERT GALLATIN, October 13, 1802\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\nYou know my doubts, or rather convictions, about the unconstitutionality\r\nof the act for building piers in the Delaware, and the fears that it\r\nwill lead to a bottomless expense, and to the greatest abuses. There is,\r\nhowever, one intention of which the act is susceptible, and which will\r\nbring it within the constitution; and we ought always to presume that\r\nthe real intention which is alone consistent with the constitution.\r\nAlthough the power to regulate commerce does not give a power to build\r\npiers, wharves, open ports, clear the beds of rivers, dig canals,\r\nbuild warehouses, build manufacturing machines, set up manufactories,\r\ncultivate the earth, to all of which the power would go if it went to\r\nthe first, yet a power to provide and maintain a navy is a power to\r\nprovide receptacles for it, and places to cover and preserve it. In\r\nchoosing the places where this money should be laid out, I should be\r\nmuch disposed, as far as contracts will permit, to confine it to such\r\nplace or places as the ships of war may lie at, and be protected from\r\nice: and I should be for stating this in a message to Congress, in order\r\nto prevent the effect of the present example. This act has been built on\r\nthe exercise of the power of building light-houses, as a regulation of\r\ncommerce. But I well remember the opposition, on this very ground, to\r\nthe first act for building a light-house. The utility of the thing has\r\nsanctioned the infraction. But if on that infraction we build a second,\r\non that second a third, &c, any one of the powers in the constitution\r\nmay be made to comprehend every power of government. Will you read the\r\nenclosed letters on the subject of New Orleans, and think what we can do\r\nor propose in the case?\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations. October 13, 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCCI.--TO LEVI LINCOLN, October 25, 1802\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 25, 1802.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 16th is received, and that of July the 24th had come\r\nto hand while I was at Monticello. I sincerely condole with you on the\r\nsickly state of your family, and hope this will find them re-established\r\nwith the approach of the cold season. As yet, however, we have had no\r\nfrost at this place, and it is believed the yellow fever still continues\r\nin Philadelphia, if not in Baltimore. We shall all be happy to see you\r\nhere whenever the state of your family admits it. You will have seen by\r\nthe newspapers that we have gained ground generally in the elections,\r\nthat we have lost ground in not a single district of the United States\r\nexcept Kent county in Delaware, where a religious dissension occasioned\r\nit. In Jersey the elections are always carried by small majorities,\r\nconsequently the issue is affected by the smallest accidents. By the\r\npaper of the last night we have a majority of three in their Council,\r\nand one in their House of Representatives: another says it is only of\r\none in each House: even the latter is sufficient for every purpose. The\r\nopinion I originally formed has never been changed, that such of the\r\nbody of the people as thought themselves federalists, would find that\r\nthey were in truth republicans, and would come over to us by degrees;\r\nbut that their leaders had gone too far ever to change. Their bitterness\r\nincreases with their desperation. They are trying slanders now which\r\nnothing could prompt but a gall which blinds their judgments as well\r\nas their consciences. I shall take no other revenge, than, by a steady\r\npursuit of economy and peace, and by the establishment of republican\r\nprinciples in substance and in form, to sink federalism into an abyss\r\nfrom which there shall be no resurrection for it. I still think our\r\noriginal idea as to office is best: that is, to depend for the obtaining\r\na just participation, on deaths, resignations, and delinquencies. This\r\nwill least affect the tranquillity of the people, and prevent their\r\ngiving in to the suggestion of our enemies, that ours has been a contest\r\nfor office, not for principle. This is rather a slow operation, but it\r\nis sure, if we pursue it steadily, which, however, has not been done\r\nwith the undeviating resolution I could have wished. To these means of\r\nobtaining a just share in the transaction of the public business, shall\r\nbe added one other, to wit, removal for electioneering activity, or open\r\nand industrious opposition to the principles of the present government,\r\nlegislative and executive. Every officer of the government may vote at\r\nelections according to his conscience; but we should betray the cause\r\ncommitted to our care, were we to permit the influence of official\r\npatronage to be used to overthrow that cause. Your present situation\r\nwill enable you to judge of prominent offenders in your State, in the\r\ncase of the present election. I pray you to seek them, to mark them, to\r\nbe quite sure of your ground, that we may commit no error or wrong, and\r\nleave the rest to me. I have been urged to remove Mr. Whittemore, the\r\nsurveyor of Gloucester, on grounds of neglect of duty and industrious\r\nopposition. Yet no facts are so distinctly charged as to make the step\r\nsure which we should take in this. Will you take the trouble to satisfy\r\nyourself on this point? I think it not amiss that it should be known\r\nthat we are determined to remove officers who are active or open-mouthed\r\nagainst the government, by which I mean the legislature as well as the\r\nexecutive. Accept assurances of my sincere friendship and high respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCCII.--TO GOVERNOR MONROE, January 13,1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 13,1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI dropped you a line on the 10th, informing you of a nomination I\r\nhad made of you to the Senate, and yesterday I enclosed you their\r\napprobation, not then having time to write. The agitation of the public\r\nmind on occasion of the late suspension of our right of deposite at New\r\nOrleans is extreme. In the western country it is natural, and grounded\r\non honest motives. In the sea-ports it proceeds from a desire for war,\r\nwhich increases the mercantile lottery: in the federalists, generally,\r\nand especially those of Congress, the object is to force us into war if\r\npossible, in order to derange our finances, or, if this cannot be done,\r\nto attach the western country to them, as their best friends, and thus\r\nget again into power. Remonstrances, memorials, &c. are now circulating\r\nthrough the whole of the western country, and signed by the body of\r\nthe people. The measures we have been pursuing, being invisible, do\r\nnot satisfy their minds. Something sensible, therefore, has become\r\nnecessary; and indeed our object of purchasing New Orleans and\r\nthe Floridas is a measure liable to assume so many shapes, that no\r\ninstructions could be squared to fit them. It was essential then, to\r\nsend a minister extraordinary, to be joined with the ordinary one, with\r\ndiscretionary powers; first, however, well impressed with all our\r\nviews, and therefore qualified to meet and modify to these every form\r\nof proposition which could come from the other party. This could be\r\ndone only in full and frequent oral communications. Having determined\r\non this, there could not be two opinions among the republicans as to the\r\nperson. You possessed the unlimited confidence of the administration and\r\nof the western people; and generally of the republicans every where; and\r\nwere you to refuse to go, no other man can be found who does this. The\r\nmeasure has already silenced the federalists here. Congress will no\r\nlonger be agitated by them: and the country will become calm as fast as\r\nthe information extends over it. All eyes, all hopes are now fixed on\r\nyou; and were you to decline, the chagrin would be universal, and\r\nwould shake under your feet the high ground on which you stand with the\r\npublic. Indeed, I know nothing which would produce such a shock. For on\r\nthe event of this mission depend the future destinies of this republic.\r\nIf we cannot, by a purchase of the country, insure to ourselves a course\r\nof perpetual peace and friendship with all nations, then, as war cannot\r\nbe distant, it behoves us immediately to be preparing for that course,\r\nwithout, however, hastening it; and it may be necessary (on your failure\r\non the continent) to cross the channel. We shall get entangled in\r\nEuropean politics, and figuring more, be much less happy and prosperous.\r\nThis can only be prevented by a successful issue to your present\r\nmission. I am sensible after the measures you have taken for getting\r\ninto a different line of business, that it will be a great sacrifice on\r\nyour part, and presents from the season and other circumstances serious\r\ndifficulties. But some men are born for the public. Nature, by fitting\r\nthem for the service of the human race on a broad scale, has stamped\r\nthem with the evidences of her destination and their duty.\r\n\r\nBut I am particularly concerned, that, in the present case, you have\r\nmore than one sacrifice to make. To reform the prodigalities of our\r\npredecessors is understood to be peculiarly our duty, and to bring the\r\ngovernment to a simple and economical course. They, in order to increase\r\nexpense, debt, taxation, and patronage, tried always how much they could\r\ngive. The outfit given to ministers resident to enable them to furnish\r\ntheir house, but given by no nation to a temporary minister, who is\r\nnever expected to take a house or to entertain, but considered on the\r\nfooting of a voyageur, they gave to their extraordinary missionaries by\r\nwholesale. In the beginning of our administration, among other articles\r\nof reformation in expense, it was determined not to give an outfit\r\nto missionaries extraordinary, and not to incur the expense with any\r\nminister of sending a frigate to carry or bring him. The Boston happened\r\nto be going to the Mediterranean, and was permitted, therefore, to take\r\nup Mr. Livingston and touch in a port of France. A frigate was denied to\r\nCharles Pinckney, and has been refused to Mr. King for his return. Mr.\r\nMadison’s friendship and mine to you being so well known, the public\r\nwill have eagle eyes to watch if we grant you any indulgences out of the\r\ngeneral rule; and on the other hand, the example set in your case will\r\nbe more cogent on future ones, and produce greater approbation to our\r\nconduct. The allowance, therefore, will be in this, and all similar\r\ncases, all the expenses of your journey and voyage, taking a ship’s\r\ncabin to yourself, nine thousand dollars a year from your leaving\r\nhome till the proceedings of your mission are terminated, and then the\r\nquarter’s salary for the expenses of your return, as prescribed by law.\r\nAs to the time of your going, you cannot too much hasten it, as the\r\nmoment in France is critical. St. Domingo delays their taking possession\r\nof Louisiana, and they are in the last distress for money for current\r\npurposes. You should arrange your affairs for an absence of a year at\r\nleast, perhaps for a long one. It will be necessary for you to stay here\r\nsome days on your way to New York. You will receive here what advance\r\nyou choose.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant and affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCCIII.--TO M. DUPONT, February 1, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of August the 16th\r\nand October the 4th. The latter I received with peculiar satisfaction;\r\nbecause, while it holds up terms which cannot be entirely yielded,\r\nit proposes such as a mutual spirit of accommodation and sacrifice of\r\nopinion may bring to some point of union. While we were preparing on\r\nthis subject such modifications of the propositions of your letter of\r\nOctober the 4th, as we could assent to, an event happened, which obliged\r\nus to adopt measures of urgency. The suspension of the right of deposite\r\nat New Orleans, ceded, to us by our treaty with Spain, threw our whole\r\ncountry into such a ferment as imminently threatened its peace. This,\r\nhowever, was believed to be the act of the Intendant, unauthorized\r\nby his government. But it showed the necessity of making effectual\r\narrangements, to secure the peace of the two countries against the\r\nindiscreet acts of subordinate agents. The urgency of the case, as well\r\nas the public spirit, therefore, induced us to make a more solemn appeal\r\nto the justice and judgment of our neighbors, by sending a minister\r\nextraordinary to impress them with the necessity of some arrangement.\r\nMr. Monroe has been selected. His good dispositions cannot be doubted.\r\nMultiplied conversations with him, and views of the subject taken in all\r\nthe shapes in which it can present itself, have possessed him with our\r\nestimates of every thing relating to it, with a minuteness which no\r\nwritten communication to Mr. Livingston could ever have attained. These\r\nwill prepare them to meet and decide on every form of proposition which\r\ncan occur, without awaiting new instructions from hence, which\r\nmight draw to an indefinite length a discussion where circumstances\r\nimperiously oblige us to a prompt decision. For the occlusion of the\r\nMississippi is a state of things in which we cannot exist. He goes,\r\ntherefore, joined with Chancellor Livingston, to aid in the issue of a\r\ncrisis the most important the United States have ever met since their\r\nindependence, and which is to decide their future character and career.\r\nThe confidence which the government of France reposes in you, will\r\nundoubtedly give great weight to your information. An equal confidence\r\non our part, founded on your knowledge of the subject, your just\r\nviews of it, your good dispositions towards this country, and my long\r\nexperience of your personal faith and friendship, assures me that you\r\nwill render between us all the good offices in your power. The interests\r\nof the two countries being absolutely the same as to this matter, your\r\naid may be conscientiously given. It will often, perhaps, be possible\r\nfor you, having a freedom of communication, _omnibus horis_, which\r\ndiplomatic gentlemen will be excluded from by forms, to smooth\r\ndifficulties by representations and reasonings, which would be received\r\nwith more suspicion from them. You will thereby render great good to\r\nboth countries. For our circumstances are so imperious as to admit of no\r\ndelay as to our course; and the use of the Mississippi so indispensable,\r\nthat we cannot hesitate one moment to hazard our existence for its\r\nmaintenance. If we fail in this effort to put it beyond the reach of\r\naccident, we see the destinies we have to run, and prepare at once\r\nfor them. Not but that we shall still endeavor to go on in peace and\r\nfriendship with our neighbors as long as we can, if our rights of\r\nnavigation and deposite are respected; but as we foresee that the\r\ncaprices of the local officers, and the abuse of those rights by our\r\nboatmen and navigators, which neither government can prevent, will keep\r\nup a state of irritation which cannot long be kept inactive, we should\r\nbe criminally improvident not to take at once eventual measures for\r\nstrengthening ourselves for the contest. It may be said, if this object\r\nbe so all-important to us, why do we not offer such a sum as to insure\r\nits purchase? The answer is simple. We are an agricultural people,\r\npoor in money, and owing great debts. These will be falling due by\r\ninstalments for fifteen years to come, and require from us the practice\r\nof a rigorous economy to accomplish their payment: and it is our\r\nprinciple to pay to a moment whatever we have engaged, and never\r\nto engage what we cannot, and mean not, faithfully to pay. We have\r\ncalculated our resources, and find the sum to be moderate which they\r\nwould enable us to pay, and we know from late trials that little can be\r\nadded to it by borrowing. The country, too, which we wish to purchase,\r\nexcept the portion already granted, and which must be confirmed to the\r\nprivate holders, is a barren sand, six hundred miles from east to west\r\nand from thirty to forty and fifty miles from north to south, formed by\r\ndeposition of the sands by the Gulf Stream in its circular course round\r\nthe Mexican Gulf, and which being spent after performing a semicircle,\r\nhas made from its last depositions the sand-bank of East Florida. In\r\nWest Florida, indeed, there are on the borders of the rivers some rich\r\nbottoms, formed by the mud brought from the upper country. These bottoms\r\nare all possessed by individuals. But the spaces between river and river\r\nare mere banks of sand: and in East Florida, there are neither rivers\r\nnor consequently any bottoms. We cannot then make any thing by a sale\r\nof the lands to individuals. So that it is peace alone which makes it an\r\nobject with us, and which ought to make the cession of it desirable to\r\nFrance. Whatever power, other than ourselves, holds the country east of\r\nthe Mississippi, becomes our natural enemy. Will such a possession do\r\nFrance as much good, as such an enemy may do her harm? And how long\r\nwould it be hers, were such an enemy, situated at its door, added to\r\nGreat Britain? I confess, it appears to me as essential to France to\r\nkeep at peace with us, as it is to us to keep at peace with her: and\r\nthat, if this cannot be secured without some compromise as to the\r\nterritory in question, it will be useful for both to make sacrifices to\r\neffect the compromise.\r\n\r\nYou see, my good friend, with what frankness I communicate with you on\r\nthis subject; that I hide nothing from you, and that I am endeavoring to\r\nturn our private friendship to the good of our respective countries.\r\nAnd can private friendship ever answer a nobler end than by keeping two\r\nnations at peace, who, if this new position which one of them is taking\r\nwere rendered innocent, have more points of common interest, and fewer\r\nof collision than any two on earth; who become natural friends, instead\r\nof natural enemies, which this change of position would make them. My\r\nletters of April the 25th, May the 5th, and this present one have been\r\nwritten, without any disguise, in this view; and while safe in your\r\nhands they can never do any thing but good. But you and I are now at\r\nthat time of life when our call to another state of being cannot be\r\ndistant, and may be near. Besides, your government is in the habit of\r\nseizing papers without notice. These letters might thus get into hands,\r\nwhich, like the hornet which extracts poison from the same flower that\r\nyields honey to the bee, might make them the ground of blowing up a\r\nflame between our two countries, and make our friendship and confidence\r\nin each other effect exactly the reverse of what we are aiming at. Being\r\nyourself thoroughly possessed of every idea in them, let me ask from\r\nyour friendship an immediate consignment of them to the flames. That\r\nalone can make all safe, and ourselves secure.\r\n\r\nI intended to have answered you here, on the subject of your agency in\r\nthe transacting what money matters we may have at Paris, and for that\r\npurpose meant to have conferred with Mr. Gallatin. But he has, for two\r\nor three days, been confined to his room, and is not yet able to do\r\nbusiness. If he is out before Mr. Monroe’s departure, I will write an\r\nadditional letter on that subject. Be assured that it will be a great\r\nadditional satisfaction to me to render services to yourself and sons by\r\nthe same acts which shall at the same time promote the public service.\r\nBe so good as to present my respectful salutations to Madame Dupont, and\r\nto accept yourself assurances of my constant and affectionate friendship\r\nand great respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCCIV.--TO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH, April 21, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 21, 1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn some of the delightful conversations with you, in the evenings of\r\n1798-99, and which served as an anodyne to the afflictions of the crisis\r\nthrough which our country was then laboring, the Christian religion was\r\nsometimes our topic: and I then promised you, that, one day or other, I\r\nwould give you my views of it. They are the result of a life of inquiry\r\nand reflection, and very different from that anti-Christian system\r\nimputed to me by those who know nothing of my opinions. To the\r\ncorruptions of Christianity I am indeed opposed; but not to the genuine\r\nprecepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian, in the only sense in\r\nwhich he wished any one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines, in\r\npreference to all others; ascribing to himself every human excellence;\r\nand believing he never claimed any other. At the short intervals since\r\nthese conversations, when I could justifiably abstract my mind from\r\npublic affairs, the subject has been under my contemplation. But the\r\nmore I considered it, the more it expanded beyond the measure of\r\neither my time or information. In the moment of my late departure from\r\nMonticello, I received from Doctor Priestely his little treatise of\r\n‘Socrates and Jesus compared.’ This being a section of the general view\r\nI had taken of the field, it became a subject of reflection while on the\r\nroad, and unoccupied otherwise. The result was, to arrange in my mind\r\na syllabus, or outline of such an estimate of the comparative merits of\r\nChristianity, as I wished to see executed by some one of more leisure\r\nand information for the task, than myself. This I now send you, as\r\nthe only discharge of my promise I can probably ever execute. And in\r\nconfiding it to you, I know it will not be exposed to the malignant\r\nperversions of those who make every word from me a text for new\r\nmisrepresentations and calumnies. I am moreover averse to the\r\ncommunication of my religious tenets to the public; because it would\r\ncountenance the presumption of those who have endeavored to draw them\r\nbefore that tribunal, and to seduce public opinion to erect itself into\r\nthat inquisition over the rights of conscience, which the laws have so\r\njustly proscribed. It behoves every man who values liberty of conscience\r\nfor himself, to resist invasions of it in the case of others; or their\r\ncase may, by change of circumstances, become his own. It behoves him,\r\ntoo, in his own case, to give no example of concession, betraying the\r\ncommon right of independent opinion, by answering questions of faith,\r\nwhich the laws have left between God and himself. Accept my affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Syllabus of an Estimate of the Merit of the Doctrines of Jesus,\r\ncompared with those of others_.\r\n\r\nIn a comparative view of the Ethics of the enlightened nations of\r\nantiquity, of the Jews, and of Jesus, no notice should be taken of\r\nthe corruptions of reason among the ancients, to wit, the idolatry and\r\nsuperstition of the vulgar, nor of the corruptions of Christianity by\r\nthe learned among its professors.\r\n\r\nLet a just view be taken of the moral principles inculcated by the most\r\nesteemed of the sects of ancient philosophy, or of their individuals;\r\nparticularly Pythagoras, Socrates, Epicurus, Cicero, Epictetus, Seneca,\r\nAntoninus.\r\n\r\nI. Philosophers. 1. Their precepts related chiefly to ourselves, and\r\nthe government of those passions which, unrestrained, would disturb our\r\ntranquillity of mind.* In this branch of philosophy they were really\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n* To explain, I will exhibit the heads of Seneca’s and Cicero’s\r\nphilosophical works, the most extensive of any we have received from\r\nthe ancients. Of ten heads in Seneca, seven relate to ourselves, viz. de\r\nirâ, consolatio, de tranquillitate, de constantiâ sapientis, de otio\r\nsapientis, de vitâ beatâ, de brevitate vitæ; two relate to others,\r\nde clementiâ, de beneficiis; and one relates to the government of\r\nthe world, de pruvidentiâ. Of eleven tracts of Cicero, five respect\r\nourselves, viz. definibus, Tusculana, academica, paradoxa, de senectute,\r\none, de officiis, relates partly to ourselves, partly to others; one, de\r\namicitiâ, relates to others; and four are on different subjects, to wit,\r\nde naturâ deorum, de dimnatione, defato, and somnium Scipionis.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In developing our duties to others, they were short and defective.\r\nThey embraced, indeed, the circles of kindred and friends, and\r\ninculcated patriotism, or the love of our country in the aggregate, as\r\na primary obligation: towards our neighbors and countrymen they taught\r\njustice, but scarcely viewed them as within the circle of benevolence.\r\nStill less have they inculcated peace, charity, and love to our\r\nfellow-men, or embraced with benevolence the whole family of mankind.\r\n\r\nII. Jews. 1. Their system was Deism; that is, the belief in one only\r\nGod. But their ideas of him and of his attributes were degrading and\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\n2. Their Ethics were not only imperfect, but often irreconcilable with\r\nthe sound dictates of reason and morality, as they respect intercourse\r\nwith those around us; and repulsive and anti-social, as respecting other\r\nnations. They needed reformation, therefore, in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nIII. Jesus. In this state of things among the Jews, Jesus appeared.\r\nHis parentage was obscure; his condition poor; his education null; his\r\nnatural endowments great; his life correct and innocent: he was\r\nmeek, benevolent, patient, firm, disinterested, and of the sublimest\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages under which his doctrines appear are remarkable.\r\n\r\n1. Like Socrates and Epictetus, he wrote nothing himself.\r\n\r\n2. But he had not, like them, a Xenophon or an Arrian to write for\r\nhim. I name not Plato, who only used the name of Socrates to cover\r\nthe whimsies of his own brain. On the contrary, all the learned of his\r\ncountry, entrenched in its power and riches, were opposed to him, lest\r\nhis labors should undermine their advantages; and the committing to\r\nwriting his life and doctrines fell on unlettered and ignorant men; who\r\nwrote, too, from memory, and not till long after the transactions had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n3. According to the ordinary fate of those who attempt to enlighten and\r\nreform mankind, he fell an early victim to the jealousy and combination\r\nof the altar and the throne, at about thirty-three years of age, his\r\nreason having not yet attained the maximum of its energy, nor the\r\ncourse of his preaching, which was but of three years at most, presented\r\noccasions for developing a complete system of morals.\r\n\r\n4. Hence the doctrines which he really delivered were defective as\r\na whole, and fragments only of what he did deliver have come to us,\r\nmutilated, misstated, and often unintelligible.\r\n\r\n5. They have been still more disfigured by the corruptions of\r\nschismatizing followers, who have found an interest in sophisticating\r\nand perverting the simple doctrines he taught, by engrafting on them the\r\nmysticisms of a Grecian sophist, frittering them into subtleties, and\r\nobscuring them with jargon, until they have caused good men to reject\r\nthe whole in disgust, and to view Jesus himself as an impostor.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these disadvantages, a system of morals is presented to\r\nus, which, if filled up in the style and spirit of the rich fragments he\r\nleft us, would be the most perfect and sublime that has ever been taught\r\nby man.\r\n\r\nThe question of his being a member of the God-head, or in direct\r\ncommunication with it, claimed for him by some of his followers, and\r\ndenied by others, is foreign to the present view, which is merely an\r\nestimate of the intrinsic merit of his doctrines.\r\n\r\n1. He corrected the Deism of the Jews, confirming them in their belief\r\nof one only God, and giving them juster notions of his attributes and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n2. His moral doctrines, relating to kindred and friends, were more pure\r\nand perfect than those of the most correct of the philosophers, and\r\ngreatly more so than those of the Jews; and they went far beyond both in\r\ninculcating universal philanthropy, not only to kindred and friends,\r\nto neighbors and countrymen, but to all mankind, gathering all into one\r\nfamily, under the bonds of love charity, peace, common wants, and common\r\naids. A developement of this head will evince the peculiar superiority\r\nof the system of Jesus over all others.\r\n\r\n3. The precepts of philosophy, and of the Hebrew code, laid hold of\r\nactions only. He pushed his scrutinies into the heart of man; erected\r\nhis tribunal in the region of his thoughts, and purified the waters at\r\nthe fountain head.\r\n\r\n4. He taught, emphatically, the doctrine of a future state, which\r\nwas either doubted, or disbelieved by the Jews; and wielded it with\r\nefficacy, as an important incentive, supplementary to the other motives\r\nto moral conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCCV.--TO GENERAL GATES, July 11, 1803\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 11, 1803.\r\n\r\nDear General,\r\n\r\nI accept with pleasure, and with pleasure reciprocate your\r\ncongratulations on the acquisition of Louisiana: for it is a subject\r\nof mutual congratulation, as it interests every man of the nation. The\r\nterritory acquired, as it includes all the waters of the Missouri and\r\nMississippi, has more than doubled the area of the United States, and\r\nthe new part is not inferior to the old in soil, climate, productions,\r\nand important communications. If our legislature dispose of it with the\r\nwisdom we have a right to expect, they may make it the means of tempting\r\nall our Indians on the east side of the Mississippi to remove to the\r\nwest, and of condensing instead of scattering our population. I find our\r\nopposition is very willing to pluck feathers from Monroe, although not\r\nfond of sticking them into Livingston’s coat. The truth is, both have\r\na just portion of merit; and were it necessary or proper, it would be\r\nshown that each has rendered peculiar services, and of important value.\r\nThese grumblers, too, are very uneasy lest the administration should\r\nshare some little credit for the acquisition, the whole of which they\r\nascribe to the accident of war. They would be cruelly mortified could\r\nthey see our files from May, 1801, the first organization of the\r\nadministration, but more especially from April, 1802. They would see,\r\nthat though we could not say when war would arise, yet we said with\r\nenergy what would take place when it should arise. We did not, by our\r\nintrigues, produce the war; but we availed ourselves of it when it\r\nhappened. The other party saw the case now existing, on which our\r\nrepresentations were predicated, and the wisdom of timely sacrifice. But\r\nwhen these people make the war give us everything, they authorize us\r\nto ask what the war gave us in their day? They had a war; what did they\r\nmake it bring us? Instead of making our neutrality the ground of gain to\r\ntheir country, they were for plunging into the war. And if they were\r\nnow in place, they would now be at war against the atheists and\r\ndisorganizers of France. They were for making their country an appendage\r\nto England. We are friendly, cordially and conscientiously friendly to\r\nEngland, but we are not hostile to France. We will be rigorously just\r\nand sincerely friendly to both. I do not believe we shall have as much\r\nto swallow from them as our predecessors had.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Gates, and accept yourself my\r\naffectionate salutations, and assurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCCVI.--TO MR. BRECKENRIDGE, August 12, 1803\r\n\r\nTO MR. BRECKENRIDGE.\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 12, 1803.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter, though directed to you, was intended to me also,\r\nand was left open with a request, that when forwarded, I would forward\r\nit to you. It gives me occasion to write a word to you on the subject\r\nof Louisiana, which being a new one, an interchange of sentiments may\r\nproduce correct ideas before we are to act on them.\r\n\r\nOur information as to the country is very incomplete: we have taken\r\nmeasures to obtain it full as to the settled part, which I hope to\r\nreceive in time for Congress. The boundaries, which I deem not admitting\r\nquestion, are the high lands on the western side of the Mississippi\r\nenclosing all its waters, the Missouri of course, and terminating in the\r\nline drawn from the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods to\r\nthe nearest source of the Mississippi, as lately settled between Great\r\nBritain and the United States. We have some claims, to extend on the\r\nsea-coast westwardly to the Rio Norte or Bravo, and better, to go\r\neastwardly to the Rio Perdido, between Mobile and Pensacola, the ancient\r\nboundary of Louisiana. These claims will be a subject of negotiation\r\nwith Spain, and if, as soon as she is at war, we push them strongly with\r\none hand, holding out a price in the other, we shall certainly obtain\r\nthe Floridas, and all in good time. In the mean while, without waiting\r\nfor permission, we shall enter into the exercise of the natural right we\r\nhave always insisted on with Spain, to wit, that of a nation holding the\r\nupper part of streams, having a right of innocent passage through them\r\nto the ocean. We shall prepare her to see us practise on this, and she\r\nwill not oppose it by force.\r\n\r\nObjections are raising to the eastward against the vast extent of our\r\nboundaries, and propositions are made to exchange Louisiana, or a part\r\nof it, for the Floridas. But, as I have said, we shall get the Floridas\r\nwithout, and I would not give one inch of the waters of the Mississippi\r\nto any nation, because I see in a light very important to our peace the\r\nexclusive right to its navigation, and the admission of no nation into\r\nit, but as into the Potomac or Delaware, with our consent and under our\r\npolice. These federalists see in this acquisition the formation of a new\r\nconfederacy, embracing all the waters of the Mississippi, on both\r\nsides of it, and a separation of its eastern waters from us. These\r\ncombinations depend on so many circumstances, which we cannot foresee,\r\nthat I place little reliance on them. We have seldom seen neighborhood\r\nproduce affection among nations. The reverse is almost the universal\r\ntruth. Besides, if it should become the great interest of those nations\r\nto separate from this, if their happiness should depend on it so\r\nstrongly as to induce them to go through that convulsion, why should the\r\nAtlantic States dread it? But especially why should we, their present\r\ninhabitants, take side in such a question? When I view the Atlantic\r\nStates, procuring for those on the eastern waters of the Mississippi\r\nfriendly instead of hostile neighbors on its western waters, I do not\r\nview it as an Englishman would the procuring future blessings for the\r\nFrench nation, with whom he has no relations of blood or affection. The\r\nfuture inhabitants of the Atlantic and Mississippi States will be our\r\nsons. We leave them in distinct but bordering establishments. We think\r\nwe see their happiness in their union, and we wish it. Events may prove\r\nit otherwise; and if they see their interest in separation, why should\r\nwe take side with our Atlantic rather than our Mississippi descendants?\r\nIt is the elder and the younger son differing. God bless them both, and\r\nkeep them in union, if it be for their good, but separate them, if it be\r\nbetter. The inhabited part of Louisiana, from Point Coupee to the sea,\r\nwill of course be immediately a territorial government, and soon a\r\nState. But above that, the best use we can make of the country for some\r\ntime, will be to give establishments in it to the Indians on the east\r\nside of the Mississippi, in exchange for their present country, and open\r\nland-offices in the last, and thus make this acquisition the means of\r\nfilling up the eastern side, instead of drawing off its population. When\r\nwe shall be full on this side, we may lay off a range of States on the\r\nwestern bank from the head to the mouth, and so, range after range,\r\nadvancing compactly as we multiply.\r\n\r\nThis treaty must of course be laid before both Houses, because both have\r\nimportant functions to exercise respecting it. They, I presume, will\r\nsee their duty to their country in ratifying and paying for it, so as\r\nto secure a good which would otherwise probably be never again in\r\ntheir power. But I suppose they must then appeal to the nation for an\r\nadditional article to the constitution, approving and confirming an act\r\nwhich the nation had not previously authorized. The constitution has\r\nmade no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for\r\nincorporating foreign nations into our Union. The executive in seizing\r\nthe fugitive occurrence which so much advances the good of their\r\ncountry, have done an act beyond the constitution. The legislature in\r\ncasting behind them metaphysical subtleties, and risking themselves like\r\nfaithful servants, must ratify and pay for it, and throw themselves on\r\ntheir country for doing for them unauthorized, what we know they would\r\nhave done for themselves had they been in a situation to do it. It is\r\nthe case of a guardian, investing the money of his ward in purchasing an\r\nimportant adjacent territory; and saying to him when of age, I did this\r\nfor your good; I pretend to no right to bind you; you may disavow me,\r\nand I must get out of the scrape as I can: I thought it my duty to risk\r\nmyself for you. But we shall not be disavowed by the nation, and their\r\nact of indemnity will confirm and not weaken the constitution, by more\r\nstrongly marking out its lines.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing later from Europe than the public papers give. I hope\r\nyourself and all the western members will make a sacred point of being\r\nat the first day of the meeting of Congress; for _vestra res regitur_.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.",
