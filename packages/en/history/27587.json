Had Athens\r\nand Sparta succumbed to this attack of Oriental superstition and\r\ndespotism, the Parthenon, the Attic Theatre, the Dialogues of Plato, would\r\nhave been almost as impossible as if Phidias, Sophocles, and the\r\nphilosophers had never lived. Because this contest and its heroes—Leonidas\r\nand Themistocles—cast their abiding shadows across our world of to-day, I\r\nhave attempted this piece of historical fiction.\r\n\r\nMany of the scenes were conceived on the fields of action themselves\r\nduring a recent visit to Greece, and I have tried to give some glimpse of\r\nthe natural beauty of “The Land of the Hellene,”—a beauty that will remain\r\nwhen Themistocles and his peers fade away still further into the\r\nbackgrounds of history.\r\n\r\n                                                                  W.

The crowd—knotty Spartans, keen\r\nAthenians, perfumed Sicilians—pressed his pulpit closer, elbowing for the\r\nplace of vantage. Amid a lull in their clamour the crier recommenced.\r\n\r\n“And now, men of Hellas, another time hearken. The sixth contestant in the\r\npentathlon, most honourable of the games held at the Isthmus, is Glaucon,\r\nson of Conon the Athenian; his grandfather—” a jangling shout drowned him.\r\n\r\n“The most beautiful man in Hellas!” “But an effeminate puppy!” “Of the\r\nnoble house of Alcmæon!” “The family’s accursed!” “A great god helps\r\nhim—even Eros.” “Ay—the fool married for mere love. He needs help. His\r\nfather disinherited him.”\r\n\r\n“Peace, peace,” urged the crier; “I’ll tell all about him, as I have of\r\nthe others. Know then, my masters, that he loved, and won in marriage,\r\nHermione, daughter of Hermippus of Eleusis. Now Hermippus is Conon’s\r\nmortal enemy; therefore in great wrath Conon disinherited his son,—but\r\nnow, consenting to forgive him if he wins the parsley crown in the\r\npentathlon—”\r\n\r\n“A safe promise,” interrupted a Spartan in broadest Doric; “the pretty boy\r\nhas no chance against Lycon, our Laconian giant.”\r\n\r\n“Boaster!” retorted an Athenian. “Did not Glaucon bend open a horseshoe\r\nyesterday?”\r\n\r\n“Our Mœrocles did that,” called a Mantinean; whereupon the crier,\r\nforegoing his long speech on Glaucon’s noble ancestry, began to urge the\r\nAthenians to show their confidence by their wagers.\r\n\r\n“How much is staked that Glaucon can beat Ctesias of Epidaurus?”\r\n\r\n“We don’t match our lion against mice!” roared the noisiest Athenian.\r\n\r\n“Or Amyntas of Thebes?”\r\n\r\n“Not Amyntas! Give us Lycon of Sparta.”\r\n\r\n“Lycon let it be,—how much is staked and by whom, that Glaucon of Athens,\r\ncontending for the first time in the great games, defeats Lycon of Sparta,\r\ntwice victor at Nemea, once at Delphi, and once at Olympia?”\r\n\r\nThe second rush and outcry put the crier nearly at his wits’ end to record\r\nthe wagers that pelted him, and which testified how much confidence the\r\nnumerous Athenians had in their unproved champion. The brawl of voices\r\ndrew newcomers from far and near. The chariot race had just ended in the\r\nadjoining hippodrome; and the idle crowd, intent on a new excitement, came\r\nsurging up like waves. In such a whirlpool of tossing arms and shoving\r\nelbows, he who was small of stature and short of breath stood a scanty\r\nchance of getting close enough to the crier’s stand to have his wager\r\nrecorded. Such, at least, was the fate of a gray but dignified little man,\r\nwho struggled vainly—even with risk to his long linen chiton—to reach the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n“Ugh! ugh! Make way, good people,—Zeus confound you, brute of a Spartan,\r\nyour big sandals crush my toes again! Can I never get near enough to place\r\nmy two minæ on that Glaucon?”\r\n\r\n“Keep back, graybeard,” snapped the Spartan; “thank the god if you can\r\nhold your money and not lose it, when Glaucon’s neck is wrung to-morrow.”\r\nWhereupon he lifted his own voice with, “Thirty drachmæ to place on Lycon,\r\nMaster Crier! So you have it—”\r\n\r\n“And two minæ on Glaucon,” piped the little man, peering up with bright,\r\nbeady eyes; but the crier would never have heard him, save for a sudden\r\nally.\r\n\r\n“Who wants to stake on Glaucon?” burst in a hearty young Athenian who had\r\nwagered already. “You, worthy sir? Then by Athena’s owls they shall hear\r\nyou! Lend us your elbow, Democrates.”\r\n\r\nThe latter request was to a second young Athenian close by. With his\r\nstalwart helpers thrusting at either side, the little man was soon close\r\nto the crier.\r\n\r\n“Two minæ?” quoth the latter, leaning, “two that Glaucon beats Lycon, and\r\nat even odds? But your name, sir—”\r\n\r\nThe little man straightened proudly.\r\n\r\n“Simonides of Ceos.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd drew back by magic. The most bristling Spartan grew respectful.\r\nThe crier bowed as his ready stylus made the entry.\r\n\r\n“Simonides of Ceos, Simonides the most noted poet in Hellas!” cried the\r\nfirst of his two rescuers; “it’s a great honour to have served so famous a\r\nman. Pray let me take your hand.”\r\n\r\n“With all the joy in the world.” The little poet coloured with delight at\r\nthe flattery. “You have saved me, I avow, from the forge and anvil of\r\nHephæstus. What a vulgar mob! Do stand apart; then I can try to thank\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nAided again by his two protectors, Simonides was soon clear of the\r\nwhirlpool. Under one of the graceful pines, which girded the long stadium,\r\nhe recovered breath and looked at leisure upon his new acquaintances. Both\r\nwere striking men, but in sharp contrast: the taller and darker showed an\r\naquiline visage betraying a strain of non-Grecian blood. His black eyes\r\nand large mouth were very merry. He wore his green chiton with a\r\nrakishness that proved him anything but a dandy. His companion, addressed\r\nas Democrates, slighter, blonder, showed Simonides a handsome and truly\r\nGreek profile, set off by a neatly trimmed reddish beard. His purple-edged\r\ncloak fell in statuesque folds of the latest mode, his beryl signet-ring,\r\nscarlet fillet, and jewelled girdle bespoke wealth and taste. His face,\r\ntoo, might have seemed frank and affable, had not Simonides suddenly\r\nrecalled an old proverb about mistrusting a man with eyes too close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the little poet, quite as ready to pay compliments as to\r\ntake them, “let me thank my noble deliverers, for I am sure two such\r\nvalorous young men as you must come of the best blood of Attica.”\r\n\r\n“I am not ashamed of my father, sir,” spoke the taller Athenian; “Hellas\r\nhas not yet forgotten Miltiades, the victor of Marathon.”\r\n\r\n“Then I clasp the hand of Cimon, the son of the saviour of Hellas.” The\r\nlittle poet’s eyes danced. “Oh! the pity I was in Thessaly so long, and\r\nlet you grow up in my absence. A noble son of a noble father! And your\r\nfriend—did you name him Democrates?”\r\n\r\n“I did so.”\r\n\r\n“Fortunate old rascal I am! For I meet Cimon the son of Miltiades, and\r\nDemocrates, that young lieutenant of Themistocles who all the world knows\r\nis gaining fame already as Nestor and Odysseus, both in one, among the\r\norators of Athens.”\r\n\r\n“Your compliments exceed all truth,” exclaimed the second Athenian, not at\r\nall angered by the praise. But Simonides, whose tongue was brisk, ran on\r\nwith a torrent of flattery and of polite insinuation, until Cimon halted\r\nhim, with a query.\r\n\r\n“Yet why, dear Cean, since, as you say, you only arrived this afternoon at\r\nthe Isthmus, were you so anxious to stake that money on Glaucon?”\r\n\r\n“Why? Because I, like all Greece outside of Sparta, seem to be turning\r\nGlaucon-mad. All the way from Thessaly—in Bœotia, in Attica, in Megara—men\r\ntalked of him, his beauty, his prowess, his quarrel with his father, his\r\nmarriage with Hermione, the divinest maiden in Athens, and how he has gone\r\nto the games to win both the crown and crusty Conon’s forgiveness. I tell\r\nyou, every mule-driver along the way seemed to have staked his obol on\r\nhim. They praise him as ‘fair as Delian Apollo,’ ‘graceful as young\r\nHermes,’ and—here I wonder most,—‘modest as an unwedded girl.’ ” Simonides\r\ndrew breath, then faced the others earnestly, “You are Athenians; do you\r\nknow him?”\r\n\r\n“Know him?” Cimon laughed heartily; “have we not left him at the wrestling\r\nground? Was not Democrates his schoolfellow once, his second self to-day?\r\nAnd touching his beauty, his valour, his modesty,” the young man’s eyes\r\nshone with loyal enthusiasm, “do not say ‘over-praised’ till you have seen\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nSimonides swelled with delight.\r\n\r\n“Oh, lucky genius that cast me with you! Take me to him this moment.”\r\n\r\n“He is so beset with admirers, his trainers are angry already; besides, he\r\nis still at the wrestling ground.”\r\n\r\n“But soon returns to his tents,” added Democrates, instantly; “and\r\nSimonides—is Simonides. If Themistocles and Leonidas can see Glaucon, so\r\nmust the first poet of Hellas.”\r\n\r\n“O dearest orator,” cried the little man, with an arm around his neck, “I\r\nbegin to love you already. Away this moment, that I may worship your new\r\ndivinity.”\r\n\r\n“Come, then,” commanded Cimon, leading off with strides so long the bard\r\ncould hardly follow; “his tent is not distant: you shall see him, though\r\nthe trainers change to Gorgons.”\r\n\r\nThe “Precinct of Poseidon,” the great walled enclosure where were the\r\ntemples, porticos, and the stadium of the Isthmus, was quickly behind\r\nthem. They walked eastward along the sea-shore. The scene about was brisk\r\nenough, had they heeded. A dozen chariots passed. Under every tall pine\r\nalong the way stood merchants’ booths, each with a goodly crowd. Now a\r\nherd of brown goats came, the offering of a pious Phocian; now a band of\r\nAphrodite’s priestesses from Corinth whirled by in no overdecorous dance,\r\nto a deafening noise of citharas and castanets. A soft breeze was sending\r\nthe brown-sailed fisher boats across the heaving bay. Straight before the\r\nthree spread the white stuccoed houses of Cenchræa, the eastern haven of\r\nCorinth; far ahead in smooth semicircle rose the green crests of the\r\nArgive mountains, while to their right upreared the steep lonely pyramid\r\nof brown rock, Acro-Corinthus, the commanding citadel of the thriving\r\ncity. But above, beyond these, fairer than them all, spread the clear,\r\nsun-shot azure of Hellas, the like whereof is not over any other land,\r\nsave as that land is girt by the crisp foam of the blue Ægean Sea.\r\n\r\nSo much for the picture, but Simonides, having seen it often, saw it not\r\nat all, but plied the others with questions.\r\n\r\n“So this Hermione of his is beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“Like Aphrodite rising from the sea foam.” The answer came from\r\nDemocrates, who seemed to look away, avoiding the poet’s keen glance.\r\n\r\n“And yet her father gave her to the son of his bitter enemy?”\r\n\r\n“Hermippus of Eleusis is sensible. It is a fine thing to have the\r\nhandsomest man in Hellas for son-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“And now to the great marvel—did Glaucon truly seek her not for dowry, nor\r\nrank, but for sheer love?”\r\n\r\n“Marriages for love are in fashion to-day,” said Democrates, with a side\r\nglance at Cimon, whose sister Elpinice had just made a love match with\r\nCallias the Rich, to the scandal of all the prudes in Athens.\r\n\r\n“Then I meet marvels even in my old age. Another Odysseus and his\r\nPenelope! And he is handsome, valiant, high-minded, with a wife his peer?\r\nYou raise my hopes too high. They will be dashed.”\r\n\r\n“They will not,” protested Democrates, with every sign of loyalty; “turn\r\nhere: this lane in the pines leads to his tent. If we have praised too\r\nmuch, doom us to the labours of Tantalus.”\r\n\r\nBut here their progress was stopped. A great knot of people were swarming\r\nabout a statue under a pine tree, and shrill, angry voices proclaimed not\r\ntrafficking, but a brawl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE ATHLETE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was ceaseless coming and going outside the Precinct of Poseidon.\r\nFollowing much the same path just taken by Simonides and his new friends,\r\ntwo other men were walking, so deep in talk that they hardly heeded how\r\nmany made respectful way for them, or how many greeted them. The taller\r\nand younger man, to be sure, returned every salute with a graceful\r\nflourish of his hands, but in a mechanical way, and with eye fixed on his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe pair were markedly contrasted. The younger was in his early prime,\r\nstrong, well developed, and daintily dressed. His gestures were quick and\r\neloquent. His brown beard and hair were trimmed short to reveal a clear\r\nolive face—hardly regular, but expressive and tinged with an extreme\r\nsubtilty. When he laughed, in a strange, silent way, it was to reveal fine\r\nteeth, while his musical tongue ran on, never waiting for answer.\r\n\r\nHis comrade, however, answered little. He barely rose to the other’s\r\nshoulder, but he had the chest and sinews of an ox. Graces there were\r\nnone. His face was a scarred ravine, half covered by scanty stubble. The\r\nforehead was low. The eyes, gray and wise, twinkled from tufted eyebrows.\r\nThe long gray hair was tied about his forehead in a braid and held by a\r\ngolden circlet. The “chlamys” around his hips was purple but dirty. To his\r\ncompanion’s glib Attic he returned only Doric monosyllables.\r\n\r\n“Thus I have explained: if my plans prosper; if Corcyra and Syracuse send\r\naid; if Xerxes has trouble in provisioning his army, not merely can we\r\nresist Persia, but conquer with ease. Am I too sanguine, Leonidas?”\r\n\r\n“We shall see.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt Xerxes will find his fleet untrustworthy. The Egyptian sailors\r\nhate the Phœnicians. Therefore we can risk a sea fight.”\r\n\r\n“No rashness, Themistocles.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—it is dicing against the Fates, and the stake is the freedom of\r\nHellas. Still a battle must be risked. If we quit ourselves bravely, our\r\nnames shall be remembered as long as Agamemnon’s.”\r\n\r\n“Or Priam’s?—his Troy was sacked.”\r\n\r\n“And you, my dear king of Sparta, will of course move heaven and earth to\r\nhave your Ephors and Council somewhat more forward than of late in\r\npreparing for war? We all count on you.”\r\n\r\n“I will try.”\r\n\r\n“Who can ask more? But now make an end to statecraft. We were speaking\r\nabout the pentathlon and the chances of—”\r\n\r\nHere the same brawling voices that had arrested Simonides broke upon\r\nThemistocles and Leonidas also. The cry “A fight!” was producing its\r\ninevitable result. Scores of men, and those not the most aristocratic,\r\nwere running pell-mell whither so many had thronged already. In the\r\nconfusion scant reverence was paid the king of Sparta and the first\r\nstatesman of Athens, who were thrust unceremoniously aside and were barely\r\nwitnesses of what followed.\r\n\r\nThe outcry was begun, after-report had it, by a Sicyonian bronze-dealer\r\nfinding a small but valuable lamp missing from the table whereon he showed\r\nhis wares. Among the dozen odd persons pressing about the booth his eye\r\nsingled out a slight, handsome boy in Oriental dress; and since Syrian\r\nserving-lads were proverbially light-fingered, the Sicyonian jumped\r\nquickly at his conclusion.\r\n\r\n“Seize the Barbarian thief!” had been his shout as he leaped and snatched\r\nthe alleged culprit’s mantle. The boy escaped easily by the frailness of\r\nhis dress, which tore in the merchant’s hands; but a score of bystanders\r\nseized the fugitive and dragged him back to the Sicyonian, whose order to\r\n“search!” would have been promptly obeyed; but at this instant he stumbled\r\nover the missing lamp on the ground before the table, whence probably it\r\nhad fallen. The bronze-dealer was now mollified, and would willingly have\r\nreleased the lad, but a Spartan bystander was more zealous.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a Barbarian thief and spy!” he began bellowing; “he dropped the\r\nlamp when he was detected! Have him to the temple and to the wardens of\r\nthe games!”\r\n\r\nThe magic word “spy” let loose the tongues and passions of every man\r\nwithin hearing. The unfortunate lad was seized again and jostled rudely,\r\nwhile questions rattled over him like hailstones.\r\n\r\n“Whose slave are you? Why here? Where’s your master? Where did you get\r\nthat outlandish dress and gold-laced turban? Confess, confess,—or it’ll be\r\nwhipped out of you! What villany are you up to?”\r\n\r\nIf the prisoner had understood Greek,—which was doubtful,—he could scarce\r\nhave comprehended this babel. He struggled vainly; tears started to his\r\neyes. Then he committed a blunder. Not attempting a protest, he thrust a\r\nsmall hand into his crimson belt and drew forth a handful of gold as bribe\r\nfor release.\r\n\r\n“A slave with ten darics!” bawled the officious Spartan, never relaxing\r\nhis grip. “Hark you, friends, it’s plain as day. Dexippus of Corinth has a\r\nSyrian lad like this. The young scoundrel’s robbed his master and is\r\nrunning away.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it! A runaway! To the temple with him!” chimed a dozen. The\r\nprisoner’s outcries were drowned. He would have been swept off in ungentle\r\ncustody had not a strong hand intervened in his favor.\r\n\r\n“A moment, good citizens,” called a voice in clear Attic. “Release this\r\nlad. I know Dexippus’s slave; he’s no such fellow.”\r\n\r\nThe others, low-browed Spartans mostly, turned, ill-pleased at the\r\ninterruption of an Athenian, but shrank a step as a name went among them.\r\n\r\n“Castor and Pollux—it’s Glaucon the Beautiful!”\r\n\r\nWith two thrusts of impetuous elbows, the young man was at the assailed\r\nlad’s side. The newcomer was indeed a sight for gods. Beauty and power\r\nseemed wholly met in a figure of perfect symmetry and strength. A face of\r\nfine regularity, a chiselled profile, smooth cheeks, deep blue eyes, a\r\ncrown of closely cropped auburn hair, a chin neither weak nor stern, a\r\nskin burnt brown by the sun of the wrestling schools—these were parts of\r\nthe picture, and the whole was how much fairer than any part! Aroused now,\r\nhe stood with head cast back and a scarlet cloak shaking gracefully from\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Unhand the lad!” he repeated.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, compelled by his beauty, the Spartans yielded. The Oriental\r\npressed against his protector; but the affair was not to end so easily.\r\n\r\n“Hark you, Sir Athenian,” rejoined the Spartan leader, “don’t presume on\r\nyour good looks. Our Lycon will mar them all to-morrow. Here’s Dexippus’s\r\nslave or else a Barbarian spy: in either case to the temple with him, and\r\ndon’t you hinder.”\r\n\r\nHe plucked at the boy’s girdle; but the athlete extended one slim hand,\r\nseized the Spartan’s arm, and with lightning dexterity laid the busybody\r\nflat on Mother Earth. He staggered upward, raging and calling on his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n“Sparta insulted by Athens! Vengeance, men of Lacedæmon! Fists! Fists!”\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Oriental was forgotten in the storm of patriotic fury that\r\nfollowed. Fortunately no one had a weapon. Half a dozen burly Laconians\r\nprecipitated themselves without concert or order upon the athlete. He was\r\nhidden a moment in the rush of flapping gowns and tossing arms. Then like\r\na rock out of the angry sea shone his golden head, as he shook off the\r\nattack. Two men were on their backs, howling. The others stood at\r\nrespectful distance, cursing and meditating another rush. An Athenian\r\npottery merchant from a neighbouring booth began trumpeting through his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Men of Athens, this way!”\r\n\r\nHis numerous countrymen came scampering from far and wide. Men snatched up\r\nstones and commenced snapping off pine boughs for clubs. The athlete,\r\ncentre of all this din, stood smiling, with his glorious head held high,\r\nhis eyes alight with the mere joy of battle. He held out his arms. Both\r\npose and face spoke as clearly as words,—“Prove me!”\r\n\r\n“Sparta is insulted. Away with the braggart!” the Laconians were\r\nclamouring. The Athenians answered in kind. Already a dark sailor was\r\ndrawing a dirk. Everything promised broken heads, and perhaps blood, when\r\nLeonidas and his friend,—by laying about them with their staves,—won their\r\nway to the front. The king dashed his staff upon the shoulder of a\r\nstrapping Laconian who was just hurling himself on Glaucon.\r\n\r\n“Fools! Hold!” roared Leonidas, and the moment the throng saw what\r\nnewcomers they faced, Athenian and Spartan let their arms drop and stood\r\nsheepish and silent. Themistocles instantly stepped forward and held up\r\nhis hand. His voice, trumpet-clear, rang out among the pines. In three\r\nsentences he dissolved the tumult.\r\n\r\n“Fellow-Hellenes, do not let Dame Discord make sport of you. I saw all\r\nthat befell. It is only an unlucky misunderstanding. You are quite\r\nsatisfied, I am sure, Master Bronze-Dealer?”\r\n\r\nThe Sicyonian, who saw in a riot the ruin of his evening’s trade, nodded\r\ngladly.\r\n\r\n“He says there was no thieving, and he is entirely satisfied. He thanks\r\nyou for your friendly zeal. The Oriental was not Dexippus’s slave, and\r\nXerxes does not need such boys for spies. I am certain Glaucon would not\r\ninsult Sparta. So let us part without bad blood, and await the judgment of\r\nthe god in the contest to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nNot a voice answered him. The crash of music from the sacrificial embassy\r\nof Syracuse diverted everybody’s attention; most of the company streamed\r\naway to follow the flower-decked chariots and cattle back to the temple.\r\nThemistocles and Leonidas were left almost alone to approach the athlete.\r\n\r\n“You are ever Glaucon the Fortunate,” laughed Themistocles; “had we not\r\nchanced this way, what would not have befallen?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, it was delightful,” rejoined the athlete, his eyes still kindled;\r\n“the shock, the striving, the putting one’s own strength and will against\r\nmany and feeling ‘I am the stronger.’ ”\r\n\r\n“Delightful, no doubt” replied the statesman, “though Zeus spare me\r\nfighting one against ten! But what god possessed you to meddle in this\r\nbrawl, and imperil all chances for to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“I was returning from practice at the palæstra. I saw the lad beset and\r\nknew he was not Dexippus’s slave. I ran to help him. I thought no more\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“And risked everything for a sly-eyed Oriental. Where is the rascal?”\r\n\r\nBut the lad—author of the commotion—had disappeared completely.\r\n\r\n“Behold his fair gratitude to his rescuer,” cried Themistocles, sourly,\r\nand then he turned to Leonidas. “Well, very noble king of Sparta, you were\r\nasking to see Glaucon and judge his chances in the pentathlon. Your\r\nLaconians have just proved him; are you satisfied?”\r\n\r\nBut the king, without a word of greeting, ran his eyes over the athlete\r\nfrom head to heel, then blurted out his verdict:\r\n\r\n“Too pretty.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon blushed like a maid. Themistocles threw up his hands in\r\ndeprecation.\r\n\r\n“But were not Achilles and many another hero beautiful as brave? Does not\r\nHomer call them so many times ‘godlike’?”\r\n\r\n“Poetry doesn’t win the pentathlon,” retorted the king; then suddenly he\r\nseized the athlete’s right arm near the shoulder. The muscles cracked.\r\nGlaucon did not wince. The king dropped the arm with a “_Euge!_” then\r\nextended his own hand, the fingers half closed, and ordered, “Open.”\r\n\r\nOne long minute, just as Simonides and his companions approached, Athenian\r\nand Spartan stood face to face, hand locked in hand, while Glaucon’s\r\nforehead grew redder, not with blushing. Then blood rushed to the king’s\r\nbrow also. His fingers were crimson. They had been forced open.\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_” cried the king, again; then, to Themistocles, “He will do.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon, as if satisfied in his object and averse to further dalliance,\r\nhe gave Cimon and his companions the stiffest of nods and deliberately\r\nturned on his heel. Speech was too precious coin for him to be wasted on\r\nmere adieus. Only over his shoulder he cast at Glaucon a curt mandate.\r\n\r\n“I hate Lycon. Grind his bones.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles, however, lingered a moment to greet Simonides. The little\r\npoet was delighted, despite overweening hopes, at the manly beauty yet\r\nmodesty of the athlete, and being a man who kept his thoughts always near\r\nhis tongue, made Glaucon blush more manfully than ever.\r\n\r\n“Master Simonides is overkind,” had ventured the athlete; “but I am sure\r\nhis praise is only polite compliment.”\r\n\r\n“What misunderstanding!” ran on the poet. “How you pain me! I truly\r\ndesired to ask a question. Is it not a great delight to know that so many\r\npeople are gladdened just by looking on you?”\r\n\r\n“How dare I answer? If ‘no,’ I contradict you—very rude. If ‘yes,’ I\r\npraise myself—far ruder.”\r\n\r\n“Cleverly turned. The face of Paris, the strength of Achilles, the wit of\r\nPeriander, all met in one body;” but seeing the athlete’s confusion more\r\nprofound than ever, the Cean cut short. “Heracles! if my tongue wounds\r\nyou, lo! it’s clapped back in its sheath; I’ll be revenged in an ode of\r\nfifty iambs on your victory. For that you will conquer, neither I nor any\r\nsane man in Hellas has the least doubt. Are you not confident, dear\r\nAthenian?”\r\n\r\n“I am confident in the justice of the gods, noble Simonides,” said the\r\nathlete, half childishly, half in deep seriousness.\r\n\r\n“Well you may be. The gods are usually ‘just’ to such as you. It’s we\r\ngraybeards that Tyche, ‘Lady Fortune,’ grows tired of helping.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps!” Glaucon passed his hand across his eyes with a dreamy gesture.\r\n“Yet sometimes I almost say, ‘Welcome a misfortune, if not too terrible,’\r\njust to ward off the god’s jealousy of too great prosperity. In all\r\nthings, save my father’s anger, I have prospered. To-morrow I can appease\r\nthat, too. Yet you know Solon’s saying, ‘Call no man fortunate till he is\r\ndead.’ ”\r\n\r\nSimonides was charmed at this frank confession on first acquaintance.\r\n“Yes, but even one of the Seven Sages can err.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know. I only hope—”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Glaucon,” admonished Democrates. “There’s no worse dinner before a\r\ncontest than one of flighty thoughts. When safe in Athens—”\r\n\r\n“In Eleusis you mean,” corrected the athlete.\r\n\r\n“Pest take you,” cried Cimon; “you say Eleusis because there is Hermione.\r\nBut make this day-dreaming end ere you come to grips with Lycon.”\r\n\r\n“He will awaken,” smiled Themistocles. Then, with another gracious nod to\r\nSimonides, the statesman hastened after Leonidas, leaving the three young\r\nmen and the poet to go to Glaucon’s tent in the pine grove.\r\n\r\n“And why should Leonidas wish Glaucon to grind the bones of the champion\r\nof Sparta?” asked Cimon, curiously.\r\n\r\n“Quickly answered,” replied Simonides, who knew half the persons of the\r\nnobility in Hellas; “first, Lycon is of the rival kingly house at Sparta;\r\nsecond, he’s suspected of ‘Medizing,’ of favouring Persia.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard that story of ‘Medizing,’ ” interrupted Democrates, promptly;\r\n“I can assure you it is not true.”\r\n\r\n“Enough if he’s suspected,” cried the uncompromising son of Miltiades;\r\n“honest Hellenes should not even be blown upon in times like this. Another\r\nreason then for hating him—”\r\n\r\n“Peace!” ordered Glaucon, as if starting from a long revery, and with a\r\nsweep of his wonderful hands; “let the Medes, the Persians, and their war\r\nwait. For me the only war is the pentathlon,—and then by Zeus’s favour the\r\nvictory, the glory, the return to Eleusis! Ah—wish me joy!”\r\n\r\n“Verily, the man is mad,” reflected the poet; “he lives in his own bright\r\nworld, sufficient to himself. May Zeus never send storms to darken it! For\r\nto bear disaster his soul seems never made.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAt the tent Manes, the athlete’s body-servant, came running to his master,\r\nwith a small box firmly bound.\r\n\r\n“A strange dark man brought this only a moment since. It is for Master\r\nGlaucon.”\r\n\r\nOn opening there was revealed a bracelet of Egyptian turquoise; the price\r\nthereof Simonides wisely set at two minæ. Nothing betrayed the identity of\r\nthe giver save a slip of papyrus written in Greek, but in very uncertain\r\nhand. “_To the Beautiful Champion of Athens: from one he has greatly\r\nserved._”\r\n\r\nCimon held the bracelet on high, admiring its perfect lustre.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles was wrong,” he remarked; “the Oriental was not ungrateful.\r\nBut what ‘slave’ or ‘lad’ was this that Glaucon succoured?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” insinuated Simonides, “Themistocles was wrong yet again. Who\r\nknows if a stranger giving such gifts be not sent forth by Xerxes?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t chatter foolishness,” commanded Democrates, almost peevishly; but\r\nGlaucon replaced the bracelet in the casket.\r\n\r\n“Since the god sends this, I will rejoice in it,” he declared lightly. “A\r\nfair omen for to-morrow, and it will shine rarely on Hermione’s arm.” The\r\nmention of that lady called forth new protests from Cimon, but he in turn\r\nwas interrupted, for a half-grown boy had entered the tent and stood\r\nbeckoning to Democrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE HAND OF PERSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lad who sidled up to Democrates was all but a hunchback. His bare arms\r\nwere grotesquely tattooed, clear sign that he was a Thracian. His eyes\r\ntwinkled keenly, uneasily, as in token of an almost sinister intelligence.\r\nWhat he whispered to Democrates escaped the rest, but the latter began\r\ngirding up his cloak.\r\n\r\n“You leave us, _philotate_?” cried Glaucon. “Would I not have all my\r\nfriends with me to-night, to fill me with fair thoughts for the morrow?\r\nBid your ugly Bias keep away!”\r\n\r\n“A greater friend than even Glaucon the Alcmæonid commands me hence,” said\r\nthe orator, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Declare his name.”\r\n\r\n“Declare _her_ name,” cried Simonides, viciously.\r\n\r\n“Noble Cean, then I say I serve a most beautiful, high-born dame. Her name\r\nis Athens.”\r\n\r\n“Curses on your public business,” lamented Glaucon. “But off with you,\r\nsince your love is the love of us all.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates kissed the athlete on both cheeks. “I leave you to faithful\r\nguardians. Last night I dreamed of a garland of lilies, sure presage of a\r\nvictory. So take courage.”\r\n\r\n“_Chaire! chaire!_”(1) called the rest; and Democrates left the tent to\r\nfollow the slave-boy.\r\n\r\nEvening was falling: the sea, rocks, fields, pine groves, were touched by\r\nthe red glow dying behind Acro-Corinthus. Torches gleamed amid the trees\r\nwhere the multitudes were buying, selling, wagering, making merry. All\r\nGreece seemed to have sent its wares to be disposed of at the Isthmia.\r\nDemocrates idled along, now glancing at the huckster who displayed his\r\npainted clay dolls and urged the sightseers to remember the little ones at\r\nhome. A wine-seller thrust a sample cup of a choice vintage under the\r\nAthenian’s nose, and vainly adjured him to buy. Thessalian easy-chairs,\r\npottery, slaves kidnapped from the Black Sea, occupied one booth after\r\nanother. On a pulpit before a bellowing crowd a pair of marionettes were\r\nrolling their eyes and gesticulating, as a woman pulled the strings.\r\n\r\nBut there were more exalted entertainments. A rhapsodist stood on a pine\r\nstump chanting in excellent voice Alcæus’s hymn to Apollo. And more\r\nwillingly the orator stopped on the edge of a throng of the better sort,\r\nwhich listened to a man of noble aspect reading in clear voice from his\r\nscroll.\r\n\r\n“Æschylus of Athens,” whispered a bystander. “He reads choruses of certain\r\ntragedies he says he will perfect and produce much later.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates knew the great dramatist well, but what he read was new—a “Song\r\nof the Furies” calling a terrific curse upon the betrayer of friendship.\r\n“Some of his happiest lines,” meditated Democrates, walking away, to be\r\nheld a moment by the crowd around Lamprus the master-harpist. But now,\r\nfeeling that he had dallied long enough, the orator turned his back on the\r\ntwo female acrobats who were swinging on a trapeze and struck down a long,\r\nstraight road which led toward the distant cone of Acro-Corinthus. First,\r\nhowever, he turned on Bias, who all the time had been accompanying,\r\ndog-fashion.\r\n\r\n“You say he is waiting at Hegias’s inn?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, master. It’s by the temple of Bellerophon, just as you begin to\r\nenter the city.”\r\n\r\n“Good! I don’t want to ask the way. Now catch this obol and be off.”\r\n\r\nThe boy snatched the flying coin and glided into the crowd.\r\n\r\nDemocrates walked briskly out of the glare of the torches, then halted to\r\nslip the hood of his cloak up about his face.\r\n\r\n“The road is dark, but the wise man shuns accidents,” was his reflection,\r\nas he strode in the direction pointed by Bias.\r\n\r\nThe way was dark. No moon; and even the brilliant starlight of summer in\r\nHellas is an uncertain guide. Democrates knew he was traversing a long\r\navenue lined by spreading cypresses, with a shimmer of white from some\r\ntall, sepulchral monument. Then through the dimness loomed the high\r\ncolumns of a temple, and close beside it pale light spread out upon the\r\nroad as from an inn.\r\n\r\n“Hegias’s inn,” grumbled the Athenian. “Zeus grant it have no more fleas\r\nthan most inns of Corinth!”\r\n\r\nAt sound of his footsteps the door opened promptly, without knocking. A\r\nsqualid scene revealed itself,—a white-washed room, an earthen floor, two\r\nclay lamps on a low table, a few stools,—but a tall, lean man in Oriental\r\ndress greeted the Athenian with a salaam which showed his own gold\r\nearrings, swarthy skin, and black mustache.\r\n\r\n“Fair greetings, Hiram,” spoke the orator, no wise amazed, “and where is\r\nyour master?”\r\n\r\n“At service,” came a deep voice from a corner, so dark that Democrates had\r\nnot seen the couch where lolled an ungainly figure that now rose clumsily.\r\n\r\n“Hail, Democrates.”\r\n\r\n“Hail, Lycon.”\r\n\r\nHand joined in hand; then Lycon ordered the Oriental to “fetch the noble\r\nAthenian some good Thasian wine.”\r\n\r\n“You will join me?” urged the orator.\r\n\r\n“Alas! no. I am still in training. Nothing but cheese and porridge till\r\nafter the victory to-morrow; but then, by Castor, I’ll enjoy ‘the\r\ngentleman’s disease’—a jolly drunkenness.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are sure of victory to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Good Democrates, what god has tricked you into believing your fine\r\nAthenian has a chance?”\r\n\r\n“I have seven minæ staked on Glaucon.”\r\n\r\n“Seven staked in the presence of your friends; how many in their absence?”\r\n\r\nDemocrates reddened. He was glad the room was dark. “I am not here to\r\nquarrel about the pentathlon,” he said emphatically.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well. Leave your dear sparrow to my gentle hands.” The Spartan’s\r\nhuge paws closed significantly: “Here’s the wine. Sit and drink. And you,\r\nHiram, get to your corner.”\r\n\r\nThe Oriental silently squatted in the gloom, the gleam of his beady eyes\r\njust visible. Lycon sat on a stool beside his guest, his Cyclops-like\r\nlimbs sprawling down upon the floor. Scarred and brutish, indeed, was his\r\nface, one ear missing, the other beaten flat by boxing gloves; but\r\nDemocrates had a distinct feeling that under his battered visage and wiry\r\nblack hair lurked greater penetration of human motive and more ability to\r\nplay therewith than the chance observer might allow. The Athenian\r\ndeliberately waited his host’s first move.\r\n\r\n“The wine is good, Democrates?” began Lycon.\r\n\r\n“Excellent.”\r\n\r\n“I presume you have arranged your wagers to-morrow with your usual\r\nprudence.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know about them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my invaluable Hiram, who arranged this interview for us through Bias,\r\nhas made himself a brother to all the betting masters. I understand you\r\nhave arranged it so that whether Glaucon wins or loses you will be none\r\nthe poorer.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian set down his cup.\r\n\r\n“Because I would not let my dear friend’s sanguine expectations blind all\r\nmy judgment is no reason why you should seek this interview, Lycon,” he\r\nrejoined tartly. “If this is the object of your summons, I’m better back\r\nin my own tent.”\r\n\r\nLycon tilted back against the table. His speech was nothing curt or\r\n“Laconic”; it was even drawling. “On the contrary, dear Democrates, I was\r\nonly commending your excellent foresight, something that I see\r\ncharacterizes all you do. You are the friend of Glaucon. Since Aristeides\r\nhas been banished, only Themistocles exceeds you in influence over the\r\nAthenians. Therefore, as a loyal Athenian you must support your champion.\r\nLikewise, as a man of judgment you must see that I—though this pentathlon\r\nis only a by-play, not my business—will probably break your Glaucon’s back\r\nto-morrow. It is precisely this good judgment on your part which makes me\r\nsure I do well to ask an interview—for something else.”\r\n\r\n“Then quickly to business.”\r\n\r\n“A few questions. I presume Themistocles to-day conferred with Leonidas?”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t present with them.”\r\n\r\n“But in due time Themistocles will tell you everything?”\r\n\r\nDemocrates chewed his beard, not answering.\r\n\r\n“_Pheu!_ you don’t pretend Themistocles distrusts you?” cried the Spartan.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like your questions, Lycon.”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry. I’ll cease them. I only wished to-night to call to your\r\nmind the advantage of two such men as you and I becoming friends. I may be\r\nking of Lacedæmon before long.”\r\n\r\n“I knew that before, but where’s your chariot driving?”\r\n\r\n“Dear Athenian, the Persian chariot is now driving toward Hellas. We\r\ncannot halt it. Then let us be so wise that it does not pass over us.”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” Democrates spilled the cup as he started. “No ‘Medizing’ talk\r\nbefore me. Am I not Themistocles’s friend?”\r\n\r\n“Themistocles and Leonidas will seem valiant fools after Xerxes comes. Men\r\nof foresight—”\r\n\r\n“Are never traitors.”\r\n\r\n“Beloved Democrates,” sneered the Spartan, “in one year the most patriotic\r\nHellene will be he who has made the Persian yoke the most endurable. Don’t\r\nblink at destiny.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be overcertain.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t grow deaf and blind. Xerxes has been collecting troops these four\r\nyears. Every wind across the Ægean tells how the Great King assembles\r\nmillions of soldiers, thousands of ships: Median cavalry, Assyrian\r\narchers, Egyptian battle-axemen—the best troops in the world. All the East\r\nwill be marching on our poor Hellas. And when has Persia failed to\r\nconquer?”\r\n\r\n“At Marathon.”\r\n\r\n“A drop of rain before the tempest! If Datis, the Persian general, had\r\nonly been more prudent!”\r\n\r\n“Clearly, noblest Lycon,” said Democrates, with a satirical smile, “for a\r\ntaciturn Laconian to become thus eloquent for tyranny must have taken a\r\nbribe of ten thousand gold darics.”\r\n\r\n“But answer my arguments.”\r\n\r\n“Well—the old oracle is proved: ‘Base love of gain and naught else shall\r\nbear sore destruction to Sparta.’ ”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t halt Xerxes’s advance.”\r\n\r\n“An end to your croakings,”—Democrates was becoming angry,—“I know the\r\nPersian’s power well enough. Now why have you summoned me?”\r\n\r\nLycon looked on his visitor long and hard. He reminded the Athenian\r\ndisagreeably of a huge cat just considering whether a mouse were near\r\nenough to risk a spring.\r\n\r\n“I sent for you because I wished you to give a pledge.”\r\n\r\n“I’m in no mood to give it.”\r\n\r\n“You need not refuse. Giving or withholding the fate of Hellas will not be\r\naltered, save as you wish to make it so.”\r\n\r\n“What must I promise?”\r\n\r\n“That you will not reveal the presence in Greece of a man I intend to set\r\nbefore you.” Another silence. Democrates knew even then, if vaguely, that\r\nhe was making a decision on which might hinge half his future. In the\r\nafter days he looked back on this instant with unspeakable regret. But the\r\nLaconian sat before him, smiling, sneering, commanding by his more\r\ndominant will. The Athenian answered, it seemed, despite himself:—\r\n\r\n“If it is not to betray Hellas.”\r\n\r\n“It is not.”\r\n\r\n“Then I promise.”\r\n\r\n“Swear it then by your native Athena.”\r\n\r\nAnd Democrates—perhaps the wine was strong—lifted his right hand and swore\r\nby Athena Polias of Athens he would betray no secret.\r\n\r\nLycon arose with what was part bellow, part laugh. Even then the orator\r\nwas moved to call back the pledge, but the Spartan acted too swiftly. The\r\nshort moments which followed stamped themselves on Democrates’s memory.\r\nThe flickering lamps, the squalid room, the long, dense shadows, the\r\nungainly movements of the Spartan, who was opening a door,—all this passed\r\nafter the manner of a vision. And as in a vision Democrates saw a stranger\r\nstepping through the inner portal, as at Lycon’s summons—a man of no huge\r\nstature, but masterful in eye and mien. Another Oriental, but not as the\r\nobsequious Hiram. Here was a lord to command and be obeyed. Gems flashed\r\nfrom the scarlet turban, the green jacket was embroidered with pearls—and\r\nwas not half the wealth of Corinth in the jewels studding the sword hilt?\r\nTight trousers and high shoes of tanned leather set off a form supple and\r\npowerful as a panther’s. Unlike most Orientals the stranger was fair. A\r\nblond beard swept his breast. His eyes were sharp, steel-blue. Never a\r\nword spoke he; but Democrates looked on him with wide eyes, then turned\r\nalmost in awe to the Spartan.\r\n\r\n“This is a prince—” he began.\r\n\r\n“His Highness Prince Abairah of Cyprus,” completed Lycon, rapidly, “now\r\ncome to visit the Isthmian Games, and later your Athens. It is for this I\r\nhave brought you face to face—that he may be welcome in your city.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian cast at the stranger a glance of keenest scrutiny. He knew by\r\nevery instinct in his being that Lycon was telling a barefaced lie. Why he\r\ndid not cry out as much that instant he hardly himself knew. But the gaze\r\nof the “Cyprian” pierced through him, fascinating, magnetizing, and\r\nLycon’s great hand was on his victim’s shoulder. The “Cyprian’s” own hand\r\nwent out seeking Democrates’s.\r\n\r\n“I shall be very glad to see the noble Athenian in his own city. His fame\r\nfor eloquence and prudence is already in Tyre and Babylon,” spoke the\r\nstranger, never taking his steel-blue eyes from the orator’s face. The\r\naccent was Oriental, but the Greek was fluent. The prince—for prince he\r\nwas, whatever his nation—pressed his hand closer. Almost involuntarily\r\nDemocrates’s hand responded. They clasped tightly; then, as if Lycon\r\nfeared a word too much, the unknown released his hold, bowed with\r\ninimitable though silent courtesy, and was gone behind the door whence he\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nIt had taken less time than men use to count a hundred. The latch clicked.\r\nDemocrates gazed blankly on the door, then turned on Lycon with a start.\r\n\r\n“Your wine was strong. You have bewitched me. What have I done? By Zeus of\r\nOlympus—I have given my hand in pledge to a Persian spy.”\r\n\r\n“ ‘A prince of Cyprus’—did you not hear me?”\r\n\r\n“Cerberus eat me if that man has seen Cyprus. No Cyprian is so blond. The\r\nman is Xerxes’s brother.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see, friend; we shall see: ‘Day by day we grow old, and day by\r\nday we grow wiser.’ So your own Solon puts it, I think.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates drew himself up angrily. “I know my duty; I’ll denounce you to\r\nLeonidas.”\r\n\r\n“You gave a pledge and oath.”\r\n\r\n“It were a greater crime to keep than to break it.”\r\n\r\nLycon shrugged his huge shoulders. “_Eu!_ I hardly trusted to that. But I\r\ndo trust to Hiram’s pretty story about your bets, and still more to a tale\r\nthat’s told about where and how you’ve borrowed money.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates’s voice shook either with rage or with fear when he made shift\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\n“I see I’ve come to be incriminated and insulted. So be it. If I keep my\r\npledge, at least suffer me to wish you and your ‘Cyprian’ a very good\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nLycon good-humouredly lighted him to the door. “Why so hot? I’ll do you a\r\nservice to-morrow. If Glaucon wrestles with me, I shall kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I thank the murderer of my friend?”\r\n\r\n“Even when that friend has wronged you?”\r\n\r\n“Silence! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nEven in the flickering lamplight Democrates could see the Spartan’s evil\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“Of course—Hermione.”\r\n\r\n“Silence, by the infernal gods! Who are you, Cyclops, for _her_ name to\r\ncross your teeth?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not angry. Yet you will thank me to-morrow. The pentathlon will be\r\nmerely a pleasant flute-playing before the great war-drama. You will see\r\nmore of the ‘Cyprian’ at Athens—”\r\n\r\nDemocrates heard no more. Forth from that wine-house he ran into the\r\nsheltering night, till safe under the shadow of the black cypresses. His\r\nhead glowed. His heart throbbed. He had been partner in foulest treason.\r\nDuty to friend, duty to country,—oath or no oath,—should have sent him to\r\nLeonidas. What evil god had tricked him into that interview? Yet he did\r\nnot denounce the traitor. Not his oath held him back, but benumbing\r\nfear,—and what sting lay back of Lycon’s hints and threats the orator knew\r\nbest. And how if Lycon made good his boast and killed Glaucon on the\r\nmorrow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PENTATHLON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a tent at the lower end of the long stadium stood Glaucon awaiting the\r\nfinal summons to his ordeal. His friends had just cried farewell for the\r\nlast time: Cimon had kissed him; Themistocles had gripped his hand;\r\nDemocrates had called “Zeus prosper you!” Simonides had vowed that he was\r\nalready hunting for the metres of a triumphal ode. The roar from without\r\ntold how the stadium was filled with its chattering thousands. The\r\nathlete’s trainers were bestowing their last officious advice.\r\n\r\n“The Spartan will surely win the quoit-throw. Do not be troubled. In\r\neverything else you can crush him.”\r\n\r\n“Beware of Mœrocles of Mantinea. He’s a knavish fellow; his backers are\r\nrecalling their bets. But he hopes to win on a trick; beware, lest he trip\r\nyou in the foot-race.”\r\n\r\n“Aim low when you hurl the javelin. Your dart always rises.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon received this and much more admonition with his customary smile.\r\nThere was no flush on the forehead, no flutter of the heart. A few hours\r\nlater he would be crowned with all the glory which victory in the great\r\ngames could throw about a Hellene, or be buried in the disgrace to which\r\nhis ungenerous people consigned the vanquished. But, in the words of his\r\nday, “he knew himself” and his own powers. From the day he quitted boyhood\r\nhe had never met the giant he could not master; the Hermes he could not\r\noutrun. He anticipated victory as a matter of course, even victory wrested\r\nfrom Lycon, and his thoughts seemed wandering far from the tawny track\r\nwhere he must face his foes.\r\n\r\n“Athens,—my father,—my wife! I will win glory for them all!” was the drift\r\nof his revery.\r\n\r\nThe younger rubber grunted under breath at his athlete’s vacant eye, but\r\nPytheas, the older of the pair, whispered confidently that “when he had\r\nknown Master Glaucon longer, he would know that victories came his way,\r\njust by reaching out his hands.”\r\n\r\n“Athena grant it,” muttered the other. “I’ve got my half mina staked on\r\nhim, too.” Then from the tents at either side began the ominous call of\r\nthe heralds:—\r\n\r\n“Amyntas of Thebes, come you forth.”\r\n\r\n“Ctesias of Epidaurus, come you forth.”\r\n\r\n“Lycon of Sparta, come you forth.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon held out his hands. Each trainer seized one.\r\n\r\n“Wish me joy and honour, good friends!” cried the athlete.\r\n\r\n“Poseidon and Athena aid you!” And Pytheas’s honest voice was husky. This\r\nwas the greatest ordeal of his favourite pupil, and the trainer’s soul\r\nwould go with him into the combat.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon of Athens, come you forth.”\r\n\r\nThe curtains of the tent swept aside. An intense sunlight sprang to meet\r\nthe Athenian. He passed into the arena clad only in his coat of glistering\r\noil. Scolus of Thasos and Mœrocles of Mantinea joined the other four\r\nathletes; then, escorted each by a herald swinging his myrtle wand, the\r\nsix went down the stadium to the stand of the judges.\r\n\r\nBefore the fierce light of a morning in Hellas beating down on him,\r\nGlaucon the Alcmæonid was for an instant blinded, and walked on passively,\r\nfollowing his guide. Then, as from a dissolving mist, the huge stadium\r\nbegan to reveal itself: line above line, thousand above thousand of\r\nbright-robed spectators, a sea of faces, tossing arms, waving garments. A\r\nthunderous shout rose as the athletes came to view,—jangling, incoherent;\r\neach city cheered its champion and tried to cry down all the rest:\r\napplause, advice, derision. Glaucon heard the derisive hootings, “pretty\r\ngirl,” “pretty pullet,” from the serried host of the Laconians along the\r\nleft side of the stadium; but an answering salvo, “Dog of Cerberus!”\r\nbawled by the Athenian crowds opposite, and winged at Lycon, returned the\r\ntaunts with usury. As the champions approached the judges’ stand a\r\nprocession of full twenty pipers, attended by as many fair boys in flowing\r\nwhite, marched from the farther end of the stadium to meet them. The boys\r\nbore cymbals and tambours; the pipers struck up a brisk marching note in\r\nthe rugged Dorian mode. The boys’ lithe bodies swayed in enchanting\r\nrhythm. The roaring multitude quieted, admiring their grace. The champions\r\nand the pipers thus came to the pulpit in the midst of the long arena. The\r\npresident of the judges, a handsome Corinthian in purple and a golden\r\nfillet, swept his ivory wand from right to left. The marching note ceased.\r\nThe whole company leaped as one man to its feet. The pipes, the cymbals\r\nwere drowned, whilst twenty thousand voices—Doric, Bœotian, Attic—chorused\r\ntogether the hymn which all Greece knew: the hymn to Poseidon of the\r\nIsthmus, august guardian of the games.\r\n\r\nLouder it grew; the multitude found one voice, as if it would cry, “We are\r\nHellenes all; though of many a city, the same fatherland, the same gods,\r\nthe same hope against the Barbarian.”\r\n\r\n  “Praise we Poseidon the mighty, the monarch,\r\n  Shaker of earth and the harvestless sea;\r\n  King of wide Ægæ and Helicon gladsome\r\n  Twain are the honours high Zeus sheds on thee!\r\n  Thine to be lord of the mettlesome chargers,\r\n  Thine to be lord of swift ships as they wing!\r\n  Guard thou and guide us, dread prince of the billows,\r\n  Safe to their homeland, thy suppliants bring;\r\n  Faring by land or by clamorous waters\r\n  Be thou their way-god to shield, to defend,\r\n  Then shall the smoke of a thousand glad altars,\r\n  To thee in reverent gladness ascend!”\r\n\r\nThus in part. And in the hush thereafter the president poured a libation\r\nfrom a golden cup, praying, as the wine fell on the brazier beside him, to\r\nthe “Earth Shaker,” seeking his blessing upon the contestants, the\r\nmultitude, and upon broad Hellas. Next the master-herald announced that\r\nnow, on the third day of the games, came the final and most honoured\r\ncontest: the pentathlon, the fivefold struggle, with the crown to him who\r\nconquered thrice. He proclaimed the names of the six rivals, their cities,\r\ntheir ancestry, and how they had complied with the required training. The\r\npresident took up his tale, and turning to the champions, urged them to\r\nstrive their best, for the eyes of all Hellas were on them. But he warned\r\nany man with blood-guiltiness upon his soul not to anger the gods by\r\ncontinuing in the games.\r\n\r\n“But since,” the brief speech concluded, “these men have chosen to\r\ncontend, and have made oath that they are purified or innocent, let them\r\njoin, and Poseidon shed fair glory upon the best!”\r\n\r\nMore shouting; the pipers paraded the arena, blowing shriller than ever.\r\nSome of the athletes shifted uneasily. Scolus the Thasian—youngest of the\r\nsix—was pale, and cast nervous glances at the towering bulk of Lycon. The\r\nSpartan gave him no heed, but threw a loud whisper at Glaucon, who stood\r\nsilently beside him:—\r\n\r\n“By Castor, son of Conon, you are extremely handsome. If fine looks won\r\nthe battle, I might grow afraid.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian, whose roving eye had just caught Cimon and Democrates in the\r\naudience, seemed never to hear him.\r\n\r\n“And you are passing stalwart. Still, be advised. I wouldn’t harm you, so\r\ndrop out early.”\r\n\r\nStill no answer from Glaucon, whose clear eye seemed now to be wandering\r\nover the bare hills of Megara beyond.\r\n\r\n“No answer?” persisted the giant. “_Eu!_ don’t complain that you’ve lacked\r\nwarning, when you sit to-night in Charon’s ferry-boat.”\r\n\r\nThe least shadow of a smile flitted across the Athenian’s face; there was\r\na slight deepening of the light in his eye. He turned his head a bit\r\ntoward Lycon:—\r\n\r\n“The games are not ended, dear Spartan,” he observed quietly.\r\n\r\nThe giant scowled. “I don’t like you silent, smiling men! You’re warned.\r\nI’ll do my worst—”\r\n\r\n“Let the leaping begin!” rang the voice of the president,—a call that\r\nchanged all the uproar to a silence in which one might hear the wind\r\nmoving in the firs outside, while every athlete felt his muscles tighten.\r\n\r\nThe heralds ran down the soft sands to a narrow mound of hardened earth,\r\nand beckoned to the athletes to follow. In the hands of each contestant\r\nwere set a pair of bronze dumb-bells. The six were arrayed upon the mound\r\nwith a clear reach of sand before. The master-herald proclaimed the order\r\nof the leaping: that each contestant should spring twice, and he whose\r\nleaps were the poorest should drop from the other contests.\r\n\r\nGlaucon stood, his golden head thrown back, his eyes wandering idly toward\r\nhis friends in the stadium. He could see Cimon restless on his seat, and\r\nSimonides holding his cloak and doubtless muttering wise counsel. The\r\nchampion was as calm as his friends were nervous. The stadium had grown\r\noppressively still; then broke into along “ah!” Twenty thousand sprang up\r\ntogether as Scolus the Thasian leaped. His partisans cheered, while he\r\nrose from a sand-cloud; but ceased quickly. His leap had been poor. A\r\nherald with a pick marked a line where he had landed. The pipers began a\r\nrollicking catch to which the athletes involuntarily kept time with their\r\ndumb-bells.\r\n\r\nGlaucon leaped second. Even the hostile Laconians shouted with pleasure at\r\nsight of his beautiful body poised, then flung out upon the sands far\r\nbeyond the Thasian. He rose, shook off the dust, and returned to the\r\nmound, with a graceful gesture to the cheer that greeted him; but wise\r\nheads knew the contest was just beginning.\r\n\r\nCtesias and Amyntas leaped beyond the Thasian’s mark, short of the\r\nAthenian’s. Lycon was fifth. His admirers’ hopes were high. He did not\r\nblast them. Huge was his bulk, yet his strength matched it. A cloud of\r\ndust hid him from view. When it settled, every Laconian was roaring with\r\ndelight. He had passed beyond Glaucon. Mœrocles of Mantinea sprang last\r\nand badly. The second round was almost as the first; although Glaucon\r\nslightly surpassed his former effort. Lycon did as well as before. The\r\nothers hardly bettered their early trial. It was long before the Laconians\r\ngrew quiet enough to listen to the call of the herald.\r\n\r\n“Lycon of Sparta wins the leaping. Glaucon of Athens is second. Scolus of\r\nThasos leaps the shortest and drops from the pentathlon.”\r\n\r\nAgain cheers and clamour. The inexperienced Thasian marched disconsolately\r\nto his tent, pursued by ungenerous jeers.\r\n\r\n“The quoit-hurling follows,” once more the herald; “each contestant throws\r\nthree quoits. He who throws poorest drops from the games.”\r\n\r\nCimon had risen now. In a momentary lull he trumpeted through his hands\r\nacross the arena.\r\n\r\n“Wake, Glaucon; quit your golden thoughts of Eleusis; Lycon is filching\r\nthe crown.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles, seated near Cimon’s side, was staring hard, elbows on knees\r\nand head on hands. Democrates, next him, was gazing at Glaucon, as if the\r\nathlete were made of gold; but the object of their fears and hopes gave\r\nback neither word nor sign.\r\n\r\nThe attendants were arraying the five remaining champions at the foot of a\r\nlittle rise in the sand, near the judges’ pulpit. To each was brought a\r\nbronze quoit, the discus. The pipers resumed their medley. The second\r\ncontest was begun.\r\n\r\nFirst, Amyntas of Thebes. He took his stand, measured the distance with\r\nhis eye, then with a run flew up the rising, and at its summit his body\r\nbent double, while the heavy quoit flew away. A noble cast! and twice\r\nexcelled. For a moment every Theban in the stadium was transported.\r\nStrangers sitting together fell on one another’s necks in sheer joy. But\r\nthe rapture ended quickly. Lycon flung second. His vast strength could now\r\ntell to the uttermost. He was proud to display it. Thrice he hurled.\r\nThrice his discus sped out as far as ever man had seen a quoit fly in\r\nHellas. Not even Glaucon’s best wishers were disappointed when he failed\r\nto come within three cubits of the Spartan. Ctesias and Mœrocles realized\r\ntheir task was hopeless, and strove half heartedly. The friends of the\r\nhuge Laconian were almost beside themselves with joy; while the herald\r\ncalled desperately that:—\r\n\r\n“Lycon of Sparta wins with the discus. Glaucon of Athens is second.\r\nCtesias of Epidaurus throws poorest and drops from the games.”\r\n\r\n“Wake, Glaucon!” trumpeted Cimon, again his white face shining out amid\r\nthe thousands of gazers now. “Wake, or Lycon wins again and all is lost!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon was almost beyond earshot; to the frantic entreaty he answered by\r\nno sign. As he and the Spartan stood once more together, the giant leered\r\non him civilly:—\r\n\r\n“You grow wise, Athenian. It’s honour enough and to spare to be second,\r\nwith Lycon first. _Eu!_—and here’s the last contest.”\r\n\r\n“I say again, good friend,”—there was a slight closing of the Athenian’s\r\nlips, and deepening in his eyes,—“the pentathlon is not ended.”\r\n\r\n“The harpies eat you, then, if you get too bold! The herald is calling for\r\nthe javelin-casting. Come,—it’s time to make an end.”\r\n\r\nBut in the deep hush that spread again over the thousands Glaucon turned\r\ntoward the only faces that he saw out of the innumerable host:\r\nThemistocles, Democrates, Simonides, Cimon. They beheld him raise his arm\r\nand lift his glorious head yet higher. Glaucon in turn saw Cimon sink into\r\nhis seat. “He wakes!” was the appeased mutter passing from the son of\r\nMiltiades and running along every tier of Athenians. And silence deeper\r\nthan ever held the stadium; for now, with Lycon victor twice, the literal\r\nturning of a finger in the next event might win or lose the parsley crown.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan came first. The heralds had set a small scarlet shield at the\r\nlower end of the course. Lycon poised his light javelin thrice, and thrice\r\nthe slim dart sped through the leathern thong on his fingers. But not for\r\nglory. Perchance this combat was too delicate an art for his ungainly\r\nhands. Twice the missile lodged in the rim of the shield; once it sprang\r\nbeyond upon the sand. Mœrocles, who followed, surpassed him. Amyntas was\r\nhardly worse. Glaucon came last, and won his victory with a dexterous\r\ngrace that made all but the hottest Laconian swell the “_Io! paian!_” of\r\napplause. His second cast had been into the centre of the target. His\r\nthird had splintered his second javelin as it hung quivering.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon of Athens wins the javelin-casting. Mœrocles of Mantinea is\r\nsecond. Amyntas of Thebes is poorest and drops from the games.” But who\r\nheard the herald now?\r\n\r\nBy this time all save the few Mantineans who vainly clung to their\r\nchampion, and the Laconians themselves, had begun to pin their hopes on\r\nthe beautiful son of Conon. There was a steely glint in the Spartan\r\nathlete’s eye that made the president of the games beckon to the\r\nmaster-herald.\r\n\r\n“Lycon is dangerous. See that he does not do Glaucon a mischief, or\r\ntransgress the rules.”\r\n\r\n“I can, till they come to the wrestling.”\r\n\r\n“In that the god must aid the Athenian. But now let us have the\r\nfoot-race.”\r\n\r\nIn the little respite following the trainers entered and rubbed down the\r\nthree remaining contestants with oil until their bodies shone again like\r\ntinted ivory. Then the heralds conducted the trio to the southern end\r\nfarthest from the tents. The two junior presidents left their pulpit and\r\ntook post at either end of a line marked on the sand. Each held the end of\r\na taut rope. The contestants drew lots from an urn for the place nearest\r\nthe lower turning goal,—no trifling advantage. A favouring god gave\r\nMœrocles the first; Lycon was second; Glaucon only third. As the three\r\ncrouched before the rope with hands dug into the sand, waiting the fateful\r\nsignal, Glaucon was conscious that a strange blond man of noble mien and\r\nOriental dress was sitting close by the starting line and watching him\r\nintently.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those moments of strain, when even trifles can turn the\r\noverwrought attention. Glaucon knew that the stranger was looking from him\r\nto Lycon, from Lycon back to himself, measuring each with shrewd eye. Then\r\nthe gaze settled on the Athenian. The Oriental called to him:—\r\n\r\n“Swift, godlike runner, swift;”—they were so close they could catch the\r\nEastern accent—“the Most High give you His wings!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon saw Lycon turn on the shouter with a scowl that was answered by a\r\ncomposed smile. To the highly strung imagination of the Athenian the wish\r\nbecame an omen of good. For some unknown cause the incident of the\r\nOriental lad he rescued and the mysterious gift of the bracelet flashed\r\nback to him. Why should a stranger of the East cast him fair wishes? Would\r\nthe riddle ever be revealed?\r\n\r\nA trumpet blast. The Oriental, his wish, all else save the tawny track,\r\nflashed from Glaucon’s mind. The rope fell. The three shot away as one.\r\n\r\nOver the sand they flew, moving by quick leaps, their shining arms\r\nflashing to and fro in fair rhythm. Twice around the stadium led the race,\r\nso no one strained at first. For a while the three clung together, until\r\nnear the lower goal the Mantinean heedlessly risked a dash. His foot\r\nslipped on the sands. He recovered; but like arrows his rivals passed him.\r\nAt the goal the inevitable happened. Lycon, with the shorter turn, swung\r\nquickest. He went up the homeward track ahead, the Athenian an elbow’s\r\nlength behind. The stadium seemed dissolving in a tumult. Men rose; threw\r\ngarments in the air; stretched out their arms; besought the gods; screamed\r\nto the runners.\r\n\r\n“Speed, son of Conon, speed!”\r\n\r\n“Glory to Castor; Sparta is prevailing!”\r\n\r\n“Strive, Mantinean,—still a chance!”\r\n\r\n“Win the turn, dear Athenian, the turn, and leave that Cyclops behind!”\r\n\r\nBut at the upper turn Lycon still held advantage, and down the other track\r\nwent the twain, even as Odysseus ran behind Ajax, “who trod in Ajax’\r\nfootsteps ere ever the dust had settled, while on his head fell the breath\r\nof him behind.” Again at the lower goal the Mantinean was panting wearily\r\nin the rear. Again Lycon led, again rose the tempest of voices. Six\r\nhundred feet away the presidents were stretching the line, where victory\r\nand the plaudits of Hellas waited Lycon of Lacedæmon.\r\n\r\nThen men ceased shouting, and prayed under breath. They saw Glaucon’s\r\nshoulders bend lower and his neck strain back, while the sunlight sprang\r\nall over his red-gold hair. The stadium leaped to their feet, as the\r\nAthenian landed by a bound at his rival’s side. Quick as the bound the\r\ngreat arm of the Spartan flew out with its knotted fist. A deadly stroke,\r\nand shunned by a hair’s-breadth; but it was shunned. The senior president\r\ncalled angrily to the herald; but none heard his words in the rending din.\r\nThe twain shot up the track elbow to elbow, and into the rope. It fell\r\namid a blinding cloud of dust. All the heralds and presidents ran together\r\ninto it. Then was a long, agonizing moment, while the stadium roared,\r\nshook, and raged, before the dust settled and the master-herald stood\r\nforth beckoning for silence.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon of Athens wins the foot-race. Lycon of Sparta is second. Mœrocles\r\nof Mantinea drops from the contest. Glaucon and Lycon, each winning twice,\r\nshall wrestle for the final victory.”\r\n\r\nAnd now the stadium grew exceeding still. Men lifted their hands to their\r\nfavourite gods, and made reckless, if silent, vows,—geese, pigs, tripods,\r\neven oxen,—if only the deity would strengthen their favourite’s arm. For\r\nthe first time attention was centred on the tall “time pointer,” by the\r\njudges’ stand, and how the short shadow cast by the staff told of the end\r\nof the morning. The last wagers were recorded on the tablets by nervous\r\nstyluses. The readiest tongues ceased to chatter. Thousands of wistful\r\neyes turned from the elegant form of the Athenian to the burly form of the\r\nSpartan. Every outward chance, so many an anxious heart told itself,\r\nfavoured the oft-victorious giant; but then,—and here came reason for a\r\ntrue Hellene,—“the gods could not suffer so fair a man to meet defeat.”\r\nThe noonday sun beat down fiercely. The tense stillness was now and then\r\nbroken by the bawling of a swarthy hawker thrusting himself amid the\r\nspectators with cups and a jar of sour wine. There was a long rest. The\r\ntrainers came forward again and dusted the two remaining champions with\r\nsand that they might grip fairly. Pytheas looked keenly in his pupil’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“ ‘Well begun is half done,’ my lad; but the hottest battle is still\r\nbefore,” said he, trying to cover his own consuming dread.\r\n\r\n“Faint heart never won a city,” smiled Glaucon, as if never more at ease;\r\nand Pytheas drew back happier, seeing the calm light in the athlete’s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” he muttered to his fellow-trainer, “all is well. The boy has\r\nwakened.”\r\n\r\nBut now the heralds marched the champions again to the judges. The\r\npresident proclaimed the rules of the wrestling,—two casts out of three\r\ngave victory. In lower tone he addressed the scowling Spartan:—\r\n\r\n“Lycon, I warn you: earn the crown only fairly, if you would earn it. Had\r\nthat blow in the foot-race struck home, I would have refused you victory,\r\nthough you finished all alone.”\r\n\r\nA surly nod was the sole answer.\r\n\r\nThe heralds led the twain a little way from the judges’ stand, and set\r\nthem ten paces asunder and in sight of all the thousands. The heralds\r\nstood, crossing their myrtle wands between. The president rose on his\r\npulpit, and called through the absolute hush:—\r\n\r\n“Prepared, Spartan?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Prepared, Athenian?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then Poseidon shed glory on the best!”\r\n\r\nHis uplifted wand fell. A clear shrill trumpet pealed. The heralds bounded\r\nback in a twinkling. In that twinkling the combatants leaped into each\r\nother’s arms. A short grapple; again a sand cloud; and both were rising\r\nfrom the ground. They had fallen together. Heated by conflict, they were\r\nlocked again ere the heralds could proclaim a tie. Cimon saw the great\r\narms of the Spartan twine around the Athenian’s chest in fair grapple, but\r\neven as Lycon strove with all his bull-like might to lift and throw,\r\nGlaucon’s slim hand glided down beneath his opponent’s thigh. Twice the\r\nSpartan put forth all his powers. Those nearest watched the veins of the\r\nathletes swell and heard their hard muscles crack. The stadium was in\r\nsuccession hushed and tumultuous. Then, at the third trial, even as Lycon\r\nseemed to have won his end, the Athenian smote out with one foot. The\r\nsands were slippery. The huge Laconian lunged forward, and as he lunged,\r\nhis opponent by a masterly effort tore himself loose. The Spartan fell\r\nheavily,—vanquished by a trick, though fairly used.\r\n\r\nThe stadium thundered its applause. More vows, prayers, exhortations.\r\nGlaucon stood and received all the homage in silence. A little flush was\r\non his forehead. His arms and shoulders were very red. Lycon rose slowly.\r\nAll could hear his rage and curses. The heralds ordered him to contain\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Now, fox of Athens,” rang his shout, “I will kill you!”\r\n\r\nPytheas, beholding his fury, tore out a handful of hair in his mingled\r\nhope and dread. No man knew better than the trainer that no trick would\r\nconquer Lycon this second time; and Glaucon the Fair might be nearer the\r\nfields of Asphodel than the pleasant hills by Athens. More than one man\r\nhad died in the last ordeal of the pentathlon.\r\n\r\nThe silence was perfect. Even the breeze had hushed while Glaucon and\r\nLycon faced again. The twenty thousand sat still as in their sepulchres,\r\neach saying in his heart one word—“Now!” If in the first wrestling the\r\nattack had been impetuous, it was now painfully deliberate. When the\r\nheralds’ wands fell, the two crept like mighty cats across the narrow\r\nsands, frames bent, hands outstretched, watching from the corners of their\r\neyes a fair chance to rush in and grapple. Then Lycon, whose raging spirit\r\nhad the least control, charged. Another dust cloud. When it cleared, the\r\ntwo were locked together as by iron.\r\n\r\nFor an instant they swayed, whilst the Spartan tried again his brute\r\npower. It failed him. Glaucon drew strength from the earth like Antæus.\r\nThe hushed stadium could hear the pants of the athletes as they locked\r\ncloser, closer. Strength failing, the Spartan snatched at his enemy’s\r\nthroat; but the Athenian had his wrist gripped fast before the clasp could\r\ntighten, and in the melée Glaucon’s other hand passed beneath Lycon’s\r\nthigh. The two seemed deadlocked. For a moment they grinned face to face,\r\nalmost close enough to bite each other’s lips. But breath was too precious\r\nfor curses. The Spartan flung his ponderous weight downward. A slip in the\r\ngliding sand would have ruined the Athenian instantly; but Poseidon or\r\nApollo was with him. His feet dug deep, and found footing. Lycon drew back\r\nbaffled, though the clutches of their hands were tightening like vices of\r\nsteel. Then again face to face, swaying to and fro, panting, muttering,\r\nwhile the veins in the bare backs swelled still more.\r\n\r\n“He cannot endure it. He cannot! Ah! Athena Polias, pity him! Lycon is\r\nwearing him down,” moaned Pytheas, beside himself with fear, almost\r\nrunning to Glaucon’s aid.\r\n\r\nThe stadium resumed its roaring. A thousand conflicting prayers, hopes,\r\ncounsels, went forth to the combatants. The gods of Olympus and Hades; all\r\ndemigods, heroes, satyrs, were invoked for them. They were besought to\r\nconquer in the name of parents, friends, and native land. Athenians and\r\nLaconians, sitting side by side, took up the combat, grappling fiercely.\r\nAnd all this time the two strove face to face.\r\n\r\nHow long had it lasted? Who knew? Least of all that pair who wrestled\r\nperchance for life and for death. Twice again the Spartan strove with his\r\nweight to crush his opponent down. Twice vainly. He could not close his\r\ngrip around the Athenian’s throat. He had looked to see Glaucon sink\r\nexhausted; but his foe still looked on him with steadfast, unweakening\r\neyes. The president was just bidding the heralds, “Pluck them asunder and\r\ndeclare a tie!” when the stadium gave a shrill long shout. Lycon had\r\nturned to his final resource. Reckless of his own hurt, he dashed his iron\r\nforehead against the Athenian’s, as bull charges bull. Twice and three\r\ntimes, and the blood leaped out over Glaucon’s fair skin. Again—the rush\r\nof blood was almost blinding. Again—Pytheas screamed with agony—the\r\nAthenian’s clutch seemed weakening. Again—flesh and blood could not stand\r\nsuch battering long. If Lycon could endure this, there was only one end to\r\nthe pentathlon.\r\n\r\n“Help thou me, Athena of the Gray Eyes! For the glory of Athens, my\r\nfather, my wife!”\r\n\r\nThe cry of Glaucon—half prayer, half battle-shout—pealed above the\r\nbellowing stadium. Even as he cried it, all saw his form draw upward as\r\nmight Prometheus’s unchained. They saw the fingers of the Spartan unclasp.\r\nThey saw his bloody face upturned and torn with helpless agony. They saw\r\nhis great form totter, topple, fall. The last dust cloud, and into it the\r\nmultitude seemed rushing together....\r\n\r\n... They caught Glaucon just as he fell himself. Themistocles was the\r\nfirst to kiss him. Little Simonides wept. Cimon, trying to embrace the\r\nvictor, hugged in the confusion a dirty Platæan. Democrates seemed lost in\r\nthe whirlpool, and came with greetings later. Perhaps he had stopped to\r\nwatch that Oriental who had given Glaucon good wishes in the foot-race.\r\nThe fairest praise, however, was from a burly man, who merely held out his\r\nhand and muttered, “Good!” But this was from Leonidas.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nVery late a runner crowned with pink oleanders panted up to the Athenian\r\nwatch by Mount Icarus at the custom-house on the Megarian frontier.\r\n\r\n“_Nika!_—He conquers.”\r\n\r\nThe man fell breathless; but in a moment a clear beacon blazed upon the\r\nheight. From a peak in Salamis another answered. In Eleusis, Hermippus the\r\nNoble was running to his daughter. In Peiræus, the harbour-town, the\r\nsailor folk were dancing about the market-place. In Athens, archons,\r\ngenerals, and elders were accompanying Conon to the Acropolis to give\r\nthanks to Athena. Conon had forgotten how he had disowned his son. Another\r\nbeacon glittered from the Acropolis. Another flashed from the lordly crest\r\nof Pentelicus, telling the news to all Attica. There was singing in the\r\nfishers’ boats far out upon the bay. In the goat-herds’ huts on dark\r\nHymethus the pan-pipes blew right merrily. Athens spent the night in\r\nalmost drunken joy. One name was everywhere:—\r\n\r\n“Glaucon the Beautiful who honours us all! Glaucon the Fortunate whom the\r\nHigh Gods love!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  BOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SHADOW OF THE PERSIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HERMIONE OF ELEUSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nA cluster of white stuccoed houses with a craggy hill behind, and before\r\nthem a blue bay girt in by the rocky isle of Salamis—that is\r\nEleusis-by-the-Sea. Eastward and westward spreads the teeming Thrasian\r\nplain, richest in Attica. Behind the plain the encircling mountain wall\r\nfades away into a purple haze. One can look southward toward Salamis; then\r\nto the left rises the rounded slope of brown Pœcilon sundering Eleusis\r\nfrom its greater neighbour, Athens. Look behind: there is a glimpse of the\r\nlong violet crests of Cithæron and Parnes, the barrier mountains against\r\nBœotia. Look to right: beyond the summits of Megara lifts a noble cone. It\r\nis an old friend, Acro-Corinthus. The plain within the hills is sprinkled\r\nwith thriving farmsteads, green vineyards, darker olive groves. The stony\r\nhill-slopes are painted red by countless poppies. One hears the tinkling\r\nof the bells of roving goats. Thus the more distant view; while at the\r\nvery foot of the hill of vision rises a temple with proud columns and\r\npediments,—the fane of Demeter the “Earth Mother” and the seat of her\r\nMysteries, renowned through Hellas.\r\n\r\nThe house of Hermippus the Eumolpid, first citizen of Eleusis, stood to\r\nthe east of the temple. On three sides gnarled trunks and sombre leaves of\r\nthe sacred olives almost hid the white low walls of the rambling\r\nbuildings. On the fourth side, facing the sea, the dusty road wound east\r\ntoward Megara. Here, by the gate, were gathered a rustic company:\r\nbrown-faced village lads and lasses, toothless graybeards, cackling old\r\nwives. Above the barred gate swung a festoon of ivy, whilst from within\r\nthe court came the squeaking of pipes, the tuning of citharas, and shouted\r\norders—signs of a mighty bustling. Then even while the company grew, a\r\nhalf-stripped courier flew up the road and into the gate.\r\n\r\n“They come,” ran the wiseacre’s comment; but their buzzing ceased, as\r\nagain the gate swung back to suffer two ladies to peer forth. Ladies, in\r\nthe truth, for the twain had little in common with the ogling village\r\nmaids, and whispers were soon busy with them.\r\n\r\n“Look—his wife and her mother! How would you, Praxinœ, like to marry an\r\nIsthmionices?”\r\n\r\n“Excellently well, but your Hermas won’t so honour you.”\r\n\r\n“_Eu!_ see, she lifts her pretty blue veil; I’m glad she’s handsome. Some\r\nbeautiful men wed regular hags.”\r\n\r\nThe two ladies were clearly mother and daughter, of the same noble height,\r\nand dressed alike in white. Both faces were framed in a flutter of Amorgos\r\ngauze: the mother’s was saffron, crowned with a wreath of golden\r\nwheat-ears; the daughter’s blue with a circlet of violets. And now as they\r\nstood with arms entwined the younger brushed aside her veil. The gossips\r\nwere right. The robe and the crown hid all but the face and tress of the\r\nlustrous brown hair,—but that face! Had not King Hephæstos wrought every\r\nline of clear Phœnician glass, then touched them with snow and rose, and\r\nshot through all the ichor of life? Perhaps there was a fitful fire in the\r\ndark eyes that awaited the husband’s coming, or a slight twitching of the\r\nimpatient lips. But nothing disturbed the high-born repose of face and\r\nfigure. Hermione was indeed the worthy daughter of a noble house, and\r\nhappy the man who was faring homeward to Eleusis!\r\n\r\nAnother messenger. Louder bustle in the court, and the voice of Hermippus\r\narraying his musicians. Now a sharp-faced man, who hid his bald pate under\r\na crown of lilies, joined the ladies,—Conon, father of the victor. He had\r\nended his life-feud with Hermippus the night the message flashed from\r\nCorinth. Then a third runner; this time in his hand a triumphant palm\r\nbranch, and his one word—“Here!” A crash of music answered from the court,\r\nwhile Hermippus, a stately nobleman, his fine head just sprinkled with\r\ngray, led out his unmartial army.\r\n\r\nSingle pipes and double pipes, tinkling lyres and many-stringed citharas,\r\nnot to forget herdsmen’s reed flutes, cymbals, and tambours, all made\r\nmelody and noise together. An imposing procession that must have crammed\r\nthe courtyard wound out into the Corinth road.\r\n\r\nHere was the demarch(2) of Eleusis, a pompous worthy, who could hardly\r\nhold his head erect, thanks to an exceeding heavy myrtle wreath. After\r\nhim, two by two, the snowy-robed, long-bearded priests of Demeter; behind\r\nthese the noisy corps of musicians, and then a host of young men and\r\nwomen,—bright of eye, graceful of movement,—twirling long chains of ivy,\r\nlaurel, and myrtle in time to the music. Palm branches were everywhere.\r\nThe procession moved down the road; but even as it left the court a crash\r\nof cymbals through the olive groves answered its uproar. Deep now and\r\nsonorous sounded manly voices as in some triumphal chant. Hermione, as she\r\nstood by the gate, drew closer to her mother. Inflexible Attic custom\r\nseemed to hold her fast. No noblewoman might thrust herself boldly under\r\nthe public eye—save at a sacred festival—no, not when the centre of the\r\ngladness was her husband.\r\n\r\n“He comes!” So she cried to her mother; so cried every one. Around the\r\nturn in the olive groves swung a car in which Cimon stood proudly erect,\r\nand at his side another. Marching before the chariot were Themistocles,\r\nDemocrates, Simonides; behind followed every Athenian who had visited the\r\nIsthmia. The necks of the four horses were wreathed with flowers; flowers\r\nhid the reins and bridles, the chariot, and even its wheels. The victor\r\nstood aloft, his scarlet cloak flung back, displaying his godlike form. An\r\nunhealed scar marred his forehead—Lycon’s handiwork; but who thought of\r\nthat, when above the scar pressed the wreath of wild parsley? As the two\r\nprocessions met, a cheer went up that shook the red rock of Eleusis. The\r\nchampion answered with his frankest smile; only his eyes seemed\r\nquestioning, seeking some one who was not there.\r\n\r\n“Io! Glaucon!” The Eleusinian youths broke from their ranks and fell upon\r\nthe chariot. The horses were loosed in a twinkling. Fifty arms dragged the\r\ncar onward. The pipers swelled their cheeks, each trying to outblow his\r\nfellow. Then after them sped the maidens. They ringed the chariot round\r\nwith a maze of flowers chains. As the car moved, they accompanied it with\r\na dance of unspeakable ease, modesty, grace. A local poet—not Simonides,\r\nnot Pindar, but some humbler bard—had invoked his muse for the grand\r\noccasion. Youths and maidens burst forth into singing.\r\n\r\n  “Io! Io, pæan! the parsley-wreathed victor hail!\r\n  Io! Io, pæan! sing it out on each breeze, each gale!\r\n    He has triumphed, our own, our beloved,\r\n      Before all the myriad’s ken.\r\n    He has met the swift, has proved swifter!\r\n      The strong, has proved stronger again!\r\n    Now glory to him, to his kinfolk,\r\n      To Athens, and all Athens’ men!\r\n    Meet, run to meet him,\r\n      The nimblest are not too fleet.\r\n    Greet him, with raptures greet him,\r\n      With songs and with twinkling feet.\r\n    He approaches,—throw flowers before him.\r\n      Throw poppy and lily and rose;\r\n    Blow faster, gay pipers, faster,\r\n      Till your mad music throbs and flows,\r\n    For his glory and ours flies through Hellas,\r\n      Wherever the Sun-King goes.\r\n\r\n  Io! Io, pæan! crown with laurel and myrtle and pine,\r\n  Io, pæan! haste to crown him with olive, Athena’s dark vine.\r\n    He is with us, he shines in his beauty;\r\n      Oh, joy of his face the first sight;\r\n    He has shed on us all his bright honour,\r\n      Let High Zeus shed on him his light,\r\n    And thou, Pallas, our gray-eyed protectress,\r\n      Keep his name and his fame ever bright!”\r\n\r\nMatching action to the song, they threw over the victor crowns and chains\r\nbeyond number, till the parsley wreath was hidden from sight. Near the\r\ngate of Hermippus the jubilant company halted. The demarch bawled long for\r\nsilence, won it at last, and approached the chariot. He, good man, had\r\nbeen a long day meditating on his speech of formal congratulation and\r\nenjoyed his opportunity. Glaucon’s eyes still roved and questioned, yet\r\nthe demarch rolled out his windy sentences. But there was something\r\nunexpected. Even as the magistrate took breath after reciting the victor’s\r\nnoble ancestry, there was a cry, a parting of the crowd, and Glaucon the\r\nAlcmæonid leaped from the chariot as never on the sands at Corinth. The\r\nveil and the violet wreath fell from the head of Hermione when her face\r\nwent up to her husband’s. The blossoms that had covered the athlete shook\r\nover her like a cloud as his face met hers. Then even the honest demarch\r\ncut short his eloquence to swell the salvo.\r\n\r\n“The beautiful to the beautiful! The gods reward well. Here is the fairest\r\ncrown!”\r\n\r\nFor all Eleusis loved Hermione, and would have forgiven far greater things\r\nfrom her than this.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nHermippus feasted the whole company,—the crowd at long tables in the\r\ncourt, the chosen guests in a more private chamber. “Nothing to excess”\r\nwas the truly Hellenic maxim of the refined Eleusinian; and he obeyed it.\r\nHis banquet was elegant without gluttony. The Syracusan cook had prepared\r\na lordly turbot. The wine was choice old Chian but well diluted. There was\r\nno vulgar gorging with meat, after the Bœotian manner; but the great\r\nCopaic eel, “such as Poseidon might have sent up to Olympus,” made every\r\ngourmand clap his hands. The aromatic honey was the choicest from Mt.\r\nHymettus.\r\n\r\nSince the smaller company was well selected, convention was waived, and\r\nladies were present. Hermione sat on a wide chair beside Lysistra, her\r\ncomely mother; her younger brothers on stools at either hand. Directly\r\nacross the narrow table Glaucon and Democrates reclined on the same couch.\r\nThe eyes of husband and wife seldom left each other; their tongues flew\r\nfast; they never saw how Democrates hardly took his gaze from the face of\r\nHermione. Simonides, who reclined beside Themistocles,—having struck a\r\nfirm friendship with that statesman on very brief acquaintance,—was\r\noverrunning with humour and anecdote. The great man beside him was hardly\r\nhis second in the fence of wit and wisdom. After the fish had given way to\r\nthe wine, Simonides regaled the company with a gravely related story of\r\nhow the Dioscuri had personally appeared to him during his last stay in\r\nThessaly and saved him from certain death in a falling building.\r\n\r\n“You swear this is a true tale, Simonides?” began Themistocles, with one\r\neye in his head.\r\n\r\n“It’s impiety to doubt. As penalty, rise at once and sing a song in honour\r\nof Glaucon’s victory.”\r\n\r\n“I am no singer or harpist,” returned the statesman, with a\r\nself-complacency he never concealed. “I only know how to make Athens\r\npowerful.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you son of Miltiades,” urged the poet, “at least you will not refuse\r\nso churlishly.”\r\n\r\nCimon, with due excuses, arose, called for a harp, and began tuning it;\r\nbut not all the company were destined to hear him. A slave-boy touched\r\nThemistocles on the shoulder, and the latter started to go.\r\n\r\n“The Dioscuri will save you?” demanded Simonides, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Quite other gods,” rejoined the statesman; “your pardon, Cimon, I return\r\nin a moment. An agent of mine is back from Asia, surely with news of\r\nweight, if he must seek me at once in Eleusis.”\r\n\r\nBut Themistocles lingered outside; an instant more brought a summons to\r\nDemocrates, who found Themistocles in an antechamber, deep in talk with\r\nSicinnus,—nominally the tutor of his sons, actually a trusted spy. The\r\nfirst glance at the Asiatic’s keen face and eyes was disturbing. An inward\r\nomen—not from the entrails of birds, nor a sign in the heavens—told\r\nDemocrates the fellow brought no happy tidings.\r\n\r\nWith incisive questions Themistocles had been bringing out everything.\r\n\r\n“So it is absolutely certain that Xerxes begins his invasion next spring?”\r\n\r\n“As certain as that Helios will rise to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Forewarned is forearmed. Now where have you been since I sent you off in\r\nthe winter to visit Asia?”\r\n\r\nThe man, who knew his master loved to do the lion’s share of the talking,\r\nanswered instantly:—\r\n\r\n“Sardis, Emesa, Babylon, Susa, Persepolis, Ecbatana.”\r\n\r\n“_Eu!_ Your commission is well executed. Are all the rumours we hear from\r\nthe East well founded? Is Xerxes assembling an innumerable host?”\r\n\r\n“Rumour does not tell half the truth. Not one tribe in Asia but is\r\nrequired to send its fighting men. Two bridges of boats are being built\r\nacross the Hellespont. The king will have twelve hundred war triremes,\r\nbesides countless transports. The cavalry are being numbered by hundreds\r\nof thousands, the infantry by millions. Such an army was never assembled\r\nsince Zeus conquered the Giants.”\r\n\r\n“A merry array!” Themistocles whistled an instant through his teeth; but,\r\nnever confounded, urged on his questions. “So be it. But is Xerxes the man\r\nto command this host? He is no master of war like Darius his father.”\r\n\r\n“He is a creature for eunuchs and women; nevertheless his army will not\r\nsuffer.”\r\n\r\n“And wherefore?”\r\n\r\n“Because Prince Mardonius, son of Gobryas, and brother-in-law of the king,\r\nhas the wisdom and valour of Cyrus and Darius together. Name him, and you\r\nname the arch-foe of Hellas. He, not Xerxes, will be the true leader of\r\nthe host.”\r\n\r\n“You saw him, of course?”\r\n\r\n“I did not. A Magian in Ecbatana told me a strange story. ‘The Prince,’\r\nsaid he, ‘hates the details of camps; leaving the preparation to others,\r\nhe has gone to Greece to spy out the land he is to conquer.’ ”\r\n\r\n“Impossible, you are dreaming!” The exclamation came not from Themistocles\r\nbut Democrates.\r\n\r\n“I am not dreaming, worthy sir,” returned Sicinnus, tartly; “the Magian\r\nmay have lied, but I sought the Prince in every city I visited; they\r\nalways told me, ‘He is in another.’ He was not at the king’s court. He may\r\nhave gone to Egypt, to India, or to Arabia;—he _may_ likewise have gone to\r\nGreece.”\r\n\r\n“These are serious tidings, Democrates,” remarked Themistocles, with an\r\nanxiety his voice seldom betrayed. “Sicinnus is right; the presence of\r\nsuch a man as Mardonius in Hellas explains many things.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Why, the lukewarmness of so many friends we had counted on, the\r\nbickerings which arose among the Confederates when we met just now at the\r\nIsthmus, the slackness of all Spartans save Leonidas in preparing for war,\r\nthe hesitancy of Corcyra in joining us. Thebes is Medizing, Crete is\r\nMedizing, so is Argos. Thessaly is wavering. I can almost name the princes\r\nand great nobles over Hellas who are clutching at Persian money. O Father\r\nZeus,” wound up the Athenian, “if there is not some master-spirit\r\ndirecting all this villany, there is no wisdom in Themistocles, son of\r\nNeocles.”\r\n\r\n“But the coming of Mardonius to Greece?” questioned the younger man; “the\r\nperil he runs? the risk of discovery—”\r\n\r\n“Is all but nothing, except as he comes to Athens, for Medizers will\r\nshelter him everywhere. Yet there is one spot—blessed be Athena—”\r\nThemistocles’s hands went up in easy piety—“where, let him come if come he\r\ndare!” Then with a swift change, as was his wont, the statesman looked\r\nstraight on Democrates.\r\n\r\n“Hark you, son of Myscelus; those Persian lords are reckless. He may even\r\ntest the fates and set foot in Attica. I am cumbered with as many cares as\r\nZeus, but this commission I give to you. You are my most trusted\r\nlieutenant; I can risk no other. Keep watch, hire spies, scatter\r\nbribe-money. Rest not day nor night to find if Mardonius the Persian\r\nenters Athens. Once in our clutches—and you have done Hellas as fair a\r\nturn as Miltiades at Marathon. You promise it? Give me your hand.”\r\n\r\n“A great task,” spoke Democrates, none too readily.\r\n\r\n“And one you are worthy to accomplish. Are we not co-workers for Athens\r\nand for Hellas?”\r\n\r\nThemistocles’s hawklike eyes were unescapable. The younger Athenian\r\nthought they were reading his soul. He held out his hand....\r\n\r\nWhen Democrates returned to the hall, Cimon had ended his song. The guests\r\nwere applauding furiously. Wine was still going round, but Glaucon and\r\nHermione were not joining. Across the table they were conversing in low\r\nsentences that Democrates could not catch. But he knew well enough the\r\nmeaning as each face flashed back the beauty of the other. And his mind\r\nwandered back darkly to the day when Glaucon had come to him, more radiant\r\nthan even his wont, and cried, “Give me joy, dear comrade, joy! Hermippus\r\nhas promised me the fairest maiden in Athens.” Some evil god had made\r\nDemocrates blind to all his boon-companion’s wooing. How many hopes of the\r\norator that day had been shattered! Yet he had even professed to rejoice\r\nwith the son of Conon.... He sat in sombre silence, until the piping voice\r\nof Simonides awakened him.\r\n\r\n“Friend, if you are a fool, you do a wise thing in keeping still; if a\r\nwise man, a very foolish thing.”\r\n\r\n“Wine, boy,” ordered Democrates; “and less water in it. I feel wretchedly\r\nstupid to-day.”\r\n\r\nHe spent the rest of the feast drinking deeply, and with much forced\r\nlaughter. The dinner ended toward evening. The whole company escorted the\r\nvictor toward Athens. At Daphni, the pass over the hills, the archons and\r\nstrategi—highest officials of the state—met them with cavalry and torches\r\nand half of the city trailing at their heels. Twenty cubits of the city\r\nwall were pulled down to make a gate for the triumphal entry. There was\r\nanother great feast at the government house. The purse of an hundred\r\ndrachmæ, due by law to Isthmian victors, was presented. A street was named\r\nfor Glaucon in the new port-town of Peiræus. Simonides recited a triumphal\r\node. All Athens, in short, made merry for days. Only one man found it hard\r\nto join the mirth whole-heartedly. And this was the victor’s bosom\r\nfriend,—Democrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  ATHENS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Athens! Shall one mount the Acropolis or enter the market place?\r\nWorship in the temple of the Virgin Athena, or descend to the Agora and\r\nthe roar of its getters and spenders? For Athens has two faces—toward the\r\nideal, toward the commonplace. Who can regard both at once? Let the\r\nAcropolis, its sculptures, its landscape, wait. It has waited for men\r\nthree thousand years. And so to the Agora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Full market time.” The Agora was a beehive. From the round Tholus at the\r\nsouth to the long portico at the north all was babel and traffic. Donkeys\r\nraised their wheezing protest against too heavy loads of farm produce.\r\nMegarian swine squealed and tugged at their leg-cords. An Asiatic sailor\r\nclamoured at the money-changer’s stall for another obol in change for a\r\nPersian daric. “Buy my oil!” bawled the huckster from his wicker booth\r\nbeside the line of Hermes-busts in the midst of the square. “Buy my\r\ncharcoal!” roared back a companion, whilst past both was haled a grinning\r\nnegro with a crier who bade every gentleman to “mark his chance” for a\r\nfashionable servant. Phocian the quack was hawking his toothache salve\r\nfrom the steps of the Temple of Apollo. Deira, the comely flower girl,\r\nheld out crowns of rose, violet, and narcissus to the dozen young dandies\r\nwho pressed about her. Around the Hermes-busts idle crowds were reading\r\nthe legal notices plastered on the base of each statue. A file of mules\r\nand wagons was ploughing through the multitude with marble for some new\r\nbuilding. Every instant the noise grew. Pandora’s box had opened, and\r\nevery clamour had flitted out.\r\n\r\nAt the northern end, where the porticos and the long Dromos street ran off\r\ntoward the Dipylon gate, stood the shop of Clearchus the potter. A low\r\ncounter was covered with the owner’s wares,—tall amphoræ for wine, flat\r\nbeakers, water-pots, and basins. Behind, two apprentices whirled the\r\nwheel, another glazed on the black varnish and painted the jars with\r\nlittle red loves and dancing girls. Clearchus sat on the counter with\r\nthree friends,—come not to trade but to barter the latest gossip from the\r\nbarber-shops: Agis the sharp, knavish cockpit and gaming-house keeper,\r\nCrito the fat mine-contractor, and finally Polus, gray and pursy, who\r\n“devoted his talents to the public weal,” in other words was a perpetual\r\njuryman and likewise busybody.\r\n\r\nThe latest rumour about Xerxes having been duly chewed, conversation began\r\nto lag.\r\n\r\n“An idle day for you, my Polus,” threw out Clearchus.\r\n\r\n“Idle indeed! No jury sits to-day in the King Archon’s Porch or the ‘Red\r\nCourt’; I can’t vote to condemn that Heraclius who’s exported wheat\r\ncontrary to the law.”\r\n\r\n“Condemn?” cried Agis; “wasn’t the evidence very weak?”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” snorted Polus, “very weak, and the wretch pleaded piteously, setting\r\nhis wife and four little ones weeping on the stand. But we are resolved.\r\n‘You are boiling a stone—your plea’s no profit,’ thought we. Our hearts\r\nvote ‘guilty,’ if our heads say ‘innocent.’ One mustn’t discourage honest\r\ninformers. What’s a patriot on a jury for if only to acquit? Holy Father\r\nZeus, but there’s a pleasure in dropping into the voting-urn the black\r\nbean which condemns!”\r\n\r\n“Athena keep us, then, from litigation,” murmured Clearchus; while Crito\r\nopened his fat lips to ask, “And what adjourns the courts?”\r\n\r\n“A meeting of the assembly, to be sure. The embassy’s come back from\r\nDelphi with the oracle we sought about the prospects of the war.”\r\n\r\n“Then Themistocles will speak,” observed the potter; “a very important\r\nmeeting.”\r\n\r\n“Very important,” choked the juror, fishing a long piece of garlic from\r\nhis wallet and cramming it into his mouth with both hands. “What a noble\r\nstatesman Themistocles is! Only young Democrates will ever be like him.”\r\n\r\n“Democrates?” squeaked out Crito.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes. Almost as eloquent as Themistocles. What zeal for democracy!\r\nWhat courage against Persia! A Nestor, I say, in wisdom—”\r\n\r\nAgis gave a whistle.\r\n\r\n“A Nestor, perhaps. Yet if you knew, as I do, how some of his nights\r\npass,—dice, Rhodian fighting-cocks, dancing-girls, and worse things,—”\r\n\r\n“I’ll scarce believe it,” grunted the juror; yet then confessed somewhat\r\nruefully, “however, he is unfortunate in his bosom friend.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” demanded the potter.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon the Alcmæonid, to be sure. I cried ‘_Io, pæan!_’ as loud as the\r\nothers when he came back; still I weary of having a man always so\r\nfortunate.”\r\n\r\n“Even as you voted to banish Aristeides, Themistocles’s rival, because you\r\nwere tired of hearing him called ‘the Just.’ ”\r\n\r\n“There’s much in that. Besides, he’s an Alcmæonid, and since their old\r\nmurder of Cylon the house has been under a blood curse. He has married the\r\ndaughter of Hermippus, who is too highly born to be faithful to the\r\ndemocracy. He carries a Laconian cane,—sure sign of Spartanizing\r\ntendencies. He may conspire any day to become tyrant.”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” warned Clearchus, “there he passes now, arm in arm with Democrates\r\nas always, and on his way to the assembly.”\r\n\r\n“The men are much alike in build,” spoke Crito, slowly, “only Glaucon is\r\ninfinitely handsomer.”\r\n\r\n“And infinitely less honest. I distrust your too beautiful and too lucky\r\nmen,” snapped Polus.\r\n\r\n“Envious dog,” commented Agis; and bitter personalities might have\r\nfollowed had not a bell jangled from an adjacent portico.\r\n\r\n“Phormio, my brother-in-law, with fresh fish from Phaleron,” announced\r\nPolus, drawing a coin from his wonted purse,—his cheek; “quick, friends,\r\nwe must buy our dinners.”\r\n\r\nBetween the columns of the portico stood Phormio the fishmonger, behind a\r\ntable heaped with his scaly wares. He was a thick, florid man with blue\r\neyes lit by a humourous twinkle. His arms were crusted with brine. To his\r\nwaist he was naked. As the friends edged nearer he held up a turbot,\r\ncalling for a bid. A clamour answered him. The throng pressed up the\r\nsteps, elbowing and scrambling. The competition was keen but good-natured.\r\nPhormio’s broad jests and witticisms—he called all his customers by\r\nname—aided in forcing up the price. The turbot was knocked down to a rich\r\ngentleman’s cook marketing for his master. The pile of fish decreased, the\r\nbidding sharpened. The “Market Wardens” seemed needed to check the\r\njostling. But as the last eel was held up, came a cry—\r\n\r\n“Look out for the rope!”\r\n\r\nPhormio’s customers scattered. Scythian constables were stretching cords\r\ndusted with red chalk across all exits from the Agora, save that to the\r\nsouth. Soon the band began contracting its nets and driving a swarm of\r\ncitizens toward the remaining exit, for a red chalk-mark on a mantle meant\r\na fine. Traffic ceased instantly. Thousands crowded the lane betwixt the\r\ntemples and porches, seeking the assembly place,—through a narrow,\r\nill-built way, but the great area of the Pnyx opened before them like the\r\nslopes of some noble theatre.\r\n\r\nNo seats; rich and poor sat down upon the rocky ground. Under the open\r\nazure, at the focus of the semicircle, with clear view before of the city,\r\nand to right of the red cliffs of the Acropolis, rose a low platform hewn\r\nin the rock,—the “Bema,” the orator’s pulpit. A few chairs for the\r\nmagistrates and a small altar were its sole furnishings. The multitude\r\nentered the Pnyx through two narrow entrances pierced in the massy\r\nengirdling wall and took seats at pleasure; all were equals—the Alcmæonid,\r\nthe charcoal-seller from Acharnæ. Amid silence the chairman of the Council\r\narose and put on the myrtle crown,—sign that the sitting was opened. A\r\nherald besought blessings on the Athenians and the Platæans their allies.\r\nA wrinkled seer carefully slaughtered a goose, proclaimed that its\r\nentrails gave good omen, and cast the carcass on the altar. The herald\r\nassured the people there was no rain, thunder, or other unlucky sign from\r\nheaven. The pious accordingly breathed easier, and awaited the order of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the Council convening the assembly was read; then the\r\nherald’s formal proclamation:—\r\n\r\n“Who wishes to speak?”\r\n\r\nThe answer was a groan from nigh every soul present. Three men ascended\r\nthe Bema. They bore the olive branches and laurel garlands, suppliants at\r\nDelphi; but their cloaks were black. “The oracle is unfavourable! The gods\r\ndeliver us to Xerxes!” The thrill of horror went around the Pnyx.\r\n\r\nThe three stood an instant in gloomy silence. Then Callias the Rich,\r\nsolemn and impressive, their spokesman, told their eventful story.\r\n\r\n“Athenians, by your orders we have been to Delphi to inquire of the surest\r\noracle in Greece your destinies in the coming war. Hardly had we completed\r\nthe accustomed sacrifices in the Temple of Apollo, when the Pythoness\r\nAristonice, sitting above the sacred cleft whence comes the inspiring\r\nvapour, thus prophesied.” And Callias repeated the hexameters which warned\r\nthe Athenians that resistance to Xerxes would be worse than futile; that\r\nAthens was doomed; concluding with the fearful line, “Get from this temple\r\nafar, and brood on the ills that await ye.”\r\n\r\nIn the pause, as Callias’s voice fell, the agony of the people became nigh\r\nindescribable. Sturdy veterans who had met the Persian spears at Marathon\r\nblinked fast. Many groaned, some cursed. Here and there a bold spirit\r\ndared to open his heart to doubt, and to mutter, “Persian gold, the\r\nPythoness was corrupted,” but quickly hushed even such whispers as rank\r\nimpiety. Then a voice close to the Bema rang out loudly:—\r\n\r\n“And is this all the message, Callias?”\r\n\r\n“The voice of Glaucon the Fortunate,” cried many, finding relief in words.\r\n“He is a friend to the ambassador. There is a further prophecy.”\r\n\r\nThe envoy, who had made his theatrical pause too long, continued:—\r\n\r\n“Such, men of Athens, was the answer; and we went forth in dire\r\ntribulation. Then a certain noble Delphian, Timon by name, bade us take\r\nthe olive branches and return to the Pythoness, saying, ‘O King Apollo,\r\nreverence these boughs of supplication, and deliver a more comfortable\r\nanswer concerning our dear country. Else we will not leave thy sanctuary,\r\nbut stay here until we die.’ Whereat the priestess gave us a second\r\nanswer, gloomy and riddling, yet not so evil as the first.”\r\n\r\nAgain Callias recited his lines of doom, “that Athena had vainly prayed to\r\nZeus in behalf of her city, and that it was fated the foe should overrun\r\nall Attica, yet\r\n\r\n  “ ‘Safe shall the wooden wall continue for thee and thy children;\r\n  Wait not the tramp of the horse, nor the footmen mightily moving\r\n  Over the land, but turn your back to the foe, and retire ye.\r\n  Yet a day shall arrive when ye shall meet him in battle.\r\n  Oh, holy Salamis, thou shalt destroy the offspring of women\r\n  When men scatter the seed, or when they gather the harvest.’ ”\r\n\r\n“And that is all?” demanded fifty voices.\r\n\r\n“That is all,” and Callias quitted the Bema. Whereupon if agony had held\r\nthe Pnyx before, perplexity held it now. “The wooden wall?” “Holy\r\nSalamis?” “A great battle, but who is to conquer?” The feverish anxiety of\r\nthe people at length found its vent in a general shout.\r\n\r\n“The seers! Call the seers! Explain the oracle!”\r\n\r\nThe demand had clearly been anticipated by the president of the Council.\r\n\r\n“Xenagoras the Cerycid is present. He is the oldest seer. Let us hearken\r\nto his opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe head of the greatest priestly family in Athens arose. He was a\r\nvenerable man, wearing his ribbon-decked robes of office. The president\r\npassed him the myrtle crown, as token that he had the Bema. In a tense\r\nhush his voice sounded clearly.\r\n\r\n“I was informed of the oracles before the assembly met. The meaning is\r\nplain. By the ‘wooden wall’ is meant our ships. But if we risk a battle,\r\nwe are told slaughter and defeat will follow. The god commands, therefore,\r\nthat without resistance we quit Attica, gathering our wives, our children,\r\nand our goods, and sail away to some far country.”\r\n\r\nXenagoras paused with the smile of him who performs a sad but necessary\r\nduty, removed the wreath, and descended the Bema.\r\n\r\n“Quit Attica without a blow! Our fathers’ fathers’ sepulchres, the shrines\r\nof our gods, the pleasant farmsteads, the land where our Attic race have\r\ndwelt from dimmest time!”\r\n\r\nThe thought shot chill through the thousands. Men sat in helpless silence,\r\nwhile many a soul, as the gaze wandered up to the temple-crowned\r\nAcropolis, asked once, yes twice, “Is not the yoke of Persia preferable to\r\nthat?” Then after the silence broke the clamour of voices.\r\n\r\n“The other seers! Do all agree with Xenagoras? Stand forth! stand forth!”\r\n\r\nHegias, the “King Archon,” chief of the state religion, took the Bema. His\r\nspeech was brief and to the point.\r\n\r\n“All the priests and seers of Attica have consulted. Xenagoras speaks for\r\nthem all save Hermippus of the house of Eumolpus, who denies the others’\r\ninterpretation.”\r\n\r\nConfusion followed. Men rose, swung their arms, harangued madly from where\r\nthey stood. The chairman in vain ordered “Silence!” and was fain to bid\r\nthe Scythian constables restore order. An elderly farmer thrust himself\r\nforward, took the wreath, and poured out his rustic wisdom from the Bema.\r\nHis advice was simple. The oracle said “the wooden wall” would be a\r\nbulwark, and by the wooden wall was surely meant the Acropolis which had\r\nonce been protected by a palisade. Let all Attica shut itself in the\r\ncitadel and endure a siege.\r\n\r\nSo far he had proceeded garrulously, but the high-strung multitude could\r\nendure no more. “_Kataba! Kataba!_” “Go down! go down!” pealed the yell,\r\nemphasized by a shower of pebbles. The elder tore the wreath from his head\r\nand fled the Bema. Then out of the confusion came a general cry.\r\n\r\n“Cimon, son of Miltiades, speak to us!”\r\n\r\nBut that young nobleman preserved a discreet silence, and the multitude\r\nturned to another favourite.\r\n\r\n“Democrates, son of Myscelus, speak to us!”\r\n\r\nThe popular orator only wrapped his cloak about him, as he sat near the\r\nchairman’s stand, never answering the call he rejoiced of wont to hear.\r\n\r\nThere were cries for Hermippus, cries even for Glaucon, as if prowess in\r\nthe pentathlon gave ability to unravel oracles. The athlete sitting beside\r\nDemocrates merely blushed and drew closer to his friend. Then at last the\r\ndespairing people turned to their last resource.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles, son of Neocles, speak to us!”\r\n\r\nThrice the call in vain; but at the fourth time a wave of silence swept\r\nacross the Pnyx. A figure well beloved was taking the wreath and mounting\r\nthe Bema.\r\n\r\nThe words of Themistocles that day were to ring in his hearer’s ears till\r\nlife’s end. The careless, almost sybaritic, man of the Isthmus and Eleusis\r\nseemed transfigured. For one moment he stood silent, lofty, awe-inspiring.\r\nHe had a mighty task: to calm the superstitious fears of thirty thousand,\r\nto silence the prophets of evil, to infuse those myriads with his own high\r\ncourage. He began with a voice so low it would have seemed a whisper if\r\nnot audible to all the Pnyx. Quickly he warmed. His gestures became\r\ndramatic. His voice rose to a trumpet-call. He swept his hearers with him\r\nas dry leaves before the blast. “When he began to weave his words, one\r\nmight have deemed him churlish, nay a fool, but when from his chest came\r\nhis deep voice, and words like unto flakes of winter snow, then who could\r\nwith him contend?” Thus Homer of Odysseus the Guileful, thus as truly of\r\nThemistocles saviour of Hellas.\r\n\r\nFirst he told the old, but never wearisome story of the past of Athens.\r\nHow, from the days of Codrus long ago, Athens had never bowed the knee to\r\nan invader, how she had wrested Salamis from greedy Megara, how she had\r\nhounded out the tyrannizing sons of Peisistratus, how she had braved all\r\nthe wrath of Persian Darius and dashed his huge armament back at Marathon.\r\nWith such a past, only a madman as well as traitor would dream of\r\nsubmitting to Xerxes now. But as for the admonition of Xenagoras to quit\r\nAttica and never strike a blow, Themistocles would have none of it. With a\r\nclearness that appealed to every home-loving Hellene he pictured the fate\r\nof wanderers as only one step better than that of slaves. What, then, was\r\nleft? The orator had a decisive answer. Was not the “wooden wall” which\r\nshould endure for the Athenians the great fleet they were just completing?\r\nAnd as for the fate of the battle the speaker had an unexpected solution.\r\n“Holy Salamis,” spoke the Pythoness. And would she have said “holy,” if\r\nthe issue had been only woe to the sons of Athens? “Luckless Salamis” were\r\nthen more reasonably the word; yet the prophetess so far from predicting\r\ndefeat had assured them victory.\r\n\r\nThus ran the substance of the speech on which many a soul knew hung the\r\nmending or ending of Hellas, but lit all through with gleams of wit,\r\nshades of pathos, outbursts of eloquence which burned into the hearers’\r\nhearts as though the speaker were a god. Then at the end, Themistocles,\r\nknowing his audience was with him, delivered his peroration:—\r\n\r\n“Let him who trusts in oracles trust then in this, and in the old prophecy\r\nof Epimenides that when the Persian comes it is to his hurt. But I will\r\nsay with Hector of Troy, ‘One oracle is best—to fight for one’s native\r\ncountry.’ Others may vote as they will. My vote is that if the foe by land\r\nbe too great, we retire before him to our ships, ay, forsake even\r\nwell-loved Attica, but only that we may trust to the ‘wooden wall,’ and\r\nfight the Great King by sea at Salamis. We contend not with gods but with\r\nmen. Let others fear. I will trust to Athena Polias,—the goddess terrible\r\nin battle. Hearken then to Solon the Wise (the orator pointed toward the\r\ntemple upon the soaring Acropolis):—\r\n\r\n  “ ‘Our Athens need fear no hurt\r\n    Though gods may conspire her ill.\r\n  The hand that hath borne us up,\r\n    It guides us and guards us still.\r\n  Athena, the child of Zeus,\r\n    She watches and knows no fear.\r\n  The city rests safe from harm\r\n    Beneath her protecting spear.’\r\n\r\nThus trusting in Athena, we will meet the foe at Salamis and will destroy\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Who wishes to speak?” called the herald. The Pnyx answered together. The\r\nvote to retire from Attica if needs be, to strengthen the fleet, to risk\r\nall in a great battle, was carried with a shout. Men ran to Themistocles,\r\ncalling him, “Peitho,—Queen Persuasion.” He made light of their praises,\r\nand walked with his handsome head tossed back toward the general’s office\r\nby the Agora, to attend to some routine business. Glaucon, Cimon, and\r\nDemocrates went westward to calm their exhilaration with a ball-game at\r\nthe gymnasium of Cynosarges. On the way Glaucon called attention to a\r\nforeigner that passed them.\r\n\r\n“Look, Democrates, that fellow is wonderfully like the honest barbarian\r\nwho applauded me at the Isthmus.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates glanced twice.\r\n\r\n“Dear Glaucon,” said he, “that fellow had a long blond beard, while this\r\nman’s is black as a crow.” And he spoke the truth; yet despite the\r\ndisguise he clearly recognized the “Cyprian.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DEMOCRATES AND THE TEMPTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the northern quarter of Athens the suburb of Alopece thrust itself\r\nunder the slopes of Mt. Lycabettus, that pyramid of tawny rock which\r\nformed the rear bulwark, as it were, of every landscape of Athens. The\r\ndwellings in the suburb were poor, though few even in the richer quarters\r\nwere at all handsome; the streets barely sixteen feet wide, ill-paved,\r\nfilthy, dingy. A line of dirty gray stucco house-fronts was broken only by\r\nthe small doors and the smaller windows in the second story. Occasionally\r\na two-faced bust of Hermes stood before a portal, or a marble lion’s head\r\nspouted into a corner water trough. All Athenian streets resembled these.\r\nThe citizen had his Pnyx, his Jury-Court, his gossiping Agora for his day.\r\nThese dingy streets sufficed for the dogs, the slaves, and the women, whom\r\nwise Zeus ordered to remain at home.\r\n\r\nPhormio the fishmonger had returned from his traffic, and sat in his\r\nhouse-door meditating over a pot of sour wine and watching the last light\r\nflickering on the great bulk of the mountain. He had his sorrows,—good\r\nman,—for Lampaxo his worthy wife, long of tongue, short of temper, thrifty\r\nand very watchful, was reminding him for the seventh time that he had sold\r\na carp half an obol too cheap. His patience indeed that evening was so\r\nnear to exhaustion that after cursing inwardly the “match-maker” who had\r\nsaddled this Amazon upon him, he actually found courage for an outbreak.\r\nHe threw up his arms after the manner of a tragic actor:—\r\n\r\n“True, true is the word of Hesiod!”\r\n\r\n“True is what?” flew back none too gently.\r\n\r\n“ ‘The fool first suffers and is after wise.’ Woman, I am resolved.”\r\n\r\n“On what?” Lampaxo’s voice was soft as broken glass.\r\n\r\n“Years increase. I shan’t live long. We are childless. I will provide for\r\nyou in my will by giving you in marriage to Hyperphon.”(3)\r\n\r\n“Hyperphon!” screamed the virago, “Hyperphon the beggarly hunchback, the\r\nlaughing-stock of Athens! O Mother Hera!—but I see the villain’s aim. You\r\nare weary of me. Then divorce me like an honourable man. Send me back to\r\nPolus my dear brother. Ah, you sheep, you are silent! You think of the\r\ntwo-minæ dowry you must then refund. Woe is me! I’ll go to the King\r\nArchon. I’ll charge you with gross abuse. The jury will condemn you.\r\nThere’ll be fines, fetters, stocks, prison—”\r\n\r\n“Peace,” groaned Phormio, terrified at the Gorgon, “I only thought—”\r\n\r\n“How dared you think? What permitted—”\r\n\r\n“Good evening, sweet sister and Phormio!” The salutation came from Polus,\r\nwho with Clearchus had approached unheralded. Lampaxo smoothed her ruffled\r\nfeathers. Phormio stifled his sorrows. Dromo, the half-starved slave-boy,\r\nbrought a pot of thin wine to his betters. The short southern twilight was\r\nswiftly passing into night. Groups of young men wandered past, bound\r\nhomeward from the Cynosarges, the Academy, or some other well-loved\r\ngymnasium. In an hour the streets would be dark and still, except for a\r\nbelated guest going to his banquet, a Scythian constable, or perhaps a\r\ncloak thief. For your Athenian, when he had no supper invitation, went to\r\nbed early and rose early, loving the sunlight far better than the flicker\r\nof his uncertain lamps.\r\n\r\n“And did the jury vote ‘guilty’?” was Phormio’s first question of his\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\n“We were patriotically united. There were barely any white beans for\r\nacquittal in the urn. The scoundrelly grain-dealer is stripped of all he\r\npossesses and sent away to beg in exile. A noble service to Athens!”\r\n\r\n“Despite the evidence,” murmured Clearchus; but Lampaxo’s shrill voice\r\nanswered her brother:—\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion you jurors should look into a case directly opposite this\r\nhouse. Spies, I say, Persian spies.”\r\n\r\n“Spies!” cried Polus, leaping up as from a coal; “why, Phormio, haven’t\r\nyou denounced them? It’s compounding with treason even to fail to report—”\r\n\r\n“Peace, brother,” chuckled the fishmonger, “your sister smells for treason\r\nas a dog for salt fish. There is a barbarian carpet merchant—a Babylonian,\r\nI presume—who has taken the empty chambers above Demas’s shield factory\r\nopposite. He seems a quiet, inoffensive man; there are a hundred other\r\nforeign merchants in the city. One can’t cry ‘Traitor!’ just because the\r\npoor wight was not born to speak Greek.”\r\n\r\n“I do not like Babylonish merchants,” propounded Polus, dogmatically; “to\r\nthe jury with him, I say!”\r\n\r\n“At least he has a visitor,” asserted Clearchus, who had long been silent.\r\n“See, a gentleman wrapped in a long himation is going up to the door and\r\nstanding up his walking stick.”\r\n\r\n“And if I have eyes,” vowed the juror, squinting through his hands in the\r\nhalf light, “that closely wrapped man is Glaucon the Alcmæonid.”\r\n\r\n“Or Democrates,” remarked Clearchus; “they look much alike from behind.\r\nIt’s getting dark.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” decided Phormio, “we can easily tell. He has left his stick below\r\nby the door. Steal across, Polus, and fetch it. It must be carved with the\r\nowner’s name.”\r\n\r\nThe juror readily obeyed; but to read the few characters on the crooked\r\nhandle was beyond the learning of any save Clearchus, whose art demanded\r\nthe mystery of writing.\r\n\r\n“I was wrong,” he confessed, after long scrutiny, “ ‘Glaucon, son of\r\nConon.’ It is very plain. Put the cane back, Polus.”\r\n\r\nThe cane was returned, but the juror pulled a very long face.\r\n\r\n“Dear friends, here is a man I’ve already suspected of undemocratic\r\nsentiments conferring with a Barbarian. Good patriots cannot be too\r\nvigilant. A plot, I assert. Treason to Athens and Hellas! Freedom’s in\r\ndanger. Henceforth I shall look on Glaucon the Alcmæonid as an enemy of\r\nliberty.”\r\n\r\n“_Phui!_” almost shouted Phormio, whose sense of humour was keen, “a noble\r\nconspiracy! Glaucon the Fortunate calls on a Babylonish merchant by night.\r\nYou say to plot against Athens. I say to buy his pretty wife a carpet.”\r\n\r\n“The gods will some day explain,” said Clearchus, winding up the\r\nargument,—and so for a little while the four forgot all about Glaucon.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nDespite the cane, Clearchus was right. The visitor was Democrates. The\r\norator mounted the dark stair above the shield-factory and knocked against\r\na door, calling, “_Pai! Pai!_” “Boy! boy!” a summons answered by none\r\nother than the ever smiling Hiram. The Athenian, however, was little\r\nprepared for the luxury, nay splendour, which greeted him, once the\r\nPhœnician had opened the door. The bare chamber had been transformed. The\r\nfoot sank into the glowing carpets of Kerman and Bactria. The\r\ngold-embroidered wall tapestries were of Sidonian purple. The divans were\r\ncovered with wondrous stuff which Democrates could not name,—another age\r\nwould call it silk. A tripod smoked with fragrant Arabian frankincense.\r\nSilver lamps, swinging from silver chains, gave brilliant light. The\r\nAthenian stood wonderbound, until a voice, not Hiram’s, greeted him.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, Athenian,” spoke the Cyprian, in his quaint, eastern accent. It\r\nwas the strange guest in the tavern by Corinth. The Prince—prince surely,\r\nwhatever his other title—was in the same rich dress as at the Isthmus,\r\nonly his flowing beard had been dyed raven black. Yet Democrates’s eyes\r\nwere diverted instantly to the peculiarly handsome slave-boy on the divan\r\nbeside his master. The boy’s dress, of a rare blue stuff, enveloped him\r\nloosely. His hair was as golden as the gold thread on the round cap. In\r\nthe shadows the face almost escaped the orator,—he thought he saw clear\r\nblue eyes and a marvellously brilliant, almost girlish, bloom and\r\nfreshness. The presence of this slave caused the Athenian to hesitate, but\r\nthe Cyprian bade him be seated, with one commanding wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n“This is Smerdis, my constant companion. He is a mute. Yet if otherwise, I\r\nwould trust him as myself.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates, putting by surprise, began to look on his host fixedly.\r\n\r\n“My dear Barbarian, for that you are a Hellene you will not pretend, you\r\nrealize, I trust, you incur considerable danger in visiting Athens.”\r\n\r\n“I am not anxious,” observed the Prince, composedly. “Hiram is watchful\r\nand skilful. You see I have dyed my hair and beard black and pass for a\r\nBabylonish merchant.”\r\n\r\n“With all except me, _philotate_,—‘dearest friend,’ as we say in Athens.”\r\nDemocrates’s smile was not wholly agreeable.\r\n\r\n“With all except you,” assented the Prince, fingering the scarlet tassel\r\nof the cushion whereon he sat. “I reckoned confidently that you would come\r\nto visit me when I sent Hiram to you. Yes—I have heard the story that is\r\non your tongue: one of Themistocles’s busybodies has brought a rumour that\r\na certain great man of the Persian court is missing from the side of his\r\nmaster, and you have been requested to greet that nobleman heartily if he\r\nshould come to Athens.”\r\n\r\n“You know a great deal!” cried the orator, feeling his forehead grow hot.\r\n\r\n“It is pleasant to know a great deal,” smiled back the Prince, carelessly,\r\nwhile Hiram entered with a tray and silver goblets brimming with\r\nviolet-flavoured sherbet; “I have innumerable ‘Eyes-and-ears.’ You have\r\nheard the name? One of the chief officers of his Majesty is ‘The Royal\r\nEye.’ You Athenians are a valiant and in many things a wise people, yet\r\nyou could grow in wisdom by looking well to the East.”\r\n\r\n“I am confident,” exclaimed Democrates, thrusting back the goblet, “if\r\nyour Excellency requires a noble game of wits, you can have one. I need\r\nonly step to the window, and cry ‘Spies!’—after which your Excellency can\r\nexercise your wisdom and eloquence defending your life before one of our\r\nAttic juries.”\r\n\r\n“Which is a polite and patriotic manner of saying, dearest Athenian, you\r\nare not prepared to push matters to such unfortunate extremity. I omit\r\nwhat his Majesty might do in the way of taking vengeance; sufficient that\r\nif aught unfortunate befalls me, or Hiram, or this my slave Smerdis, while\r\nwe are in Athens, a letter comes to your noble chief Themistocles from the\r\nbanker Pittacus of Argos.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates, who had risen to his feet, had been flushed before. He became\r\npale now. The hand that clutched the purple tapestry was trembling. The\r\nwords rose to his lips, the lips refused to utter them. The Prince, who\r\nhad delivered his threat most quietly, went on, “In short, good\r\nDemocrates, I was aware before I came to Athens of our necessities, and I\r\ncame because I was certain I could relieve them.”\r\n\r\n“Never!” The orator shot the word out desperately.\r\n\r\n“You are a Hellene.”\r\n\r\n“Am I ashamed of it?”\r\n\r\n“Do not, however, affect to be more virtuous than your race. Persians make\r\ntheir boast of truth-telling and fidelity. You Hellenes, I hear, have even\r\na god—Hermes Dolios,—who teaches you lying and thieving. The customs of\r\nnations differ. Mazda the Almighty alone knoweth which is best. Follow\r\nthen the customs of Hellenes.”\r\n\r\n“You speak in riddles.”\r\n\r\n“Plainer, then. You know the master I serve. You guess who I am, though\r\nyou shall not name me. For what sum will you serve Xerxes the Great King?”\r\n\r\nThe orator’s breath came deep. His hands clasped and unclasped, then were\r\npressed behind his head.\r\n\r\n“I told Lycon, and I tell you, I am no traitor to Hellas.”\r\n\r\n“Which means, of course, you demand a fair price. I am not angry. You will\r\nfind a Persian pays like the lord he is, and that his darics always ring\r\ntrue metal.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll hear no more. I was a fool to meet Lycon at Corinth, doubly a fool\r\nto meet you to-night. Farewell.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates seized the latch. The door was locked. He turned furiously on\r\nthe Barbarian. “Do you keep me by force? Have a care. I can be terrible if\r\ndriven to bay. The window is open. One shout—”\r\n\r\nThe Cyprian had risen, and quietly, but with a grip like iron on\r\nDemocrates’s wrist, led the orator back to the divan.\r\n\r\n“You can go free in a twinkling, but hear you shall. Before you boast of\r\nyour power, you shall know all of mine. I will recite your condition.\r\nContradict if I say anything amiss. Your father Myscelus was of the noble\r\nhouse of Codrus, a great name in Athens, but he left you no large estate.\r\nYou were ambitious to shine as an orator and leader of the Athenians. To\r\nwin popularity you have given great feasts. At the last festival of the\r\nTheseia you fed the poor of Athens on sixty oxen washed down with good\r\nRhodian wine. All that made havoc in your patrimony.”\r\n\r\n“By Zeus, you speak as if you lived all your life in Athens!”\r\n\r\n“I have said ‘I have many eyes.’ But to continue. You gave the price of\r\nthe tackling for six of the triremes with which Themistocles pretends to\r\nbelieve he can beat back my master. Worse still, you have squandered many\r\nminæ on flute girls, dice, cock-fights, and other gentle pleasures. In\r\nshort your patrimony is not merely exhausted but overspent. That, however,\r\nis not the most wonderful part of my recital.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you pry into my secrets?”\r\n\r\n“Be appeased, dear Athenian; it is much more interesting to know you deny\r\nnothing of all I say. It is now five months since you were appointed by\r\nyour sagacious Athenian assembly as commissioner to administer the silver\r\ntaken from the mines at Laurium and devoted to your navy. You fulfilled\r\nthe people’s confidence by diverting much of this money to the payment of\r\nyour own great debts to the banker Pittacus of Argos. At present you are\r\n‘watching the moon,’ as you say here in Athens,—I mean, that at the end of\r\nthis month you must account to the people for all the money you have\r\nhandled, and at this hour are at your wits’ ends to know whence the\r\nrepayment will come.”\r\n\r\n“That is all you know of me?”\r\n\r\n“All.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates sighed with relief. “Then you have yet to complete the story,\r\nmy dear Barbarian. I have adventured on half the cargo of a large\r\nmerchantman bringing timber and tin from Massalia; I look every day for a\r\nmessenger from Corinth with news of her safe arrival. Upon her coming I\r\ncan make good all I owe and still be a passing rich man.”\r\n\r\nIf the Cyprian was discomposed at this announcement, he did not betray it.\r\n\r\n“The sea is frightfully uncertain, good Democrates. Upon it, as many\r\nfortunes are lost as are made.”\r\n\r\n“I have offered due prayers to Poseidon, and vowed a gold tripod on the\r\nship’s arrival.”\r\n\r\n“So even your gods in Hellas have their price,” was the retort, with an\r\nill-concealed sneer. “Do not trust them. Take ten talents from me and\r\nto-night sleep sweetly.”\r\n\r\n“Your price?” the words slipped forth involuntarily.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles’s private memoranda for the battle-order of your new fleet.”\r\n\r\n“Avert it, gods! The ship will reach Corinth, I warn you—” Democrates’s\r\ngestures became menacing, as again he rose, “I will set you in\r\nThemistocles’s hand as soon—”\r\n\r\n“But not to-night.” The Prince rose, smiled, held out his hand. “Unbar the\r\ndoor for his Excellency, Hiram. And you, noble sir, think well of all I\r\nsaid at Corinth on the certain victory of my master; think also—” the\r\nvoice fell—“how Democrates the Codrid could be sovereign of Athens under\r\nthe protection of Persia.”\r\n\r\n“I tyrant of Athens?” the orator clapped his hand behind his back; “you\r\nsay enough. Good evening.”\r\n\r\nHe was on the threshold, when the slave-boy touched his master’s hand in\r\nsilent signal.\r\n\r\n“And if there be any fair woman you desire,”—how gliding the Cyprian’s\r\nvoice!—“shall not the power of Xerxes the great give her unto you?”\r\n\r\nWhy did Democrates feel his forehead turn to flame? Why—almost against\r\nwill—did he stretch forth his hand to the Cyprian? He went down the stair\r\nscarce feeling the steps beneath him. At the bottom voices greeted him\r\nfrom across the darkened street.\r\n\r\n“A fair evening, Master Glaucon.”\r\n\r\n“A fair evening,” his mechanical answer; then to himself; as he walked\r\naway, “Wherefore call me Glaucon? I have somewhat his height, though not\r\nhis shoulder. Ah,—I know it, I have chanced to borrow his carved\r\nwalking-stick. Impudent creatures to read the name!”\r\n\r\nHe had not far to go. Athens was compactly built, all quarters close\r\ntogether. Yet before he reached home and bed, he was fighting back an\r\nill-defined but terrible thought. “Glaucon! They think I am Glaucon. If I\r\nchose to betray the Cyprian—” Further than that he would not suffer the\r\nthought to go. He lay sleepless, fighting against it. The dark was full of\r\nthe harpies of uncanny suggestion. He arose unrefreshed, to proffer every\r\ngod the same prayer: “Deliver me from evil imaginings. Speed the ship to\r\nCorinth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ON THE ACROPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Acropolis of Athens rises as does no other citadel in the world. Had\r\nno workers in marble or bronze, no weavers of eloquence or song, dwelt\r\nbeneath its shadow, it would stand the centre and cynosure of a remarkable\r\nlandscape. It is “_The Rock_,” no other like unto it. Is it enough to say\r\nits ruddy limestone rises as a huge boulder one hundred and fifty feet\r\nabove the plain, that its breadth is five hundred, its length one\r\nthousand? Numbers and measures can never disclose a soul,—and the Rock of\r\nAthens has all but a soul: a soul seems to glow through its adamant when\r\nthe fire-footed morning steals over the long crest of Hymettus, and\r\ntouches the citadel’s red bulk with unearthly brightness; a soul when the\r\nday falls to sleep in the arms of night as Helios sinks over the western\r\nhill by Daphni. Then the Rock seems to throb and burn with life again.\r\n\r\nIt is so bare that the hungry goats can hardly crop one spear of grass\r\nalong its jagged slopes. It is so steep it scarce needs defence against an\r\narmy. It is so commanding that he who stands on the westmost pinnacle can\r\nlook across the windy hill of the Pnyx, across the brown plain-land and\r\ndown to the sparkling blue sea with the busy havens of Peiræus and\r\nPhalerum, the scattered gray isles of the Ægean, and far away to the\r\ndomelike crest of Acro-Corinthus. Let him turn to the right: below him\r\nnestles the gnarled hill of Areopagus, home of the Furies, the buzzing\r\nplaza of the Agora, the closely clustered city. Behind, there spread\r\nmountain, valley, plain,—here green, here brown, here golden,—with\r\nPentelicus the Mighty rearing behind all, his summits fretted white, not\r\nwith winter snows, but with lustrous marble. Look to the left: across the\r\nview passes the shaggy ridge of Hymettus, arid and scarred, as if wrought\r\nby the Titans, home only of goats and bees, of nymphs and satyrs.\r\n\r\nThat was almost the self-same vision in the dim past when the first savage\r\nclambered this “Citadel of Cecrops” and spoke, “Here is my\r\ndwelling-place.” This will be the vision until earth and ocean are no\r\nmore. The human habitation changes, the temples rise and crumble; the red\r\nand gray rock, the crystalline air, the sapphire sea, come from the god,\r\nand these remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlaucon and Hermione were come together to offer thanks to Athena for the\r\nglory of the Isthmus. The athlete had already mounted the citadel heading\r\na myrtle-crowned procession to bear a formal thanksgiving, but his wife\r\nhad not then been with him. Now they would go together, without pomp. They\r\nwalked side by side. Nimble Chloë tripped behind with her mistress’s\r\nparasol. Old Manes bore the bloodless sacrifice, but Hermione said in her\r\nheart there came two too many.\r\n\r\nMany a friendly eye, many a friendly word, followed as they crossed the\r\nAgora, where traffic was in its morning bustle. Glaucon answered every\r\ngreeting with his winsome smile.\r\n\r\n“All Athens seems our friend!” he said, as close by the Tyrannicides’\r\nstatues at the upper end of the plaza a grave councilman bowed and an old\r\nbread woman left her stall to bob a courtesy.\r\n\r\n“Is _your_ friend,” corrected Hermione, thinking only of her husband, “for\r\nI have won no pentathlon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _makaira_, dearest and best,” he answered, looking not on the\r\nglorious citadel but on her face, “could I have won the parsley wreath had\r\nthere been no better wreath awaiting me at Eleusis? And to-day I am\r\ngladdest of the glad. For the gods have sent me blessings beyond desert, I\r\nno longer fear their envy as once. I enjoy honour with all good men. I\r\nhave no enemy in the world. I have the dearest of friends, Cimon,\r\nThemistocles—beyond all, Democrates. I am blessed in love beyond Peleus\r\nespoused to Thetis, or Anchises beloved of Aphrodite, for my golden\r\nAphrodite lives not on Olympus, nor Paphos, nor comes on her doves from\r\nCythera, but dwells—”\r\n\r\n“Peace.” The hand laid on his mouth was small but firm. “Do not anger the\r\ngoddess by likening me unto her. It is joy enough for me if I can look up\r\nat the sun and say, ‘I keep the love of Glaucon the Fortunate and the\r\nGood.’ ”\r\n\r\nWalking thus in their golden dream, the two crossed the Agora, turned to\r\nthe left from the Pnyx, and by crooked lanes went past the craggy rock of\r\nAreopagus, till before them rose a wooden palisade and a gate. Through\r\nthis a steep path led upward to the citadel. Not to the Acropolis of fame.\r\nThe buildings then upon the Rock in one short year would lie in heaps of\r\nfire-scarred ruin. Yet in that hour before Glaucon and Hermione a not\r\nunworthy temple rose, the old “House of Athena,” prototype of the later\r\nParthenon. In the morning light it stood in beauty—a hundred Doric\r\ncolumns, a sculptured pediment, flashing with white marble and with tints\r\nof scarlet, blue, and gold. Below it, over the irregular plateau of the\r\nRock, spread avenues of votive statues of gods and heroes in stone,\r\nbronze, or painted wood. Here and there were numerous shrines and small\r\ntemples, and a giant altar for burning a hundred oxen. So hand in hand the\r\ntwain went to the bronze portal of the Temple. The kindly old priest on\r\nguard smiled as he sprinkled them with the purifying salt water out of the\r\nbrazen laver. The door closed behind them. For a moment they seemed to\r\nstand in the high temple in utter darkness. Then far above through the\r\nmarble roof a softened light came creeping toward them. As from unfolding\r\nmist, the great calm face of the ancient goddess looked down with its\r\nunchanging smile. A red coal glowed on the tripod at her feet. Glaucon\r\nshook incense over the brazier. While it smoked, Hermione laid the crown\r\nof lilies between the knees of the half-seen image, then her husband\r\nlifted his hands and prayed aloud.\r\n\r\n“Athena, Virgin, Queen, Deviser of Wisdom,—whatever be the name thou\r\nlovest best,—accept this offering and hear. Bless now us both. Give us to\r\nstrive for the noblest, to speak the wise word, to love one another. Give\r\nus prosperity, but not unto pride. Bless all our friends; but if we have\r\nenemies, be thou their enemy also. And so shall we praise thee forever.”\r\n\r\nThis was all the prayer and worship. A little more meditation, then\r\nhusband and wife went forth from the sacred cella. The panorama—rocks,\r\nplain, sea, and bending heavens—opened before them in glory. The light\r\nfaded upon the purple breasts of the western mountains. Behind the\r\nAcropolis, Lycabettus’s pyramid glowed like a furnace. The marble on\r\ndistant Pentelicus shone dazzlingly.\r\n\r\nGlaucon stood on the easternmost pinnacle of the Rock, watching the\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n“Joy, _makaira_, joy,” he cried, “we possess one another. We dwell in\r\n‘violet-crowned Athens’; for what else dare we to pray?”\r\n\r\nBut Hermione pointed less pleased toward the crest of Pentelicus.\r\n\r\n“Behold it! How swiftly yonder gray cloud comes on a rushing wind! It will\r\ncover the brightness. The omen is bad.”\r\n\r\n“Why bad, _makaira_?”\r\n\r\n“The cloud is the Persian. He hangs to-day as a thunder-cloud above Athens\r\nand Hellas. Xerxes will come. And you—”\r\n\r\nShe pressed closer to her husband.\r\n\r\n“Why speak of me?” he asked lightly.\r\n\r\n“Xerxes brings war. War brings sorrow to women. It is not the hateful and\r\nold that the spears and the arrows love best.”\r\n\r\nHalf compelled by the omen, half by a sudden burst of unoccasioned fear,\r\nher eyes shone with tears; but her husband’s laugh rang clearly.\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_ dry your eyes, and look before you. King Æolus scatters the cloud\r\nupon his briskest winds. It breaks into a thousand bits. So shall\r\nThemistocles scatter the hordes of Xerxes. The Persian shadow shall come,\r\nshall go, and again we shall be happy in beautiful Athens.”\r\n\r\n“Athena grant it!” prayed Hermione.\r\n\r\n“We can trust the goddess,” returned Glaucon, not to be shaken from his\r\nhappy mood. “And now that we have paid our vows to her, let us descend.\r\nOur friends are already waiting for us by the Pnyx before they go down to\r\nthe harbours.”\r\n\r\nAs they went down the steep, Cimon and Democrates came running to join\r\nthem, and in the brisk chatter that arose the omen of the cloud and fears\r\nof the Persian faded from Hermione’s mind.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was a merry party such as often went down to the havens of Athens in\r\nthe springtime and summer: a dozen gentlemen, old and young, for the most\r\npart married, and followed demurely by their wives with the latter’s\r\nmaids, and many a stout Thracian slave tugging hampers of meat and drink.\r\nLaughter there was, admixed with wiser talk; friends walking by twos and\r\nthrees, with Themistocles, as always, seeming to mingle with all and to\r\nsurpass every one both in jests and in wisdom. So they fared down across\r\nthe broad plain-land to the harbours, till the hill Munychia rose steep\r\nbefore them. A scramble over a rocky, ill-marked way led to the top; then\r\nbefore them broke a second view comparable almost to that from the Rock of\r\nAthena: at their feet lay the four blue havens of Athens, to the right\r\nPhaleron, closer at hand the land-locked bay of Munychia, beyond that Zea,\r\nbeyond that still a broader sheet—Peiræus, the new war-harbour of Athens.\r\nThey could look down on the brown roofs of the port-town, the forest of\r\nmasts, the merchantman unloading lumber from the Euxine, the merchantman\r\nloading dried figs for Syria; but most of all on the numbers of long black\r\nhulls, some motionless on the placid harbour, some propped harmlessly on\r\nthe shore. Hermione clouded as she saw them, and glanced away.\r\n\r\n“I do not love your new fleet, Themistocles,” she said, frowning at the\r\nhandsome statesman; “I do not love anything that tells so clearly of war.\r\nIt mars the beauty.”\r\n\r\n“Rather you should rejoice we have so fair a wooden wall against the\r\nBarbarian, dear lady,” answered he, quite at ease. “What can we do to\r\nhearten her, Democrates?”\r\n\r\n“Were I only Zeus,” rejoined the orator, who never was far from his best\r\nfriend’s wife, “I would cast two thunderbolts, one to destroy Xerxes, the\r\nsecond to blast Themistocles’s armada,—so would the Lady Hermione be\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, then, you are not the Olympian,” said the woman, half smiling\r\nat the pleasantry. Cimon interrupted them. Some of the party had caught a\r\nsun-burned shepherd in among the rocks, a veritable Pan in his shaggy\r\ngoat-skin. The bribe of two obols brought him out with his pipe. Four of\r\nthe slave-boys fell to dancing. The party sat down upon the burnt\r\ngrass,—eating, drinking, wreathing poppy-crowns, and watching the nimble\r\nslaves and the ships that crawled like ants in the haven and bay below.\r\nThus passed the noon, and as the sun dropped toward craggy Salamis across\r\nthe strait, the men of the party wandered down to the ports and found\r\nboats to take them out upon the bay.\r\n\r\nThe wind was a zephyr. The water spread blue and glassy. The sun was\r\nsinking as a ball of infinite light. Themistocles, Democrates, and Glaucon\r\nwere in one skiff, the athlete at the oars. They glided past the scores of\r\nblack triremes swinging lazily at anchor. Twice they pulled around the\r\nproudest of the fleet,—the _Nausicaä_, the gift of Hermippus to the state,\r\na princely gift even in days when every Athenian put his all at the public\r\nservice. She would be Themistocles’s flag-ship. The young men noted her\r\nfine lines, her heavy side timbers, the covered decks, an innovation in\r\nAthenian men-of-war, and Themistocles put a loving hand on the keen bronze\r\nbeak as they swung around the prow.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a tooth for the Persian king!” he was laughing, when a second\r\nskiff, rounding the trireme in an opposite direction, collided abruptly. A\r\nlurch, a few splinters was all the hurt, but as the boats parted\r\nThemistocles rose from his seat in the stern, staring curiously.\r\n\r\n“Barbarians, by Athena’s owls, the knave at the oars is a sleek Syrian,\r\nand his master and the boy from the East too. What business around our\r\nwar-fleet? Row after them, Glaucon; we’ll question—”\r\n\r\n“Glaucon does no such folly,” spoke Democrates, instantly, from the bow;\r\n“if the harbour-watch doesn’t interfere with honest traders, what’s it to\r\nus?”\r\n\r\n“As you like it.” Themistocles resumed his seat. “Yet it would do no harm.\r\nNow they row to another trireme. With what falcon eyes the master of the\r\ntrio examines it! Something uncanny, I repeat.”\r\n\r\n“To examine everything strange,” proclaimed Democrates, sententiously,\r\n“needs the life of a crow, who, they say, lives a thousand years, but I\r\ndon’t see any black wings budding on Themistocles’s shoulders. Pull\r\nonward, Glaucon.”\r\n\r\n“Whither?” demanded the rower.\r\n\r\n“To Salamis,” ordered Themistocles. “Let us see the battle-place foretold\r\nby the oracle.”\r\n\r\n“To Salamis or clear to Crete,” rejoined Glaucon, setting his strength\r\nupon the oars and making the skiff bound, “if we can find water deep\r\nenough to drown those gloomy looks that have sat on Democrates’s brows of\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\n“Not gloomy but serious,” said the young orator, with an attempt at\r\nlightness; “I have been preparing my oration against the contractor I’ve\r\nindicted for embezzling the public naval stores.”\r\n\r\n“Destroy the man!” cried the rower.\r\n\r\n“And yet I really pity him; he was under great temptation.”\r\n\r\n“No excuses; the man who robs the city in days like these is worse than he\r\nwho betrays fortresses in most wars.”\r\n\r\n“I see you are a savage patriot, Glaucon,” said Themistocles, “despite\r\nyour Adonis face. We are fairly upon the bay; our nearest eavesdroppers,\r\nyon fishermen, are a good five furlongs. Would you see something?” Glaucon\r\nrested on the oars, while the statesman fumbled in his breast. He drew out\r\na papyrus sheet, which he passed to the rower, he in turn to Democrates.\r\n\r\n“Look well, then, for I think no Persian spies are here. A month long have\r\nI wrought on this bit of papyrus. All my wisdom flowed out of my pen when\r\nI spread the ink. In short here is the ordering of the ships of the allied\r\nGreeks when we meet Xerxes in battle. Leonidas and our other chiefs gave\r\nme the task when we met at Corinth. To-day it is complete. Read it, for it\r\nis precious. Xerxes would give twenty talents for this one leaf from\r\nEgypt.”\r\n\r\nThe young men peered at the sheet curiously. The details and diagrams were\r\nfew and easy to remember, the Athenian ships here, the Æginetan next, the\r\nCorinthian next, and so with the other allies. A few comments on the use\r\nof the light penteconters behind the heavy triremes. A few more comments\r\non Xerxes’s probable naval tactics. Only the knowledge that Themistocles\r\nnever committed himself in speech or writing without exhausting every\r\nexpedient told the young men of the supreme importance of the paper. After\r\ndue inspection the statesman replaced it in his breast.\r\n\r\n“You two have seen this,” he announced, seemingly proud of his handiwork;\r\n“Leonidas shall see this, then Xerxes, and after that—” he laughed, but\r\nnot in jest—“men will remember Themistocles, son of Neocles!”\r\n\r\nThe three lapsed into silence for a moment. The skiff was well out upon\r\nthe sea. The shadows of the hills of Salamis and of Ægelaos, the opposing\r\nmountain of Attica, were spreading over them. Around the islet of\r\nPsyttaleia in the strait the brown fisher-boats were gliding. Beyond the\r\nstrait opened the blue hill-girdled bay of Eleusis, now turning to fire in\r\nthe evening sun. Everything was peaceful, silent, beautiful. Again Glaucon\r\nrested on his oars and let his eyes wander.\r\n\r\n“How true is the word of Thales the Sage,” he spoke; “ ‘the world is the\r\nfairest of all fair things, because it is the work of God.’ It cannot be\r\nthat, here, between these purple hills and the glistening sea, there will\r\ncome that battle beside which the strife of Achilles and Hector before\r\nTroy shall pass as nothing!”\r\n\r\nThemistocles shook his head.\r\n\r\n“We do not know; we are dice in the high gods’ dice-boxes.\r\n\r\n  “ ‘Man all vainly shall scan the mind of the Prince of Olympus.’\r\n\r\n“We can say nothing wiser than that. We can but use our Attic mother wit,\r\nand trust the rest to destiny. Let us be satisfied if we hope that destiny\r\nis not blind.”\r\n\r\nThey drifted many moments in silence.\r\n\r\n“The sun sinks lower,” spoke Democrates, at length; “so back again to the\r\nhavens.”\r\n\r\nOn the return Themistocles once more vowed he caught a glimpse of the\r\nskiff of the unknown foreigners, but Democrates called it mere phantasy.\r\nHermione met them at the Peiræus, and the party wandered back through the\r\ngathering dusk to the city, where each little group went its way.\r\nThemistocles went to his own house, where he said he expected Sicinnus;\r\nCimon and Democrates sought a tavern for an evening cup; Glaucon and\r\nHermione hastened to their house in the Colonus suburb near the trickling\r\nCephissus, where in the starlit night the tettix(4) in the black old\r\nolives by the stream made its monotonous music, where great fireflies\r\ngleamed, where Philomela the nightingale called, and the tall plane trees\r\nwhispered softly to the pines. When Hermione fell asleep, she had\r\nforgotten about the coming of the Persian, and dreamed that Glaucon was\r\nEros, she was Psyche, and that Zeus was giving her the wings of a\r\nbutterfly and a crown of stars.\r\n\r\nDemocrates went home later. After the heady Pramnian at the tavern, he\r\nroved away with Cimon and others to serenade beneath the lattice of a\r\nlady—none too prudish—in the Ceramicus quarter. But the fair one was cruel\r\nthat night, and her slaves repelled the minstrels with pails of hot water\r\nfrom an upper window. Democrates thereupon quitted the party. His head was\r\nvery befogged, but he could not expel one idea from it—that Themistocles\r\nhad revealed that day a priceless secret, that the statesman and Glaucon\r\nand he himself were the only men who shared it, and that it was believed\r\nthat Glaucon had visited the Babylonish carpet-seller. Joined to this was\r\nan overpowering consciousness that Helen of Troy was not so lovely as\r\nHermione of Eleusis. When he came to his lodgings, however, his wits\r\ncleared in a twinkling after he had read two letters. The first was short.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles to Democrates:—This evening I begin to discover something.\r\nSicinnus, who has been searching in Athens, is certain there is a Persian\r\nagent in the city. Seize him.—_Chaire._”\r\n\r\nThe second was shorter. It came from Corinth.\r\n\r\n“Socias the merchant to Democrates:—Tyrrhenian pirates have taken the\r\nship. Lading and crew are utterly lost.—_Chaire._”\r\n\r\nThe orator never closed his eyes that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CYPRIAN TRIUMPHS\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocrates fronted ruin. What profit later details from Socias of the\r\ncapture of the merchantman? Unless three days before the coming festival\r\nof the Panathenæa the orator could find a large sum, he was forever\r\nundone. His sequestering of the ship-money would become public property.\r\nHe would be tried for his life. Themistocles would turn against him. The\r\njury would hardly wait for the evidence. He would drink the poisonous\r\nhemlock and his corpse be picked by the crows in the Barathrum,—an open\r\npit, sole burial place for Athenian criminals.\r\n\r\nOne thing was possible: to go to Glaucon, confess all, and beg the money.\r\nGlaucon was rich. He could have the amount from Conon and Hermippus for\r\nthe asking. But Democrates knew Glaucon well enough to perceive that while\r\nthe athlete might find the money, he would be horrified at the foul\r\ndisclosure. He would save his old comrade from death, but their friendship\r\nwould be ended. He would feel in duty bound to tell Themistocles enough to\r\nruin Democrates’s political prospects for all time. An appeal to Glaucon\r\nwas therefore dismissed, and the politician looked for more desperate\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nDemocrates enjoyed apartments on the street of the Tripods east of the\r\nAcropolis, a fashionable promenade of Athens. He was regarded as a\r\nconfirmed bachelor. If, therefore, two or three dark-eyed flute girls in\r\nPhaleron had helped him to part with a good many minæ, no one scolded too\r\nloudly; the thing had been done genteelly and without scandal. Democrates\r\naffected to be a collector of fine arms and armour. The ceiling of his\r\nliving room was hung with white-plumed helmets, on the walls glittered\r\nbrass greaves, handsomely embossed shields, inlaid Chalcidian scimitars,\r\nand bows tipped with gold. Under foot were expensive rugs. The orator’s\r\nartistic tastes were excellent. Even as he sat in the deeply pillowed\r\narm-chair his eye lighted on a Nike,—a statuette of the precious\r\nCorinthian bronze, a treasure for which the dealer’s unpaid account lay\r\nstill, alas! in the orator’s coffer.\r\n\r\nBut Democrates was not thinking so much of the unpaid bronze-smith as of\r\ndivers weightier debts. On the evening in question he had ordered Bias,\r\nthe sly Thracian, out of the room; with his own hands had barred the door\r\nand closed the lattice; then with stealthy step thrust back the scarlet\r\nwall tapestry to disclose a small door let into the plaster. A key made\r\nthe door open into a cupboard, out of which Democrates drew a brass-bound\r\nbox of no great size, which he carried gingerly to a table and opened with\r\na complex key.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the box were curious, to a stranger enigmatic. Not money,\r\nnor jewels, but rolls of closely written papyri, and things which the\r\norator studied more intently,—a number of hard bits of clay bearing the\r\nimpressions of seals. As Democrates fingered these, his face might have\r\nbetrayed a mingling of keen fear and keener satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“There is no such collection in all Hellas,—no, not in the world,” ran his\r\ncommentary; “here is the signet of the Tagos of Thessaly, here of the\r\nBœotarch of Thebes, here of the King of Argos. I was able to secure the\r\nseal of Leonidas while in Corinth. This, of course, is Themistocles’s,—how\r\neasily I took it! And this—of less value perhaps to a man of the world—is\r\nof my beloved Glaucon. And here are twenty more. Then the papyri,”—he\r\nunrolled them lovingly, one after another,—“precious specimens, are they\r\nnot? Ah, by Zeus, I must be a very merciful and pious man, or I’d have\r\nused that dreadful power heaven has given me and never have drifted into\r\nthese straits.”\r\n\r\nWhat that “power” was with which Democrates felt himself endued he did not\r\neven whisper to himself. His mood changed suddenly. He closed the box with\r\na snap and locked it hurriedly.\r\n\r\n“Cursed casket!—I think I would be happier if Phorcys, the old man of the\r\ndeep, could drown it all! I would be better for it and kept from foul\r\nthoughts.”\r\n\r\nHe thrust the box back in the cupboard, drew forth a second like it,\r\nunlocked it, and took out more writings. Selecting two, he spread ink and\r\npapyrus before him, and copied with feverish haste. Once he hesitated, and\r\nalmost flung back the writings into the casket. Once he glanced at the\r\nnotes he had prepared for his speech against the defrauding contractor. He\r\ngrimaced bitterly. Then the hesitation ended. He finished the copying,\r\nreplaced the second box, and barred and concealed the cupboard. He hid his\r\nnew copies in his breast and called in Bias.\r\n\r\n“I am going out, but I shall not be late.”\r\n\r\n“Shall not Hylas and I go with lanterns?” asked the fellow. “Last night\r\nthere were foot-pads.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t need you,” rejoined his master, brusquely.\r\n\r\nHe went down into the dimly lighted street and wound through the maze of\r\nback alleys wherein Athens abounded, but Democrates never missed his way.\r\nOnce he caught the glint of a lantern—a slave lighting home his master\r\nfrom dinner. The orator drew into a doorway; the others glided by, seeing\r\nnothing. Only when he came opposite the house of the Cyprian he saw light\r\nspreading from the opposite doorway and knew he must pass under curious\r\neyes. Phormio was entertaining friends very late. But Democrates took\r\nboldness for safety, strode across the illumined ring, and up to the\r\nCyprian’s stairway. The buzz of conversation stopped a moment. “Again\r\nGlaucon,” he caught, but was not troubled.\r\n\r\n“After all,” he reflected, “if seen at all, there is no harm in such a\r\nmistake.”\r\n\r\nThe room was again glittering in its Oriental magnificence. The Cyprian\r\nadvanced to meet his visitor, smiling blandly.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, dear Athenian. We have awaited you. We are ready to heal your\r\ncalamity.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates turned away his face.\r\n\r\n“You know it already! O Zeus, I am the most miserable man in all Hellas!”\r\n\r\n“And wherefore miserable, good friend?” The Cyprian half led, half\r\ncompelled the visitor to a seat on the divan. “Is it such to be enrolled\r\nfrom this day among the benefactors of my most gracious lord and king?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t goad me!” Democrates wrung his hands. “I am desperate. Take these\r\npapyri, read, pay, then let me never see your face again.” He flung the\r\ntwo rolls in the Prince’s lap and sat in abject misery.\r\n\r\nThe other unrolled the writings deliberately, read slowly, motioned to\r\nHiram, who also read them with catlike scrutiny. During all this not a\r\nword was spoken. Democrates observed the beautiful mute emerge from an\r\ninner chamber and silently take station at his master’s side, following\r\nthe papers also with wonderful, eager eyes. Only after a long interval the\r\nPrince spoke.\r\n\r\n“Well—you bring what purports to be private memoranda of Themistocles on\r\nthe equipment and arraying of the Athenian fleet. Yet these are only\r\ncopies.”\r\n\r\n“Copies; the originals cannot stay in my possession. It were ruin to give\r\nthem up.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince turned to Hiram.\r\n\r\n“And do you say, from what you know of these things, these memoranda are\r\ngenuine?”\r\n\r\n“Genuine. That is the scanty wisdom of the least of your Highness’s\r\nslaves.”\r\n\r\nThe Oriental bowed himself, then stood erect in a manner that reminded\r\nDemocrates of some serpent that had just coiled and uncoiled.\r\n\r\n“Good,” continued the emissary; “yet I must ask our good Athenian to\r\nconfirm them with an oath.”\r\n\r\nThe orator groaned. He had not expected this last humiliation; but being\r\nforced to drink the cup, he drained it to the lees. He swore by Zeus\r\nOrchios, Watcher of Oaths, and Dike, the Eternal Justice, that he brought\r\ntrue copies, and that if he was perjured, he called a curse upon himself\r\nand all his line. The Cyprian received his oath with calm satisfaction,\r\nthen held out the half of a silver shekel broken in the middle.\r\n\r\n“Show this to Mydon, the Sicyonian banker at Phaleron. He holds its\r\ncounterpart. He will pay the man who completes the coin ten talents.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates received the token, but felt that he must stand upon his\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n“I have given an oath, stranger, but give the like to me. What proof have\r\nI of this Mydon?”\r\n\r\nThe question seemed to rouse the unseen lion in the Cyprian. His eye\r\nkindled. His voice swelled.\r\n\r\n“We leave oaths, Hellene, to men of trade and barter, to men of trickery\r\nand guile. The Aryan noble is taught three things: to fear the king, to\r\nbend the bow, to speak the truth. And he learns all well. I have\r\nspoken,—my word is my oath.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian shrank at the storm he had roused. But the Prince almost\r\ninstantly curbed himself. His voice sank again to its easy tone of\r\nconciliation.\r\n\r\n“So much for my word, good friend; yet better than an oath, look here. Can\r\nthe man who bears this ring afford to tell a lie?”\r\n\r\nHe extended his right hand. On the second finger was a huge beryl signet.\r\nDemocrates bent over it.\r\n\r\n“Two seated Sphynxes and a winged cherub flying above,—the seal of the\r\nroyal Achæmenians of Persia! You are sent by Xerxes himself. You are—”\r\n\r\nThe Prince raised a warning finger. “Hush, Athenian. Think what you will,\r\nbut do not name me, though soon my name shall fly through all the world.”\r\n\r\n“So be it,” rejoined Democrates, his hands clutching the broken coin as at\r\na last reprieve from death. “But be warned, even though I bear you no\r\ngood-will. Themistocles is suspicious. Sicinnus his agent, a sly cat, is\r\nsearching for you. The other day Themistocles, in the boat at Peiræus, was\r\nfain to have you questioned. If detected, I cannot save you.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Good Democrates, I come of a race that trusts in the omnipotence of God\r\nand does the right. Duty requires me in Athens. What Ahura-Mazda and\r\nMithra his glorious vicegerent will, that shall befall me, be I in Hellas\r\nor in safe Ecbatana. The decree of the Most High, written among the stars,\r\nis good. I do not shun it.”\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken candidly, reverently. Democrates drew toward the\r\ndoor, and the others did not strive to detain him.\r\n\r\n“As you will,” spoke the Athenian; “I have warned you. Trust then your\r\nGod. I have sold myself this once, but do not call me friend. Necessity is\r\na sharp goad. May our paths never cross again!”\r\n\r\n“Until you again have need,” said the Prince, not seeking to wring from\r\nthe other any promise.\r\n\r\nDemocrates muttered a sullen farewell and went down the dark stairs. The\r\nlight in Phormio’s house was out. No one seemed to be watching. On the way\r\nhomeward Democrates comforted himself with the reflection that although\r\nthe memoranda he sold were genuine, Themistocles often changed his plans,\r\nand he could see to it this scheme for arraying the war fleet was speedily\r\naltered. No real harm then would come to Hellas. And in his hand was the\r\nbroken shekel,—the talisman to save him from destruction. Only when\r\nDemocrates thought of Glaucon and Hermione he was fain to grit his teeth,\r\nwhile many times it returned to him, “They think it was _Glaucon_ who has\r\nbeen twice now to visit the Babylonish carpet-seller.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAs the door had closed behind the orator, the Prince had strode across the\r\nrugs to the window—and spat forth furiously as in extreme disgust.\r\n\r\n“Fool, knave, villain! I foul my lips by speaking to his accursed ears!”\r\n\r\nThe tongue in which he uttered this was the purest “Royal Persian,” such\r\nas one might hear in the king’s court. The beautiful “mute,” mute no\r\nlonger, glided across the chamber and laid both hands upon his shoulder\r\nwith a gracious caress.\r\n\r\n“And yet you bear with these treacherous creatures, you speak them fair?”\r\nwas the remark in the same musical tongue.\r\n\r\n“Yes, because there is sore need. Because, with all their faithlessness,\r\ncovetousness, and guile, these Hellenes are the keenest, subtlest race\r\nbeneath Mithra’s glorious light. And we Persians must play with them,\r\nmaster them, and use them to make us lords of all the world.”\r\n\r\nHiram had disappeared behind a curtain. The Prince lifted her silver\r\nembroidered red cap. Over the graceful shoulders fell a mass of clear gold\r\nhair, so golden one might have hidden shining darics within it. The\r\nshining head pressed against the Persian’s breast. In this attitude, with\r\nthe loose dress parting to show the tender lines, there could be no doubt\r\nof the other’s sex. The Prince laid his hand upon her neck and drew her\r\nbright face nearer.\r\n\r\n“This is a mad adventure on which we two have come,” he spoke; “how nearly\r\nyou were betrayed at the Isthmus, when the Athenian saved you! A blunder\r\nby Hiram, an ill-turn of Fate, will ruin us yet. It is far, Rose of Eran,\r\nfrom Athens to the pleasant groves of Susa and the sparkling Choaspes.”\r\n\r\n“But the adventure is ending,” answered she, with smiling confidence;\r\n“Mazda has guarded us. As you have said—we are in his hand, alike here and\r\nin my brother’s palace. And we have seen Greece and Athens—the country and\r\ncity which you will conquer, which you will rule.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, letting his eyes pass from her face to the vista of the\r\nAcropolis, which lay in fair view under the moonlight. “How noble a city\r\nthis! Xerxes has promised that I shall be satrap of Hellas, Athens shall\r\nbe my capital, and you, O best beloved, you shall be mistress of Athens.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be mistress of Athens,” echoed she, “but you, husband and lord,\r\nwould that men might give you a higher name than satrap, chief of the\r\nGreat King’s slaves!”\r\n\r\n“Xerxes is king,” he answered her.\r\n\r\n“My brother wears the purple cap. He sits on the throne of Cyrus the Great\r\nand Darius the Dauntless. I would be a loyal Aryan, the king is indeed in\r\nSusa or Babylon. But for me the true king of Media and Persia—is here.”\r\nAnd she lifted proud eyes to her husband.\r\n\r\n“You are bold, Rose of Eran,” he smiled, not angry at her implication;\r\n“more cautious words than these have brought many in peril of the\r\nbow-string. But, by Mithra the Fiend-Smiter, why were you not made a man?\r\nThen truly would your mother Atossa have given Darius an heir right worthy\r\nthe twenty kingdoms!”\r\n\r\nShe gave a gentle laugh.\r\n\r\n“The Most High ordains the best. Have I not the noblest kingdom? Am I not\r\nyour wife?”\r\n\r\nHis laugh answered her.\r\n\r\n“Then I am greater than Xerxes. I love my empire the best!”\r\n\r\nHe leaned again from the lattice, “O, fairest of cities, and we shall win\r\nit! See how the tawny rock turns to silver beneath the moonbeams! How\r\nclearly burn the stars over the plain and the mountain! And these Greeks,\r\nclever, wise, beautiful, when we have mastered them, have taught them our\r\nAryan obedience and love of truth, what servants will they not become! For\r\nwe are ordained to conquer. Mazda has given us empire without limit, from\r\nthe Indus to the Great Ocean of the West,—all shall be ours; for we are\r\nPersians, the race to rule forever.”\r\n\r\n“We will conquer,” she said dreamily, as enchanted as was he by the\r\nbeauties of the night.\r\n\r\n“From the day Cyrus your grandfather flung down Cambyses the Mede, the\r\nHigh God has been with us. Egypt, Assyria, Babylon—have all bowed under\r\nour yoke. The Lydian at golden Sardis, the Tartar on the arid steppes, the\r\nHindoo by his sacred river, all send tribute to our king, and Hellas—” he\r\nheld out his arms confidently—“shall be the brightest star in the Persian\r\ntiara. When Darius your father lay dying, I swore to him, ‘Master, fear\r\nnot; I will avenge you on Athens and on all the Greeks.’ And in one brief\r\nyear, O _fravashi_, soul of the great departed, I may make good the vow. I\r\nwill make these untamed Hellenes bow their proud necks to a king.”\r\n\r\nHer own eyes brightened, looking on him, as he spoke in pride and power.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” she could not keep back the question, “as we have moved through\r\nthis Hellas, and seen its people, living without princes, or with princes\r\nof little power, sometimes a strange thought comes. These perverse,\r\nunobedient folk, false as they are, and ununited, have yet a strength to\r\ndo great things, a strength which even we Aryans lack.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It cannot be. Mazda ordained a king to rule, the rest to obey. And all\r\nthe wits of Hellas have no strength until they learn that lesson well. But\r\nI will teach it them.”\r\n\r\n“For some day you will be their king?” spoke the woman. He did not\r\nreprove, but stood beside her, gazing forth upon the night. In the\r\nmoonlight the columns and sculptures of the great temple on the Acropolis\r\nstood out in minute tracery They could see all the caverns and jagged\r\nledges on the massy Rock. The flat roofs of the sleeping city lay like a\r\ndark and peaceful ocean. The mountains spread around in shadow-wrapped\r\nhush. Far away the dark stretch of the sea sent back a silver shimmering\r\nin answer to the moon. A landscape only possible at Athens! The two\r\nsensitive Orientals’ souls were deeply touched. For long they were silent,\r\nthen the husband spoke.\r\n\r\n“Twenty days more; we are safe in Sardis, the adventure ended. The war\r\nonly remains, and the glory, the conquest,—and thou. O Ahura-Mazda,” he\r\nspoke upward to the stars, “give to thy Persians this land. For when Thou\r\nhast given this, Thou wilt keep back nothing of all the world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DEMOCRATES RESOLVES\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocrates surpassed himself when arraigning the knavish contractor.\r\n“Nestor and Odysseus both speak to us,” shouted Polus in glee, flinging\r\nhis black bean in the urn. “What eloquence, what righteous fury when he\r\npainted the man’s infamy to pillage the city in a crisis like this!”\r\n\r\nSo the criminal was sent to death and Democrates was showered with\r\ncongratulations. Only one person seemed hardly satisfied with all the\r\nyoung orator did,—Themistocles. The latter told his lieutenant candidly he\r\nfeared all was not being done to apprehend the Persian emissary.\r\nThemistocles even took it upon himself to send Sicinnus to run down\r\nseveral suspects, and just on the morning of the day preceding the\r\nPanathenæa—the great summer festival—Democrates received a hint which sent\r\nhim home very thoughtful. He had met his chief in the Agora as he was\r\nleaving the Government-House, and Themistocles had again asked if he had\r\nsmelt aught of the Persian agent. He had not.\r\n\r\n“Then you would well devote more time to finding his scent, and less to\r\nconvicting a pitiful embezzler. You know the Alopece suburb?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“And the house of Phormio the fishmonger?” to which Democrates nodded.\r\n\r\n“Well, Sicinnus has been watching the quarter. A Babylonish carpet-seller\r\nhas rooms opposite Phormio. The man is suspicious, does no trading, and\r\nPhormio’s wife told Sicinnus an odd tale.”\r\n\r\n“What tale?” Democrates glanced at a passing chariot, avoiding\r\nThemistocles’s gaze.\r\n\r\n“Why, twice the Barbarian, she swears, has had an evening visitor—and he\r\nour dear Glaucon.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. The good woman is mistaken. Still, question her. Pry into this\r\nBabylonian’s doings. He may be selling more things than carpets. If he has\r\ncorrupted any here in Athens,—by Pluto the Implacable, I will make them\r\ntell out the price!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll inquire at once.”\r\n\r\n“Do so. The matter grows serious.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles caught sight of one of the archons and hastened across the\r\nAgora to have a word with him. Democrates passed his hand across his\r\nforehead, beaded with sudden sweat-drops. He knew—though Themistocles had\r\nsaid not a word—that his superior was beginning to distrust his efforts,\r\nand that Sicinnus was working independently. Democrates had great respect\r\nfor the acuteness of that Asiatic. He was coming perilously near the truth\r\nalready. If the Cyprian and Hiram were arrested, the latter at least would\r\nsurely try to save his life by betraying their nocturnal visitor. To get\r\nthe spy safely out of Athens would be the first step,—but not all.\r\nSicinnus once upon the scent would not readily drop it until he had\r\ndiscovered the emissary’s confederate. And of the fate of that confederate\r\nThemistocles had just given a grim hint. There was one other solution\r\npossible. If Democrates could discover the confederate _himself_, Sicinnus\r\nwould regard the matter as cleared up and drop all interest therein. All\r\nthese possibilities raced through the orator’s head, as does the past\r\nthrough one drowning. A sudden greeting startled him.\r\n\r\n“A fair morning, Democrates.” It was Glaucon. He walked arm-in-arm with\r\nCimon.\r\n\r\n“A fair morning, indeed. Where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“To the Peiræus to inspect the new tackling of the _Nausicaä_. You will\r\njoin us?”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately I argue a case before the King Archon.”\r\n\r\n“Be as eloquent as in your last speech. Do you know, Cimon declares I am\r\ndisloyal too, and that you will soon be prosecuting me?”\r\n\r\n“Avert it, gods! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why, he is sending a letter to Argos,” asserted Cimon. “Now I say Argos\r\nhas Medized, therefore no good Hellene should correspond with a traitorous\r\nArgive.”\r\n\r\n“Be jury on my treachery,” commanded Glaucon. “Ageladas the\r\nmaster-sculptor sends me a bronze Perseus in honour of my victory. Shall I\r\nchurlishly send him no thanks because he lives in Argos?”\r\n\r\n“ ‘Not guilty’ votes the jury; the white beans prevail. So the letter goes\r\nto-day?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow afternoon. You know Seuthes of Corinth—the bow-legged fellow\r\nwith a big belly. He goes home to-morrow afternoon after seeing the\r\nprocession and the sacrifice.”\r\n\r\n“He goes by sea?” asked Democrates, casually.\r\n\r\n“By land; no ship went to his liking. He will lie overnight at Eleusis.”\r\n\r\nThe friends went their ways. Democrates hardly saw or heard anything until\r\nhe was in his own chambers. Three things were graven on his mind: Sicinnus\r\nwas watching, the Babylonian was suspected, Glaucon was implicated and was\r\nsending a letter to Argos.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nBias the Thracian was discovered that afternoon by his master lurking in a\r\ncorner of the chamber. Democrates seized a heavy dog-whip, lashed the boy\r\nunmercifully, then cast him out, threatening that eavesdropping would be\r\nrewarded by “cutting into shoe soles.” Then the master resumed his\r\nfeverish pacings and the nervous twisting of his fingers. Unfortunately,\r\nBias felt certain the threat would never have been uttered unless the\r\nweightiest of matters had been on foot. As in all Greek dwellings,\r\nDemocrates’s rooms were divided not by doors but by hanging curtains, and\r\nBias, letting curiosity master fear, ensconced himself again behind one of\r\nthese and saw all his master’s doings. What Democrates said and did,\r\nhowever, puzzled his good servant quite sufficiently.\r\n\r\nDemocrates had opened the privy cupboard, taken out one of the caskets and\r\nscattered its contents upon the table, then selected a papyrus, and seemed\r\ncopying the writing thereon with extreme care. Next one of the clay seals\r\ncame into play. Democrates was testing it upon wax. Then the orator rose,\r\ndashed the wax upon the floor, put his sandal thereon, tore the papyrus on\r\nwhich he wrote to bits. Again he paced restlessly, his hands clutching his\r\nhair, his forehead frowns and blackness, while Bias thought he heard him\r\nmuttering as he walked:—\r\n\r\n“O Zeus! O Apollo! O Athena! I cannot do this thing! Deliver me! Deliver!”\r\n\r\nThen back to the table again, once more to pick up the mysterious clay,\r\nagain to copy, to stamp on the wax, to fling down, mutilate, and destroy.\r\nThe pantomime was gone through three times. Bias could make nothing of it.\r\nSince the day his parents—following the barbarous Thracian custom—had sold\r\nhim into slavery and he had passed into Democrates’s service, the lad had\r\nnever seen his master acting thus.\r\n\r\n“Clearly the _kyrios_ is mad,” was his own explanation, and growing\r\nfrightened at following the strange movements of his lord, he crept from\r\nhis retreat and tried to banish uncanny fears at a safe distance, by tying\r\na thread to the leg of a gold-chafer(5) and watching its vain efforts at\r\nflight. Yet had he continued his eavesdropping he might have found—if not\r\nthe key to all Democrates’s doings—at least a partial explanation. For the\r\nfourth time the papyrus had been written, for the fourth time the orator\r\nhad torn it up. Then his eyes went down to the lump of clay before him on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“Curses upon the miserable stuff!” he swore almost loudly; “it is this\r\nwhich has set the evil thoughts to racing. Destroy _that_, and the deed is\r\nbeyond my power.”\r\n\r\nHe held up the clay and eyed it as a miser might his gold.\r\n\r\n“What a little lump! Not very hard. I can dash it on the floor and it\r\ndissolves in dust. And yet, and yet—all Elysium, all Tartarus, are pent up\r\nfor me in just this bit of clay.”\r\n\r\nHe picked at it with his finger and broke a small piece from the edge.\r\n\r\n“A little more, the stamp is ruined. I could not use it. Better if it were\r\nruined. And yet,—and yet,—”\r\n\r\nHe laid the clay upon the table and sat watching it wistfully.\r\n\r\n“O Father Zeus!” he broke out after silence, “if I were not compelled by\r\nfear! Sicinnus is so sharp, Themistocles so unmerciful! It would be a\r\nterrible death to die,—and every man is justified in shunning death.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at the inanimate lump as if he expected it to answer him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I am all alone. No one to counsel me. In every other trouble when has\r\nit been as this? Glaucon? Cimon? Themistocles?—What would they advise?”—he\r\nended with a laugh more bitter than a sob. “And I must save myself, but at\r\nsuch a price!”\r\n\r\nHe pressed his hands over his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Curses on the hour I met Lycon! Curses on the Cyprian and his gold! It\r\nwould have been better to have told Glaucon and let him save me now and\r\nhate me forever after. But I have sold myself to the Cyprian. The deed\r\ncannot be taken back.”\r\n\r\nBut as he said it, he arose, took the charmed bit of clay, replaced in the\r\nbox, and locked the coffer. His hand trembled as he did it.\r\n\r\n“I cannot do this thing. I have been foolish, wicked,—but I must not be\r\ndriven mad by fear. The Cyprian must quit Athens to-morrow. I can throw\r\nSicinnus off the scent. I shall never be the worse.”\r\n\r\nHe walked with the box toward the cupboard, but stopped halfway.\r\n\r\n“It is a dreadful death to die;”—his thoughts raced and were half\r\nuttered,—“hemlock!—men grow cold limb by limb and keep all their faculties\r\nto the end. And the crows in the Barathrum, and the infamy upon my\r\nfather’s name! When was a son of the house of Codrus branded ‘A Traitor to\r\nAthens’? Is it wickedness to save one’s own life?”\r\n\r\nInstead of going to the cupboard he approached the window. The sun beat\r\nhotly, but as he leaned forth into the street he shivered as on a winter’s\r\nmorn. In blank wretchedness he watched the throng beneath the window,\r\npannier-laden asses, venders of hot sausage with their charcoal stoves and\r\ntrays, youths going to and from the gymnasium, slaves returning from\r\nmarket. How long he stood thus, wretched, helpless, he did not know. At\r\nlast he stirred himself.\r\n\r\n“I cannot stand gaping like a fool forever. An omen, by every god an omen!\r\nAh! what am I to do?” He glanced toward the sky in vain hope of a lucky\r\nraven or eagle winging out of the east, but saw only blue and brightness.\r\nThen his eye went down the street, and at the glance the warm blood\r\ntingled from his forehead to his heels.\r\n\r\nShe was passing,—Hermione, child of Hermippus. She walked before, two\r\ncomely maids went after with her stool and parasol; but they were the\r\npeonies beside the rose. She had thrown her blue veil back. The sun played\r\nover the sheen of her hair. As she moved, her floating saffron dress of\r\nthe rare muslin of Amorgos now revealed her delicate form, now clothed her\r\nin an enchanting cloud. She held her head high, as if proud of her own\r\ngrace and of the beauty and fair name of her husband. She never looked\r\nupward, nor beheld how Democrates’s eyes grew like bright coals as he\r\ngazed on her. He saw her clear high forehead, he heard—or thought he heard\r\ndespite the jar of the street—the rustle of the muslin robe. Hermione\r\npassed, nor ever knew how, by taking this way from the house of a friend,\r\nshe coloured the skein of life for three mortals—for herself, her husband,\r\nand Democrates.\r\n\r\nDemocrates followed her with his eyes until she vanished around the\r\nfountain at the street corner; then sprang back from the window. The\r\nworkings of his face were terrible. It was an instant when men grasp the\r\ngodlike or sink to the demon, when they do deeds never to be recalled.\r\n\r\n“The omen!” he almost cried, “the omen! Not Zeus but Hermes the Guileful\r\nsent it. He will be with me. She is Glaucon’s wife. But if not his, whose\r\nthen but mine? I will do the deed to the uttermost. The god is with me.”\r\n\r\nHe flung the casket upon the table and spread its fateful contents again\r\nbefore him. His hand flew over the papyrus with marvellous speed and\r\nskill. He knew that all his faculties were at his full command and\r\nunwontedly acute.\r\n\r\nBias was surprised at his sport by a sudden clapping of his master’s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“What is it, _kyrie_?”\r\n\r\n“Go to Agis. He keeps the gaming-house in the Ceramicus. You know where.\r\nTell him to come hither instantly. He shall not lack reward. Make your\r\nfeet fly. Here is something to speed them.”\r\n\r\nHe flung at the boy a coin. Bias opened eyes and mouth in wonder. It was\r\nnot silver, but a golden daric.\r\n\r\n“Don’t blink at it, sheep, but run. Bring Agis,” ordered the master,—and\r\nBias’s legs never went faster than on that afternoon.\r\n\r\nAgis came. Democrates knew his man and had no difficulty in finding his\r\nprice. They remained talking together till it was dark, yet in so guarded\r\na tone that Bias, though he listened closely, was unable to make out\r\nanything. When Agis went away, he carried two letters. One of these he\r\nguarded as if holding the crown jewels of the Great King; the second he\r\ndespatched by a discreet myrmidon to the rooms of the Cyprian in Alopece.\r\nIts contents were pertinent and ran thus:—\r\n\r\n“Democrates to the stranger calling himself a prince of Cyprus,\r\ngreeting:—Know that Themistocles is aware of your presence in Athens, and\r\ngrows suspicious of your identity. Leave Athens to-morrow or all is lost.\r\nThe confusion accompanying the festival will then make escape easy. The\r\nman to whom I entrust this letter will devise with Hiram the means for\r\nyour flight by ship from the havens. May our paths never cross\r\nagain!—_Chaire._”\r\n\r\nAfter Agis was gone the old trembling came again to Democrates. He had\r\nBias light all the lamps. The room seemed full of lurking\r\ngoblins,—harpies, gorgons, the Hydra, the Minotaur, every other foul and\r\nnoxious shape was waiting to spring forth. And, most maddening of all, the\r\nchorus of Æschylus, that Song of the Furies Democrates had heard recited\r\nat the Isthmus, rang in the miserable man’s ears:—\r\n\r\n    “With scourge and with ban\r\n    We prostrate the man,\r\n    Who with smooth-woven wile,\r\n    And a fair-facèd smile\r\n  Hath planted a snare for his friend.\r\n    Though fleet, we shall find him;\r\n    Though strong, we shall bind him,\r\n  Who planted a snare for his friend.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates approached the bust of Hermes standing in one corner. The\r\nbrazen face seemed to wear a smile of malignant gladness at the fulfilment\r\nof his will.\r\n\r\n“Hermes,” prayed the orator, “Hermes Dolios, god of craft and lies,\r\nthieves’ god, helper of evil,—be with me now. To Zeus, to Athena the pure,\r\nI dare not pray. Prosper me in the deed to which I set my hand,”—he\r\nhesitated, he dared not bribe the shrewd god with too mean a gift, “and I\r\nvow to set in thy temple at Tanagra three tall tripods of pure gold. So be\r\nwith me on the morrow, and I will not forget thy favour.”\r\n\r\nThe brazen face still smiled on; the room was very still. Yet Democrates\r\ntook comfort. Hermes was a great god and would help him. When the song of\r\nthe Furies grew too loud, Democrates silenced it by summoning back\r\nHermione’s face and asking one triumphant question:—\r\n\r\n“She is Glaucon’s wife. But if not his, whose then but mine?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PANATHENÆA\r\n\r\n\r\nFlowers on every head, flowers festooned about each pillar, and flowers\r\nunder foot when one crossed the Agora. Beneath the sheltering porticos\r\nlurked bright-faced girls who pelted each passer with violets, narcissus,\r\nand hyacinths. For this was the morn of the final crowning day of the\r\nPanathenæa, greatest, gladdest of Athenian festivals.\r\n\r\nAthletic contests had preceded it and stately Pyrrhic dances of men in\r\nfull armour. There had been feasting and merry-making despite the\r\ndarkening shadow of the Persian. Athens seemed awakened only to rejoice.\r\nTo-day was the procession to the Acropolis, the bearing of the sacred robe\r\nto Athena, the public sacrifice for all the people. Not even the peril of\r\nXerxes could hinder a gladsome holiday.\r\n\r\nThe sun had just risen above Hymettus, the Agora shops were closed, but\r\nthe plaza itself and the lesches—the numerous little club houses about\r\nit—overran with gossipers. On the stone bench before one of these buzzed\r\nthe select coterie that of wont assembled in Clearchus’s booth; only Polus\r\nthe juror now and then nodded and snored. He had sat up all night hearing\r\nthe priestesses chant their ceaseless litanies on the Acropolis.\r\n\r\n“Guilty—I vote guilty,” the others heard him muttering, as his head sank\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n“Wake up, friend,” ordered Clearchus; “you’re not condemning any poor\r\nscoundrel now.”\r\n\r\n“_Ai!_ ah!” Polus rubbed his eyes, “I only thought I was dropping the\r\nblack bean—”\r\n\r\n“Against whom?” quoth Crito, the fat contractor.\r\n\r\n“Whom? Why that aristocrat Glaucon, surely,—to-night—” Polus suddenly\r\nchecked himself and began to roll his eyes.\r\n\r\n“You’ve a dreadful grievance against him,” remarked Clearchus; “the gods\r\nknow why.”\r\n\r\n“The wise patriot can see many things,” observed Polus, complacently,\r\n“only I repeat—wait till to-night—and then—”\r\n\r\n“What then?” demanded all the others.\r\n\r\n“Then you shall see,” announced the juror, with an oratorical flourish of\r\nhis dirty himation, “and not you only but all of Athens.”\r\n\r\nClearchus grinned.\r\n\r\n“Our dear Polus has a vast sense of his own importance. And who has been\r\nmaking you partner of the state secrets—Themistocles?”\r\n\r\n“A man almost his peer, the noble patriot Democrates. Ask Phormio’s wife,\r\nLampaxo; ask—” Once more he broke off to lay a finger on his lips. “This\r\nwill be a notable day for Athens!”\r\n\r\n“Our good friend surely thinks so!” rejoined the potter, dryly; “but since\r\nhe won’t trust us with his precious secret, I think it much more\r\ninteresting to watch the people crossing the square. The procession must\r\nbe gathering outside the Dipylon Gate. Yonder rides Themistocles now to\r\ntake command.”\r\n\r\nThe statesman cantered past on a shining white Thessalian. At his heels\r\nwere prancing Cimon, Democrates, Glaucon, and many another youth of the\r\nnoble houses of Athens. At sight of the son of Conon, Polus had wagged his\r\nhead in a manner utterly perplexing to his associates, and they were again\r\nperplexed when they saw Democrates wheel back from the side of his chief\r\nand run up for a hurried word with a man in the crowd they recognized as\r\nAgis.\r\n\r\n“Agis is a strange fish to have dealings with a ‘steward’ of the\r\nprocession to-day,” wondered Crito.\r\n\r\n“You’ll be enlightened to-morrow,” said Polus, exasperatingly. Then as the\r\nband of horsemen cantered down the broad Dromos street, “Ah, me,—I wish I\r\ncould afford to serve in the cavalry. It’s far safer than tugging a spear\r\non foot. But there’s one young man out yonder on whose horse I’d not\r\ngladly be sitting.”\r\n\r\n“_Phui_,” complained Clearchus, “you are anxious to eat Glaucon skin and\r\nbones! There goes his wife now, all in white flowers and ribbons, to take\r\nher place in the march with the other young matrons. Zeus! But she is as\r\nhandsome as her husband.”\r\n\r\n“She needn’t ‘draw up her eyebrows,’ ”(6) growled the juror, viciously;\r\n“they’re marks of disloyalty even in her. Can’t you see she wears shoes of\r\nthe Theban model, laced open so as to display her bare feet, though\r\neverybody knows Thebes is Medizing? She’s no better than Glaucon.”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” ordered Clearchus, rising, “you have spoken folly enough. Those\r\ntrumpets tell us we must hasten if we hope to join in the march\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nWho can tell the great procession? Not the maker of books,—what words call\r\ndown light on the glancing eyes, on the moving lines of colour? Not the\r\nartist,—his pencil may not limn ten thousand human beings, beautiful and\r\nglad, sweeping in bright array across the welcoming city. Nor can the\r\nsculptor’s marble shape the marching forms, the rippling draperies, the\r\nwarm and buoyant life. The life of Athens was the crown of Greece. The\r\nfestival of the Panathenæa was the crown of Athens.\r\n\r\nNever had Helios looked down on fairer landscape or city. The doors of the\r\npatrician houses were opened; for a day unguarded, unconstrained, the\r\ndaughters, wives, and mothers of the nobility of Athens walked forth in\r\ntheir queenly beauty. One could see that the sculptor’s master works were\r\nbut rigid counterparts of lovelier flesh and blood. One could see\r\nveterans, stalwart almost as on the day of the old-time battles, but\r\ncrowned with the snow of years. One could see youths, and need no longer\r\nmarvel the young Apollo was accounted fair. Flowers, fluttering mantles,\r\npurple, gold, the bravery of armour, rousing music—what was missing? All\r\nconjoined to make a perfect spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe sun had chased the last vapours from the sky. The little ravines on\r\ndistant Hymettus stood forth sharply as though near at hand. The sun grew\r\nhot, but men and women walked with bared heads, and few were the untanned\r\ncheeks and shoulders. Children of the South, and lovers of the Sun-King,\r\nthe Athenians sought no shelter, their own bright humour rejoicing in the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOn the broad parade ground outside the Dipylon, the towering northwestern\r\ngate, the procession gathered. Themistocles the Handsome, never more\r\ngallant than now upon the white Thessalian, was ordering the array, the\r\nten young men, “stewards of the Panathenæa,” assisting. He sent his last\r\nglance down the long files, his ivory wand signed to the musicians in the\r\nvan.\r\n\r\n“Play! march!”\r\n\r\nFifty pipers blew, fifty citharas tinkled. The host swept into the city.\r\n\r\nThemistocles led. Under the massy double gate caracoled the charger. The\r\nrobe of his rider blew out behind him like purple wings. There was the cry\r\nand clang of cymbals and drums. From the gray battlement yellow daisies\r\nrained down like gold. Cantering, halting, advancing, beckoning, the chief\r\nwent forward, and behind swept the “knights,” the mounted chivalry of\r\nAthens,—three hundred of the noblest youths of Attica, on beasts sleek and\r\nspirited, and in burnished armour, but about every helm a wreath. Behind\r\nthe “knights” rode the magistracy, men white-headed and grave, some\r\nriding, some in flower-decked cars. After these the victors in the games\r\nand contests of the preceding day. Next the elders of Athens—men of\r\nblameless life, beautiful in hale and honoured age. Next the _ephebi_,—the\r\nyouths close to manhood, whose fair limbs glistened under their sweeping\r\nchitons. Behind them, their sisters, unveiled, the maidens of Athens,\r\nwalking in rhythmic beauty, and with them their attendants, daughters of\r\nresident foreigners. Following upon these was the long line of bleating\r\nvictims, black bulls with gilded horns and ribbon-decked rams without\r\nblemish. And next—but here the people leaned from parapet, house-roof,\r\nportico, and shouted louder than ever:\r\n\r\n“The car and the robe of Athena! Hail, _Io, pæan!_ hail!”\r\n\r\nUp the street on a car shaped like a galley moved the peplus, the great\r\nrobe of the sovran goddess. From afar one could see the wide folds spread\r\non a shipyard and rippling in the breeze. But what a sail! One year long\r\nhad the noblest women of Attica wrought on it, and all the love and art\r\nthat might breathe through a needle did not fail. It was a sheen of\r\nglowing colour. The strife of Athena with the brutish giants, her contest\r\nwith Arachne, the deeds of the heroes of Athens—Erechtheus, Theseus,\r\nCodrus: these were some of the pictures. The car moved noiselessly on\r\nwheels turned by concealed mechanism. Under the shadow of the sail walked\r\nthe fairest of its makers, eight women, maids and young matrons, clothed\r\nin white mantles and wreaths, going with stately tread, unmoved by the\r\nshouting as though themselves divine. Seven walked together. But one,\r\ntheir leader, went before,—Hermione, child of Hermippus.\r\n\r\nMany an onlooker remembered this sight of her, the deep spiritual eyes,\r\nthe symmetry of form and fold, the perfect carriage. Fair wishes flew out\r\nto her like doves.\r\n\r\n“May she be blessed forever! May King Helios forever bring her joy!”\r\n\r\nSome cried thus. More thought thus. All seemed more glad for beholding\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBehind the peplus in less careful array went thousands of citizens of\r\nevery age and station, all in festival dress, all crowned with flowers.\r\nThey followed the car up the Dromos Street, across the cheering Agora, and\r\naround the southern side of the Acropolis, making a full circuit of the\r\ncitadel. Those who watched saw Glaucon with Democrates and Cimon give\r\ntheir horses to slaves, and mount the bare knoll of Areopagus, looking\r\ndown upon the western face of the Acropolis. As the procession swung about\r\nto mount the steep, Hermione lifted her glance to Areopagus, saw her\r\nhusband gazing down on her, raised her hands in delighted gesture, and he\r\nanswered her. It was done in the sight of thousands, and the thousands\r\nsmiled with the twain.\r\n\r\n“Justice! The beautiful salutes the beautiful.” And who thought the less\r\nof Hermione for betraying the woman beneath the mien of the goddess?\r\n\r\nBut now the march drew to an end. The procession halted, reformed,\r\ncommenced the rugged way upward. Suddenly from the bastion of the\r\nAcropolis above wafted new music. Low, melancholy at first, as the pipers\r\nand harpers played in the dreamy Lydian mode, till, strengthening into the\r\nbolder Æolic, the strains floated down, inviting, “Come up hither,” then\r\nstronger still it pealed in the imperious crash of the Doric as the\r\nprocession mounted steadily. Now could be seen great Lamprus, Orpheus’s\r\npeer, the master musician, standing on the balcony above the gate, beating\r\ntime for the loud choral.\r\n\r\nA chorus amongst the marchers and a second chorus in the citadel joined\r\ntogether, till the red crags shook,—singing the old hymn of the Homeridæ\r\nto Athena, homely, rude, yet dear with the memory of ages:—\r\n\r\n  “Pallas Athena, gray-eyed queen of wisdom,\r\n          Thy praise I sing!\r\n  Steadfast, all holy, sure ward of our city,\r\n    Triton-born rule whom High Zeus doth bring\r\n  Forth from his forehead.\r\n  Thou springest forth valiant;\r\n    The clangour swells far as thy direful arms ring.\r\n\r\n  “All the Immortals in awed hush are bending,\r\n  Beautiful, terrible, thy light thou’rt sending\r\n    Flashed from thine eyes and thy pitiless spear.\r\n  Under thy presence Olympus is groaning,\r\n  Earth heaves in terrors, the blue deeps are moaning;\r\n    ‘Wisdom, the All-Seeing Goddess is here!’\r\n\r\n  “Now the sea motionless freezes before thee;\r\n  Helios, th’ Sun-Lord, draws rein to adore thee;\r\n    Whilst thou, O Queen, puttest on divine might.\r\n  Zeus, the deep-councillor, gladly greets thee!\r\n  Hail, Holy Virgin—our loud pæan meets thee,\r\n    PALLAS, CHASTE WISDOM, DISPELLER OF NIGHT!”\r\n\r\nUp the face of the Rock, up the long, statue-lined way, till through the\r\ngate the vision burst,—the innumerable fanes and altars, the assembly of\r\nsingers and priests, the great temple in its pride of glittering marble.\r\nClearer, stronger sounded the choral, shot up through the limpid azure;\r\nswaying, burning, throbbing, sobs and shouting, tears and transports, so\r\nmounted new strains of the mighty chorus, lit through with the flames of\r\nHomeric verse. Then stronger yet was the mingling of voices, earth, sky,\r\ndeep, beasts’ cry and gods’ cry, all voiced, as chorus answered to chorus.\r\nNow the peplus was wafted on a wave of song toward the temple’s\r\ndawn-facing portal, when from beneath the columns, as the tall valves\r\nturned and the sun leaped into the cella, hidden voices returned the\r\nformer strains—mournful at first. Out of the adytum echoed a cry of\r\nanguish, the lament of the Mother of Wisdom at her children’s deathly\r\nignorance, which plucks them down from the Mount of the Beautiful Vision.\r\nBut as the thousands neared, as its pæans became a prayer, as yearning\r\nanswered to yearning, lo! the hidden song swelled and soared,—for the\r\ngoddess looked for her own, and her own were come to her. And thus in\r\nbeneath the massy pediment, in through the wide-flung doors, floated the\r\npeplus, while under its guardian shadow walked Hermione.\r\n\r\nSo they brought the robe to Athena.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nGlaucon and his companions had watched the procession ascend, then\r\nfollowed to see the sacrifice upon the giant altar. The King Archon cut\r\nthe throat of the first ox and made public prayer for the people. Wood\r\nsoaked in perfumed oil blazed upon the huge stone platform of the\r\nsacrifice. Girls flung frankincense upon the roaring flames. The music\r\ncrashed louder. All Athens seemed mounting the citadel. The chief\r\npriestess came from the holy house, and in a brief hush proclaimed that\r\nthe goddess had received the robe with all favour. After her came the\r\nmakers of the peplus, and Hermione rejoined her husband.\r\n\r\n“Let us not stay to the public feast,” was her wish; “let these hucksters\r\nand charcoal-burners who live on beans and porridge scramble for a bit of\r\nburned meat, but we return to Colonus.”\r\n\r\n“Good then,” answered Glaucon, “and these friends of course go with us.”\r\n\r\nCimon assented readily. Democrates hesitated, and while hesitating was\r\nseized by the cloak by none other than Agis, who gave a hasty whisper and\r\nvanished in the swirling multitude before Democrates could do more than\r\nnod.\r\n\r\n“He’s an uncanny fox,” remarked Cimon, mystified; “I suppose you know his\r\nreputation?”\r\n\r\n“The servant of Athens must sometimes himself employ strange servants,”\r\nevaded the orator.\r\n\r\n“Yet you might suffer your friends to understand—”\r\n\r\n“Dear son of Miltiades,” Democrates’s voice shook in the slightest, “the\r\nmeaning of my dealings with Agis I pray Athena you may never have cause to\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Which means you will not tell us. Then by Zeus I swear the secret no\r\ndoubt is not worth the knowing.” Cimon stopped suddenly, as he saw a look\r\nof horror on Hermione’s face. “Ah, lady! what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Glaucon,” she groaned, “frightful omen! I am terrified!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon’s hands dropped at her cry. He himself paled slightly. In one of\r\nhis moods of abstraction he had taken the small knife from his belt and\r\nbegun to pare his nails,—to do which after a sacrifice was reputed an\r\ninfallible means of provoking heaven’s anger. The friends were grave and\r\nsilent. The athlete gave a forced laugh.\r\n\r\n“The goddess will be merciful to-day. To-morrow I will propitiate her with\r\na goat.”\r\n\r\n“Now, now, not to-morrow,” urged Hermione, with white lips, but her\r\nhusband refused.\r\n\r\n“The goddess is surfeited with sacrifices this morning. She would forget\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\nThen he led the rest, elbowing the way through the increasing swarms of\r\nyoung and old, and down into the half-deserted city. Democrates left them\r\nin the Agora, professing great stress of duties.\r\n\r\n“Strange man,” observed Cimon, as he walked away; “what has he this past\r\nmonth upon his mind? That Persian spy, I warrant. But the morning wanes.\r\nIt’s a long way to Colonus. ‘Let us drink, for the sun is in the zenith.’\r\nSo says Alcæus—and I love the poet, for he like myself is always thirsty.”\r\n\r\nThe three went on to the knoll of Colonus where Glaucon dwelt. Cimon was\r\noverrunning with puns and jests, but the others not very merry. The omen\r\nof Glaucon’s thoughtlessness, or something else, made husband and wife\r\nsilent, yet it was a day when man or maid should have felt their spirits\r\nrise. The sky had never been brighter, not in Athens. Never had the\r\nmountains and sea spread more gloriously. From the warm olive-groves\r\nsounded the blithesome note of the Attic grasshopper. The wind sweeping\r\nover the dark cypresses by the house set their dark leaves to talking. The\r\nafternoon passed in pleasure, friends going and coming; there was\r\nlaughter, music, and good stories. Hermione at least recovered part of her\r\nbrightness, but her husband, contrary to all custom, remained taciturn,\r\neven melancholy. At last as the gentle tints of evening began to cover\r\nhill and plain and the red-tiled roofs of the ample city, all the friends\r\nwere gone, saving only Cimon, and he—reckless fellow—was well able to\r\ndispense with companionship, being, in the words of Theognis, “not\r\nabsolutely drunk, nor sober quite.” Thus husband and wife found themselves\r\nalone together on the marble bench beneath the old cypress.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _makaire_! dearest and best,” asked Hermione, her hands touching his\r\nface, “is it the omen that makes you grow so sad? For the sun of your life\r\nis so seldom under clouds that when it is clouded at all, it seems as deep\r\ndarkness.”\r\n\r\nHe answered by pressing back her hair, “No, not the omen. I am not a slave\r\nto chance like that. Yet to-day,—the wise God knows wherefore,—there comes\r\na sense of brooding fear. I have been too happy—too blessed with\r\nfriendship, triumph, love. It cannot last. Clotho the Spinner will weary\r\nof making my thread of gold and twine in a darker stuff. Everything lovely\r\nmust pass. What said Glaucus to Diomedes? ‘Even as the race of leaves, so\r\nlikewise are those of men; the leaves that now are, the wind scattereth,\r\nand the forest buddeth forth more again; thus also with the race of men,\r\none putteth forth, another ceaseth.’ So even my joy must pass—”\r\n\r\n“Glaucon,—take back the words. You frighten me.”\r\n\r\nHe felt her in his arms trembling, and cursed himself for what he had\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\n“A blight upon my tongue! I have frightened you, and without cause. Surely\r\nthe day is bright enough, surely Athena having been thus far good we can\r\ntrust her goodness still. Who knows but that it be many a year before our\r\nsun comes to his setting!”\r\n\r\nHe kissed her many times. She grew comforted, but they had not been\r\ntogether long when they were surprised by the approach of Themistocles and\r\nHermippus. Hermione ran to her father.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles and I were summoned hither,” explained Hermippus, “by a\r\nmessage from Democrates bidding us come to Colonus at once, on an urgent\r\nmatter touching the public weal.”\r\n\r\n“He is not here. I cannot understand,” marvelled Glaucon; but while he\r\nspoke, he was interrupted by the clatter of hoofs from a party of horsemen\r\nspurring furiously and heading from the pass of Daphni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A TRAITOR TO HELLAS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the house six riders were reining,—five Scythian “bowmen” of the\r\nconstabulary of Athens, tow-headed Barbarians, grinning but mute; the\r\nsixth was Democrates. He dismounted with a bound, and as he did so the\r\nfriends saw that his face was red as with pent-up excitement. Themistocles\r\nadvanced hastily.\r\n\r\n“What’s this? Your hands seem a-quiver. Whom has that constable tied up\r\nbehind him?”\r\n\r\n“Seuthes!” cried Glaucon, bounding back, “Seuthes, by every god, and\r\npinioned like a felon.”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” groaned the prisoner, lashed to a horse, “what have I done to be\r\nseized and tried like a bandit? Why should I be set upon by these\r\ngentlemen while I was enjoying a quiet pot of wine in the tavern at\r\nDaphni, and be haled away as if to crucifixion? _Mu! Mu!_ make them untie\r\nme, dear Master Glaucon.”\r\n\r\n“Put down your prisoner,” ordered Democrates, “and all you constables stay\r\nwithout the house. I ask Themistocles, Hermippus, and Glaucon to come to\r\nan inner room. I must examine this man. The matter is serious.”\r\n\r\n“Serious?” echoed the bewildered athlete, “I can vouch for Seuthes—an\r\nexcellent Corinthian, come to Athens to sell some bales of wool—”\r\n\r\n“Answer, Glaucon,” Democrates’s voice was stern. “Has he no letters from\r\nyou for Argos?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“You admit it?”\r\n\r\n“By the dog of Egypt, do you doubt my word?”\r\n\r\n“Friends,” called Democrates, dramatically, “mark you that Glaucon admits\r\nhe has employed this Seuthes as his courier.”\r\n\r\n“Whither leads this mummery?” cried the athlete, growing at last angry.\r\n\r\n“If to nothing, I, Democrates, rejoice the most. Now I must bid you to\r\nfollow me.”\r\n\r\nSeizing the snivelling Seuthes, the orator led into the house and to a\r\nprivate chamber. The rest followed, in blank wonderment. Cimon had\r\nrecovered enough to follow—none too steadily. But when Hermione\r\napproached, Democrates motioned her back.\r\n\r\n“Do not come. A painful scene may be impending.”\r\n\r\n“What my husband can hear, that can I,” was her retort. “Ah! but why do\r\nyou look thus dreadfully on Glaucon?”\r\n\r\n“I have warned you, lady. Do not blame me if you hear the worst,” rejoined\r\nDemocrates, barring the door. A single swinging lamp shed a fitful light\r\non the scene—the whimpering prisoner, the others all amazed, the orator’s\r\nface, tense and white. Democrates’s voice seemed metallic as he\r\ncontinued:—\r\n\r\n“Now, Seuthes, we must search you. Produce first the letter from Glaucon.”\r\n\r\nThe fat florid little Corinthian was dressed as a traveller, a gray\r\nchalmys to his hips, a brimmed brown hat, and high black boots. His hands\r\nwere now untied. He tugged from his belt a bit of papyrus which Democrates\r\nhanded to Themistocles, enjoining “Open.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon flushed.\r\n\r\n“Are you mad, Democrates, to violate my private correspondence thus?”\r\n\r\n“The weal of Athens outweighs even the pleasure of Glaucon,” returned the\r\norator, harshly, “and you, Themistocles, note that Glaucon does not deny\r\nthat the seal here is his own.”\r\n\r\n“I do not deny,” cried the angry athlete. “Open, Themistocles, and let\r\nthis stupid comedy end.”\r\n\r\n“And may it never change to tragedy!” proclaimed Democrates. “What do you\r\nread, Themistocles?”\r\n\r\n“A courteous letter of thanks to Ageladas.” The senior statesman was\r\nfrowning. “Glaucon is right. Either you are turned mad, or are victim of\r\nsome prank,—is it yours, Cimon?”\r\n\r\n“I am as innocent as a babe. I’d swear it by the Styx,” responded that\r\nyoung man, scratching his muddled head.\r\n\r\n“I fear we are not at the end of the examination,” observed Democrates,\r\nwith ominous slowness. “Now, Seuthes, recollect your plight. Have you no\r\nother letter about you?”\r\n\r\n“None!” groaned the unheroic Corinthian. “Ah! pity, kind sirs; what have I\r\ndone? Suffer me to go.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible,” remarked his prosecutor, “you are an innocent victim, or\r\nat least do not realize the intent of what you bear. I must examine the\r\nlining of your chalmys. Nothing. Your girdle. Nothing. Your hat, remove\r\nit. Quite empty. Blessed be Athena if my fears prove groundless. But my\r\nfirst duty is to Athens and Hellas. Ah! Your high boots. Remove the right\r\none.” The orator felt within, and shook the boot violently. “Nothing\r\nagain. The left one, empty it seems. _Ei!_ what is this?”\r\n\r\nIn a tense silence he shook from the boot a papyrus, rolled and sealed. It\r\nfell on the floor at the feet of Themistocles, who, watching all his\r\nlieutenant did, bent and seized it instantly; then it dropped from his\r\nhands as a live coal.\r\n\r\n“The seal! The seal! May Zeus smite me blind if I see aright!”\r\n\r\nHermippus, who had been following all the scene in silence, bent, lifted\r\nthe fateful paper, and he too gave a cry of grief.\r\n\r\n“It is the seal of Glaucon. How came it here?”\r\n\r\n“Glaucon,”—hard as Democrates’s voice had been that night, it rang like\r\ncold iron now,—“as the friend of your boyhood, and one who would still do\r\nfor you all he may, I urge you as you love me to look upon this seal.”\r\n\r\n“I am looking,” but as he spoke paleness followed the angry flush on the\r\nathlete’s forehead. He needed no omen to tell him something fearful was\r\nabout to ensue.\r\n\r\n“The seal is yours?”\r\n\r\n“The very same, two dancing mænads and over them a winged Eros. But how\r\ncame this letter here? I did not—”\r\n\r\n“As you love life or death, as you preserve any regard for our friendship,\r\nI adjure you,—not to brave it longer, but to confess—”\r\n\r\n“Confess what? My head is reeling.”\r\n\r\n“The treason in which you have dipped your hands, your dealings with the\r\nPersian spy, your secret interviews, and last of all this letter,—I fear a\r\ngross betrayal of all trust,—to some agent of Xerxes. I shudder when I\r\nthink of what may be its contents.”\r\n\r\n“And—this—from—you! Oh,—Democrates,—”\r\n\r\nThe accused man’s hands snatched at the air. He sank upon a chest.\r\n\r\n“He does not deny it,” threw out the orator, but Glaucon’s voice rang\r\nshrilly:—\r\n\r\n“Ever! Ever will I deny! Though the Twelve Gods all cried out ‘guilty!’\r\nThe charge is monstrous.”\r\n\r\n“It is time, Democrates,” said Themistocles, who had preserved a grim\r\nsilence, “that you showed us clearly whither your path is leading. This is\r\na fearful accusation you launch against your best-loved friend.”\r\n\r\n“Themistocles is right,” assented the orator, moving away from the\r\nluckless Seuthes as from a pawn no longer important in the game of life\r\nand death. “The whole of the wretched story I fear I must tell on the Bema\r\nto all Athens. I must be brief, but believe me, I can make good all I say.\r\nSince my return from the Isthmia, I have been observed to be sad.\r\nRightly—for knowing Glaucon as I did, I grew suspicious, and I loved him.\r\nYou have thought me not diligent in hunting down the Persian spy. You were\r\nwrong. But how could I ruin my friend without full proof? I made use of\r\nAgis,—no genteel confederate, to be sure, but honest, patriotic,\r\nindefatigable. I soon had my eyes on the suspected Babylonish\r\ncarpet-seller. I observed Glaucon’s movements closely, they gave just\r\nground for suspicion. The Babylonian, I came to feel, was none other than\r\nan agent of Xerxes himself. I discovered that Glaucon had been making this\r\nemissary nocturnal visits.”\r\n\r\n“A lie!” groaned the accused, in agony.\r\n\r\n“I would to Athena I believed you,” was the unflinching answer; “I have\r\ndirect evidence from eye-witnesses that you went to him. In a moment I can\r\nproduce it. Yet still I hesitated. Who would blast a friend without\r\ndamning proof? Then yesterday with your own lips you told me you sent a\r\nmessenger to disloyal Argos. I suspected two messages, not one, were\r\nentrusted to Seuthes, and that you proclaimed the more innocent matter\r\nthus boldly simply to blind my eyes. Before Seuthes started forth this\r\nmorning Agis informed me he had met him in a wine-shop—”\r\n\r\n“True,” whimpered the unhappy prisoner.\r\n\r\n“And this fellow as much as admitted he carried a second and secret\r\nmessage—”\r\n\r\n“Liar!” roared Seuthes.\r\n\r\n“Men hint strange things in wine-shops,” observed Democrates,\r\nsarcastically. “Enough that a second papyrus with Glaucon’s seal has been\r\nfound hidden upon you.”\r\n\r\n“Open it then, and know the worst,” interjected Themistocles, his face\r\nlike a thunder-cloud; but Democrates forbade him.\r\n\r\n“A moment. Let me complete my story. This afternoon I received warning\r\nthat the Babylonish carpet-vender had taken sudden flight, presumably\r\ntoward Thebes. I have sent mounted constables after him. I trust they can\r\nseize him at the pass of Phyle. In the meantime, I may assure you I have\r\nirrefutable evidence—needless to present here—that the man was a Persian\r\nagent, and to more purpose hear this affidavit, sworn to by very worthy\r\npatriots.\r\n\r\n“Polus, son of Phodrus of the Commune of Diomea, and Lampaxo his sister\r\ntake oath by Zeus, Dike, and Athena, thus: We swear we saw and recognized\r\nGlaucon, son of Conon, twice visiting by night in the past month of\r\nScirophorion a certain Babylonish carpet-seller, name unknown, who had\r\nlodgings above Demas’s shield factory in Alopece.”\r\n\r\n“Details lack,” spoke Themistocles, keenly.\r\n\r\n“To be supplied in full measure at the trial,” rejoined the orator. “And\r\nnow to the second letter itself.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, the letter, whatever the foul Cyclops that wrought it!” groaned\r\nGlaucon through his teeth.\r\n\r\nThemistocles took the document from Hermippus’s trembling hands. His own\r\ntrembled whilst he broke the seal.\r\n\r\n“The handwriting of Glaucon. There is no doubt,” was his despairing\r\ncomment. His frown darkened. Then he attempted to read.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon of Athens to Cleophas of Argos wishes health:—\r\n\r\n“Cleophas leads the Medizers of Argos, the greatest friend of Xerxes in\r\nGreece. O Zeus, what is this next—\r\n\r\n“Our dear friend, whom I dare not name, to-day departs for Thebes, and in\r\na month will be safe in Sardis. His visit to Athens has been most\r\nfruitful. Since you at present have better opportunity than we for\r\nforwarding packets to Susa, do not fail to despatch this at once. A happy\r\nchance led Themistocles to explain to me his secret memorandum for the\r\narraying of the Greek fleet. You can apprize its worth, for the only\r\nothers to whom it is entrusted are Democrates and later Leonidas—”\r\n\r\nThemistocles flung the papyrus down. His voice was broken. Tears stood in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n“O Glaucon, Glaucon,—whom I have trusted? Was ever trust so betrayed! May\r\nApollo smite me blind, if so I could forget what I read here! It is all\r\nwritten—the secret ordering of the fleet—”\r\n\r\nFor a terrible moment there was silence in the little room, a silence\r\nbroken by a wild, shrill cry,—Hermione’s, as she cast her arms about her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n“A lie! A snare! A wicked plot! Some jealous god has devised this guile,\r\nseeing we were too happy!”\r\n\r\nShe shook with sobs, and Glaucon, roused to manhood by her grief, uprose\r\nand faced the stern face of Democrates, the blenching faces of the rest.\r\n\r\n“I am the victim of a conspiracy of all the fiends in Tartarus,”—he strove\r\nhard to speak steadily; “I did not write that second letter. It is a\r\nforgery.”\r\n\r\n“But who, then,” groaned Themistocles, hopelessly, “_can_ claim this\r\nhandiwork? Democrates or I?—for no other has seen the memorandum,—that I\r\nswear. It has not yet gone to Leonidas. It has been guarded as the apple\r\nof my eye. We three alone knew thereof. And it is in this narrow room the\r\nbetrayer of Hellas must stand.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot explain.” Glaucon staggered back to his seat. His wife’s head\r\nsank upon his lap. The two sat in misery.\r\n\r\n“Confess, by the remnants of our friendship I implore, confess,” ordered\r\nDemocrates, “and then Themistocles and I will strive to lighten if\r\npossible your inevitable doom.”\r\n\r\nThe accused man sat dumb, but Hermione struck back as some wild creature\r\ndriven to bay. She lifted her head.\r\n\r\n“Has Glaucon here no friend but me, his wife?” She sent beseeching eyes\r\nabout the room. “Do you all cry ‘guilty, guilty’? Then is your friendship\r\nfalse, for when is friendship proved, save in the hour of need?”\r\n\r\nThe appeal brought an answer from her father, who had been standing\r\nsilent; and in infinite distress kindly, cautious, charitable Hermippus\r\nbegan:—\r\n\r\n“Dear Glaucon, Hermione is wrong; we were never more your friends. We are\r\nwilling to believe the best and not the worst. Therefore tell all frankly.\r\nYou have been a victim of great temptation. The Isthmian victory has\r\nturned your head. The Persian was subtle, plausible. He promised I know\r\nnot what. You did not realize all you were doing. You had confederates\r\nhere in Athens who are more guilty. We can make allowances. Tell only the\r\ntruth, and the purse and influence of Hermippus of Eleusis shall never be\r\nheld back to save his son-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“Nor mine, nor mine,” cried Themistocles, snatching at every straw; “only\r\nconfess, the temptation was great, others were more guilty, everything\r\nthen may be done—”\r\n\r\nGlaucon drew himself together and looked up almost proudly. Slowly he was\r\nrecovering strength and wit.\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to confess,” he spoke, “nothing. I know nothing of this\r\nPersian spy. Can I swear the god’s own oath—by Earth, by Sky, by the\r\nStyx—”\r\n\r\nThemistocles shook his head wearily.\r\n\r\n“How can we say you are innocent? You never visited the Babylonian?”\r\n\r\n“Never. Never!”\r\n\r\n“Polus and Lampaxo swear otherwise. The letter?”\r\n\r\n“A forgery.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible. Is the forger Democrates or I?”\r\n\r\n“Some god has done this thing in malice, jealous of my great joy.”\r\n\r\n“I fear Hermes no longer strides so frequently about Athens. The hand and\r\nseal are yours,—and still you do not confess?”\r\n\r\n“If I must die,” Glaucon was terribly pale, but his voice was steady, “it\r\nis not as a perjurer!”\r\n\r\nThemistocles turned his back with a groan.\r\n\r\n“I can do nothing for you. This is the saddest hour in my life.” He was\r\nsilent, but Democrates sprang to the athlete’s side.\r\n\r\n“Have I not prayed each god to spare me this task?” he spoke. “Can I\r\nforget our friendship? Do not brave it to the end. Pity at least your\r\nfriends, your wife—”\r\n\r\nHe threw back his cloak, pointing to a sword.\r\n\r\n“_Ai_,” cried the accused, shrinking. “What would you have me do?”\r\n\r\n“Save the public disgrace, the hooting jury, the hemlock, the corpse flung\r\ninto the Barathrum. Strike this into your breast and end the shame.”\r\n\r\nNo further. Glaucon smote him so that he reeled. The athlete’s tone was\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\n“Villain! You shall not tempt me.” Then he turned to the rest, and stood\r\nin his white agony, yet beautiful as ever, holding out his arms.\r\n\r\n“O friends, do you all believe the worst? Do you, Themistocles, turn\r\nsilently against me?” No answer. “And you, Hermippus?” No answer again.\r\n“And you, Cimon, who praised me as the fairest friend in all the world?”\r\nThe son of Miltiades simply tore his hair. Then the athlete turned to\r\nDemocrates.\r\n\r\n“And you I deemed more than comrade, for we were boys at school together,\r\nwere flogged with the same rod, and drank from the same cup, had like\r\nfriends, foes, loves, hates; and have lived since as more than\r\nbrothers,—do you too turn utterly away?”\r\n\r\n“I would it were otherwise,” came the sullen answer. Again Democrates\r\npointed to the sword, but Glaucon stood up proudly.\r\n\r\n“No. I am neither traitor, nor perjurer, nor coward. If I must perish, it\r\nshall be as becomes an Alcmæonid. If you have resolved to undo me, I know\r\nyour power over Athenian juries. I must die. But I shall die with\r\nunspotted heart, calling the curse of the innocent upon the god or man who\r\nplotted to destroy me.”\r\n\r\n“We have enough of this direful comedy,” declared Democrates, pale\r\nhimself. “Only one thing is left. Call in the Scythians with their gyves,\r\nand hale the traitor to prison.”\r\n\r\nHe approached the door; the others stood as icy statues, but not Hermione.\r\nShe had her back against the door before the orator could open.\r\n\r\n“Hold,” she commanded, “for you are doing murder!”\r\n\r\nDemocrates halted at the menacing light in her eyes. All the fear had gone\r\nout of them. Athena Promachos, “Mistress of Battles,” must have stood in\r\nthat awful beauty when aroused. Did the goddess teach her in that dread\r\nmoment of her power over the will of the orator? Glaucon was still\r\nstanding motionless, helpless, his last appeal having ended in mute\r\nresignation to inevitable fate. She motioned to him desperately.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon! Glaucon!” she adjured, “do not throw your life away. They shall\r\nnot murder you. Up! Rouse yourself! There is yet time. Fly, or all is\r\nlost.”\r\n\r\n“Fly!” spoke the athlete, almost vacantly. “No, I will brave them to the\r\nend.”\r\n\r\n“For my sake, fly,” she ordered, and conjured by that potent talisman,\r\nGlaucon moved toward her.\r\n\r\n“How? Whither?”\r\n\r\n“To the ends of the earth, Scythia, Atlantis, India, and remain till all\r\nAthens knows you are innocent.”\r\n\r\nAs men move who know not what they do, he approached the door. Held by the\r\nmagic of her eyes the others stood rigid. They saw Hermione raise the\r\nlatch. Her husband’s face met hers in one kiss. The door opened, closed.\r\nGlaucon was gone, and as the latch clicked Democrates shook off the charm\r\nand leaped forward.\r\n\r\n“After the traitor! Not too late!—”\r\n\r\nFor an instant he wrestled with Hermione hand to hand, but she was strong\r\nthrough fear and love. He could not master her. Then a heavy grasp fell on\r\nhis shoulder—Cimon’s.\r\n\r\n“You are beside yourself, Democrates. My memory is longer than yours. To\r\nme Glaucon is still a friend. I’ll not see him dragged to death before my\r\neyes. When we follow even a fox or a wolf, we give fair start and fair\r\nplay. You shall not pursue him yet.”\r\n\r\n“Blessing on you!” cried the wife, falling on her knees and seizing\r\nCimon’s cloak. “Oh, make Themistocles and my father merciful!”\r\n\r\nHermippus—tender-hearted man—was in tears. Themistocles was pacing the\r\nlittle chamber, his hand tugging his beard, clearly in grievous doubt.\r\n\r\n“The Scythians! The constables!” Democrates clamoured frantically; “every\r\ninstant gives the traitor better start.”\r\n\r\nBut Cimon held him fast, and Themistocles was not to be interrupted. Only\r\nafter a long time he spoke, and then with authority which brooked no\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\n“There is no hole in the net of Democrates’s evidence that Glaucon is\r\nguilty of foul disloyalty, disloyalty worthy of shameful death. Were he\r\nany other there would be only one way with him and that a short one. But\r\nGlaucon I know, if I know any man. The charges even if proved are nigh\r\nincredible. For of all the thousands in Hellas his soul seemed the purest,\r\nnoblest, most ingenuous. Therefore I will not hasten on his death. I will\r\ngive the gods a chance to save him. Let Democrates arraign me for\r\n‘misprision of treason’ if he will, and of failing in duty to Athens.\r\nThere shall be no pursuit of Glaucon until morning. Then let the Eleven(7)\r\nissue their hue and cry. If they take him, let the law deal with him. Till\r\nthen give respite.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates attempted remonstrance. Themistocles bade him be silent\r\nsharply, and the other bowed his head in cowed acquiescence. Hermione\r\nstaggered from the door, her father unbarred, and the whole wretched\r\ncompany went forth. In the passage hung a burnished steel mirror; Hermione\r\ngave a cry as she passed it. The light borne by Hermippus showed her in\r\nher festival dress, the rippling white drapery, the crown of white\r\nviolets.\r\n\r\n“My father!” she cried, falling into his arms, “is it still the day of the\r\nPanathenæa, when I marched in the great procession, when all Athens called\r\nme happy? It was a thousand years ago! I can never be glad again—”\r\n\r\nHe lifted her tenderly as she fainted. Old Cleopis, the Spartan nurse who\r\nhad kissed her almost before her mother, ran to her. They carried her to\r\nbed, and Athena in mercy hid her from consciousness that night and all the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE DISLOYALTY OF PHORMIO\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the Panathenæa, Bias, servant of Democrates, had supped\r\nwith Phormio,—for in democratic Athens a humble citizen would not disdain\r\nto entertain even a slave. The Thracian had a merry wit and a\r\nstory-teller’s gift that more than paid for the supper of barley-porridge\r\nand salt mackerel, and after the viands had disappeared was ready even to\r\ntell tales against his master.\r\n\r\n“I’ve turned my brain inside out, and shaken it like a meal sack. No\r\nwisdom comes. The _kyrios_ has something on his mind. He prays to Hermes\r\nDolios as often as if he were a cut-purse. Then yesterday he sent me for\r\nAgis—”\r\n\r\n“Agis?” Phormio pricked up his ears. “The gambling-house keeper? What does\r\nDemocrates with _him_?”\r\n\r\n“Answer yourself. My master has been to Agis’s pretty place before to see\r\nhis cocks. However, this is different. To-day I met Theon.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s he?”\r\n\r\n“Agis’s slave, the merriest scoundrel in Athens. Agis, he says, has been\r\nprancing like an ass stuffed with barley. He gave Theon a letter from\r\nDemocrates to take to your Babylonian opposite; Theon must hunt up\r\nSeuthes, a Corinthian, and worm out of him when and how he was leaving\r\nAthens. Agis promised Theon a gold stater if all was right.”\r\n\r\nPhormio whistled. “You mean the carpet-dealer here? By Athena’s owls,\r\nthere is no light in his window to-night!”\r\n\r\n“None, indeed,” crackled Lampaxo; “didn’t I see that cursed Babylonian\r\nwith his servants gliding out just as Bias entered? Zeus knows whither! I\r\nhope ere dawn Democrates has them by the heels.”\r\n\r\n“Democrates does something to-night,” asserted Bias, extending his cup for\r\nwine. “At noon Agis flew up to him, chattered something in his ear,\r\nwhereupon Democrates bade me be off and not approach him till to-morrow,\r\notherwise a cane gets broken on my shoulders.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not painful to have a holiday,” laughed Phormio.\r\n\r\n“It’s most painful to be curious yet unsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“But why did not you take the letter to the Babylonian?” observed Phormio,\r\nshrewdly.\r\n\r\n“I’m perplexed, indeed. Only one thing is possible.”\r\n\r\n“And that is—”\r\n\r\n“Theon is not known in this street. I am. Perhaps the _kyrios_ didn’t care\r\nto have it rumoured he had dealings with that Babylonian.”\r\n\r\n“Silence, undutiful scoundrel,” ordered Lampaxo, from her corner; “what\r\nhas so noble a patriot as Democrates to conceal? Ugh! Be off with you!\r\nPhormio, don’t dare to fill up the tipsy fox’s beaker again. I want to\r\npull on my nightcap and go to bed.”\r\n\r\nBias did not take the hint. Phormio was considering whether it was best to\r\njoin combat with his redoubtable spouse, or save his courage for a more\r\nimportant battle, when a slight noise from the street made all listen.\r\n\r\n“Pest light on those bands of young roisterers!” fumed Lampaxo. “They go\r\naround all night, beating on doors and vexing honest folk. Why don’t the\r\nconstables trot them all to jail?”\r\n\r\n“This isn’t a drunken band, good wife,” remarked Phormio, rising; “some\r\none is sitting on the stones by the Hermes, near the door, groaning as if\r\nin pain.”\r\n\r\n“A drunkard? Let him lie then,” commanded Lampaxo; “let the coat-thieves\r\ncome and filch his chiton.”\r\n\r\n“He’s hardly drunken,” observed her husband, peering through the lattice\r\nin the door, “but sick rather. Don’t detain me, _philotata_,”—Lampaxo’s\r\nskinny hand had tried to restrain. “I’ll not let even a dog suffer.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be ruined by too much charity,” bewailed the woman, but Bias\r\nfollowed the fishmonger into the night. The moon shone down the narrow\r\nstreet, falling over the stranger who half lay, half squatted by the\r\nHermes. When the two approached him, he tried to stagger to his feet, then\r\nreeled, and Phormio’s strong arms seized him. The man resisted feebly, and\r\nseemed never to hear the fishmonger’s friendly questions.\r\n\r\n“I am innocent. Do not arrest me. Help me to the temple of Hephæstos,\r\nwhere there’s asylum for fugitives. Ah! Hermione, that I should bring you\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\nBias leaped back as the moonlight glanced over the face of the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Master Glaucon, half naked and mad! _Ai!_ woe!”\r\n\r\n“Glaucon the Alcmæonid,” echoed Phormio, in amazement, and the other still\r\nstruggled to escape.\r\n\r\n“Do you not hear? I am innocent. I never visited the Persian spy. I never\r\nbetrayed the fleet. By what god can I swear it, that you may believe?”\r\n\r\nPhormio was a man to recover from surprise quickly, and act swiftly and to\r\nthe purpose. He made haste to lead his unfortunate visitor inside and lay\r\nhim on his one hard couch. Scarcely was this done, however, when Lampaxo\r\nran up to Glaucon in mingled rage and exultation.\r\n\r\n“Phormio doesn’t know what Polus and I told Democrates, or what he told\r\nus! So you thought to escape, you white-skinned traitor? But we’ve watched\r\nyou. We know how you went to the Babylonian. We know your guilt. And now\r\nthe good gods have stricken you mad and delivered you to justice.” She\r\nwaved her bony fists in the prostrate man’s face. “Run, Phormio! don’t\r\nstand gaping like a magpie. Run, I say—”\r\n\r\n“Whither? For a physician?”\r\n\r\n“To Areopagus, fool! There’s where the constables have their camp. Bring\r\nten men with fetters. He’s strong and desperate. Bias and I will wait and\r\nguard him. If you stir, traitor,—” she was holding a heavy meat-knife at\r\nthe fugitive’s throat,—“I’ll slit your weasand like a chicken.”\r\n\r\nBut for once in his life Phormio defied his tyrant effectively. With one\r\nhand he tore the weapon from her clutch, the other closed her screaming\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n“Are you mad yourself? Will you rouse the neighbourhood? I don’t know what\r\nyou and Polus tattled about to Democrates. I don’t greatly care. As for\r\ngoing for constables to seize Glaucon the Fortunate—”\r\n\r\n“Fortunate!” echoed the miserable youth, rising on one elbow, “say it\r\nnever again. The gods have blasted me with one great blow. And you—you are\r\nPhormio, husband and brother-in-law of those who have sworn against\r\nme,—you are the slave of Democrates my destroyer,—and you, woman,—Zeus\r\nsoften you!—already clamour for my worthless life, as all Athens does\r\nto-morrow!”\r\n\r\nLampaxo suddenly subsided. Resistance from her spouse was so unexpected\r\nshe lost at once arguments and breath. Phormio continued to act promptly;\r\ntaking a treasured bottle from a cupboard he filled a mug and pressed it\r\nto the newcomer’s lips. The fiery liquor sent the colour back into\r\nGlaucon’s face. He raised himself higher—strength and mind in a measure\r\nreturned. Bias had whispered to Phormio rapidly. Perhaps he had guessed\r\nmore of his master’s doings than he had dared to hint before.\r\n\r\n“Hark you, Master Glaucon,” began Phormio, not unkindly. “You are with\r\nfriends, and never heed my wife. She’s not so steely hearted as she\r\nseems.”\r\n\r\n“Seize the traitor,” interjected Lampaxo, with a gasp.\r\n\r\n“Tell your story. I’m a plain and simple man, who won’t believe a\r\ngentleman with your fair looks, fame, and fortune has pawned them all in a\r\nnight. Bias has sense. First tell how you came to wander down this way.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon sat upright, his hands pressing against his forehead.\r\n\r\n“How can I tell? I have run to and fro, seeing yet not seeing whither I\r\nwent. I know I passed the Acharnican gate, and the watch stared at me.\r\nDoubtless I ran hither because here they said the Babylonian lived, and he\r\nhas been ever in my head. I shudder to go over the scene at Colonus. I\r\nwish I were dead. Then I could forget it!”\r\n\r\n“Constables—fetters!” howled Lampaxo, as a direful interlude, to be\r\nsilenced by an angry gesture from her helpmeet.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, try to tell what you can,” spoke Phormio, mildly, and\r\nGlaucon, with what power he had, complied. Broken, faltering, scarce\r\ncoherent often, his story came at last. He sat silent while Phormio\r\nclutched his own head. Then Glaucon darted around wild and hopeless eyes.\r\n\r\n“_Ai!_ you believe me guilty. I almost believe so myself. All my best\r\nfriends have cast me off. Democrates, my friend from youth, has wrought my\r\nruin. My wife I shall never see again. I am resolved—” He rose. A\r\ndesperate purpose made his feet steady.\r\n\r\n“What will you do?” demanded Phormio, perplexed.\r\n\r\n“One thing is left. I am sure to be arrested at dawn if not before. I will\r\ngo to the ‘City-House,’ the public prison, and give myself up. The\r\nignominy will soon end. Then welcome the Styx, Hades, the never ending\r\nnight—better than this shame!”\r\n\r\nHe started forth, but Phormio’s hand restrained him. “Not so fast, lad!\r\nThank Olympus, I’m not Lampaxo. You’re too young a turbot for Charon’s\r\nfish-net. Let me think a moment.”\r\n\r\nThe fishmonger stood scratching his thin hairs. Another howl from Lampaxo\r\ndecided him.\r\n\r\n“Are you a traitor, too? Away with the wretch to prison!”\r\n\r\n“I’m resolved,” cried Phormio, striking his thigh. “Only an honest man\r\ncould get such hatred from my wife. If they’ve not tracked you yet,\r\nthey’re not likely to find you before morning. My cousin Brasidas is\r\nmaster of the _Solon_, and owes a good turn—”\r\n\r\nQuick strides took him to a chest. He dragged forth a sleeveless sailor’s\r\ncloak of hair-cloth. To fling this over Glaucon’s rent chiton took an\r\ninstant, another instant to clap on the fugitive’s head a brimless red\r\ncap.\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_—you grow transformed. But that white face of yours is dangerous.\r\nSee!” he rubbed over the Alcmæonid’s face two handfuls of black ashes\r\nsnatched from the hearth and sprang back with a great laugh, “you’re a\r\nsailor unlading charcoal now. Zeus himself would believe it. All is\r\nready—”\r\n\r\n“For prison?” asked Glaucon, clearly understanding little.\r\n\r\n“For the sea, my lad. For Athens is no place for you to-morrow, and\r\nBrasidas sails at dawn. Some more wine? It’s a long, brisk walk.”\r\n\r\n“To the havens? You trust me? You doubt the accusation which every friend\r\nsave Hermione believes? O pure Athena—and this is possible!” Again\r\nGlaucon’s head whirled. It took more of the fiery wine to stay him up.\r\n\r\n“Ay, boy,” comforted Phormio, very gruff, “you shall walk again around\r\nAthens with a bold, brave face, though not to-morrow, I fear. Polus trusts\r\nhis heart and not his head in voting ‘guilty,’ so I trust it voting\r\n‘innocent.’ ”\r\n\r\n“I warn you,” Glaucon spoke rapidly, “I’ve no claim on your friendship. If\r\nyour part in this is discovered, you know our juries.”\r\n\r\n“That I know,” laughed Phormio, grimly, “for I know dear Polus. So now my\r\nown cloak and we are off.”\r\n\r\nBut Lampaxo, who had watched everything with accumulating anger, now burst\r\nloose. She bounded to the door.\r\n\r\n“Constables! Help! Athens is betrayed!”\r\n\r\nShe bawled that much through the lattice before her husband and Bias\r\ndragged her back. Fortunately the street was empty.\r\n\r\n“That I should see this! My own husband betraying the city! Aiding a\r\ntraitor!” Then she began whimpering through her nose. “_Mu! mu!_ leave the\r\nvillain to his fate. Think of me if not of your own safety. Woe! when was\r\na woman more misused?”\r\n\r\nBut here her lament ended, for Phormio, with the firmness of a man\r\nthoroughly determined, thrust a rag into her mouth and with Bias’s help\r\nbound her down upon the couch by means of a convenient fish-cord.\r\n\r\n“I am grieved to stop your singing, blessed dear,” spoke the fishmonger,\r\nindulging in a rare outburst of sarcasm against his formidable helpmeet,\r\n“but we play a game with Fate to-night a little too even to allow unfair\r\nchances. Bias will watch you until I return, and then I can discover,\r\n_philotata_, whether your love for Athens is so great you must go to the\r\nArchon to denounce your husband.”\r\n\r\nThe Thracian promised to do his part. His affection for Democrates was\r\nclearly not the warmest. Lampaxo’s farewell, as Phormio guided his\r\nhalf-dazed companion into the street, was a futile struggle and a choking.\r\nThe ways were empty and silent. Glaucon allowed himself to be led by the\r\nhand and did not speak. He hardly knew how or whither Phormio was taking\r\nhim. Their road lay along the southern side of the Acropolis, past the\r\ntall columns of the unfinished Temple of Zeus, which reared to giant\r\nheight in the white moonlight. This, as well as the overshadowing Rock\r\nitself, they left behind without incident. Phormio chose devious alleys,\r\nand they met neither Scythian constables nor bands of roisterers. Only\r\nonce the two passed a house bright with lamps. Jovial guests celebrated a\r\nlate wedding feast. Clearly the two heard the marriage hymn of Sappho.\r\n\r\n  “The bridegroom comes tall as Ares,\r\n       Ho, Hymenæus!\r\n  Taller than a mighty man,\r\n       Ho, Hymenæus!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon stopped like one struck with an arrow.\r\n\r\n“They sang that song the night I wedded Hermione. Oh, if I could drink the\r\nLethe water and forget!”\r\n\r\n“Come,” commanded Phormio, pulling upon his arm. “The sun will shine again\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThus the twain went forward, Glaucon saying not a word. He hardly knew how\r\nthey passed the Itonian Gate and crossed the long stretch of open country\r\nbetwixt the city and its havens. No pursuit as yet—Glaucon was too\r\nperplexed to reason why. At last he knew they entered Phaleron. He heard\r\nthe slapping waves, the creaking tackle, the shouting sailors. Torches\r\ngleamed ruddily. A merchantman was loading her cargo of pottery crates and\r\noil jars,—to sail with the morning breeze. Swarthy shipmen ran up and down\r\nthe planks betwixt quay and ship, balancing their heavy jars on their\r\nheads as women bear water-pots. From the tavern by the mooring came\r\nharping and the clatter of cups, while two women—the worse for wine—ran\r\nout to drag the newcomers in to their revel. Phormio slapped the slatterns\r\naside with his staff. In the same fearful waking dream Glaucon saw Phormio\r\ndemanding the shipmaster. He saw Brasidas—a short man with the face of a\r\nhound and arms to hug like a bear—in converse with the fishmonger, saw the\r\nmaster at first refusing, then gradually giving reluctant assent to some\r\ndemand. Next Phormio was half leading, half carrying the fugitive aboard\r\nthe ship, guiding him through a labyrinth of bales, jars, and cordage, and\r\npointing to a hatchway ladder, illumined by a swinging lantern.\r\n\r\n“Keep below till the ship sails; don’t wipe the charcoal from your face\r\ntill clear of Attica. Officers will board the vessel before she puts off;\r\nyet have no alarm, they’ll only come to see she doesn’t violate the law\r\nagainst exporting grain.” Phormio delivered his admonitions rapidly, at\r\nthe same time fumbling in his belt. “Here—here are ten drachmæ, all I’ve\r\nabout me, but something for bread and figs till you make new friends,—in\r\nwhich there’ll be no trouble, I warrant. Have a brave heart. Remember that\r\nHelios can shine lustily even if you are not in Athens, and pray the gods\r\nto give a fair return.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon felt the money pressed within his palm. He saw Phormio turning\r\naway. He caught the fishmonger’s hard hand and kissed it twice.\r\n\r\n“I can never reward you. Not though I live ten thousand years and have all\r\nthe gold of Gyges.”\r\n\r\n“_Phui!_” answered Phormio, with a shrug; “don’t detain me, it’s time I\r\nwas home and was unlashing my loving wife.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that he was gone. Glaucon descended the ladder. The cabin was\r\nlow, dark, unfurnished save with rude pallets of straw, but Glaucon heeded\r\nnone of these things. Deeper than the accusation by Democrates, than the\r\nbelief therein by Themistocles and the others, the friendship of the\r\nfishmonger touched him. A man base-born, ignorant, uncivil, had believed\r\nhim, had risked his own life to save him, had given him money out of his\r\npoverty, had spoken words of fair counsel and cheer. On the deck above the\r\nsailors were tumbling the cargo, and singing at their toil, but Glaucon\r\nnever heard them. Flinging himself on a straw pallet, for the first time\r\ncame the comfort of hot tears.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nVery early the _Solon’s_ square mainsail caught the breeze from the warm\r\nsouthwest. The hill of Munychia and the ports receded. The panorama of\r\nAthens—plain, city, citadel, gray Hymettus, white Pentelicus—spread in a\r\nvista of surpassing beauty—so at least to the eyes of the outlaw when he\r\nclambered to the poop. As the ship ran down the low coast, land and sea\r\nseemed clothed with a robe of rainbow-woven light. Far, near,—islands,\r\nmountains, and deep were burning with saffron, violet, and rose, as the\r\nSun-God’s car climbed higher above the burning path it marked across the\r\nsea. Glaucon saw all in clear relief,—the Acropolis temple where he had\r\nprayed, the Pnyx and Areopagus, the green band of the olive groves, even\r\nthe knoll of Colonus,—where he had left his all. Never had he loved Athens\r\nmore than now. Never had she seemed fairer to his eyes than now. He was a\r\nGreek, and to a Greek death was only by one stage a greater ill than\r\nexile.\r\n\r\n“O Athena Polias,” he cried, stretching his hands to the fading beauty,\r\n“goddess who determineth all aright,—bless thou this land, though it wakes\r\nto call me traitor. Teach it to know I am innocent. Comfort Hermione, my\r\nwife. And restore me to Athens, after doing deeds which wipe out all my\r\nunearned shame!”\r\n\r\nThe _Solon_ rounded the cape. The headland concealed the city. The\r\nSaronian bay opened into the deeper blue of the Ægean and its sprinkling\r\nof brown islands. Glaucon looked eastward and strove to forget Attica.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nTwo hours later all Athens seemed reading this placard in the Agora:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  NOTICE\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the arrest of GLAUCON, SON OF CONON, charged with high\r\n    treason, I will pay one talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     DEXILEUS, Chairman of the Eleven.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther such placards were posted in Peiræus, in Eleusis, in Marathon, in\r\nevery Attic village. Men could talk of nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MARDONIUS THE PERSIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOff Andros the northern gale smote them. The ship had driven helplessly.\r\n\r\nOff Tenos only the skill of Brasidas kept the _Solon_ clear of the rocky\r\nshores.\r\n\r\nAs they raced past holy Delos the frightened passengers had vowed twelve\r\noxen to Apollo if he saved them.\r\n\r\nNear Naxos, Brasidas, after vainly trying to make a friendly haven, bade\r\nhis sailors undergird the ship with heavy cables, for the timbers seemed\r\nstarting. Finally he suffered his craft to drive,—hoping at least to find\r\nsome islet with a sandy shore where he could beach her with safety.\r\n\r\nThe _Solon_, however, was near her doom. She was built on the Samian\r\nmodel, broad, flat, high in poop, low in prow,—excellent for cargo, but\r\nnone too seaworthy. The foresail blew in tatters. The closely brailed\r\nmainsail shook the weakened mast. The sailors had dropped their quaint\r\noaths, and began to pray—sure proof of danger. The dozen passengers seemed\r\nalmost too panic-stricken to aid in flinging the cargo overboard. Several\r\nwere raving.\r\n\r\n“Hearken, Poseidon of Calauria,” howled a Peiræus merchant against the\r\nscreeching blasts, “save from this peril and I vow thee and thy temple two\r\nmixing bowls of purest gold!”\r\n\r\n“A great vow,” suggested a calmer comrade. “All your fortune can hardly\r\npay it.”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” spoke the other, in undertone, “don’t let the god overhear me; let\r\nme get safe to Mother Earth and Poseidon has not one obol. His power is\r\nonly over the sea.”\r\n\r\nA creaking from the mainmast told that it might fall at any moment.\r\nPassengers and crew redoubled their shouts to Poseidon and to Zeus of\r\nÆgina. A fat passenger staggered from his cabin, a huge money-bag bound to\r\nhis belt,—as if gold were the safest spar to cling to in that boiling\r\ndeep. Others, less frantic, gave commissions one to another, in case one\r\nperished and another escaped.\r\n\r\n“You alone have no messages, pray no prayers, show no fear!” spoke a\r\ngrave, elderly man to Glaucon, as both clutched the swaying bulwark.\r\n\r\n“And wherefore?” came the bitter answer; “what is left me to fear? I\r\ndesire no life hereafter. There can be no consciousness without sad\r\nmemory.”\r\n\r\n“You are very young to speak thus.”\r\n\r\n“But not too young to have suffered.”\r\n\r\nA wave dashed one of the steering rudders out of the grip of the sailor\r\nguiding it. The rush of water swept him overboard. The _Solon_ lurched.\r\nThe wind smote the straining mainsail, and the shivered mainmast tore from\r\nits stays and socket. Above the bawling of wind and water sounded the\r\ncrash. The ship, with only a small sail upon the poop, blew about into the\r\ntrough of the sea. A mountain of green water thundered over the prow,\r\nbearing away men and wreckage. The “governor,” Brasidas’s mate, flung away\r\nthe last steering tiller.\r\n\r\n“The _Solon_ is dying, men,” he trumpeted through his hands. “To the boat!\r\nSave who can!”\r\n\r\nThe pinnace set in the waist was cleared away by frantic hands and axes.\r\nOminous rumblings from the hold told how the undergirding could not keep\r\nback the water. The pinnace was dragged to the ship’s lee and launched in\r\nthe comparative calm of the _Solon’s_ broadside. Pitifully small was the\r\nboat for five and twenty. The sailors, desperate and selfish, leaped in\r\nfirst, and watched with jealous eyes the struggles of the passengers to\r\nfollow. The noisy merchant slipped in the leap, and they heard him scream\r\nonce as the wave swallowed him. Brasidas stood in the bow of the pinnace,\r\nclutching a sword to cut the last rope. The boat filled to the gunwales.\r\nThe spray dashed into her. The sailors bailed with their caps. Another\r\npassenger leaped across, whereat the men yelled and drew their dirks.\r\n\r\n“Three are left. Room for one more. The rest must swim!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon stood on the poop. Was life still such a precious thing to some\r\nthat they must clutch for it so desperately? He had even a painful\r\namusement in watching the others. Of himself he thought little save to\r\nhope that under the boiling sea was rest and no return of memory. Then\r\nBrasidas called him.\r\n\r\n“Quick! The others are Barbarians and you a Hellene. Your chance—leap!”\r\n\r\nHe did not stir. The “others”—two strangers in Oriental dress—were\r\nstriving to enter the pinnace. The seamen thrust their dirks out to force\r\nthem back.\r\n\r\n“Full enough!” bawled the “governor.” “That fellow on the poop is mad. Cut\r\nthe rope, or we are caught in the swirl.”\r\n\r\nThe elder Barbarian lifted his companion as if to fling him into the boat,\r\nbut Brasidas’s sword cut the one cable. The wave flung the _Solon_ and the\r\npinnace asunder. With stolid resignation the Orientals retreated to the\r\npoop. The people in the pinnace rowed desperately to keep her out of the\r\ndeadly trough of the billows, but Glaucon stood erect on the drifting\r\nwreck and his voice rang through the tumult of the sea.\r\n\r\n“Tell them in Athens, and tell Hermione my wife, that Glaucon the\r\nAlcmæonid went down into the deep declaring his innocence and denouncing\r\nthe vengeance of Athena on whosoever foully destroyed him!—”\r\n\r\nBrasidas waved his sword in last farewell. Glaucon turned back to the\r\nwreck. The _Solon_ had settled lower. Every wave washed across the waist.\r\nNothing seemed to meet his gaze save the leaden sky, the leaden green\r\nwater, the foam of the bounding storm-crests. He told himself the gods\r\nwere good. Drowning was more merciful death than hemlock. Pelagos, the\r\nuntainted sea, was a softer grave than the Barathrum. The memory of the\r\nfearful hour at Colonus, the vision of the face of Hermione, of all things\r\nelse that he would fain forget—all these would pass. For what came after\r\nhe cared nothing.\r\n\r\nSo for some moments he stood, clinging upon the poop, awaiting the end.\r\nBut the end came slowly. The _Solon_ was a stoutly timbered ship. Much of\r\nher lading had been cast overboard, but more remained and gave buoyancy to\r\nthe wreckage. And as the Athenian awaited, almost impatiently, the final\r\ndisaster, something called his eye away from the heaving sky-line. Human\r\nlife was still about him. Wedged in a refuge, betwixt two capstans, the\r\nOrientals were sitting, awaiting doom like himself. But wonder of\r\nwonders,—he had not relaxed his hold on life too much to marvel,—the\r\nyounger Barbarian was beyond all doubt a woman. She sat in her companion’s\r\nlap, lifting her white face to his, and Glaucon knew she was of wondrous\r\nbeauty. They were talking together in some Eastern speech. Their arms were\r\nclosely twined. It was plain they were passing the last love messages\r\nbefore entering the great mystery together. Of Glaucon they took no heed.\r\nAnd he at first was almost angered that strangers should intrude upon this\r\nlast hour of life. But as he looked, as he saw the beauty of the woman,\r\nthe sheen of her golden hair, the interchange of love by touch and\r\nword,—there came across his own spirit a most unlooked-for change.\r\nSuddenly the white-capped billows seemed pitiless and chill. The warm joy\r\nof life returned. Again memory surged back, but without its former pang.\r\nHe saw again the vision of Athens, of Colonus, of Eleusis-by-the-Sea. He\r\nsaw Hermione running through the throng to meet him the day he returned\r\nfrom the Isthmia. He heard the sweet wind singing over the old olives\r\nbeside the cool Cephissus. Must these all pass forever? forever? Were\r\nlife, friends, love, the light of the sun, eternally lost, and nothing\r\nleft save the endless sleep in the unsunned caves of Oceanus? With one\r\nsurge the desire to live, to bear hard things, to conquer them, returned.\r\nHe dashed the water from his eyes. What he did next was more by instinct\r\nthan by reason. He staggered across the reeling deck, approached the\r\nBarbarians, and seized the man by the arm.\r\n\r\n“Would you live and not die? Up, then,—there is still a chance.”\r\n\r\nThe man gazed up blankly.\r\n\r\n“We are in Mazda’s hands,” he answered in foreign accent. “It is\r\nmanifestly his will that we should pass now the Chinvat bridge. We are\r\nhelpless. Where is the pinnace?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon dragged him roughly to his feet.\r\n\r\n“I do not know your gods. Do not speak of their will to destroy us till\r\nthe destruction falls. Do you love this woman?”\r\n\r\n“Save her, let me twice perish.”\r\n\r\n“Rouse yourself, then. One hope is left!”\r\n\r\n“What hope?”\r\n\r\n“A raft. We can cast a spar overboard. It will float us. You look\r\nstrong,—aid me.”\r\n\r\nThe man rose and, thoroughly aroused, seconded the Athenian intelligently\r\nand promptly. The lurches of the merchantman told how close she was to her\r\nend. One of the seamen’s axes lay on the poop. Glaucon seized it. The\r\nforemast was gone and the mainmast, but the small boat-mast still stood,\r\nthough its sail had blown to a thousand flapping streamers. Glaucon laid\r\nhis axe at the foot of the spar. Two fierce strokes weakened so that the\r\nnext lurch sent it crashing overboard. It swung in the mælstrom by its\r\nstays and the halyards of the sail. Tossing to and fro like a bubble, it\r\nwas a fearful hope, but a louder rumbling from the hold warned how other\r\nhope had fled. The Barbarian recoiled as he looked on it.\r\n\r\n“It can never float through this storm,” Glaucon heard him crying between\r\nthe blasts, but the Athenian beckoned him onward.\r\n\r\n“Leap!” commanded Glaucon; “spring as the mast rises on the next wave.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot forsake her,” called back the man, pointing to the woman, who\r\nlay with flying hair between the capstans, helpless and piteous now that\r\nher lover was no longer near.\r\n\r\n“I will provide for her. Leap!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon lifted the woman in his arms. He took a manner of pride in showing\r\nthe Barbarian his skill. The man looked at him once, saw he could be\r\ntrusted, and took the leap. He landed in the water, but caught the\r\nsail-cloth drifting from the mast, climbed beside it, and sat astride. The\r\nAthenian sprang at the next favoring wave. His burden made the task hard,\r\nbut his stadium training never stood in better stead. The cold water\r\nclosed around him. The wave dragged down in its black abyss, but he struck\r\nboldly upward, was beside the friendly spar, and the Barbarian aided him\r\nto mount beside him, then cut the lashings to the _Solon_ with the dagger\r\nthat still dangled at his belt. The billows swept them away just as the\r\nwreck reared wildly, and bow foremost plunged into the deep. They bound\r\nthe woman—she was hardly conscious now—into the little shelter formed by\r\nthe junction of the broken sail-yard and the mast. The two men sat beside\r\nher, shielding her with their bodies from the beat of the spray. Speech\r\nwas all but impossible. They were fain to close their eyes and pray to be\r\ndelivered from the unceasing screaming of the wind, the howling of the\r\nwaters. And so for hours....\r\n\r\nGlaucon never knew how long they thus drifted. The _Solon_ had been\r\nsmitten very early in the morning. She had foundered perhaps at noon. It\r\nmay have been shortly before sunset—though Helios never pierced the clouds\r\nthat storm-racked day—when Glaucon knew that the Barbarian was speaking to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Look!” The wind had lulled a little; the man could make himself heard.\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\nThrough the masses of gray spray and driving mist Glaucon gazed when the\r\nnext long wave tossed them. A glimpse,—but the joys of Olympus seemed\r\ngiven with that sight; wind-swept, wave-beaten, rock-bound, that half-seen\r\nridge of brown was land,—and land meant life, the life he had longed to\r\nfling away in the morning, the life he longed to keep that night. He\r\nshouted the discovery to his companion, who bowed his head, manifestly in\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nThe wind bore them rapidly. Glaucon, who knew the isles of the Ægean as\r\nbecame a Hellene, was certain they drove on Astypalæa, an isle subject to\r\nPersia, though one of the outermost Cyclades. The woman was in no state to\r\nrealize their crisis. Only a hand laid on her bosom told that her heart\r\nstill fluttered. She could not endure the surge and the suffocating spray\r\nmuch longer. The two men sat in silence, but their eyes went out hungrily\r\ntoward the stretch of brown as it lifted above the wave crests. The last\r\nmoments of the desperate voyage crept by like the pangs of Tantalus.\r\nSlowly they saw unfolding the fog-clothed mountains, a forest, scattered\r\nbits of white they knew were stuccoed houses; but while their eyes brought\r\njoy, their ears brought sadness. The booming of the surf upon an outlying\r\nledge grew ever clearer. Almost ere they knew it the drifting mast was\r\nstayed with a shock. They saw two rocks swathed in dripping weed that\r\ncrusted with knife-like barnacles, thrust their black heads out of the\r\nboiling water. And beyond—fifty paces away—the breakers raced up the sandy\r\nshore where waited refuge.\r\n\r\nThe spar wedged fast in the rocks. The waves beat over it pitilessly. He\r\nwho stayed by it long had better have sunk with the _Solon_,—his would\r\nhave been an easier death. Glaucon laid his mouth to the man’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Swim through the surf. I will bear the woman safely.”\r\n\r\n“Save her, and be you blessed forever. I die happy. I cannot swim.”\r\n\r\nThe moment was too terrible for Glaucon to feel amazed at this confession.\r\nTo a Hellene swimming was second nature. He thought and spoke quickly.\r\n\r\n“Climb on the higher rock. The wave does not cover it entirely. Dig your\r\ntoes in the crevices. Cling to the seaweed. I will return for you.”\r\n\r\nHe never heard what the other cried back to him. He tore the woman clear\r\nof her lashings, threw his left arm about her, and fought his way through\r\nthe surf. He could swim like a Delian, the best swimmers in Hellas; but\r\nthe task was mighty even for the athlete. Twice the deadly undertow almost\r\ndragged him downward. Then the soft sand was oozing round his feet. He\r\nknew a knot of fisher folk were running to the beach, a dozen hands took\r\nhis fainting burden from him. One instant he stood with the water rushing\r\nabout his ankles, gasped and drew long breaths, then turned his face\r\ntoward the sea.\r\n\r\n“Are you crazed?” he heard voices clamouring—they seemed a great way\r\noff,—“a miracle that you lived through the surf once! Leave the other to\r\nfate. Phorcys has doomed him already.”\r\n\r\nBut Glaucon was past acting by reason now. His head seemed a ball of fire.\r\nOnly his hands and feet responded mechanically to the dim impulse of his\r\nbewildered brain. Once more the battling through the surf, this time\r\nagainst it and threefold harder. Only the man whose strength had borne the\r\ngiant Spartan down could have breasted the billows that came leaping to\r\ndestroy him. He felt his powers were strained to the last notch. A little\r\nmore and he knew he might roll helpless, but even so he struggled onward.\r\nOnce again the two black rocks were springing out of the swollen water. He\r\nsaw the Barbarian clinging desperately to the higher. Why was he risking\r\nhis life for a man who was not a Hellene, who might be even a servant of\r\nthe dreaded Xerxes? A strange moment for such questionings, and no time to\r\nanswer! He clung to the seaweed beside the Barbarian for an instant, then\r\nthrough the gale cried to the other to place his hands upon his shoulders.\r\nThe Oriental complied intelligently. For a third time Glaucon struggled\r\nacross the raging flood. The passage seemed endless, and every receding\r\nbreaker dragging down to the graves of Oceanus. The Athenian knew his\r\npower was failing, and doled it out as a miser, counting his strokes,\r\ntaking deep gulps of air between each wave. Then, even while consciousness\r\nand strength seemed passing together, again beneath his feet were the\r\nshifting sands, again the voices encouraging, the hands outstretched,\r\nstrange forms running down into the surf, strange faces all around him.\r\nThey were bearing him and the Barbarian high upon the beach. They laid him\r\non the hard, wet sand—never a bed more welcome. He was naked. His feet and\r\nhands bled from the tearing of stones and barnacles. His head was in fever\r\nglow. Dimly he knew the Barbarian was approaching him.\r\n\r\n“Hellene, you have saved us. What is your name?”\r\n\r\nThe other barely raised his head. “In Athens, Glaucon the Alcmæonid, but\r\nnow I am without name, without country.”\r\n\r\nThe Oriental answered by kneeling on the sands and touching his head upon\r\nthem close to Glaucon’s feet.\r\n\r\n“Henceforth, O Deliverer, you shall be neither nameless nor outcast. For\r\nyou have saved me and her I love more than self. You have saved\r\nArtazostra, sister of Xerxes, and Mardonius, son of Gobryas, who is not\r\nthe least of the Princes of Persia and Eran.”\r\n\r\n“Mardonius—arch foe of Hellas!” Glaucon spoke the words in horror. Then\r\nreaction from all he had undergone robbed him of sense. They carried him\r\nto the fisher-village. That night he burned with fever and raved wildly.\r\nIt was many days before he knew anything again.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nSix days later a Byzantine corn-ship brought from Amorgos to Peiræus two\r\nsurvivors of the _Solon_,—the only ones to escape the swamping of the\r\npinnace. Their story cleared up the mystery of the fate of “Glaucon the\r\nTraitor.” “The gods,” said every Agora wiseacre, “had rewarded the villain\r\nwith their own hands.” The Babylonish carpet-seller and Hiram had\r\nvanished, despite all search, but everybody praised Democrates for saving\r\nthe state from a fearful peril. As for Hermione, her father took her to\r\nEleusis that she might be free from the hoots of the people. Themistocles\r\nwent about his business very sorrowful. Cimon lost half his gayety.\r\nDemocrates, too, appeared terribly worn. “How he loved his friend!” said\r\nevery admirer. Beyond doubt for long Democrates was exceeding thoughtful.\r\nPerhaps a reason for this was that about a month after the going of\r\nGlaucon he learned from Sicinnus that Prince Mardonius was at length in\r\nSardis,—and possibly Democrates knew on what vessel the carpet-seller had\r\ntaken flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE COMING OF THE PERSIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE LOTUS-EATING AT SARDIS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Glaucon awoke to consciousness, it was with a sense of absolute\r\nweakness, at the same moment with a sense of absolute rest. He knew that\r\nhe was lying on pillows “softer than sleep,” that the air he breathed was\r\nladen with perfume, that the golden light which came through his\r\nhalf-closed eyelids was deliciously tempered, that his ears caught a\r\nmusical murmur, as of a plashing fountain. So he lay for long, too\r\nimpotent, too contented to ask where he lay, or whence he had departed.\r\nAthens, Hermione, all the thousand and one things of his old life, flitted\r\nthrough his brain, but only as vague, far shapes. He was too weak even to\r\nlong for them. Still the fountain plashed on, and mingling with the\r\ntinkling he thought he heard low flutes breathing. Perhaps it was only a\r\nphantasy of his flagging brain. Then his eyes opened wider. He lifted his\r\nhand. It was a task even to do that little thing,—he was so weak. He\r\nlooked at the hand! Surely his own, yet how white it was, how thin; the\r\nbones were there, the blue veins, but all the strength gone out of them.\r\nWas this the hand that had flung great Lycon down? It would be mere sport\r\nfor a child to master him now. He touched his face. It was covered with a\r\nthick beard, as of a long month’s growth. The discovery startled him. He\r\nstrove to rise on one elbow. Too weak! He sank back upon the cushions and\r\nlet his eyes rove inquiringly. Never had he seen tapestries the like of\r\nthose that canopied his bed. Scarlet and purple and embroidered in gold\r\nthread with elaborate hunting scenes,—the dogs, the chariots, the slaying\r\nof the deer, the bearing home of the game. He knew the choicest looms of\r\nSidon must have wrought them. And the linen, so cool, so grateful,\r\nunderneath his head—was it not the almost priceless fabric of Borsippa? He\r\nstirred a little, his eyes rested on the floor. It was covered with a rug\r\nworth an Athenian patrician’s ransom,—a lustrous, variegated sheen,\r\nshowing a new tint at each change of the light. So much he saw from the\r\nbed, and curiosity was wakened. Again he put forth his hand, and touched\r\nthe hanging curtains. The movement set a score of little silver bells that\r\ndangled over the canopy to jingling. As at a signal the flutes grew\r\nlouder, mingling with them was the clearer note of lyres. Now the strains\r\nswelled sweetly, now faded away into dreamy sighing, as if bidding the\r\nlistener to sink again into the arms of sleep. Another vain effort to rise\r\non his elbow. Again he was helpless. Giving way to the charm of the music,\r\nhe closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Either I am awaking in Elysium, or the gods send to me pleasant dreams\r\nbefore I die.”\r\n\r\nHe was feebly wondering which was the alternative when a new sound roused\r\nhim, the sweep and rustle of the dresses of two women as they approached\r\nthe bed. He gazed forth listlessly, when lo! above his couch stood two\r\nstrangers,—strangers, but either as fair as Aphrodite arising from the\r\nsea. Both were tall, and full of queenly grace, both were dressed in gauzy\r\nwhite, but the hair of the one was of such gold that Glaucon hardly saw\r\nthe circlet which pressed over it. Her eyes were blue, the lustre of her\r\nface was like a white rose. The other’s hair shone like the wing of a\r\nraven. A wreath of red poppies covered it, but over the softly tinted\r\nforehead there peered forth a golden snake with emerald eyes—the Egyptian\r\nuræus, the crown of a princess from the Nile. Her eyes were as black as\r\nthe other’s were blue, her lips as red as the dye of Tyre, her hands—But\r\nbefore Glaucon looked and wondered more, the first, she of the golden\r\nhead, laid her hand upon his face,—a warm, comforting hand that seemed to\r\nspeed back strength and gladness with the touch. Then she spoke. Her Greek\r\nwas very broken, yet he understood her.\r\n\r\n“Are you quite awakened, dear Glaucon?”\r\n\r\nHe looked up marvelling, not knowing how to answer; but the golden goddess\r\nseemed to expect none from him.\r\n\r\n“It is now a month since we brought you from Astypalæa. You have wandered\r\nclose to the Portals of the Dead. We feared you were beloved by Mazda too\r\nwell, that you would never wake that we might bless you. Night and day\r\nhave my husband and I prayed to Mithra the Merciful and Hauratât the\r\nHealth-Giver in your behalf; each sunrise, at our command, the Magians\r\nhave poured out for you the Haôma, the sacred juice dear to the Beautiful\r\nImmortals, and Amenhat, wisest of the physicians of Memphis, has stood by\r\nyour bedside without rest. Now at last our prayers and his skill have\r\nconquered; you awake to life and gladness.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon lay wondering, not knowing how to reply, and only understanding in\r\nhalf, when the dark-haired goddess spoke, in purer Greek than her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“And I, O Glaucon of Athens, would have you suffer me to kiss your feet.\r\nFor you have given my brother and my sister back to life.” Then drawing\r\nnear she took his hand in hers, while the two smiling looked down on him.\r\n\r\nThen at last he found tongue to speak. “O gracious Queens, for such you\r\nare, forgive my roving wits. You speak of great service done. But wise\r\nZeus knoweth we are strangers—”\r\n\r\nThe golden goddess tossed her shining head and smiled,—still stroking with\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n“Dear Glaucon, do you remember the Eastern lad you saved from the Spartans\r\nat the Isthmus? Behold him! Recall the bracelet of turquoise,—my first\r\ngratitude. Then again you saved me with my husband. For I am the woman you\r\nbore through the surf at the island. I am Artazostra, wife of Mardonius,\r\nand this is Roxana, his half-sister, whose mother was a princess in\r\nEgypt.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon passed his fingers before his face, beckoning back the past.\r\n\r\n“It is all far away and strange: the flight, the storm, the wreck, the\r\ntossing spar, the battling through the surges. My head is weak. I cannot\r\npicture it all.”\r\n\r\n“Do not try. Lie still. Grow strong and glad, and suffer us to teach you,”\r\ncommanded Artazostra.\r\n\r\n“Where do I lie? We are not upon the rocky islet still?”\r\n\r\nThe ladies laughed, not mockingly but so sweetly he wished that they would\r\nnever cease.\r\n\r\n“This is Sardis,” spoke Roxana, bending over him; “you lie in the palace\r\nof the satrap.”\r\n\r\n“And Athens—” he said, wandering.\r\n\r\n“Is far away,” said Artazostra, “with all its griefs and false friends and\r\nfoul remembrances. The friends about you here will never fail. Therefore\r\nlie still and have peace.”\r\n\r\n“You know my story,” cried he, now truly in amaze.\r\n\r\n“Mardonius knows all that passes in Athens, in Sparta, in every city of\r\nHellas. Do not try to tell more. We weary you already. See—Amenhat comes\r\nto bid us begone.”\r\n\r\nThe curtains parted again. A dark man in a pure white robe, his face and\r\nhead smooth-shaven, approached the bed. He held out a broad gold cup, the\r\nrim whereof glinted with agate and sardonyx. He had no Greek, but Roxana\r\ntook the cup from him and held it to Glaucon’s lips.\r\n\r\n“Drink,” she commanded, and he was fain to obey. The Athenian felt the\r\nheavily spiced liquor laying hold of him. His eyes closed, despite his\r\nwish to gaze longer on the two beautiful women. He felt their hands\r\ncaressing his cheeks. The music grew ever softer. He thought he was\r\nsinking into a kind of euthanasy, that his life was drifting out amid\r\ndelightful dreams. But not cold Thanatos, but health-bearing Hypnos was\r\nthe god who visited him now. When next he woke, it was with a clearer\r\nvision, a sounder mind.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nSardis the Golden, once capital of the Lydian kings and now of the Persian\r\nsatraps, had recovered from the devastation by the Ionians in their\r\nill-starred revolt seventeen years preceding. The city spread in the\r\nfertile Sardiene, one of the garden plains of Asia Minor. To the south the\r\ncloud-crowned heights of Tmolus ever were visible. To the north flowed the\r\nnoble stream of Hebrus, whilst high above the wealthy town, the busy\r\nagora, the giant temple of Lydian Cybele, rose the citadel of Meles, the\r\npalace fortress of the kings and the satraps. A frowning castle it was\r\nwithout, within not the golden-tiled palaces of Ecbatana and Susa boasted\r\ngreater magnificence and luxury than this one-time dwelling of Crœsus. The\r\nceilings of the wide banqueting halls rose on pillars of emerald Egyptian\r\nmalachite. The walls were cased with onyx. Winged bulls that might have\r\ngraced Nineveh guarded the portals. The lions upbearing the throne in the\r\nhall of audience were of gold. The mirrors in the “House of the Women”\r\nwere not steel but silver. The gorgeous carpets were sprinkled with rose\r\nwater. An army of dark Syrian eunuchs and yellow-faced Tartar girls ran at\r\nthe beck of the palace guests. Only the stealthy entrance of Sickness and\r\nDeath told the dwellers here they were not yet gods.\r\n\r\nArtaphernes, satrap of Lydia, had his divan, his viziers, and his\r\naudiences,—a court worthy of a king,—but the real lord of Western Asia was\r\nthe prince who was nominally his guest. Mardonius had his own retinue and\r\nwing of the palace. On him fell the enormous task of organizing the masses\r\nof troops already pouring into Sardis, and he discharged his duty\r\nunwearyingly. The completion of the bridges of boats across the\r\nHellespont, the assembling of the fleet, the collecting of provisions,\r\nfell to his province. Daily a courier pricked into Sardis with despatches\r\nfrom the Great King to his trusted general. Mardonius left the great\r\nlevees and public spectacles to Artaphernes, but his hand was everywhere.\r\nHis decisions were prompt. He was in constant communication with the\r\nMedizing party in Hellas. He had no time for the long dicing and drinking\r\nbouts the Persians loved, but he never failed to find each day an hour to\r\nspend with Artazostra his wife, with Roxana his half-sister, and with\r\nGlaucon his preserver.\r\n\r\nSlowly through the winter health had returned to the Athenian. For days he\r\nhad lain dreaming away the hours to the tune of the flutes and the\r\nfountains. When the warm spring came, the eunuchs carried him in a\r\nsedan-chair through the palace garden, whence he could look forth on the\r\nplain, the city, the snow-clad hills, and think he was on Zeus’s Olympian\r\nthrone, surveying all the earth. Then it was he learned the Persian\r\nspeech, and easily, for were not his teachers Artazostra and Roxana? He\r\nfound it no difficult tongue, simple and much akin to Greek, and unlike\r\nmost of the uncouth tongues the Oriental traders chattered in Sardis. The\r\ntwo women were constantly with him. Few men were admitted to a Persian\r\nharem, but Mardonius never grudged the Greek the company of these twain.\r\n\r\n“Noble Athenian,” said the Prince, the first time he visited Glaucon’s\r\nbed, “you are my brother. My house is yours. My friends are yours. Command\r\nus all.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nEvery day Glaucon was stronger. He tested himself with dumb-bells. Always\r\nhe could lift a heavier weight. When the summer was at hand, he could ride\r\nout with Mardonius to the “Paradise,” the satrap’s hunting park, and be in\r\nat the death of the deer. Yet he was no more the “Fortunate Youth” of\r\nAthens. Only imperfectly he himself knew how complete was the severance\r\nfrom his old life. The terrible hour at Colonus had made a mark on his\r\nspirit which not all Zeus’s power could take away. No doubt all the\r\none-time friends believed him dead. Had Hermione’s confidence in him\r\nremained true? Would she not say “guilty” at last with all the rest?\r\nMardonius might have answered, he had constant letters from Greece, but\r\nthe Prince was dumb when Glaucon strove to ask of things beyond the Ægean.\r\n\r\nDay by day the subtle influence of the Orient—the lotus-eating,—“tasting\r\nthe honey-sweet fruit which makes men choose to abide forever, forgetful\r\nof the homeward way”—spread its unseen power over the Alcmæonid. Athens,\r\nthe old pain, even the face of Hermione, would rise before him only dimly.\r\nHe fought against this enchantment. But it was easier to renew his vow to\r\nreturn to Athens, after wiping out his shame, than to break these bands\r\ndaily tightening.\r\n\r\nHe heard little Greek, now that he was learning Persian. Even he himself\r\nwas changed. His hair and beard grew long, after the Persian manner. He\r\nwore the loose Median cloak, the tall felt cap of a Persian noble. The\r\nelaborate genuflexions of the Asiatics no longer astonished him. He\r\nlearned to admire the valiant, magnanimous lords of the Persians. And\r\nXerxes, the distant king, the wielder of all this power, was he not truly\r\na god on earth, vicegerent of Lord Zeus himself?\r\n\r\n“Forget you are a Hellene. We will talk of the Nile, not of the\r\nCephissus,” Artazostra said, whenever he spoke of home. Then she would\r\ntell of Babylon and Persepolis, and Mardonius of forays beside the wide\r\nCaspian, and Roxana of her girlhood, while Gobryas was satrap of Egypt,\r\nspent beside the magic river, of the Pharaohs, the great pyramid, of Isis\r\nand Osiris and the world beyond the dead. Before the Athenian was opened\r\nthe golden East, its glitter, its wonderment, its fascination. He even was\r\nsilent when his hosts talked boldly of the coming war, how soon the\r\nPersian power would rule from the Pillars of Heracles to Ind.\r\n\r\nYet once he stood at bay, showing that he was a Hellene still. They were\r\nin the garden. Mardonius had come to them where under the pomegranate tree\r\nthe women spread their green tapestry which their nimble needles covered\r\nwith a battle scene in scarlet. The Prince told of the capture and\r\ncrucifixion of the chiefs of a futile revolt in Armenia. Then Artazostra\r\nclapped her hands to cry.\r\n\r\n“Fools! Fools whom Angra-Mainyu the Evil smites blind that he may destroy\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon, sitting at her feet, looked up quickly. “Valiant fools, lady;\r\nevery man must strike for his own country.”\r\n\r\nArtazostra shook her shining head.\r\n\r\n“Mazda gives victory to the king of Eran alone. Resisting Xerxes is not\r\nrebellion against man, it is rebellion against Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” asked the Athenian, his eye lighting ominously. “Are yours\r\nthe greatest gods?”\r\n\r\nBut Roxana in turn cast down the tapestry and opened her arms with a\r\ncharming gesture.\r\n\r\n“Be not angry, Glaucon, for will you not become one with us? I dare to\r\nprophesy like a seer from old Chaldea. Assur of Nineveh, Marduk of\r\nBabylon, Baal of Tyre, Ammon of Memphis—all have bent the knee to Mazda\r\nthe Glorious, to Mithra the Fiend-Smiting, and shall the weak _dævas_, the\r\npuny gods of Greece, save their land, when greater than they bow down in\r\nsore defeat?”\r\n\r\nYet Glaucon still looked on her boldly.\r\n\r\n“You have your mighty gods, but we have ours. Pray to your Mazda and\r\nMithra, but we will still trust Zeus of the Thunders and Athena of the\r\nGray Eyes, the bulwarks of our fathers. And Fate must answer which can\r\nhelp the best.”\r\n\r\nThe Persians shook their heads. It was time to return to the palace. All\r\nthat Glaucon had seen of the Barbarian’s might, since awakening in Sardis,\r\ntold him Xerxes was indeed destined to go forth conquering and to conquer.\r\nThen the vision of the Acropolis, the temples, the Guardian Goddess,\r\nreturned. He banished all disloyal thoughts for the instant. The Prince\r\nwalked with his wife, Glaucon with Roxana. He had always thought her\r\nbeautiful; she had never seemed so beautiful as now. Did he imagine\r\nwhither Mardonius perhaps was leading him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE COMING OF XERXES THE GOD-KING\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the lotus-eating ended. Repeated messengers told how Xerxes was\r\nquitting Babylon, was holding a muster in Cappadocia, and now was crossing\r\nAsia Minor toward Sardis. Mardonius and his companions had returned to\r\nthat capital. Daily the soldiery poured into Sardis by tens of thousands.\r\nGlaucon knew now it was not a vain boast that for ten years the East had\r\nbeen arming against Hellas, that the whole power of the twenty satrapies\r\nwould be flung as one thunderbolt upon devoted Greece.\r\n\r\nIn the plain about Sardis a second city was rising, of wicker booths and\r\ngay pavilions. The host grew hourly. Now a band of ebony archers in\r\nleopard skins entered from far Ethiopia, now Bactrian battle-axemen, now\r\nyellow-faced Tartars from the northeast, now bright-turbaned Arabs upon\r\ntheir swaying camels,—Syrians, Cilicians, black-bearded Assyrians and\r\nBabylonians, thick-lipped Egyptians, came, and many a strange race more.\r\n\r\nBut the core of the army were the serried files of Aryan horse and\r\nfoot,—blond-headed, blue-eyed men, Persians and Medes, veterans of twenty\r\nvictories. Their muscles were tempered steel. Their unwearying feet had\r\ntramped many a long parasang. Some were light infantry with wicker shields\r\nand powerful bows, but as many more horsemen in gold-scaled armour and\r\nwith desert steeds that flew like Pegasus.\r\n\r\n“The finest cavalry in the world!” Mardonius vaunted, and his guest durst\r\nnot answer nay.\r\n\r\nSatrap after satrap came. When at last a foaming Arab galloping to the\r\ncastle proclaimed, “Next morn the Lord of the World will enter Sardis,”\r\nGlaucon could scarce have looked for a greater, though he had expected\r\nCronian Zeus himself.\r\n\r\nMardonius, as “bow-bearer to the king,” a semi-regal office, rode forth a\r\nstage to meet the sovran. The streets of Sardis were festooned with\r\nflowers. Thousands of spearmen held back the crowds. The Athenian stood\r\nbeside Roxana and Artazostra at the upper window of a Lydian merchant\r\nprince, and his eyes missed nothing.\r\n\r\nNever had the two women seemed lovelier than when their hearts ran out to\r\ntheir approaching king. He felt now the power of personal sovranty, how\r\nthese children of the East awaited not Xerxes the Master, but Xerxes the\r\nOmnipotent, God-Manifest, whose decrees were as the decrees of Heaven. And\r\ntheir awe could not fail to awe the Athenian.\r\n\r\nAt noon the multitude caught the first token of the king. Down the road,\r\nthrough the gate, walked a man, bare-headed, bare-footed,\r\nalone,—Artaphernes, despot of all Lydia, going to pay his abject homage.\r\nPresently the eunuch priests of Cybele, perched above the gate, clashed\r\ntheir cymbals and raised their hymn of welcome. To the boom of drums the\r\nthousand chosen cavalry and as many picked footmen of the Life Guard\r\nentered, tall, magnificent soldiers,—caps and spear butts shining with\r\ngold. After these a gilded car drawn by the eight sacred horses, each\r\nmilk-white, and on the car an altar bearing the eternal fire of Mazda.\r\nThen, each in his flashing chariot, moved the “Six Princes,” the heads of\r\nthe great clans of the Achæmenians, then two hundred led desert horses, in\r\nsplendid trappings, and then—after a long interval, that the host might\r\ncast no dust upon its lord, rode a single horseman on a jet-black steed,\r\nArtabanus—the king’s uncle and vizier. He beckoned to the people.\r\n\r\n“Have fear, Lydians, the giver of breath to all the world comes now\r\nbeneath your gates!”\r\n\r\nThe lines of soldiers flung down their spears and dropped upon their\r\nknees. The multitude imitated. A chariot came running behind four of the\r\nsacred steeds of Nisæa,—their coats were like new snow, their manes\r\nbraided with gold thread, bridle, bits, pole, baseboard, shone with gems\r\nand the royal metal. The wheel was like the sun. A girl-like youth guided\r\nthe crimson reins, a second held the tall green parasol. Its shadow did\r\nnot hide the commanding figure upon the car. Glaucon looked hard. No\r\nmistaking—Xerxes was here, the being who could say to millions “Die!” and\r\nthey perished like worms; in verity “God-Manifest.”\r\n\r\nFor in looks Xerxes, son of Darius, was surely the Great King. A figure of\r\naugust height was set off nobly by the flowing purple caftan and the\r\npurple cap which crowned the curling black hair. The riches of satrapies\r\nwere in the rubies and topazes on sword sheath and baldric. The head was\r\nraised. The face was not regular, but of a proud, aquiline beauty. The\r\nskin was olive, the eyes dark, a little pensive. If there were weak lines\r\nabout the mouth, the curling beard covered them. The king looked straight\r\non, unmoved by the kneeling thousands, but as he came abreast of the\r\nbalcony, chance made him look upward. Perhaps the sight of the beautiful\r\nGreek caused Xerxes to smile winsomely. The smile of a god can intoxicate.\r\nCaught away from himself, Glaucon the Alcmæonid joined in the great salvo\r\nof cheering.\r\n\r\n“Victory to Xerxes! Let the king of kings reign forever!”\r\n\r\nThe chariot was gone almost instantly, a vast retinue—cooks, eunuchs,\r\ngrooms, hunters, and many closed litters bearing the royal\r\nconcubines—followed, but all these passed before Glaucon shook off the\r\nspell the sight of royalty cast on him.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThat night in the palace Xerxes gave a feast in honour of the new\r\ncampaign. The splendours of a royal banquet in the East need no retelling.\r\nSilver lamps, carpets of Kerman rugs or of the petals of fresh roses, a\r\nthousand lutes and dulcimers, precious Helbon wine flowing like water,\r\ncups of Phœnician crystal, tables groaning with wild boars roasted whole,\r\ndancing women none too modest,—these were but the incidentals of a\r\ngorgeous confusion. To Glaucon, with the chaste loveliness of the\r\nPanathenæa before his mind, the scene was one of vast wonderment but\r\nscarcely of pleasure. The Persian did nothing by halves. In battle a hero,\r\nat his cups he became a satyr. Many of the scenes before the guests\r\nemptied the last of the tall silver tankards were indescribable.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOn the high dais above the roaring hall sat Xerxes the king,—adored,\r\nenvied, pitiable.\r\n\r\nWhen Spitames, the seneschal, brought him the cup, the bearer bowed his\r\nface, not daring to look on his dread lord’s eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen Artabanus, the vizier, approached with a message, he first kissed the\r\ncarpet below the dais.\r\n\r\nWhen Hydarnes, commander of the Life Guard, drew near to receive the\r\nwatchword for the night, he held his mantle before his mouth, lest his\r\nbreath pollute the world monarch.\r\n\r\nYet of all forms of seeming prosperity wherewith Fate can curse a man, the\r\nworst was the curse of Xerxes. To be called “god” when one is finite and\r\nmortal; to have no friends, but only a hundred million slaves; to be\r\ndenied the joys of honest wish and desire because there were none left\r\nunsatisfied; to have one’s hastiest word proclaimed as an edict of deity;\r\nnever to be suffered to confess a mistake, cost what the blunder might,\r\nthat the “king of kings” might seem lifted above all human error; in\r\nshort, to be the bondsman of one’s own deification,—this was the hard\r\ncaptivity of the lord of the twenty satrapies.\r\n\r\nFor Xerxes the king was a man,—of average instincts, capacities, goodness,\r\nwickedness. A god or a genius could have risen above his fearful\r\nisolation. Xerxes was neither. The iron ceremonial of the Persian court\r\nleft him of genuine pleasures almost none. Something novel, a rare\r\nsensation, an opportunity to vary the dreary monotony of splendour by an\r\nastounding act of generosity or an act of frightful cruelty,—it mattered\r\nlittle which,—was snatched at by the king with childlike eagerness. And\r\nthis night Xerxes was in an unwontedly gracious mood. At his elbow, as he\r\nsat on the throne cased with lapis lazuli and onyx, waited the one man who\r\ncame nearest to being a friend and not a slave,—Mardonius, son of Gobryas,\r\nthe bow-bearer,—and therefore more entitled than any other prince of the\r\nPersians to stand on terms of intimacy with his lord.\r\n\r\nWhile Spitames passed the wine, the king hearkened with condescending and\r\napproving nod to the report of the Prince as to his mad adventure in\r\nHellas. Xerxes even reproved his brother-in-law mildly for hazarding his\r\nown life and that of his wife among those stiff-necked tribesmen who were\r\nso soon to taste the Aryan might.\r\n\r\n“It was in your service, Omnipotence,” the Prince was rejoining blandly;\r\n“what if not I alone, but a thousand others of the noblest of the Persians\r\nand the Medes may perish, if only the glory of their king is advanced?”\r\n\r\n“Nobly said; you are a faithful slave, Mardonius. I will remember you when\r\nI have burned Athens.”\r\n\r\nHe even reached forth and stroked the bow-bearer’s hand, a condescension\r\nwhich made the footstool-bearer, parasol-bearer, quiver-bearer, and a\r\ndozen great lords more gnaw their lips with envy. Hydarnes, the commander\r\nwho had waited an auspicious moment, now thought it safe to kneel on the\r\nlowest step of the throne.\r\n\r\n“Omnipotence, I am constrained to tell you that certain miserable Hellenes\r\nhave been seized in the camp to-night—spies sent to pry out your power. Do\r\nyou deign to have them impaled, crucified, or cast into the adders’ cage?”\r\n\r\nThe king smiled magnanimously.\r\n\r\n“They shall not die. Show them the host, and all my power. Then send them\r\nhome to their fellow-rebels to tell the madness of dreaming to withstand\r\nmy might.”\r\n\r\nThe smile of Xerxes had spread, like the ripple from a pebble splashing in\r\na pool, over the face of every nobleman in hearing. Now their praises came\r\nas a chant.\r\n\r\n“O Ocean of Clemency and Wisdom! Happy Eran in thy sagacious yet merciful\r\nking!”\r\n\r\nXerxes, not heeding, turned to Mardonius.\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes,—you were telling how you corrupted one of the chief Athenians,\r\nthen had to flee. On the voyage you were shipwrecked?”\r\n\r\n“So I wrote to Babylon, to your Eternity.”\r\n\r\n“And a certain Athenian fugitive saved your lives? And you brought him to\r\nSardis?”\r\n\r\n“I did so, Omnipotence.”\r\n\r\n“Of course he is at the banquet.”\r\n\r\n“The king speaks by the promptings of Mazda. I placed him with certain\r\nfriends and bade them see he did not lack good cheer.”\r\n\r\n“Send,—I would talk with him.”\r\n\r\n“Suffer me to warn your Majesty,” ventured Mardonius, “he is an Athenian\r\nand glories in being of a stubborn, Persian-hating stock. I fear he will\r\nnot perform due obeisance to the Great King.”\r\n\r\n“I can endure his rudeness,” spoke Xerxes, for once in excellent humour;\r\n“let the ‘supreme usher’ bring him with full speed.”\r\n\r\nThe functionary thus commanded bowed himself to the ground and hastened on\r\nhis errand.\r\n\r\nBut well that Mardonius had deprecated the wrath of the monarch. Glaucon\r\ncame with his head high, his manner almost arrogant. The mere fact that\r\nhis boldness might cost him his life made him less bending than ever. He\r\ntrod firmly upon the particular square of golden carpet at the foot of the\r\ndais which none, saving the king, the vizier, and the “Six Princes,” could\r\nlawfully tread. He held his hands at his sides, firmly refusing to conceal\r\nthem in his cloak, as court etiquette demanded. As he stood on the steps\r\nof the throne, he gave the glittering monarch the same familiar bow he\r\nmight have awarded a friend he met in the Agora. Mardonius was troubled.\r\nThe supreme usher was horrified. The master-of-punishments, ever near his\r\nchief, gazed eagerly to see if Xerxes would not touch the audacious\r\nHellene’s girdle—a sign for prompt decapitation. Only the good nature of\r\nthe king prevented a catastrophe, and Xerxes was moved by two motives,\r\npleasure at meeting a fellow-mortal who could look him in the eye without\r\nservility or fear, delight at the beautiful features and figure of the\r\nAthenian. For an instant monarch and fugitive looked face to face, then\r\nXerxes stretched out, not his hand, but the gold tip of his ivory baton.\r\nGlaucon had wisdom enough to touch it,—a token that he was admitted to\r\naudience with the king.\r\n\r\n“You are from Athens, beautiful Hellene,” spoke Xerxes, still admiring the\r\nstranger. “I will question you. Let Mardonius interpret.”\r\n\r\n“I have learned Persian, great sir,” interposed Glaucon, never waiting for\r\nthe bow-bearer.\r\n\r\n“You have done well,” rejoined the smiling monarch; “yet better had you\r\nlearned our Aryan manners of courtliness. No matter—you will learn them\r\nlikewise in good time. Now tell me your name and parentage.”\r\n\r\n“I am Glaucon, son of Conon, of the house of the Alcmæonidæ.”\r\n\r\n“Great nobles, Omnipotence,” interposed Mardonius, “so far as nobility can\r\nbe reckoned among the Greeks.”\r\n\r\n“I have yet to learn their genealogies,” remarked Xerxes, dryly; then he\r\nturned back to Glaucon. “And do your parents yet live, and have you any\r\nbrethren?” The question was a natural one for an Oriental. Glaucon’s\r\nanswer came with increased pride.\r\n\r\n“I am a child of my parent’s old age. My mother is dead. My father is\r\nfeeble. I have no brethren. Two older brothers I had. One fell here at\r\nSardis, when we Athenians sacked the city. One fell victorious at\r\nMarathon, while he burned a Persian ship. Therefore I am not ashamed of\r\ntheir fates.”\r\n\r\n“Your tongue is bold, Hellene,” said the good-natured king; “you are but a\r\nlame courtier. No matter. Tell me, nevertheless, why you churlishly refuse\r\nto do me reverence. Do you set yourself above all these princes of the\r\nPersians who bow before me?”\r\n\r\n“Not so, great sir. But I was born at Athens, not at Susa. We Hellenes\r\npray standing even to Zeus, stretching forth our hands and looking upward.\r\nCan I honour the lord of all the satrapies above the highest god?”\r\n\r\n“A nimble tongue you have, Athenian, though an unbending neck.” Xerxes sat\r\nand stroked his beard, pleased at the frank reply. “Mardonius has told how\r\nyou saved his and my sister’s lives, and that you are an outlaw from\r\nAthens.”\r\n\r\n“The last is all too true, great sir.”\r\n\r\n“Which means you will not pray your gods too hard for my defeat? ha?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon blushed, then looked up boldly.\r\n\r\n“A Persian king, I know, loves truth-telling. I still love and pray for\r\nAthens, even if unknown enemies conspired against me.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! You can learn our other virtues later. Are you blind to my power?\r\nIf so, I pity more than I blame you.”\r\n\r\n“The king is kind,” returned Glaucon, putting by a part of his hauteur. “I\r\nwould not anger him. I only know he would rather have men say, ‘Xerxes\r\nconquered a proud nation, hard to subdue,’ than, ‘He conquered a feeble\r\nrace of whining slaves.’ ”\r\n\r\n“Excellent! In all save your vain confidence of victory, you seem wise\r\nbeyond your youth. You are handsome. You are noble—”\r\n\r\n“Very noble,” interposed Mardonius.\r\n\r\n“And you saved the lives of Mardonius and Artazostra. Did you know their\r\nnobility when you rescued them?”\r\n\r\n“Not so. I would not let them drown like sheep.”\r\n\r\n“The better, then. You acted without low motive of reward. Yet let the day\r\nnever come when Xerxes is called ‘ungrateful’ for benefits done his\r\nservants. You shall come to love me by beholding my magnanimity. I will\r\nmake you a Persian, despite your will. Have you seen battle?”\r\n\r\n“I was too young to bear a spear at Marathon,” was the unflinching answer.\r\n\r\n“Learn then to wield it in another army. Where is the archsecretary?”\r\n\r\nThat functionary was present instantly. Mardonius, taking the whispers of\r\nthe king, dictated an order which the scribe stamped on his tablet of wet\r\nclay with a rapid stylus.\r\n\r\n“Now the chief proclaimer,” was the king’s order, which brought a tall man\r\nin a bright scarlet caftan salaaming to the dais.\r\n\r\nHe took the tablet from the secretary and gave a resounding blow upon the\r\nbrass gong dangling from his elbow. The clatter of wine cups ceased. The\r\ndrinkers were silent on pain of death. The herald sent his proclamation in\r\nstentorian voice down the hall:—\r\n\r\n“_In the name of Xerxes the Achæmenian, king of kings, king of Persia,\r\nMedia, Babylon, and Lydia; smiter of the Scythians, dominator of the\r\nIndians, terror of the Hellenes; to all peoples of the world his\r\nslaves,—hear ye!_\r\n\r\n“Says Xerxes the king, whose word changes not. Forasmuch as Glaucon the\r\nAthenian did save from death my servant and my sister, Mardonius and\r\nArtazostra, I do enroll him among the ‘Benefactors of the King,’ a sharer\r\nof my bounty forever. Let his name henceforth be not Glaucon, but\r\nPrexaspes. Let my purple cap be touched upon his head. Let him be given\r\nthe robe of honour and the girdle of honour. Let the treasurer pay him a\r\ntalent of gold. Let my servants honour him. Let those who mock at him be\r\nimpaled. And this I proclaim as my decree.”\r\n\r\nWhat followed Glaucon was too bewildered to recall clearly. He knew that\r\nthe archchamberlain lifted the great jewel-crusted hat from the king’s\r\nhead and set it on his own for an instant, that they brought him a flowing\r\npurple robe, and clasped about his waist a golden belt, every link set\r\nwith a stone of price. The hall arose _en masse_ to drink to the man whom\r\nthe sovran delighted to honour.\r\n\r\n“Hail! Thrice hail to the Lord Prexaspes! Justly rewarded by our gracious\r\nking!”\r\n\r\nNo man refused his plaudit, and Glaucon never knew how many envious\r\ncourtiers cheered with their lips and in their hearts muttered dark things\r\nagainst “the manner in which his Majesty loved to play the god and promote\r\nthis unknown Hellene above the heads of so many faithful subjects.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon had made shift to speak some words of deprecation and gratitude to\r\nroyalty; his bow was deeper when the supreme usher led him away from the\r\nthrone than when he approached it. As he made his way out of the\r\nbanqueting hall, a score of noblemen, captains of thousands, over-eunuchs,\r\nand more trailed at his heels, salaaming, fawning, congratulating,\r\noffering all manner of service. Not on the days following his victory at\r\nthe Isthmia had his head been in such a whirl. He hardly heard the\r\nwell-meant warning which Artabanus, the shrewd old vizier, gave as he\r\npassed the door of the great hall.\r\n\r\n“Play the game well, my new Lord Prexaspes. The king can make you satrap\r\nor he can crucify you. Play the game well, the stakes are high.”\r\n\r\nNeither did he hear the conversation betwixt Xerxes and the bow-bearer\r\nwhilst he was being conducted away.\r\n\r\n“Have I done well to honour this man, Mardonius?”\r\n\r\n“Your Eternity was never more wise. Bear with his uncourtliness now, for\r\nhe is truthful, upright, and noble in soul—qualities rare in a Hellene.\r\nGive me but time. I will make him a worthy Persian indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Do not fail therein,” ordered the monarch, “for the youth has such\r\nbeauty, both of body and mind, I am grieved he was born in Athens. Yet\r\nthere is one short way to wean him from his doomed and miserable country.”\r\n\r\n“Will Omnipotence but name it?”\r\n\r\n“Search out for him a Persian wife, no, three or four wives—although I\r\nhave heard the custom of these witless Greeks is to be content with only\r\none. There is no surer way to turn his heart than that.”\r\n\r\n“I thank your Eternity for your commandment. It shall not be forgotten.”\r\n\r\nMardonius bowed himself. Xerxes called for more wine. The feast lasted\r\nlate and ended in an orgy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CHARMING BY ROXANA\r\n\r\n\r\nGlaucon’s longing for the old life ebbed and flowed. Sometimes the return\r\nof memory maddened him. Who had done it?—had forged that damning letter\r\nand then hid it with Seuthes? Themistocles? Impossible. Democrates?—“the\r\nfriend with the understanding heart no less than a brother dear,” as Homer\r\nsaid? More impossible. An unknown enemy, then, had stolen the fleet order\r\nfrom Themistocles? But what man had hated Glaucon? One answer\r\nremained,—unwittingly the athlete had offended some god, forgotten some\r\nvow, or by sheer good fortune had awakened divine jealousy. Poseidon had\r\nbeen implacable toward Odysseus, Athena toward Hector, Artemis toward\r\nNiobe,—Glaucon could only pray that his present welcome amongst the\r\nPersians might not draw down another outburst of Heaven’s anger.\r\n\r\nMore than all else was the keen longing for Hermione. He saw her in the\r\nnight. Vainly, amidst the storms of the gathering war, he had sought a\r\nmessenger to Athens. In this he dared ask no help from Mardonius. Then\r\nalmost from the blue a bolt fell that made him wish to tear Hermione from\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nA Carian slave, a trusted steward at the Athenian silver mines of Laurium,\r\nhad loved his liberty and escaped to Sardis. The Persians questioned him\r\neagerly, for he knew all the gossip of Athens. Glaucon met the runaway,\r\nwho did not know then who he was, so many Greek refugees were always\r\nfluttering around the king’s court. The Carian told of a new honour for\r\nDemocrates.\r\n\r\n“He is elected strategus for next year because of his proud patriotism.\r\nThere is talk, too, of a more private bit of good fortune.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“That he has made successful suit to Hermippus of Eleusis for his\r\ndaughter,—the widow of Glaucon, the dead outlaw. They say the marriage\r\nfollows at the end of the year of mourning—Sir, you are not well!”\r\n\r\n“I was never better.” But the other had turned ashen. He quitted the\r\nCarian abruptly and shut himself in his chamber. It was good that he wore\r\nno sword. He might have slain himself.\r\n\r\nYet, he communed in his heart, was it not best? Was he not dead to Athens?\r\nMust Hermione mourn him down to old age? And whom better could she take\r\nthan Democrates, the man who had sacrificed even friendship for love of\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nArtabanus, the vizier, gave a great feast that night. They drank the\r\npledge, “Victory to the king, destruction to his enemies.” The lords all\r\nlooked on Glaucon to see if he would touch the cup. He drank deeply. They\r\napplauded him. He remained long at the wine, the slaves bore him home\r\ndrunken. In the morning Mardonius said Xerxes ordered him to serve in the\r\ncavalry guards, a post full of honour and chance for promotion. Glaucon\r\ndid not resist. Mardonius sent him a silvered cuirass and a black horse\r\nfrom the steppes of Bactria,—fleet as the north wind. In his new armour he\r\nwent to the chambers of Artazostra and Roxana. They had never seen him in\r\npanoply before. The brilliant mail became him rarely. The ladies were\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n“You grow Persian apace, my Lord Prexaspes,”—Roxana always called him by\r\nhis new name now,—“soon we shall hail you as ‘your Magnificence’ the\r\nsatrap of Parthia or Asia or some other kingly province in the East.”\r\n\r\n“I do well to become Persian,” he answered bitterly, unmoved by the\r\nadmiration, “for yesterday I heard that which makes it more than ever\r\nmanifest that Glaucon the Athenian is dead. And whether he shall ever rise\r\nto live again, Zeus knoweth; but from me it is hid.”\r\n\r\nArtazostra did not approach, but Roxana came near, as if to draw the\r\nbuckle of the golden girdle—the gift of Xerxes. He saw the turquoise\r\nshining on the tiara that bound her jet-black hair, the fine dark profile\r\nof her face, her delicate nostrils, the sweep of drapery that half\r\nrevealed the form so full of grace. Was there more than passing friendship\r\nin the tone with which she spoke to him?\r\n\r\n“You have heard from Athens?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And the tidings were evil.”\r\n\r\n“Why call them evil, princess? My friends all believe me dead. Can they\r\nmourn for me forever? They can forget me, alas! more easily than I in my\r\nlonesomeness can forget them.”\r\n\r\n“You are very lonely?”—the hand that drew the buckle worked slowly. How\r\nsoft it was, how delicately the Nile sun had tinted it!\r\n\r\n“Do you say you have no friends? None? Not in Sardis? Not among the\r\nPersians?”\r\n\r\n“I said not that, dear lady,—but when can a man have more than one native\r\ncountry?—and mine is Attica, and Attica is far away.”\r\n\r\n“And you can never have another? Can new friendships never take the place\r\nof those that lie forever dead?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, believe, new home, new friends, new love, are more than possible,\r\nwill you but open your heart to suffer them.”\r\n\r\nThe voice both thrilled and trembled now, then suddenly ceased. The colour\r\nsprang into Roxana’s forehead. Glaucon bowed and kissed her hand. It\r\nseemed to rise to his lips very willingly.\r\n\r\n“I thank you for your fair hopes. Farewell.” That was all he said, but as\r\nhe went forth from Roxana’s presence, the pang of the tidings brought by\r\nthe Carian seemed less keen.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe hosts gathered daily. Xerxes spent his time in dicing, hunting,\r\ndrinking, or amusing himself with his favourite by-play, wood-carving. He\r\nheld a few solemn state councils, at which he appeared to determine all\r\nthings and was actually guided by Artabanus and Mardonius. Now, at last,\r\nall the colossal machinery which was to crush down Hellas was being set in\r\nmotion. Glaucon learned how futile was Themistocles’s hope of succour to\r\nAthens from the Sicilian Greeks, for,—thanks to Mardonius’s indefatigable\r\ndiplomacy,—it was arranged that the Phœnicians of Carthage should launch a\r\npowerful armament against the Sicilians, the same moment Xerxes descended\r\non Sparta and Athens. With calm satisfaction Mardonius watched the\r\ncompletion of his efforts. All was ready,—the army of hundreds of\r\nthousands, the twelve hundred war-ships, the bridges across the\r\nHellespont, the canal at Mt. Athos. Glaucon’s admiration for the son of\r\nGobryas grew apace. Xerxes was the outward head of the attack on Hellas.\r\nMardonius was the soul. He was the idol of the army—its best archer and\r\nrider. Unlike his peers, he maintained no huge harem of jealous concubines\r\nand conspiring eunuchs. Artazostra he worshipped. Roxana he loved. He had\r\nno time for other women. No servant of Xerxes seemed outwardly more\r\nobedient than he. Night and day he wrought for the glory of Persia.\r\nTherefore, Glaucon looked on him with dread. In him Themistocles and\r\nLeonidas would find a worthy foeman.\r\n\r\nDaily Glaucon felt the Persian influence stealing upon him. He grew even\r\naccustomed to think of himself under his new name. Greeks were about him:\r\nDemaratus, the outlawed “half-king” of Sparta, and the sons of Hippias,\r\nlate tyrant of Athens. He scorned the company of these renegades. Yet\r\nsometimes he would ask himself wherein was he better than they,—had\r\nDemocrates’s accusation been true, could he have asked a greater reward\r\nfrom the Barbarian? And what he would do on the day of battle he did not\r\ndare to ask of his own soul.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nXerxes left Sardis with the host amidst the same splendour with which he\r\nhad entered. Glaucon rode in the Life Guard, and saw royalty frequently,\r\nfor the king loved to meet handsome men. Once he held the stirrup as\r\nXerxes dismounted—an honour which provoked much envious grumbling.\r\nArtazostra and Roxana travelled in their closed litters with the train of\r\nwomen and eunuchs which followed every Persian army. Thus the myriads\r\nrolled onward through Lydia and Mysia, drinking the rivers dry by their\r\nnumbers; and across the immortal plains of Troy passed that army which was\r\ndestined to do and suffer greater things than were wrought beside the\r\npoet-sung Simois and Scamander, till at last they came to the Hellespont,\r\nthe green river seven furlongs wide, that sundered conquered Asia from the\r\nEurope yet to be conquered.\r\n\r\nHere were the two bridges of ships, more than three hundred in each, held\r\nby giant cables, and which upbore a firm earthen road, protected by a high\r\nbulwark, that the horses and camels might take no fright at the water.\r\nHere, also, the fleet met them,—the armaments of the East, Phœnicians,\r\nCilicians, Egyptians, Cyprians,—more triremes and transports than had ever\r\nbefore ridden upon the seas. And as he saw all this power, all directed by\r\none will, Glaucon grew even more despondent. How could puny, faction-rent\r\nHellas bear up against this might? Only when he looked on the myriads\r\npassing, and saw how the captains swung long whips and cracked the lash\r\nacross the backs of their spearmen, as over driven cattle, did a little\r\ncomfort come. For he knew there was still a fire in Athens and Sparta, a\r\nfire not in Susa nor in Babylon, which kindled free souls and free hands\r\nto dare and do great things. “Whom will the high Zeus prosper when the\r\n_slaves_ of Xerxes stand face to face with _men_?”\r\n\r\nA proud thought,—but it ceased to comfort him, as all that afternoon he\r\nstood near the marble throne of the “Lord of the World,” whence Xerxes\r\noverlooked his myriads while they filed by, watched the races of swift\r\ntriremes, and heard the proud assurances of his officers that “no king\r\nsince the beginning of time, not Thothmes of Egypt, not Sennacherib of\r\nAssyria, not Cyrus nor Darius, had arrayed such hosts as his that day.”\r\n\r\nThen evening came. Glaucon was, after his wont, in the private pavilion of\r\nMardonius,—itself a palace walled with crimson tapestry in lieu of marble.\r\nHe sat silent and moody for long, the bright fence of the ladies or of the\r\nbow-bearer seldom moving him to answer. And at last Artazostra could\r\nendure it no more.\r\n\r\n“What has tied your tongue, Prexaspes? Surely my brother in one of his\r\npleasantries has not ordered that it be cut out? Your skin is too fair to\r\nlet you be enrolled amongst his Libyan mutes.”\r\n\r\nThe Hellene answered with a pitiful attempt at laughter.\r\n\r\n“Silent, am I? Then silent because I am admiring your noble ladyship’s\r\nplay of wit.”\r\n\r\nArtazostra shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Impossible. Your eyes were glazed like the blue of Egyptian beads. You\r\nwere not listening to me. You were seeing sights and hearkening to voices\r\nfar away.”\r\n\r\n“You press me hard, lady,” he confessed; “how can I answer? No man is\r\nmaster of his roving thoughts,—at least, not I.”\r\n\r\n“You were seeing Athens. Are you so enamoured of your stony country that\r\nyou believe no other land can be so fair?”\r\n\r\n“Stony it is, lady,—you have seen it,—but there is no sun like the sun\r\nthat gilds the Acropolis; no birds sing like the nightingales from the\r\ngrove by the Cephissus; no trees speak with the murmur of the olives at\r\nColonus, or on the hill slope at Eleusis-by-the-Sea. I can answer you in\r\nthe words of Homer, the singer of Hellas, the words he sets on the tongue\r\nof a wanderer and outcast, even as I. ‘A rugged land, yet nurse of noble\r\nmen, and for myself I can see naught sweeter than a man’s own country.’ ”\r\n\r\nThe praise of his native land had brought the colour into the cheeks of\r\nthe Athenian, his voice rose to enthusiasm. He knew that Roxana was\r\nwatching him intently.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful it must be, dear Hellene,” she spoke, as she sat upon the\r\nfootstool below the couch of her brother, “yet you have not seen all the\r\nworld. You have not seen the mystic Nile, Memphis, Thebes, and Saïs, our\r\nwondrous cities; have not seen how the sun rises over the desert, how it\r\nturns the sand hills to red gold, how at sunset the cliffs glow like walls\r\nof beryl and sard and golden jasper.”\r\n\r\n“Tell then of Egypt,” said Glaucon, clearly taking pleasure in the music\r\nof her voice.\r\n\r\n“Not to-night. I have praised it before. Rather I will praise also the\r\nrose valleys of Persia and Bactria, whither Mardonius took me after my\r\ndear father died.”\r\n\r\n“Are they very beautiful also?”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful as the Egyptian’s House of the Blessed, for those who have\r\npassed the dread bar of Osiris; beautiful as Airyana-Væya, the home land\r\nof the Aryans, whence Ahura-Mazda sent them forth. The winters are short,\r\nthe summers bright and long. Neither too much rain nor burning heat. The\r\nParadise by Sardis is nothing beside them. One breathes in the roses, and\r\nhearkens to the bulbuls—our Aryan nightingales—all day and all night long.\r\nThe streams bubble with cool water. At Susa the palace is fairer than word\r\nmay tell. Hither the court comes each summer from the tedious glories of\r\nBabylon. The columns of the palace reach up to heaven, but no walls\r\nengirdle them, only curtains green, white, and blue,—whilst the warm sweet\r\nbreeze blows always thither from green prairies.”\r\n\r\n“You draw a picture fair as the plains of Elysium, dear lady,” spoke\r\nGlaucon, his own gaze following the light that burned in hers, “and yet I\r\nwould not seek refuge even in the king’s court with all its beauty. There\r\nare times when I long to pray the god, ‘Give to me wings, eagle wings from\r\nZeus’s own bird, and let me go to the ends of the earth, and there in some\r\ncharmed valley I may find at last the spring of Lethe water, the water of\r\nforgetfulness that gives peace.’ ”\r\n\r\nRoxana looked on him; pity was in her eyes, and he knew he was taking\r\npleasure in her pitying.\r\n\r\n“The magic water you ask is not to be drunk from goblets,” she answered\r\nhim, “but the charmed valley lies in the vales of Bactria, the ‘Roof of\r\nthe World,’ high amid mountains crowned with immortal snows. Every good\r\ntree and flower are here, and here winds the mystic Oxus, the great river\r\nsweeping northward. And here, if anywhere, on Mazda’s wide, green earth,\r\ncan the trouble-tossed have peace.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is so beautiful?” said the Athenian.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful,” answered Mardonius and Artazostra together. And Roxana, with\r\nan approving nod from her brother, arose and crossed the tent where hung a\r\nsimple harp.\r\n\r\n“Will my Lord Prexaspes listen,” she asked, “if I sing him one of the\r\nhomely songs of the Aryans in praise of the vales by the Oxus? My skill is\r\nsmall.”\r\n\r\n“It should suffice to turn the heart of Persephone, even as did Orpheus,”\r\nanswered the Athenian, never taking his gaze from her.\r\n\r\nThe soft light of the swinging lamps, the heavy fragrance of the\r\nfrankincense which smouldered on the brazier, the dark lustre of the\r\nsinger’s eyes—all held Glaucon as by a spell. Roxana struck the harp. Her\r\nvoice was sweet, and more than desire to please throbbed through the\r\nstrings and song.\r\n\r\n  “O far away is gliding\r\n    The pleasant Oxus’s stream,\r\n  I see the green glades darkling,\r\n    I see the clear pools gleam.\r\n  I hear the bulbuls calling\r\n    From blooming tree to tree.\r\n  Wave, bird, and tree are singing,\r\n    ‘Away! ah, come with me!’\r\n\r\n  “By Oxus’s stream is rising\r\n    Great Cyrus’s marble halls;\r\n  Like rain of purest silver,\r\n    His tinkling fountain falls;\r\n  To his cool verdant arbours\r\n    What joy with thee to flee.\r\n  I’ll join with bird and river,\r\n    ‘Away! rest there with me!’\r\n\r\n  “Forget, forget old sorrows,\r\n    Forget the dear things lost!\r\n  There comes new peace, new brightness,\r\n    When darksome waves are crossed;\r\n  By Oxus’s streams abiding,\r\n    From pang and strife set free,\r\n  I’ll teach thee love and gladness,—\r\n    Rest there, for aye, with me!”\r\n\r\nThe light, the fragrance, the song so pregnant with meaning, all wrought\r\nupon Glaucon of Athens. He felt the warm glow in his cheeks; he felt\r\nsubtle hands outstretching as if drawing forth his spirit. Roxana’s eyes\r\nwere upon him as she ended. Their gaze met. She was very fair, high-born,\r\nsensitive. She was inviting him to put away Glaucon the outcast from\r\nHellas, to become body and soul Prexaspes the Persian, “Benefactor of the\r\nKing,” and sharer in all the glories of the conquering race. All the past\r\nseemed slipping away from him as unreal. Roxana stood before him in her\r\ndark Oriental beauty; Hermione was in Athens—and they were giving her in\r\nmarriage to Democrates. What wonder he felt no mastery of himself, though\r\nall that day he had kept from wine?\r\n\r\n“A simple song,” spoke Mardonius, who seemed marvellously pleased at all\r\nhis sister did, “yet not lacking its sweetness. We Aryans are without the\r\nelaborate music the Greeks and Babylonians affect.”\r\n\r\n“Simplicity is the highest beauty,” answered the Greek, as if still in his\r\ntrance, “and when I hear Euphrosyne, fairest of the Graces, sing with the\r\nvoice of Erato, the Song-Queen, I grow afraid. For a mortal may not hear\r\nthings too divine and live.”\r\n\r\nRoxana replaced the harp and made one of her inimitable Oriental\r\ncourtesies,—a token at once of gratitude and farewell for the evening.\r\nGlaucon never took his gaze from her, until with a rustle and sweep of her\r\nblue gauze she had glided out of the tent. He did not see the meaning\r\nglances exchanged by Mardonius and Artazostra before the latter left them.\r\n\r\nWhen the two men were alone, the bow-bearer asked a question.\r\n\r\n“Dear Prexaspes, do you not think I should bless the twelve archangels I\r\npossess so beautiful a sister?”\r\n\r\n“She is so fair, I wonder that Zeus does not haste from Olympus to\r\nenthrone her in place of Hera.”\r\n\r\nThe bow-bearer laughed.\r\n\r\n“No, I crave for her only a mortal husband. Though there are few in\r\nPersia, in Media, in the wide East, to whom I dare entrust her.\r\nPerhaps,”—his laugh grew lighter,—“I would do well to turn my eyes\r\nwestward.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon did not see Roxana again the next day nor for several following,\r\nbut in those days he thought much less on Hermione and on Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DEMOCRATES’S TROUBLES RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through that year to its close and again to the verge of springtime\r\nthe sun made violet haze upon the hills and pure fire of the bay at\r\nEleusis-by-the-Sea. Night by night the bird song would be stilled in the\r\nold olives along the dark waters. There Hermione would sit looking off\r\ninto the void, as many another in like plight has sat and wearily waited,\r\nasking of the night and the sea the questions that are never answered. As\r\nthe bay shimmered under the light of morning, she could gaze toward the\r\nbrown crags of Salamis and the open Ægean beyond. The waves kept their\r\nabiding secret. The tall triremes, the red-sailed fishers’ boats, came and\r\nwent from the havens of Athens, but Hermione never saw the ship that had\r\nborne away her all.\r\n\r\nThe roar and scandal following the unmasking of Glaucon had long since\r\nabated. Hermippus—himself full five years grayer on account of the\r\ncalamity—had taken his daughter again to quiet Eleusis, where there was\r\nless to remind her of that terrible night at Colonus. She spent the autumn\r\nand winter in an unbroken shadow life, with only her mother and old\r\nCleopis for companions. Reasons not yet told to the world gave her a\r\nlittle hope and comfort. But in mere desire to make her dark cloud break,\r\nher parents were continually giving Hermione pain. She guessed it long\r\nbefore her father’s wishes passed beyond vaguest hints. She heard him\r\npraising Democrates, his zeal for Athens and Hellas, his fair worldly\r\nprospects, and there needed no diviner to reveal Hermippus’s hidden\r\nmeaning. Once she overheard Cleopis talking with another maid.\r\n\r\n“Her Ladyship has taken on terribly, to be sure, but I told her mother\r\n‘when a fire blazes too hot, it burns out simply the faster.’ Democrates\r\nis just the man to console in another year.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the other wiseacre, “she’s far too young and pretty to\r\nstay unwedded very long. Aphrodite didn’t make her to sit as an old maid\r\ncarding wool and munching beans. One can see Hermippus’s and Lysistra’s\r\npurpose with half an eye.”\r\n\r\n“Cleopis, Nania, what is this vile tattling that I hear?”\r\n\r\nThe young mistress’s eyes blazed fury. Nania turned pale. Hermione was\r\nquite capable of giving her a sound whipping, but Cleopis mustered a bold\r\nfront and a ready lie:\r\n\r\n“_Ei!_ dear little lady, don’t flash up so! I was only talking with Nania\r\nabout how Phryne the scullion maid was making eyes at Scylax the groom.”\r\n\r\n“I heard you quite otherwise,” was the nigh tremulous answer. But Hermione\r\nwas not anxious to push matters to an issue. From the moment of Glaucon’s\r\ndownfall she had believed—what even her own mother had mildly derided—that\r\nDemocrates had been the author of her husband’s ruin. And now that the\r\nintent of her parents ever more clearly dawned on her, she was close upon\r\ndespair. Hermippus, however,—whatever his purpose,—was considerate, nay\r\nkindly. He regarded Hermione’s feelings as pardonable, if not laudable. He\r\nwould wait for time to soothe her. But the consciousness that her father\r\npurposed such a fate for her, however far postponed, was enough to double\r\nall the unanswered longing, the unstilled pain.\r\n\r\nGlaucon was gone. And with him gone, could Hermione’s sun ever rise again?\r\nCould she hope, across the end of the æons, to clasp hands even in the dim\r\nHouse of Hades with her glorious husband? If there was chance thereof,\r\ndark Hades would grow bright as Olympus. How gladly she would fare out to\r\nthe shade land, when Hermes led down his troops of helpless dead.\r\n\r\n  “Downward, down the long dark pathway,\r\n    Past Oceanus’s great streams,\r\n  Past the White Rock, past the Sun’s gates\r\n    Downward to the land of Dreams:\r\n  There they reach the wide dim borders\r\n    Of the fields of asphodel,\r\n  Where the spectres and the spirits\r\n    Of wan, outworn mortals dwell.”\r\n\r\nBut was this the home of Glaucon the Fair; should the young, the strong,\r\nthe pure in heart, share one condemnation with the mean and the guilty?\r\nHomer the Wise left all hid. Yet he told of some not doomed to the common\r\nlot. Thus ran the promise to Menelaus, espoused to Helen.\r\n\r\n  “Far away the gods shall bear you:\r\n    To the fair Elysian plains,\r\n  Where the time fleets gladly, swiftly,\r\n    Where bright Rhadamanthus reigns:\r\n  Snow is not, nor rain, nor winter,\r\n    But clear zephyrs from the west,\r\n  Singing round the streams of Ocean\r\n    Round the islands of the Blest.”\r\n\r\nWas the pledge for Menelaus only?\r\n\r\nThe boats came, the boats went, on the blue bay. But as the spring grew\r\nwarm, Hermione thought less of them, less almost of the last dread vision\r\nof Glaucon.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe cloud of the Persian hung ever darkening over Athens. Continual\r\nrumours made Xerxes’s power terrible even beyond fact. It was hard to go\r\non eating, drinking, frequenting the jury or the gymnasium, when men knew\r\nto a certainty the coming summer would bring Athens face to face with\r\nslavery or destruction. Wise men grew silent. Fools took to carousing to\r\nbanish care. But one word not the frailest uttered—“submission.” Worldly\r\nprudence forbade that. The women would have stabbed the craven to death\r\nwith their bodkins. For the women were braver than the men. They knew the\r\nfate of conquered Ionia: for the men only merciful death, for the women\r\nthe living death of the Persian harems and indignities words may not\r\nutter. Whether Hellas forsook her or aided, Athens had chosen her fate.\r\nXerxes might annihilate her. Conquer her he could not.\r\n\r\nYet the early spring came back sweetly as ever. The warm breeze blew from\r\nEgypt. Philomela sang in the olive groves. The snows on Pentelicus faded.\r\nAround the city ran bands of children singing the “swallow’s song,” and\r\nbeseeching the spring donation of honey cakes:—\r\n\r\n  “She is here, she is here, the swallow;\r\n  Fair seasons bringing,—fair seasons to follow.”\r\n\r\nAnd many a housewife, as she rewarded the singers, dropped a silent tear,\r\nwondering whether another spring would see the innocents anywhere save in\r\na Persian slave-pen, or, better fate, in Orchus.\r\n\r\nYet to one woman that spring there came consolation. On Hermippus’s door\r\nhung a glad olive wreath. Hermione had borne a son. “The fairest babe she\r\nhad ever seen,” cried the midwife. “Phœnix,” the mother called him, “for\r\nin him shall Glaucon the Beautiful live again.” Democrates sent a runner\r\nevery day to Eleusis to inquire for Hermione until all danger was passed.\r\nOn the “name-day,” ten days after the birth, he was absent from the\r\ngathering of friends and kinsmen, but sent a valuable statuette to\r\nHermione, who left it, however, to her father to thank him.\r\n\r\nThe day after Phœnix was born old Conon, Glaucon’s father, died. The old\r\nman had never recovered from the blow given by the dishonourable death of\r\nthe son with whom he had so lately quarrelled. He left a great landed\r\nestate at Marathon to his new-born grandson. The exact value thereof\r\nDemocrates inquired into sharply, and when a distant cousin talked of\r\ncontesting the will, the orator announced he would defend the infant’s\r\nrights. The would-be plaintiff withdrew at once, not anxious to cross\r\nswords with this favourite of the juries, and everybody said that\r\nDemocrates was showing a most scrupulous regard for his unfortunate\r\nfriend’s memory.\r\n\r\nIndeed, seemingly, Democrates ought to have been the happiest man in\r\nAthens. He had been elected “strategus,” to serve on the board of generals\r\nalong with Themistocles. He had plenty of money, and gave great banquets\r\nto this or that group of prominent citizens. During the winter he had\r\nasked Hermippus for his daughter in marriage. The Eumolpid told him that\r\nsince Glaucon’s fearful end, he was welcome as a son-in-law. Still he\r\ncould not conceal that Hermione never spoke of him save in hate, and in\r\nview of her then delicate condition it was well not to press the matter.\r\nThe orator had seemed well content. “Woman’s fantasies would wear away in\r\ntime.” But the rumour of this negotiation, outrunning truth, grew into the\r\nlying report of an absolute betrothal,—the report which was to drift to\r\nAsia and turn Glaucon’s heart to stone, gossip having always wrought more\r\nharm than malignant lying.\r\n\r\nYet flies were in Democrates’s sweet ointment. He knew Themistocles hardly\r\ntrusted him as frankly as of yore. Little Simonides, a man of wide\r\ninfluence and keen insight, treated him very coldly. Cimon had cooled\r\nalso. But worse than all was a haunting dread. Democrates knew, if hardly\r\nanother in Hellas, that the Cyprian—in other words Mardonius—was safe in\r\nAsia, and likewise that he had fled on the _Solon_. Mardonius, then, had\r\nescaped the storm. What if the same miracle had saved the outlaw? What if\r\nthe dead should awake? The chimera haunted Democrates night and day.\r\n\r\nStill he was beginning to shake off his terrors. He believed he had washed\r\nhis hands fairly clean of his treason, even if the water had cost his\r\nsoul. He joined with all his energies in seconding Themistocles. His voice\r\nwas loudest at the Pnyx, counselling resistance. He went on successful\r\nembassies to Sicyon and Ægina to get pledges of alliance. In the summer he\r\ndid his uttermost to prepare the army which Themistocles and Evænetus the\r\nSpartan led to defend the pass of Tempē. The expedition sailed amid high\r\nhopes for a noble defence of Hellas. Democrates was proud and sanguine.\r\nThen, like a thunderbolt, there came one night a knock at his door. Bias\r\nled to his master no less a visitor than the sleek and smiling\r\nPhœnician—Hiram.\r\n\r\nThe orator tried to cover his terrors by windy bluster. He broke in before\r\nthe Oriental could finish his elaborate salaam.\r\n\r\n“Of all the harpies and gorgons you are the least welcome. Were you not\r\nwarned when you fled Athens for Argos never to show your face in Attica\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency said so,” was the bland reply.\r\n\r\n“Admirably you obey it. It remains for me to reward the obedience. Bias,\r\ngo to the street; summon two Scythian watchmen.”\r\n\r\nThe Thracian darted out. Hiram simply stood with hands folded.\r\n\r\n“It is well, Excellency, the lad is gone. I have many things to say in\r\nconfidence to your Nobility. At Lacedæmon my Lord Lycon was gracious\r\nenough to give certain commands for me to transmit to you.”\r\n\r\n“Commands? To me? Earth and gods! am I to be commanded by an adder like\r\nyou? You shall pay for this on the rack.”\r\n\r\n“Your slave thinks otherwise,” observed Hiram, humbly. “If your Lordship\r\nwill deign to read this letter, it will save your slave many words and\r\nyour Lordship many cursings.”\r\n\r\nHe knelt again before he offered a papyrus. Democrates would rather have\r\ntaken fire, but he could not refuse. And thus he read:—\r\n\r\n“Lycon of Lacedæmon to Democrates of Athens, greeting:—Can he who Medizes\r\nin the summer Hellenize in the spring? I know your zeal for Themistocles.\r\nWas it for this we plucked you back from exposure and ruin? Do then as\r\nHiram bids you, or repay the money you clutched so eagerly. Fail not, or\r\nrest confident all the documents you betrayed shall go to Hypsichides the\r\nFirst Archon, your enemy. Use then your eloquence on Attic juries! But you\r\nwill grow wise; what need of me to threaten? You will hearken to Hiram.\r\n\r\n“From Sparta, on the festival of Bellerophon, in the ephorship of\r\nTheudas.—_Chaire!_”\r\n\r\nDemocrates folded the papyrus and stood long, biting his whitened lips in\r\nsilence. Perhaps he had surmised the intent of the letter the instant\r\nHiram extended it.\r\n\r\n“What do you desire?” he said thickly, at last.\r\n\r\n“Let my Lord then hearken—” began the Phœnician, to be interrupted by the\r\nsudden advent of Bias.\r\n\r\n“The Scythians are at the door, _kyrie_,” he was shouting; “shall I order\r\nthem in and drag this lizard out by the tail?”\r\n\r\n“No, in Zeus’s name, no! Bid them keep without. And do you go also. This\r\nhonest fellow is on private business which only I must hear.”\r\n\r\nBias slammed the door. Perhaps he stood listening. Hiram, at least, glided\r\nnearer to his victim and spoke in a smooth whisper, taking no chances of\r\nan eavesdropper.\r\n\r\n“Excellency, the desire of Lycon is this. The army has been sent to Tempē.\r\nAt Lacedæmon Lycon used all his power to prevent its despatch, but\r\nLeonidas is omnipotent to-day in Sparta, and besides, since Lycon’s\r\ncalamity at the Isthmia, his prestige, and therefore his influence, is not\r\na little abated. Nevertheless, the army must be recalled from Tempē.”\r\n\r\n“And the means?”\r\n\r\n“Yourself, Excellency. It is within your power to find a thousand good\r\nreasons why Themistocles and Evænetus should retreat. And you will do so\r\nat once, Excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Do not think you and your accursed masters can drive me from infamy to\r\ninfamy. I can be terrible if pushed to bay.”\r\n\r\n“Your Nobility has read Lycon’s letter,” observed the Phœnician, with\r\nfolded arms.\r\n\r\nThere was a sword lying on the tripod by which Democrates stood; he\r\nregretted for all the rest of his life that he had not seized it and ended\r\nthe snakelike Oriental then and there. The impulse came, and went. The\r\nopportunity never returned. The orator’s head dropped down upon his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n“Go back to Sparta, go back instantly,” he spoke in a hoarse whisper.\r\n“Tell that Polyphemus you call your master there that I will do his will.\r\nAnd tell him, too, that if ever the day comes for vengeance on him, on the\r\nCyprian, on you,—my vengeance will be terrible.”\r\n\r\n“Your slave’s ears hear the first part of your message with joy,”—Hiram’s\r\nsmile never grew broader,—“the second part, which my Lord speaks in\r\nanger,—I will forget.”\r\n\r\n“Go! go!” ordered the orator, furiously. He clapped his hands. Bias\r\nreëntered.\r\n\r\n“Tell the constables I don’t need them. Here is an obol apiece for their\r\ntrouble. Conduct this man out. If he comes hither again, do you and the\r\nother slaves beat him till there is not a whole spot left on his body.”\r\n\r\nHiram’s genuflexion was worthy of Xerxes’s court.\r\n\r\n“My Lord, as always,” was his parting compliment, “has shown himself\r\nexceeding wise.”\r\n\r\nThus the Oriental went. In what a mood Democrates passed the remaining day\r\nneeds only scant wits to guess. Clearer, clearer in his ears was ringing\r\nÆschylus’s song of the Furies. He could not silence it.\r\n\r\n    “With scourge and with ban\r\n    We prostrate the man\r\n    Who with smooth-woven wile\r\n    And a fair-facèd smile\r\n  Hath planted a snare for his friend!\r\n    Though fleet, we shall find him;\r\n    Though strong, we shall bind him,\r\n  Who planted a snare for his friend!”\r\n\r\nHe had intended to be loyal to Hellas,—to strive valiantly for her\r\nfreedom,—and now! Was the Nemesis coming upon him, not in one great clap,\r\nbut stealthily, finger by finger, cubit by cubit, until his soul’s price\r\nwas to be utterly paid? Was this the beginning of the recompense for the\r\nnight scene at Colonus?\r\n\r\nThe next morning he made a formal visit to the shrine of the Furies in the\r\nhill of Areopagus. “An old vow, too long deferred in payment, taken when\r\nhe joined in his first contest on the Bema,” he explained to friends, when\r\nhe visited this uncanny spot.\r\n\r\nFew were the Athenians who would pass that cleft in the Areopagus where\r\nthe “Avengers” had their grim sanctuary without a quick motion of the\r\nhands to avert the evil eye. Thieves and others of evil conscience would\r\nmake a wide circuit rather than pass this abode of Alecto, Megæra, and\r\nTisiphone, pitiless pursuers of the guilty. The terrible sisters hounded a\r\nman through life, and after death to the judgment bar of Minos. With\r\nreason, therefore, the guilty dreaded them.\r\n\r\nDemocrates had brought the proper sacrifices—two black rams, which were\r\nduly slaughtered upon the little altar before the shrine and sprinkled\r\nwith sweetened water. The priestess, a gray hag herself, asked her visitor\r\nif he would enter the cavern and proffer his petition to the mighty\r\ngoddesses. Leaving his friends outside, the orator passed through the door\r\nwhich the priestess seemed to open in the side of the cave. He saw only a\r\njagged, unhewn cranny, barely tall enough for a man to stand upright and\r\nreaching far into the sculptured rock. No image: only a few rough votive\r\ntablets set up by a grateful suppliant for some mercy from the awful\r\ngoddesses.\r\n\r\n“If you would pray here, _kyrie_,” said the hag, “it is needful that I go\r\nforth and close the door. The holy Furies love the dark, for is not their\r\nhome in Tartarus?”\r\n\r\nShe went forth. As the light vanished, Democrates seemed buried in the\r\nrock. Out of the blackness spectres were springing against him. From a\r\ncleft he heard a flapping, a bat, an imprisoned bird, or Alecto’s direful\r\nwings. He held his hands downward, for he had to address infernal\r\ngoddesses, and prayed in haste.\r\n\r\n“O ye sisters, terrible yet gracious, give ear. If by my offerings I have\r\nfound favour, lift from my heart this crushing load. Deliver me from the\r\nfear of the blood guilty. Are ye not divine? Do not the immortals know all\r\nthings? Ye know, then, how I was tempted, how sore was the compulsion, and\r\nhow life and love were sweet. Then spare me. Give me back unhaunted\r\nslumber. Deliver me from Lycon. Give my soul peace,—and in reward, I swear\r\nit by the Styx, by Zeus’s own oath, I will build in your honour a temple\r\nby your sacred field at Colonus, where men shall gather to reverence you\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\nBut here he ceased. In the darkness moved something white. Again a\r\nflapping. He was sure the white thing was Glaucon’s face. Glaucon had\r\nperished at sea. He had never been buried, so his ghost was wandering over\r\nthe world, seeking vainly for rest. It all came to Democrates in an\r\ninstant. His knees smote together; his teeth chattered. He sprang back\r\nupon the door and forced it open, but never saw the dove that fluttered\r\nforth with him.\r\n\r\n“A hideous place!” he cried to his waiting friends. “A man must have a\r\nstronger heart than mine to love to tarry after his prayer is finished.”\r\n\r\nOnly a few days later Hellas was startled to hear that Tempē had been\r\nevacuated without a blow, and the pass left open to Xerxes. It was said\r\nDemocrates, in his ever commendable activity, had discovered at the last\r\nmoment the mountain wall was not as defensible as hoped, and any\r\nresistance would have been disastrous. Therefore, whilst the retreat was\r\nbewailed, everybody praised the foresight of the orator. Everybody—one\r\nshould say, except two, Bias and Phormio. They had many conferences\r\ntogether, especially after the coming and going of Hiram.\r\n\r\n“There is a larger tunny in the sea than yet has entered the meshes,”\r\nconfessed the fishmonger, sorely puzzled, after much vain talk.\r\n\r\nBut Hermione was caring for none of these things. Her hands were busy with\r\nthe swaddling clothes. Her thoughts only for that wicker cradle which\r\nswung betwixt the pillars, where Hermippus’s house looked toward Salamis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE COMMANDMENT OF XERXES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to praise the blessings of peace. Still easier to paint the\r\nhorrors of war,—and yet war will remain for all time the greatest game at\r\nwhich human wits can play. For in it every form of courage, physical and\r\nmoral, and every talent are called into being. If war at once develops the\r\nbestial, it also develops as promptly the heroic. Alone of human\r\nactivities it demands a brute’s strength, an iron will, a serpent’s\r\nintellect, a lion’s courage—all in one. And of him who has these things in\r\njustest measure, history writes, “He conquered.” It was because Mardonius\r\nseemed to possess all these, to foresee everything, to surmount\r\neverything, that Glaucon despaired for the fate of Hellas, even more than\r\nwhen he beheld the crushing armaments of the Persian.\r\n\r\nYet for long it seemed as if the host would march even to Athens without\r\nbattle, without invoking Mardonius’s skill. The king crossed Thrace and\r\nMacedonia, meeting only trembling hospitality from the cities along his\r\nroute. At Doriscus he had held a review of his army, and smiled when the\r\nfawning scribes told how one million seven hundred thousand foot and\r\neighty thousand horse followed his banners.(8) Every fugitive and spy from\r\nsouthern Hellas told how the hearts of the stanchest patriots were\r\nsinking, how everywhere save in Athens and Sparta loud voices urged the\r\nsending of “earth and water,”—tokens of submission to the irresistible\r\nking. At the pass of Tempē covering Thessaly, Glaucon, who knew the hopes\r\nof Themistocles, had been certain the Hellenes would make a stand. Rumour\r\nhad it that ten thousand Greek infantry were indeed there, and ready for\r\nbattle. But the outlaw’s expectations were utterly shattered. To the\r\ndisgust of the Persian lords, who dearly loved brisk fighting, it was soon\r\ntold how the cowardly Hellenes had fled by ship, leaving the rich plains\r\nof Thessaly bare to the invader.\r\n\r\nThus was blasted Glaucon’s last hope. Hellas was doomed. He almost looked\r\nto see Themistocles coming as ambassador to bring the homage of Athens.\r\nSince his old life seemed closed to the outlaw, he allowed Mardonius to\r\nhave his will with him,—to teach him to act, speak, think, as an Oriental.\r\nHe even bowed himself low before the king, an act rewarded by being\r\ncommanded one evening to play at dice with majesty itself. Xerxes was\r\nactually gracious enough to let his new subject win from him three\r\nhandsome Syrian slave-boys.\r\n\r\n“You Hellenes are becoming wise,” announced the monarch one day, when the\r\nLocrian envoys came with their earth and water. “If you can learn to speak\r\nthe truth, you will equal even the virtues of the Aryans.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty has not found me a liar,” rejoined the Athenian, warmly.\r\n\r\n“You gather our virtues apace. I must consider how I can reward you by\r\npromotion.”\r\n\r\n“The king is overwhelmingly generous. Already I fear many of his servants\r\nmutter that I am promoted beyond all desert.”\r\n\r\n“Mutter? mutter against you?” The king’s eyes flashed ominously. “By\r\nMazda, it is against me, then, who advanced you! Hearken, Otanes,”—he\r\naddressed the general of the Persian footmen, who stood near by,—“who are\r\nthe disobedient slaves who question my advancement of Prexaspes?”\r\n\r\nThe general—he had been the loudest grumbler—bowed and kissed the carpet.\r\n\r\n“None, your Eternity; on the contrary, there is not one Aryan in the host\r\nwho does not rejoice the king has found so noble an object for his godlike\r\nbounty.”\r\n\r\n“You hear, Prexaspes,” said Xerxes, mollified. “I am glad, for the man who\r\nquestions my wisdom touching your advancement must be impaled. To-morrow\r\nis my birthday, you will not fail to sit with the other great lords at the\r\nbanquet.”\r\n\r\n“The king overpowers me with his goodness.”\r\n\r\n“Do not fail to deserve it. Mardonius is always praising you. Consider\r\nalso how much better it is to depend on a gracious king than on the\r\nclamour of the fickle mob that rules in your helpless cities!”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe next morning was the royal birthday. The army, pitched in the fertile\r\nplain by Thessalian Larissa, feasted on the abundance at hand. The king\r\ndistributed huge largesses of money. All day long he sat in his\r\npalace-like tent, receiving congratulations from even the lowest of his\r\nfollowers, and bound in turn not to reject any reasonable petition. The\r\nMagi sacrificed blooded stallions and rare spices to Mithra the “Lord of\r\nWide Pastures,” to Vohu-Manu the “Holy Councillor,” and all their other\r\nangels, desiring them to bless the arms of the king.\r\n\r\nThe “Perfect Banquet” of the birthday came in the evening. It hardly\r\ndiffered from the feast at Sardis. The royal pavilion had its poles plated\r\nwith silver, the tapestries were green and purple, the couches were spread\r\nwith gorgeous coverlets. Only the drinking was more moderate, the\r\nceremonial less rigid. The fortunate guests devoured dainties reserved for\r\nthe special use of royalty: the flour of the bread was from Assos, the\r\nwine from Helbon, the water to dilute the wine had come in silver flasks\r\nfrom the Choaspes by Susa. The king even distributed the special unguent\r\nof lion’s fat and palm wine which no subject, unpermitted, could use and\r\nshun the death penalty.\r\n\r\nThen at the end certain of the fairest of the women came and danced\r\nunveiled before the king—this one night when they might show forth their\r\nbeauty. And last of all danced Roxana. She danced alone; a diaphanous\r\ndrapery of pink Egyptian cotton blew around her as an evening cloud. From\r\nher black hair shone the diamond coronet. To the sensuous swing of the\r\nmusic she wound in and out before the king and his admiring lords,\r\nadvancing, retreating, rising, swaying, a paragon of agility and grace,\r\nfeet, body, hands, weaving their charm together. When at the end she fell\r\non her knees before the king, demanding whether she had done well, the\r\napplause shook the pavilion. The king looked down on her, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Rise, sister of Mardonius. All Eran rejoices in you to-night. And on this\r\nevening whose request can I fail to grant? Whose can I grant more gladly\r\nthan yours? Speak; you shall have it, though it be for half my kingdoms.”\r\n\r\nThe dancer arose, but hung down her flashing coronal. Her blush was\r\nenchanting. She stood silent, while the good-humoured king smiled down on\r\nher, till Artazostra came from her seat by Mardonius and whispered in her\r\near. Every neck in the crowded pavilion was craned as Artazostra spoke to\r\nXerxes.\r\n\r\n“May it please my royal brother, this is the word of Roxana. ‘I love my\r\nbrother Mardonius; nevertheless, contrary to the Persian custom, he keeps\r\nme now to my nineteenth year unwedded. If now I have found favour in the\r\nsight of the king, let him command Mardonius to give me to some noble\r\nyouth who shall do me honour by the valiant deeds and the true service he\r\nshall render unto my Lord.’ ”\r\n\r\n“A fair petition! Let the king grant it!” shouted twenty; while others\r\nmore wise whispered, “This was not done without foreknowledge by\r\nMardonius.”\r\n\r\nXerxes smiled benignantly and rubbed his nose with the lion’s fat while\r\ndeliberating.\r\n\r\n“An evil precedent, lady, an evil precedent when women demand husbands and\r\ndo not wait for their fathers’ or brothers’ good pleasure. But I have\r\npromised. The word of the king is not to be broken. Daughter of Gobryas,\r\nyour petition is granted. Come hither, Mardonius,”—the bow-bearer\r\napproached the throne,—“you have heard the bold desire of your sister, and\r\nmy answer. I must command you to bestow on her a husband.”\r\n\r\nThe bow-bearer bowed obediently.\r\n\r\n“I hear the word of the king, and all his mandates are good. This is no\r\nmeet time for marriage festivities, when the Lord of the World and all the\r\nAryan power goes forth to war. Yet as soon as the impious rebels amongst\r\nthe Hellenes shall be subdued, I will rejoice to bestow my sister upon\r\nwhatsoever fortunate servant the king may deign to honour.”\r\n\r\n“You hear him, lady,”—the royal features assumed a grin, which was\r\nreflected throughout the pavilion. “A husband you shall have, but\r\nMardonius shall be revenged. Your fate is in my hands. And shall not\r\nI,—guardian of the households of my empire,—give a warning to all bold\r\nmaidens against lifting their wills too proudly, or presuming upon an\r\noverindulgent king? What then shall be just punishment?” The king bent his\r\nhead, still rubbing his nose, and trying to persuade all about that he was\r\nmeditating.\r\n\r\n“Bardas, satrap of Sogandia, is old; he has but one eye; they say he beats\r\nhis eleven wives daily with a whip of rhinoceros hide. It would be just if\r\nI gave him this woman also in marriage. What think you, Hydarnes?”\r\n\r\n“If your Eternity bestows this woman on Bardas, every husband and father\r\nin all your kingdoms will applaud your act,” smiled the commander.\r\n\r\nThe threatened lady fell again on her knees, outstretching her hands and\r\nbeseeching mercy,—never a more charming picture of misery and contrition.\r\n\r\n“You tremble, lady,” went on the sovran, “and justly. It were better for\r\nmy empire if my heart were less hard. After all, you danced so elegantly\r\nthat I must be mollified. There is the young Prince Zophyrus, son of Datis\r\nthe general,—he has only five wives already. True, he is usually the worse\r\nfor wine, is not handsome, and killed one of his women not long since\r\nbecause she did not sing to please him. Yes—you shall have Zophyrus—he\r\nwill surely rule you—”\r\n\r\n“Mercy, not Zophyrus, gracious Lord,” pleaded the abject Egyptian.\r\n\r\nThe king looked down on her, with a broader grin than ever.\r\n\r\n“You are very hard to please. I ought to punish your wilfulness by some\r\ndreadful doom. Do not cry out again. I will not hear you. My decision is\r\nfixed. Mardonius shall bestow you in marriage to a man who is not even a\r\nPersian by birth, who one year since was a disobedient rebel against my\r\npower, who even now contemns and despises many of the good customs of the\r\nAryans. Hark, then, to his name. When Hellas is conquered, I command that\r\nMardonius wed you to the Lord Prexaspes.”\r\n\r\nThe king broke into an uproarious laugh, a signal for the thousand loyal\r\nsubjects within the great pavilion to roar with laughter also. In the\r\nconfusion following Artazostra and Roxana disappeared. Fifty hands dragged\r\nthe appointed bridegroom to the king, showering on him all manner of\r\ncongratulations. Xerxes’s act was a plain proof that he was adopting the\r\nbeautiful Hellene as one of his personal favourites,—a post of influence\r\nand honour not to be despised by a vizier. What “Prexaspes” said when he\r\nthanked the king was drowned in the tumult of laughing and cheering. The\r\nmonarch, delighted to play the gracious god, roared his injunctions to the\r\nAthenian so loud that above the din they heard him.\r\n\r\n“You will bridle her well, Prexaspes. I know them—those Egyptian fillies!\r\nThey need a hard curb and the lash at times. Beware the tyranny of your\r\nown harem. I would not have the satrapies know how certain bright eyes in\r\nthe seraglio can make the son of Darius play the fool. There is nothing\r\nmore dangerous than women. It will take all your courage to master them. A\r\nhard task lies before you. I have given you one wife, but you know our\r\ngood Persian custom—five, ten, or twenty. Take the score, I order you.\r\nThen in twelve years you’ll be receiving the prize a Persian king bestows\r\nevery summer on the father of the most children!”\r\n\r\nAnd following this broad hint, the king held his sides with laughter\r\nagain, a mirth which it is needless to say was echoed and reëchoed till it\r\nseemed it could not cease. Only a few ventured to mutter under breath:\r\n“The Hellene will have a subsatrapy in the East before the season is over\r\nand a treasure of five thousand talents! Mithra wither the upstart!”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe summer was waning when the host moved southward from Larissa, for mere\r\nnumbers had made progress slow, and despite Mardonius’s providence the\r\nquestion of commissariat sometimes became difficult. Now at last, leaving\r\nbehind Thrace and Macedonia, the army began to enter Greece itself. As it\r\nfared across the teeming plains of Thessaly, it met only welcome from the\r\ninhabitants and submissions from fresh embassies. Report came from the\r\nfleet—keeping pace with the land army along the coasts—that nowhere had\r\nthe weak squadrons of the Greeks adventured a stand. Daily the smile of\r\nthe Lord of the World grew more complacent, as his “table-companions” told\r\nhim: “The rumour of your Eternity’s advent stupefies the miserable\r\nHellenes. Like Atar, the Angel of Fire, your splendour glitters afar. You\r\nwill enter Athens and Sparta, and no sword leave its sheath, no bow its\r\nwrapper.”\r\n\r\nEvery day Mardonius asked of Glaucon, “Will your Hellenes fight?” and the\r\nanswer was ever more doubting, “I do not know.”\r\n\r\nLong since Glaucon had given up hope of the defeat of the Persian. Now he\r\nprayed devoutly there might be no useless shedding of blood. If only he\r\ncould turn back and not behold the humiliation of Athens! Of the fate of\r\nthe old-time friends—Democrates, Cimon, Hermione—he tried not to think. No\r\ndoubt Hermione was the wife of Democrates. More than a year had sped since\r\nthe flight from Colonus. Hermione had put off her mourning for the yellow\r\nveil of a bride. Glaucon prayed the war might bring her no new sorrow,\r\nthough Democrates, of course, would resist Persia to the end. As for\r\nhimself he would never darken their eyes again. He was betrothed to\r\nRoxana. With her he would seek one of those valleys in Bactria which she\r\nhad praised, the remoter the better, and there perhaps was peace.\r\n\r\nThus the host wound through Thessaly, till before them rose, peak on peak,\r\nthe jagged mountain wall of Othrys and Œta, fading away in violet\r\ndistance, the bulwark of central Hellas. Then the king’s smile became a\r\nfrown, for the Hellenes, undismayed despite his might, were assembling\r\ntheir fleet at northern Eubœa, and at the same time a tempest had\r\nshattered a large part of the royal navy. The Magi offered sacrifice to\r\nappease Tishtrya, the Prince of the Wind-ruling Stars, but the king’s\r\nfrown grew blacker at each message. Glaucon was near him when at last the\r\nmonarch’s thunders broke forth.\r\n\r\nA hot, sultry day. The king’s chariot had just crossed the mountain stream\r\nof the Sphercus, when a captain of a hundred came galloping, dismounted,\r\nand prostrated himself in the dust.\r\n\r\n“Your tidings?” demanded Xerxes, sharply.\r\n\r\n“Be gracious, Fountain of Mercy,”—the captain evidently disliked his\r\nmission,—“I am sent from the van. We came to a place where the mountains\r\nthrust down upon the sea and leave but a narrow road by the ocean. Your\r\nslaves found certain Hellenes, rebels against your benignant government,\r\nholding a wall and barring all passage to your army.”\r\n\r\n“And did you not forthwith seize these impudent wretches and drag them\r\nhither to be judged by me?”\r\n\r\n“Compassion, Omnipotence,”—the messenger trembled,—“they seemed sturdy,\r\nwell-armed rogues, and the way was narrow and steep where a score can face\r\na thousand. Therefore, your slave came straight with his tidings to the\r\never gracious king.”\r\n\r\n“Dog! Coward!” Xerxes plucked the whip from the charioteer’s hand and\r\nlashed it over the wretch’s shoulders. “By the _fravashi_, the soul of\r\nDarius my father, no man shall bring so foul a word to me and live!”\r\n\r\n“Compassion, Omnipotence, compassion!” groaned the man, writhing like a\r\nworm. Already the master-of-punishments was approaching to cover his face\r\nwith a towel, preparatory to the bow-string, but the royal anger spent\r\nitself just enough to avert a tragedy.\r\n\r\n“Your life is forfeit, but I am all too merciful! Take then three hundred\r\nstripes on the soles of your feet and live to be braver in the future.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand blessings on your benignity,” cried the captain, as they led\r\nhim away, “I congratulate myself that insignificant as I am the king yet\r\ndeigns to notice my existence even to recompense my shortcomings.”\r\n\r\n“Off,” ordered the bristling monarch, “or you die the death yet. And do\r\nyou, Mardonius, take Prexaspes, who somewhat knows this country, spur\r\nforward, and discover who are the madmen thus earning their destruction.”\r\n\r\nThe command was obeyed. Glaucon galloped beside the Prince, overtaking the\r\nmarching army, until as they cantered into the little mud-walled city of\r\nHeraclea a second messenger from the van met them with further details.\r\n\r\n“The pass is held by seven thousand Grecian men-at-arms. There are no\r\nAthenians. There are three hundred come from Sparta.”\r\n\r\n“And their chief?” asked Glaucon, leaning eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Is Leonidas of Lacedæmon.”\r\n\r\n“Then, O Mardonius,” spoke the Athenian, with a throb in his voice not\r\nthere an hour ago. “There will be battle.”\r\n\r\nSo, whether wise men or mad, the Hellenes were not to lay down their arms\r\nwithout one struggle, and Glaucon knew not whether to be sorry or to be\r\nproud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THERMOPYLÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nA rugged mountain, an inaccessible morass, and beyond that morass the sea:\r\nthe mountain thrusting so close upon the morass as barely to leave space\r\nfor a narrow wagon road. This was the western gate of Thermopylæ. Behind\r\nthe narrow defile the mountain and swamp-land drew asunder; in the still\r\nscanty opening hot springs gushed forth, sacred to Heracles, then again on\r\nthe eastern side Mt. Œta and the impenetrable swamp drew together, forming\r\nthe second of the “Hot Gates,”—the gates which Xerxes must unlock if he\r\nwould continue his march to Athens.\r\n\r\nThe Great King’s couriers reported that the stubborn Hellenes had cast a\r\nwall across the entrance, and that so far from showing terror at the\r\nadvent of majesty, were carelessly diverting themselves by athletic games,\r\nand by combing and adorning their hair, a fact which the “Lord Prexaspes”\r\nat least comprehended to mean that Leonidas and his Spartans were\r\npreparing for desperate battle. Nevertheless, it was hard to persuade the\r\nking that at last he confronted men who would resist him to his face.\r\nGlaucon said it. Demaratus, the outlawed Spartan, said it. Xerxes,\r\nhowever, remained angry and incredulous. Four long days he and his army\r\nsat before the pass, “because,” announced his couriers, “he wishes in his\r\nbenignity to give these madmen a chance to flee away and shun\r\ndestruction;” “because,” spoke those nearest to Mardonius, the brain of\r\nthe army, “there is hot fighting ahead, and the general is resolved to\r\nbring up the picked troops in the rear before risking a battle.”\r\n\r\nThen on the fifth day either Xerxes’s patience was exhausted or Mardonius\r\nfelt ready. Strong regiments of Median infantry were ordered to charge\r\nLeonidas’s position, Xerxes not failing to command that they slay as few\r\nof the wretches as possible, but drag them prisoners before his outraged\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nA noble charge. A terrible repulse. For the first time those Asiatics who\r\nhad forgotten Marathon discovered the overwhelming superiority that the\r\nsheathing of heavy armour gave the Greek hoplites over the lighter armed\r\nMedian spearmen. The short lances and wooden targets of the attackers were\r\npitifully futile against the long spears and brazen shields of the\r\nHellenes. In the narrow pass the vast numbers of Barbarians went for\r\nnothing. They could not use their archers, they could not charge with\r\ntheir magnificent cavalry. The dead lay in heaps. The Medes attacked again\r\nand again. At last an end came to their courage. The captains laid the\r\nlash over their mutinous troops. The men bore the whips in sullen silence.\r\nThey would not charge again upon those devouring spears.\r\n\r\nWhite with anger, Xerxes turned to Hydarnes and his “Immortals,” the\r\ninfantry of the Life Guard. The general needed no second bidding. The\r\ncharge was driven home with magnificent spirit. But what the vassal Medes\r\ncould not accomplish, neither could the lordly Persians. The repulse was\r\nbloody. If once Leonidas’s line broke and the Persians rushed on with\r\nhowls of triumph, it was only to see the Hellenes’ files close in a\r\ntwinkling and return to the onset with their foes in confusion. Hydarnes\r\nled back his men at last. The king sat on the ivory throne just out of\r\narrow shot, watching the ebb and flow of the battle. Hydarnes approached\r\nand prostrated himself.\r\n\r\n“Omnipotence, I the least of your slaves put my life at your bidding.\r\nCommand that I forfeit my head, but my men can do no more. I have lost\r\nhundreds. The pass is not to be stormed.”\r\n\r\nOnly the murmur of assent from all the well-tried generals about the\r\nthrone saved Hydarnes from paying the last penalty. The king’s rage was\r\nfearful; men trembled to look on him. His words came so thick, the rest\r\ncould never follow all his curses and commands. Only Mardonius was bold\r\nenough to stand up before his face.\r\n\r\n“Your Eternity, this is an unlucky day. Is it not sacred to Angra-Mainyu\r\nthe Evil? The arch-Magian says the holy fire gives forth sparks of\r\nill-omen. Wait, then, till to-morrow. Verethraghna, the Angel of Victory,\r\nwill then return to your servants.”\r\n\r\nThe bow-bearer led his trembling master to the royal tent, and naught more\r\nof Xerxes was seen till the morning. All that night Mardonius never slept,\r\nbut went unceasingly the round of the host preparing for battle. Glaucon\r\nsaw little of him. The Athenian himself had been posted among the guard of\r\nnobles directly about the person of the king, and he was glad he was set\r\nnowhere else, otherwise he might have been ordered to join in the attack.\r\nLike every other in the host, he slept under arms, and never returned to\r\nMardonius’s pavilion. His heart had been in his eyes all that day. He had\r\nbelieved Leonidas would be swept from the pass at the first onset. Even he\r\nhad underrated the Spartan prowess. The repulse of the Medes had\r\nastonished him. When Hydarnes reeled back, he could hardly conceal his\r\njoy. The Hellenes were fighting! The Hellenes were conquering! He forgot\r\nhe stood almost at Xerxes’s side when the last charge failed; and barely\r\nin time did he save himself from joining in the shout of triumph raised by\r\nthe defenders when the decimated Immortals slunk away. He had grown\r\nintensely proud of his countrymen, and when he heard the startled Persian\r\nlords muttering dark forbodings of the morrow, he all but laughed his\r\ngladness in their faces.\r\n\r\nSo the night passed for him: the hard earth for a bed, a water cruse\r\nwrapped in a cloak for a pillow. And just as the first red blush stole\r\nover the green Malian bay and the mist-hung hills of Eubœa beyond, he woke\r\nwith all the army. Mardonius had used the night well. Chosen contingents\r\nfrom every corps were ready. Cavalrymen had been dismounted. Heavy masses\r\nof Assyrian archers and Arabian slingers were advanced to prepare for the\r\nattack by overwhelming volleys. The Persian noblemen, stung to madness by\r\ntheir king’s reproaches and their own sense of shame, bound themselves by\r\nfearful oaths never to draw from the onset until victorious or dead. The\r\nattack itself was led by princes of the blood, royal half-brothers of the\r\nking. Xerxes sat again on the ivory throne, assured by every obsequious\r\ntongue that the sacred fire gave fair omens, that to-day was the day of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe attack was magnificent. For an instant its fury seemed to carry the\r\nHellenes back. Where a Persian fell two stepped over him. The defenders\r\nwere swept against their wall. The Barbarians appeared to be storming it.\r\nThen like the tide the battle turned. The hoplites, locking shields,\r\npresented an impenetrable spear hedge. The charge spent itself in empty\r\npromise. Mardonius, who had been in the thickest, nevertheless drew off\r\nhis men skilfully and prepared to renew the combat.\r\n\r\nIn the interval Glaucon, standing by the king, could see a short, firm\r\nfigure in black armour going in and out among the Hellenes, ordering their\r\narray—Leonidas—he needed no bird to tell him. And as the Athenian stood\r\nand watched, saw the Persians mass their files for another battering\r\ncharge, saw the Great King twist his beard whilst his gleaming eyes\r\nfollowed the fate of his army, an impulse nigh irresistible came over him\r\nto run one short bow-shot to that opposite array, and cry in his own Greek\r\ntongue:—\r\n\r\n“I am a Hellene, too! Look on me come to join you, to live and die with\r\nyou, with my face against the Barbarian!”\r\n\r\nCruel the fate that set him here, impotent, when on that band of\r\ncountrymen Queen Nikē was shedding bright glory!\r\n\r\nBut he was “Glaucon the Traitor” still, to be awarded the traitor’s doom\r\nby Leonidas. Therefore the “Lord Prexaspes” must stand at his post,\r\nguarding the king of the Aryans.\r\n\r\nThe second charge was as the first, the third was as the second. Mardonius\r\nwas full of recourses. By repeated attacks he strove to wear the stubborn\r\nHellenes down. The Persians proved their courage seven times. Ten of them\r\ndied gladly, if their deaths bought that of a single foe. But few as were\r\nLeonidas’s numbers, they were not so few as to fail to relieve one another\r\nat the front of the press,—which front was fearfully narrow. And three\r\ntimes, as his men drifted back in defeat, Xerxes the king “leaped from the\r\nthrone whereon he sat, in anguish for his army.”\r\n\r\nAt noon new contingents from the rear took the place of the exhausted\r\nattackers. The sun beat down with unpitying heat. The wounded lay\r\nsweltering in their agony whilst the battle roared over them. Mardonius\r\nnever stopped to count his dead. Then at last came nightfall. Man could do\r\nno more. As the shadows from Œta grew long over the close scene of combat,\r\neven the proudest Persians turned away. They had lost thousands. Their\r\ndefeat was absolute. Before them and to westward and far away ranged the\r\njagged mountains, report had it, unthreaded by a single pass. To the\r\neastward was only the sea,—the sea closed to them by the Greek fleet at\r\nthe unseen haven of Artemisium. Was the triumph march of the Lord of the\r\nWorld to end in this?\r\n\r\nXerxes spoke no word when they took him to his tent that night, a sign of\r\nindescribable anger. Fear, humiliation, rage—all these seemed driving him\r\nmad. His chamberlains and eunuchs feared to approach to take off his\r\ngolden armour. Mardonius came to the royal tent; the king, with curses he\r\nhad never hurled against the bow-bearer before, refused to see him. The\r\nbattle was ended. No one was hardy enough to talk of a fresh attack on the\r\nmorrow. Every captain had to report the loss of scores of his best. As\r\nGlaucon rode back to Mardonius’s tents, he overheard two infantry\r\nofficers:—\r\n\r\n“A fearful day—the bow-bearer is likely to pay for it. I hope his Majesty\r\nconfines his anger only to him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—Mardonius will walk the Chinvat bridge to-morrow. The king is turning\r\nagainst him. Megabyzus is the bow-bearer’s enemy, and already is gone to\r\nhis Majesty to say that it is Mardonius’s blunders that have brought the\r\narmy to such a plight. The king will catch at that readily.”\r\n\r\nAt the tents Glaucon found Artazostra and Roxana. They were both pale. The\r\nnews of the great defeat had been brought by a dozen messengers. Mardonius\r\nhad not arrived. He was not slain, that was certain, but Artazostra feared\r\nthe worst. The proud daughter of Darius found it hard to bear up.\r\n\r\n“My husband has many enemies. Hitherto the king’s favour has allowed him\r\nto mock them. But if my brother deserts him, his ruin is speedy. Ah!\r\nAhura-Mazda, why hast Thou suffered us to see this day?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon said what he could of comfort, which was little. Roxana wept\r\npiteously; he was fain to soothe her by his caress,—something he had never\r\nventured before. Artazostra was on the point of calling her eunuchs and\r\nsetting forth for Xerxes’s tent to plead for the life of her husband, when\r\nsuddenly Pharnuches, Mardonius’s body-servant, came with news that\r\ndispelled at least the fears of the women.\r\n\r\n“I am bidden to tell your Ladyships that my master has silenced the\r\ntongues of his enemies and is restored to the king’s good favor. And I am\r\nbidden also to command the Lord Prexaspes to come to the royal tent. His\r\nMajesty has need of him.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon went, questioning much as to the service to be required. He did\r\nnot soon forget the scene that followed. The great pavilion was lit by a\r\nscore of resinous flambeaux. The red light shook over the green and purple\r\nhangings, the silver plating of the tent-poles. At one end rose the golden\r\nthrone of the king; before it in a semicircle the stools of a dozen or\r\nmore princes and commanders. In the centre stood Mardonius questioning a\r\ncoarse-featured, ill-favoured fellow, who by his sheepskin dress and\r\nleggings Glaucon instantly recognized as a peasant of this Malian country.\r\nThe king beckoned the Athenian into the midst and was clearly too eager to\r\nstand on ceremony.\r\n\r\n“Your Greek is better than Mardonius’s, good Prexaspes. In a matter like\r\nthis we dare not trust too many interpreters. This man speaks the rough\r\ndialect of his country, and few can understand him. Can you interpret?”\r\n\r\n“I am passing familiar with the Locrian and Malian dialect, your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Question this man further as to what he will do for us. We have\r\nunderstood him but lamely.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon proceeded to comply. The man, who was exceeding awkward and ill at\r\nease in such august company, spoke an outrageous shepherd’s jargon which\r\neven the Athenian understood with effort. But his business came out\r\nspeedily. He was Ephialtes, the son of one Eurydemus, a Malian, a\r\ndull-witted grazier of the country, brought to Mardonius by hope of\r\nreward. The general, partly understanding his purpose, had brought him to\r\nthe king. In brief, he was prepared, for due compensation, to lead the\r\nPersians by an almost unknown mountain path over the ridge of Œta and to\r\nthe rear of Leonidas’s position at Thermopylæ, where the Hellenes,\r\nassailed front and rear, would inevitably be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs Glaucon interpreted, the shout of relieved gladness from the Persian\r\ngrandees made the tent-cloths shake. Xerxes’s eyes kindled. He clapped his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Reward? He shall have ten talents! But where? How?”\r\n\r\nThe man asserted that the path was easy and practicable for a large body\r\nof troops. He had often been over it with his sheep and goats. If the\r\nPersians would start a force at once—it was already quite dark—they could\r\nfall upon Leonidas at dawn. The Spartan would be completely trapped, or\r\nforced to open the defile without another spear thrust.\r\n\r\n“A care, fellow,” warned Mardonius, regarding the man sharply; “you speak\r\nglibly, but if this is a trick to lead a band of the king’s servants to\r\ndestruction, understand you play with deadly dice. If the troops march,\r\nyou shall have your hands knotted together and a soldier walking behind to\r\ncut your throat at the first sign of treachery.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon interpreted the threat. The man did not wince.\r\n\r\n“There is no trap. I will guide you.”\r\n\r\nThat was all they could get him to say.\r\n\r\n“And do not the Hellenes know of this mountain path and guard it?”\r\npersisted the bow-bearer.\r\n\r\nEphialtes thought not; at least if they had, they had not told off any\r\nefficient detachment to guard it. Hydarnes cut the matter short by rising\r\nfrom his stool and casting himself before the king.\r\n\r\n“A boon, your Eternity, a boon!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the monarch.\r\n\r\n“The Immortals have been disgraced. Twice they have been repulsed with\r\nignominy. The shame burns hot in their breasts. Suffer them to redeem\r\ntheir honour. Suffer me to take this man and all the infantry of the Life\r\nGuard, and at dawn the Lord of the World shall see his desire over his\r\nmiserable enemies.”\r\n\r\n“The words of Hydarnes are good,” added Mardonius, incisively, and Xerxes\r\nbeamed and nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“Go, scale the mountain with the Immortals and tell this Ephialtes there\r\nawait him ten talents and a girdle of honour if the thing goes well; if\r\nill, let him be flayed alive and his skin be made the head of a\r\nkettledrum.”\r\n\r\nThe stolid peasant did not blench even at this. Glaucon remained in the\r\ntent, translating and hearing all the details: how Hydarnes was to press\r\nthe attack from the rear at early dawn, how Mardonius was to conduct\r\nanother onset from the front. At last the general of the guard knelt\r\nbefore the king for the last time.\r\n\r\n“Thus I go forth, Omnipotence, and to-morrow, behold your will upon your\r\nenemies, or behold me never more.”\r\n\r\n“I have faithful slaves,” said Xerxes, rising and smiling benignantly upon\r\nthe general and the bow-bearer. “Let us disperse, but first let command be\r\ngiven the Magians to cry all night to Mithra and Tishtrya, and to\r\nsacrifice to them a white horse.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty always enlists the blessings of heaven for your servants,”\r\nbowed Mardonius, as the company broke up and the king went away to his\r\ninner tent and his concubines. Glaucon lingered until most of the grandees\r\nhad gone forth, then the bow-bearer went to him.\r\n\r\n“Go back to my tents,” ordered Mardonius; “tell Artazostra and Roxana that\r\nall is well, that Ahura has delivered me from a great strait and restored\r\nme to the king’s favour, and that to-morrow the gate of Hellas will be\r\nopened.”\r\n\r\n“You are still bloody and dusty. You have watched all last night and been\r\nin the thick all day,” expostulated the Athenian; “come to the tents with\r\nme and rest.”\r\n\r\nThe bow-bearer shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No rest until to-morrow, and then the rest of victory or a longer one.\r\nNow go; the women are consuming with their care.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon wandered back through the long avenues of pavilions. The lights of\r\ninnumerable camp-fires, the hum of thousands of voices, the snorting of\r\nhorses, the grumbling of camels, the groans of men wounded—all these and\r\nall other sights and sounds from the countless host were lost to him. He\r\nwalked on by a kind of animal instinct that took him to Mardonius’s\r\nencampment through the mazes of the canvas city. It was dawning on him\r\nwith a terrible clearness that he was become a traitor to Hellas in very\r\ndeed. It was one thing to be a passive onlooker of a battle, another to be\r\na participant in a plot for the ruin of Leonidas. Unless warned betimes\r\nthe Spartan king and all who followed him infallibly would be captured or\r\nslaughtered to a man. And he had heard all—the traitor, the discussion,\r\nthe design—had even, if without his choice, been partner and helper in the\r\nsame. The blood of Leonidas and his men would be on his head. Every curse\r\nthe Athenians had heaped on him once unjustly, he would deserve. Now truly\r\nhe would be, even in his own mind’s eyes, “Glaucon the Traitor, partner to\r\nthe betrayal of Thermopylæ.” The doltish peasant, lured by the great\r\nreward, he might forgive,—himself, the high-born Alcmæonid, never.\r\n\r\nFrom this revery he was shaken by finding himself at the entrance to the\r\ntents of Mardonius. Artazostra and Roxana came to meet him. When he told\r\nof the deliverance of the bow-bearer, he had joy by the light in their\r\neyes. Roxana had never shone in greater beauty. He spoke of the heat of\r\nthe sun, of his throbbing head. The women bathed his forehead with\r\nlavender-water, touching him with their own soft hands. Roxana sang again\r\nto him, a low, crooning song of the fragrant Nile, the lotus bells, the\r\nnodding palms, the perfumed breeze from the desert. Whilst he watched her\r\nthrough half-closed eyes, the visions of that day of battles left him. He\r\nsat wrapped in a dream world, far from stern realities of men and arms. So\r\nfor a while, as he lounged on the divans, following the play of the\r\ntorch-light on the face of Roxana as her long fingers plied the strings.\r\nWhat was it to him if Leonidas fought a losing battle? Was not his\r\nhappiness secure—be it in Hellas, or Egypt, or Bactria? He tried to\r\npersuade himself thus. At the end, when he and Roxana stood face to face\r\nfor the parting, he violated all Oriental custom, yet he knew her brother\r\nwould not be angry. He took her in his arms and gave her kiss for kiss.\r\n\r\nThen he went to his own tent to seek rest. But Hypnos did not come for a\r\nlong time with his poppies. Once out of the Egyptian’s presence the\r\nhaunting terror had returned, “Glaucon the Traitor!” Those three words\r\nwere always uppermost. At last, indeed, sleep came and as he slept he\r\ndreamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE THREE HUNDRED—AND ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Glaucon slept he found himself again in Athens. He was on the familiar\r\nway from the cool wrestling ground of the Academy and walking toward the\r\ncity through the suburb of Ceramicus. Just as he came to the three tall\r\npine trees before the gate, after he had passed the tomb of Solon, behold!\r\na fair woman stood in the path and looked on him. She was beyond mortal\r\nheight and of divine beauty, yet a beauty grave and stern. Her gray eyes\r\ncut to his heart like swords. On her right hand hovered a winged Victory,\r\non her shoulder rested an owl, at her feet twined a wise serpent, in her\r\nleft hand she bore the ægis, the shaggy goat-skin engirt with\r\nsnakes—emblem of Zeus’s lightnings. Glaucon knew that she was Athena\r\nPolias, the Warder of Athens, and lifted his hands to adore her. But she\r\nonly looked on him in silent anger. Fire seemed leaping from her eyes. The\r\nmore Glaucon besought, the more she turned away. Fear possessed him. “Woe\r\nis me,” he trembled, “I have enraged a terrible immortal.” Then suddenly\r\nthe woman’s countenance was changed. The ægis, the serpent, the Victory,\r\nall vanished; he saw Hermione before him, beautiful as on the day she ran\r\nto greet him at Eleusis, yet sad as was his last sight of her the moment\r\nhe fled from Colonus. Seized with infinite longing, he sprang to her. But\r\nlo! she drifted back as into the air. It was even as when Odysseus\r\nfollowed the shade of his mother in the shadowy Land of the Dead.\r\n\r\n  “Yearned he sorely then to clasp her,\r\n    Thrice his arms were opened wide:\r\n  From his hands so strong, so loving,\r\n    Like a dream she seemed to glide,\r\n  And away, away she flitted,\r\n    Whilst he grasped the empty space,\r\n  And a pain shot through him, maddening,\r\n    As he strove for her embrace.”\r\n\r\nHe pursued, she drifted farther, farther. Her face was inexpressibly\r\nsorrowful. And Glaucon knew that she spoke to him.\r\n\r\n“I have believed you innocent, though all Athens calls you ‘traitor.’ I\r\nhave been true to you, though all men rise up against me. In what manner\r\nhave you kept your innocence? Have you had love for another, caresses for\r\nanother, kisses for another? How will you prove your loyalty to Athens and\r\nreturn?”\r\n\r\n“Hermione!” Glaucon cried, not in his dream, but quite aloud. He awoke\r\nwith a start. Outside the tent sentry was calling to sentry, changing the\r\nwatch just before the dawning. It was perfectly plain to him what he must\r\ndo. His dream had only given shape to the ferment in his brain, a ferment\r\nnever ceasing while his body slept. He must go instantly to the Greek camp\r\nand warn Leonidas. If the Spartan did not trust him, no matter, he had\r\ndone his duty. If Leonidas slew him on the spot, again no matter, life\r\nwith an eternally gnawing conscience could be bought on too hard terms. He\r\nknew, as though Zeus’s messenger Iris had spoken it, that Hermione had\r\nnever believed him guilty, that she had been in all things true to him. He\r\ncould never betray her trust.\r\n\r\nHis head now was clear and calm. He arose, threw on his cloak, and buckled\r\nabout his waist a short sword. The Nubian boy that Mardonius had given him\r\nfor a body-servant awoke on his mat, and asked wonderingly “whither his\r\nLordship was going?” Glaucon informed him he must be at the front before\r\ndaybreak, and bade him remain behind and disturb no one. But the Athenian\r\nwas not to execute his design unhindered. As he passed out of the tent and\r\ninto the night, where the morning stars were burning, and where the first\r\nred was creeping upward from the sea, two figures glided forth from the\r\nnext pavilion. He knew them and shrank from them. They were Artazostra and\r\nRoxana.\r\n\r\n“You go forth early, dearest Prexaspes,” spoke the Egyptian, throwing back\r\nher veil, and even in the starlight he saw the anxious flash of her eyes,\r\n“does the battle join so soon that you take so little sleep?”\r\n\r\n“It joins early, lady,” spoke Glaucon, his wits wandering. In the\r\nintensity of his purpose he had not thought of the partings with the\r\npeople he must henceforth reckon foes. He was sorely beset, when Roxana\r\ndrew near and laid her hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Your Greeks will resist terribly,” she spoke. “We women dread the battle\r\nmore than you. Yours is the fierce gladness of the combat, ours only the\r\nwaiting, the heavy tidings, the sorrow. Therefore Artazostra and I could\r\nnot sleep, but have been watching together. You will of course be near\r\nMardonius my brother. You will guard him from all danger. Leonidas will\r\nresist fearfully when at bay. Ah! what is this?”\r\n\r\nIn pressing closer she had discovered the Athenian wore no cuirass.\r\n\r\n“You will not risk the battle without armour?” was her cry.\r\n\r\n“I shall not need it, lady,” answered he, and only half conscious what he\r\ndid, stretched forth as if to put her away. Roxana shrank back, grieved\r\nand wondering, but Artazostra seized his arm quickly.\r\n\r\n“What is this, Prexaspes? All is not well. Your manner is strange!”\r\n\r\nHe shook her off, almost savagely.\r\n\r\n“Call me not Prexaspes,” he cried, not in Persian, but in Greek. “I am\r\nGlaucon of Athens; as Glaucon I must live, as Glaucon die. No man—not\r\nthough he desire it—can disown the land that bore him. And if I dreamed I\r\nwas a Persian, I wake to find myself a Greek. Therefore forget me forever.\r\nI go to my own!”\r\n\r\n“Prexaspes, my lover,”—Roxana, strong in fear and passion, clung about his\r\ngirdle, while again Artazostra seized him,—“last night I was in your arms.\r\nLast night you kissed me. Are we not to be happy together? What is this\r\nyou say?”\r\n\r\nHe stood one instant silent, then shook himself and put them both aside\r\nwith a marvellous ease.\r\n\r\n“Forget my name,” he commanded. “If I have given you sorrow, I repent it.\r\nI go to my own. Go you to yours. My place is with Leonidas—to save him, or\r\nmore like to die with him! Farewell!”\r\n\r\nHe sprang away from them. He saw Roxana sink upon the ground. He heard\r\nArtazostra calling to the horse-boys and the eunuchs,—perhaps she bade\r\nthem to pursue. Once he looked back, but never twice. He knew the\r\nwatchwords, and all the sentries let him pass by freely. With a feverish\r\nstride he traced the avenues of sleeping tents. Soon he was at the\r\noutposts, where strong divisions of Cissian and Babylonian infantrymen\r\nwere slumbering under arms, ready for the attack the instant the uproar\r\nfrom the rear of the pass told how Hydarnes had completed his circuit.\r\nEos—“Rosy-Fingered Dawn”—was just shimmering above the mist-hung peak of\r\nMt. Telethrius in Eubœa across the bay when Glaucon came to the last\r\nPersian outpost. The pickets saluted with their lances, as he went by\r\nthem, taking him for a high officer on a reconnoissance before the onset.\r\nNext he was on the scene of the former battles. He stumbled over riven\r\nshields, shattered spear butts, and many times over ghastlier\r\nobjects—objects yielding and still warm—dead men, awaiting the crows of\r\nthe morrow. He walked straight on, while the dawn strengthened and the\r\nnarrow pass sprang into view, betwixt mountain and morass. Then at last a\r\nchallenge, not in Persian, but in round clear Doric.\r\n\r\n“Halt! Who passes?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon held up his right hand, and advanced cautiously. Two men in heavy\r\narmour approached, and threatened his breast with their lance points.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“A friend, a Hellene—my speech tells that. Take me to Leonidas. I’ve a\r\nstory worth telling.”\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_ Master ‘Friend,’ our general can’t be waked for every deserter.\r\nWe’ll call our decarch.”\r\n\r\nA shout brought the subaltern commanding the Greek outposts. He was a\r\nSpartan of less sluggish wits than many of his breed, and presently\r\nbelieved Glaucon when he declared he had reason in asking for Leonidas.\r\n\r\n“But your accent is Athenian?” asked the decarch, with wonderment.\r\n\r\n“Ay, Athenian,” assented Glaucon.\r\n\r\n“Curses on you! I thought no Athenian ever Medized. What business had\r\n_you_ in the Persian camp? Who of your countrymen are there save the sons\r\nof Hippias?”\r\n\r\n“Not many,” rejoined the fugitive, not anxious to have the questions\r\npushed home.\r\n\r\n“Well, to Leonidas you shall go, sir Athenian, and state your business.\r\nBut you are like to get a bearish welcome. Since your pretty Glaucon’s\r\ntreason, our king has not wasted much love even on repentant traitors.”\r\n\r\nWith a soldier on either side, the deserter was marched within the barrier\r\nwall. Another encampment, vastly smaller and less luxurious than the\r\nPersian, but of martial orderliness, spread out along the pass. The\r\nHellenes were just waking. Some were breakfasting from helmets full of\r\ncold boiled peas, others buckled on the well-dinted bronze cuirasses and\r\ngreaves. Men stared at Glaucon as he was led by them.\r\n\r\n“A deserter they take to the chief,” ran the whisper, and a little knot of\r\nidle Spartans trailed behind, when at last Glaucon’s guides halted him\r\nbefore a brown tent barely larger than the others.\r\n\r\nA man sat on a camp chest by the entrance, and was busy with an iron spoon\r\neating “black broth”(9) from a huge kettle. In the dim light Glaucon could\r\njust see that he wore a purple cloak flung over his black armour, and that\r\nthe helmet resting beside him was girt by a wreath of gold foil.\r\n\r\nThe two guards dropped their spears in salute. The man looked upward.\r\n\r\n“A deserter,” reported one of Glaucon’s mentors; “he says he has important\r\nnews.”\r\n\r\n“Wait!” ordered the general, making the iron spoon clack steadily.\r\n\r\n“The weal of Hellas rests thereon. Listen!” pleaded the nervous Athenian.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” was the unruffled answer, and still the iron spoon went on plying.\r\nThe Spartan lifted a huge morsel from the pot, chewed it deliberately,\r\nthen put the vessel by. Next he inspected the newcomer from head to toe,\r\nthen at last gave his permission.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon’s words were like a bursting torrent.\r\n\r\n“Fly, your Excellency! I’m from Xerxes’s camp. I was at the Persian\r\ncouncil. The mountain path is betrayed. Hydarnes and the guard are almost\r\nover it. They will fall upon your rear. Fly, or you and all your men are\r\ntrapped!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” observed the Spartan, slowly, motioning for the deserter to cease,\r\nbut Glaucon’s fears made that impossible.\r\n\r\n“I say I was in Xerxes’s own tent. I was interpreter betwixt the king and\r\nthe traitor. I know all whereof I say. If you do not flee instantly, the\r\nblood of these men is on your head.”\r\n\r\nLeonidas again scanned the deserter with piercing scrutiny, then flung a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\nThe blood leaped into the Athenian’s cheeks. The tongue that had wagged so\r\nnimbly clove in his mouth. He grew silent.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\nAs the question was repeated, the scrutiny grew yet closer. The soldiers\r\nwere pressing around, one comrade leaning over another’s shoulder. Twenty\r\nsaw the fugitive’s form straighten as he stood in the morning twilight.\r\n\r\n“I am Glaucon of Athens, Isthmionices!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Leonidas’s jaw dropped for an instant. He showed no other\r\nastonishment, but the listening Spartans raised a yell.\r\n\r\n“Death! Stone the traitor!”\r\n\r\nLeonidas, without a word, smote the man nearest to him with a spear butt.\r\nThe soldiers were silent instantly. Then the chief turned back to the\r\ndeserter.\r\n\r\n“Why here?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon had never prayed for the gifts of Peitho, “Our Lady Persuasion,”\r\nmore than at that crucial moment. Arguments, supplications, protestations\r\nof innocence, curses upon his unknown enemies, rushed to his lips\r\ntogether. He hardly realized what he himself said. Only he knew that at\r\nthe end the soldiers did not tug at their hilts as before and scowl so\r\nthreateningly, and Leonidas at last lifted his hand as if to bid him\r\ncease.\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_” grunted the chief. “So you wish me to believe you a victim of\r\nfate, and trust your story? The pass is turned, you say? Masistes the seer\r\nsaid the libation sputtered on the flame with ill-omen when he sacrificed\r\nthis morning. Then you come. The thing shall be looked into. Call the\r\ncaptains.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe locharchs and taxiarchs of the Greeks assembled. It was a brief and\r\ngloomy council of war. While Euboulus, commanding the Corinthian\r\ncontingent, was still questioning whether the deserter was worthy of\r\ncredence, a scout came running down Mt. Œta confirming the worst. The\r\ncowardly Phocians watching the mountain trail had fled at the first arrows\r\nof Hydarnes. It was merely a question of time before the Immortals would\r\nbe at Alpeni, the village in Leonidas’s rear. There was only one thing to\r\nsay, and the Spartan chief said it.\r\n\r\n“You must retreat.”\r\n\r\nThe taxiarchs of the allied Hellenes under him were already rushing forth\r\nto their men to bid them fly for dear life. Only one or two stayed by the\r\ntent, marvelling much to observe that Leonidas gave no orders to his\r\nLacedæmonians to join in the flight. On the contrary, Glaucon, as he stood\r\nnear, saw the general lift the discarded pot of broth and explore it again\r\nwith the iron spoon.\r\n\r\n“O Father Zeus,” cried the incredulous Corinthian leader. “Are you turned\r\nmad, Leonidas?”\r\n\r\n“Time enough for all things,” returned the unmoved Spartan, continuing his\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n“Time!” shouted Euboulus. “Have we not to flee on wings, or be cut off?”\r\n\r\n“Fly, then.”\r\n\r\n“But you and your Spartans?”\r\n\r\n“We will stay.”\r\n\r\n“Stay? A handful against a million? Do I hear aright? What can you do?”\r\n\r\n“Die.”\r\n\r\n“The gods forbid! Suicide is a fearful end. No man should rush on\r\ndestruction. What requires you to perish?”\r\n\r\n“Honour.”\r\n\r\n“Honour! Have you not won glory enough by holding Xerxes’s whole power at\r\nbay two days? Is not your life precious to Hellas? What is the gain?”\r\n\r\n“Glory to Sparta.”\r\n\r\nThen in the red morning half-light, folding his big hands across his\r\nmailed chest, Leonidas looked from one to another of the little circle.\r\nHis voice was still in unemotional gutturals when he delivered the longest\r\nspeech of his life.\r\n\r\n“We of Sparta were ordered to defend this pass. The order shall be obeyed.\r\nThe rest of you must go away—all save the Thebans, whose loyalty I\r\ndistrust. Tell Leotychides, my colleague at Sparta, to care for Gorgo my\r\nwife and Pleistarchus my young son, and to remember that Themistocles the\r\nAthenian loves Hellas and gives sage counsel. Pay Strophius of Epidaurus\r\nthe three hundred drachmæ I owe him for my horse. Likewise—”\r\n\r\nA second breathless scout interrupted with the tidings that Hydarnes was\r\non the last stretches of his road. The chief arose, drew the helmet down\r\nacross his face, and motioned with his spear.\r\n\r\n“Go!” he ordered.\r\n\r\nThe Corinthian would have seized his hand. He shook him off. At Leonidas’s\r\nelbow was standing the trumpeter for his three hundred from Lacedæmon.\r\n\r\n“Blow!” commanded the chief.\r\n\r\nThe keen blast cut the air. The chief deliberately wrapped the purple\r\nmantle around himself and adjusted the gold circlet over his helmet, for\r\non the day of battle a Lacedæmonian was wont to wear his best. And even as\r\nhe waited there came to him out of the midst of the panic-stricken,\r\ndissolving camp, one by one, tall men in armour, who took station beside\r\nhim—the men of Sparta who had abided steadfast while all others prepared\r\nto flee, waiting for the word of the chief.\r\n\r\nPresently they stood, a long black line, motionless, silent, whilst the\r\nother divisions filed in swift fear past. Only the Thespians—let their\r\nnames not be forgotten—chose to share the Laconians’ glory and their doom\r\nand took their stand behind the line of Leonidas. With them stood also the\r\nThebans, but compulsion held them, and they tarried merely to desert and\r\npawn their honour for their lives.\r\n\r\nMore couriers. Hydarnes’s van was in sight of Alpeni now. The retreat of\r\nthe Corinthians, Tegeans, and other Hellenes became a run; only once\r\nEuboulus and his fellow-captains turned to the silent warrior that stood\r\nleaning on his spear.\r\n\r\n“Are you resolved on madness, Leonidas?”\r\n\r\n“_Chaire!_ Farewell!” was the only answer he gave them. Euboulus sought no\r\nmore, but faced another figure, hitherto almost forgotten in the confusion\r\nof the retreat.\r\n\r\n“Haste, Master Deserter, the Barbarians will give you an overwarm welcome,\r\nand you are no Spartan; save yourself!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon did not stir.\r\n\r\n“Do you not see that it is impossible?” he answered, then strode across to\r\nLeonidas. “I must stay.”\r\n\r\n“Are you also mad? You are young—” The good-hearted Corinthian strove to\r\ndrag him into the retreating mob.\r\n\r\nGlaucon sprang away from him and addressed the silent general.\r\n\r\n“Shall not Athens remain by Sparta, if Sparta will accept?”\r\n\r\nHe could see Leonidas’s cold eyes gleam out through the slits in his\r\nhelmet. The general reached forth his hand.\r\n\r\n“Sparta accepts,” called he; “they have lied concerning your Medizing! And\r\nyou, Euboulus, do not filch from him his glory.”\r\n\r\n“Zeus pity you!” cried Euboulus, running at last. One of the Spartans\r\nbrought to Glaucon the heavy hoplite’s armour and the ponderous spear and\r\nshield. He took his place in the line with the others. Leonidas stalked to\r\nthe right wing of his scant array, the post of honour and of danger. The\r\nThespians closed up behind. Shield was set to shield. Helmets were drawn\r\nlow. The lance points projected in a bristling hedge in front. All was\r\nready.\r\n\r\nThe general made no speech to fire his men. There was no wailing, no\r\ncrying to the gods, no curses upon the tardy ephors at Lacedæmon who had\r\ndeferred sending their whole strong levy instead of the pitiful three\r\nhundred. Sparta had sent this band to hold the pass. They had gone,\r\nknowing she might require the supreme sacrifice. Leonidas had spoken for\r\nall his men. “Sparta demanded it.” What more was to be said?\r\n\r\nAs for Glaucon he could think of nothing save—in the language of his\r\npeople—“this was a beautiful manner and place in which to die.” “Count no\r\nman happy until he meets a happy end,” so had said Solon, and of all ends\r\nwhat could be more fortunate than this? Euboulus would tell in Athens, in\r\nall Hellas, how he had remained with Leonidas and maintained Athenian\r\nhonour when Corinthian and Tegean turned away. From “Glaucon the Traitor”\r\nhe would be raised to “Glaucon the Hero.” Hermione, Democrates, and all\r\nothers he loved would flush with pride and no more with shame when men\r\nspoke of him. Could a life of a hundred years add to his glory more than\r\nhe could win this day?\r\n\r\n“Blow!” commanded Leonidas again, and again pealed the trumpet. The line\r\nmoved beyond the wall toward Xerxes’s camp in the open beside the Asopus.\r\nWhy wait for Hydarnes’s coming? They would meet the king of the Aryans\r\nface to face and show him the terrible manner in which the men of\r\nLacedæmon knew how to die.\r\n\r\nAs they passed from the shadow of the mountain, the sun sprang over the\r\nhills of Eubœa, making fire of the bay and bathing earth and heavens with\r\nglory. In their rear was already shouting. Hydarnes had reached his goal\r\nat Alpeni. All retreat was ended. The thin line swept onward. Before them\r\nspread the whole host of the Barbarian as far as the eye could reach,—a\r\ntossing sea of golden shields, scarlet surcoats, silver\r\nlance-heads,—awaiting with its human billows to engulf them. The Laconians\r\nhalted just beyond bow shot. The line locked tighter. Instinctively every\r\nman pressed closer to his comrade. Then before the eyes of Xerxes’s host,\r\nwhich kept silence, marvelling, the handful broke forth with their pæan.\r\nThey threw their well-loved charging song of Tyrtæus in the very face of\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\n  “Press the charge, O sons of Sparta!\r\n  Ye are sons of men born free:\r\n  Press the charge; ’tis where the shields lock,\r\n  That your sires would have you be!\r\n  Honour’s cheaply sold for life,\r\n  Press the charge, and join the strife:\r\n  Let the coward cling to breath,\r\n  Let the base shrink back from death,\r\n  _Press the charge, let cravens flee!_”\r\n\r\nLeonidas’s spear pointed to the ivory throne, around which and him that\r\nsat thereon in blue and scarlet glittered the Persian grandees.\r\n\r\n“Onward!”\r\n\r\nImmortal ichor seemed in the veins of every Greek. They burst into one\r\nshout.\r\n\r\n“The king! The king!”\r\n\r\nA roar from countless drums, horns, and atabals answered from the\r\nBarbarians, as across the narrow plain-land charged the three hundred—and\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MARDONIUS GIVES A PROMISE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ugh—the dogs died hard, but they are dead,” grunted Xerxes, still\r\nshivering on the ivory throne. The battle had raged disagreeably close to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“They are dead; even so perish all of your Eternity’s enemies,” rejoined\r\nMardonius, close by. The bow-bearer himself was covered with blood and\r\ndust. A Spartan sword had grazed his forehead. He had exposed himself\r\nrecklessly, as well he might, for it had taken all the efforts of the\r\nPersian captains, as well as the ruthless laying of whips over the backs\r\nof their men, to make the king’s battalions face the frenzied Hellenes,\r\nuntil the closing in of Hydarnes from the rear gave the battle its\r\ninevitable ending.\r\n\r\nXerxes was victorious. The gate of Hellas was unlocked. The mountain wall\r\nof Œta would hinder him no more. But the triumph had been bought with a\r\nprice which made Mardonius and every other general in the king’s host\r\nshake his head.\r\n\r\n“Lord,” reported Hystaspes, commander of the Scythians, “one man in every\r\nseven of my band is slain, and those the bravest.”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” spoke Artabazus, who led the Parthians, “my men swear the Hellenes\r\nwere possessed by _dævas_. They dare not approach even their dead bodies.”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” asked Hydarnes, “will it please your Eternity to appoint five\r\nother officers in the Life Guard, for of my ten lieutenants over the\r\nImmortals five are slain?”\r\n\r\nBut the heaviest news no man save Mardonius dared to bring to the king.\r\n\r\n“May it please your Omnipotence,” spoke the bow-bearer, “to order the\r\nfuneral pyres of cedar and precious oils to be prepared for your brothers\r\nAbrocomes and Hyperanthes, and command the Magians to offer prayers for\r\nthe repose of their _fravashis_ in Garonmana the Blessed, for it pleased\r\nMazda the Great they should fall before the Hellenes.”\r\n\r\nXerxes waved his hand in assent. It was hard to be the “Lord of the\r\nWorld,” and be troubled by such little things as the deaths of a few\r\nthousand servants, or even of two of his numerous half-brethren, hard at\r\nleast on a day like this when he had seen his desire over his enemies.\r\n\r\n“They shall be well avenged,” he announced with kingly dignity, then\r\nsmiled with satisfaction when they brought him the shield and helmet of\r\nLeonidas, the madman, who had dared to contemn his power. But all the\r\ngenerals who stood by were grim and sad. One more such victory would bring\r\nthe army close to destruction.\r\n\r\nXerxes’s happiness, however, was not to be clouded. From childish fears he\r\nhad passed to childish exultation.\r\n\r\n“Have you found the body also of this crazed Spartan?” he inquired of the\r\ncavalry officer who had brought the trophies.\r\n\r\n“As you say, Omnipotence,” rejoined the captain, bowing in the saddle.\r\n\r\n“Good, then. Let the head be struck off and the trunk fastened on a cross\r\nthat all may see it. And you, Mardonius,” addressing the bow-bearer, “ride\r\nback to the hillock where these madmen made their last stand. If you\r\ndiscover among the corpses any who yet breathe, bring them hither to me,\r\nthat they may learn the futility of resisting my might.”\r\n\r\nThe bow-bearer shrugged his shoulders. He loved a fair battle and fair\r\ntreatment of valiant foes. The dishonouring of the corpse of Leonidas was\r\ndispleasing to more than one high-minded Aryan nobleman. But the king had\r\nspoken, and was to be obeyed. Mardonius rode back to the hillock at the\r\nmouth of the pass, where the Hellenes had retired—after their spears were\r\nbroken and they could resist only with swords, stones, or naked hands—for\r\nthe final death grip.\r\n\r\nThe slain Barbarians lay in heaps. The Greeks had been crushed at the end,\r\nnot in close strife, but by showers of arrows. Mardonius dismounted and\r\nwent with a few followers among the dead. Plunderers were already at their\r\nharpy work of stripping the slain. The bow-bearer chased them angrily\r\naway. He oversaw the task which his attendants performed as quickly as\r\npossible. Their toil was not quite fruitless. Three or four Thespians were\r\nstill breathing, a few more of the helots who had attended Leonidas’s\r\nSpartans, but not one of the three hundred but seemed dead, and that too\r\nwith many wounds.\r\n\r\nSnofru, Mardonius’s Egyptian body-servant, rose from the ghastly work and\r\ngrinned with his ivories at his master.\r\n\r\n“All the rest are slain, Excellency.”\r\n\r\n“You have not searched that pile yonder.”\r\n\r\nSnofru and his helpers resumed their toil. Presently the Egyptian dragged\r\nfrom a bloody heap a body, and raised a yell. “Another one—he breathes!”\r\n\r\n“There’s life in him. He shall not be left to the crows. Take him forth\r\nand lay him with the others that are living.”\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to roll the three corpses from their feebly stirring\r\ncomrade. When this was done, the stricken man was still encased in his\r\ncuirass and helmet. They saw only that his hands were slim and white.\r\n\r\n“With care,” ordered the humane bow-bearer, “he is a young man. I heard\r\nLeonidas took only older men on his desperate venture. Here, rascals, do\r\nyou not see he is smothered in that helmet? Lift him up, unbuckle the\r\ncuirass. By Mithra, he has a strong and noble form! Now the helmet—uncover\r\nthe face.”\r\n\r\nBut as the Egyptian did so, his master uttered a shout of mingled\r\nwonderment and terror.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon—Prexaspes, and in Spartan armour!”\r\n\r\nWhat had befallen Glaucon was in no wise miraculous. He had borne his part\r\nin the battle until the Hellenes fell back to the fatal hillock. Then in\r\none of the fierce onsets which the Barbarians attempted before they had\r\nrecourse to the simpler and less glorious method of crushing their foes by\r\narrow fire, a Babylonian’s war club had dashed upon his helmet. The stout\r\nbronze had saved him from wound, but under the stroke strength and\r\nconsciousness had left him in a flash. The moment after he fell, the\r\nsoldier beside him had perished by a javelin, and falling above the\r\nAthenian made his body a ghastly shield against the surge and trampling of\r\nthe battle. Glaucon lay scathless but senseless through the final\r\ncatastrophe. Now consciousness was returning, but he would have died of\r\nsuffocation save for Snofru’s timely aid.\r\n\r\nIt was well for the Athenian that Mardonius was a man of ready devices. He\r\nhad not seen Glaucon at his familiar post beside the king, but had\r\npresumed the Hellene had remained at the tents with the women, unwilling\r\nto watch the destruction of his people. In the rush and roar of the battle\r\nthe messenger Artazostra had sent her husband telling of “Prexaspes’s”\r\nflight had never reached him. But Mardonius could divine what had\r\nhappened. The swallow must fly south in the autumn. The Athenian had\r\nreturned to his own. The bow-bearer’s wrath at his protégé’s desertion was\r\novermastered by the consuming fear that tidings of Prexaspes’s disloyalty\r\nwould get to the king. Xerxes’s wrath would be boundless. Had he not\r\nproffered his new subject all the good things of his empire? And to be\r\nrewarded thus! Glaucon’s recompense would be to be sawn asunder or flung\r\ninto a serpent’s cage.\r\n\r\nFortunately Mardonius had only his own personal followers around him. He\r\ncould count on their discreet loyalty. Vouchsafing no explanations, but\r\nbidding them say not a word of their discovery on their heads, he ordered\r\nSnofru and his companions to make a litter of cloaks and lances, to throw\r\naway Glaucon’s tell-tale Spartan armour, and bear him speedily to\r\nArtazostra’s tents. The stricken man was groaning feebly, moving his\r\nlimbs, muttering incoherently. The sight of Xerxes driving in person to\r\ninspect the battle-field made Mardonius hasten the litter away, while he\r\nremained to parley with the king.\r\n\r\n“So only a few are alive?” asked Xerxes, leaning over the silver rail of\r\nthe chariot, and peering on the upturned faces of the dead which were\r\nnearly trampled by his horses. “Are any sound enough to set before me?”\r\n\r\n“None, your Eternity; even the handful that live are desperately wounded.\r\nWe have laid them yonder.”\r\n\r\n“Let them wait, then; all around here seem dead. Ugly hounds!” muttered\r\nthe monarch, still peering down; “even in death they seem to grit their\r\nteeth and defy me. Faugh! The stench is already terrible. It is just as\r\nwell they are dead. Angra-Mainyu surely possessed them to fight so! It\r\ncannot be there are many more who can fight like this left in Hellas,\r\nthough Demaratus, the Spartan outlaw, says there are. Drive away,\r\nPitiramphes—and you, Mardonius, ride beside me. I cannot abide those\r\ncorpses. Where is my handkerchief? The one with the Sabæan nard on it. I\r\nwill hold it to my nose. Most refreshing! And I had a question to ask—I\r\nhave forgotten what.”\r\n\r\n“Whether news has come from the fleets before Artemisium?” spoke\r\nMardonius, galloping close to the wheel.\r\n\r\n“Not that. Ah! I remember. Where was Prexaspes? I did not see him near me.\r\nDid he stay in the tents while these mad men were destroyed? It was not\r\nloyal, yet I forgive him. After all, he was once a Hellene.”\r\n\r\n“May it please your Eternity,”—Mardonius chose his words carefully,—a\r\nPersian always loved the truth, and lies to the king were doubly\r\nimpious,—“Prexaspes was not in the tents but in the thick of the battle.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Xerxes smiled pleasantly, “it was right loyal of him to show his\r\ndevotion to me thus. And he acquitted himself valiantly?”\r\n\r\n“Most valiantly, Omnipotence.”\r\n\r\n“Doubly good. Yet he ought to have stayed near me. If he had been a true\r\nPersian, he would not have withdrawn from the person of the king, even to\r\ndisplay his prowess in combat. Still he did well. Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“I regret to tell your Eternity he was desperately wounded, though your\r\nservant hopes not unto death. He is even now being taken to my tents.”\r\n\r\n“Where that pretty dancer, your sister, will play the surgeon—ha!” cried\r\nthe king. “Well, tell him his Lord is grateful. He shall not be forgotten.\r\nIf his wounds do not mend, call in my body-physicians. And I will send him\r\nsomething in gratitude—a golden cimeter, perhaps, or it may be another\r\ncream Nisæan charger.”\r\n\r\nA general rode up to the chariot with his report, and Mardonius was\r\nsuffered to gallop to his own tents, blessing Mazda; he had saved the\r\nAthenian, yet had not told a lie.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe ever ready eunuchs of Artazostra ran to tell Mardonius of the\r\nHellene’s strange desertion, even before their lord dismounted. Mardonius\r\nwas not astonished now, however much the tidings pained him. The Greek had\r\nescaped more than trifling wounds; ten days would see him sound and hale,\r\nbut the stunning blow had left his wits still wandering. He had believed\r\nhimself dead at first, and demanded why Charon took so long with his\r\nferry-boat. He had not recognized Roxana, but spoke one name many\r\ntimes—“Hermione!” And the Egyptian, understanding too well, went to her\r\nown tent weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n“He has forsaken us,” spoke Artazostra, harshly, to her husband. “He has\r\npaid kindness with disloyalty. He has chosen the lot of his desperate race\r\nrather than princely state amongst the Aryans. Your sister is in agony.”\r\n\r\n“And I with her,” returned the bow-bearer, gravely, “but let us not forget\r\none thing—this man has saved our lives. And all else weighs small in the\r\nbalance.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mardonius went to him, Glaucon was again himself. He lay on bright\r\npillows, his forehead swathed in linen. His eyes were unnaturally bright.\r\n\r\n“You know what has befallen?” asked Mardonius.\r\n\r\n“They have told me. I almost alone of all the Hellenes have not been\r\ncalled to the heroes’ Elysium, to the glory of Theseus and Achilles, the\r\nglory that shall not die. Yet I am content. For plainly the Olympians have\r\ndestined that I should see and do great things in Hellas, otherwise they\r\nwould not have kept me back from Leonidas’s glory.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian’s voice rang confidently. None of the halting weakness\r\nremained that had made it falter once when Mardonius asked him, “Will your\r\nHellenes fight?” He spoke as might one returned crowned with the victor’s\r\nlaurel.\r\n\r\n“And wherefore are you grown so bold?” The bow-bearer was troubled as he\r\nlooked on him. “Nobly you and your handful fought. We Persians honour the\r\nbrave, and full honour we give to you. But was it not graven upon the\r\nstars what should befall? Were not Leonidas, his men, and you all mad—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! divinely mad.” Brighter still grew the Athenian’s eyes. “For\r\nthat moment of exultation when we charged to meet the king I would again\r\npay a lifetime.”\r\n\r\n“Yet the gateway of Hellas is unlocked. Your bravest are fallen. Your land\r\nis defenceless. What else can be written hereafter save, ‘The Hellenes\r\nstrove with fierce courage to fling back Xerxes. Their valour was\r\nfoolishness. The god turned against them. The king prevailed.’ ”\r\n\r\nBut Glaucon met the Persian’s glance with one more bold.\r\n\r\n“No, Mardonius, good friend, for do not think that we must be foes one to\r\nanother because our people are at war,—I can answer you with ease.\r\nLeonidas you have slain, and his handful, and you have pierced the\r\nmountain wall of Œta, and no doubt your king’s host will march even to\r\nAthens. But do not dream Hellas is conquered by striding over her land.\r\nBefore you shall possess the land you must first possess the men. And I\r\nsay to you, Athens is still left, and Sparta left, free and strong, with\r\nmen whose hearts and hands can never fail. I doubted once. But now I doubt\r\nno more. And our gods will fight for us. Your Ahura-Mazda has still to\r\nprevail over Zeus the Thunderer and Athena of the Pure Heart.”\r\n\r\n“And you?” asked the Persian.\r\n\r\n“And as for me, I know I have cast away by my own act all the good things\r\nyou and your king would fain bestow upon me. Perhaps I deserve death at\r\nyour hands. I will never plead for respite, but this I know, whether I\r\nlive or die, it shall be as Glaucon of Athens who owns no king but Zeus,\r\nno loyalty save to the land that bore him.”\r\n\r\nThere was stillness in the tent. The wounded man sank back on the pillows,\r\nbreathing deep, closing his eyes, expectant almost of a burst of wrath\r\nfrom the Persian. But Mardonius answered without trace of anger.\r\n\r\n“Friend, your words cut keenly, and your boasts are high. Only the Most\r\nHigh knoweth whether you boast aright. Yet this I say, that much as I\r\ndesire your friendship, would see you my brother, even,—you know that,—I\r\ndare not tell you you do wholly wrong. A man is given one country and one\r\nmanner of faith in God. He does not choose them. I was born to serve the\r\nlord of the Aryans, and to spread the triumphs of Mithra the Glorious, and\r\nyou were born in Athens. I would it were otherwise. Artazostra and I would\r\nfain have made you Persian like ourselves. My sister loves you. Yet we\r\ncannot strive against fate. Will you go back to your own people and share\r\ntheir lot, however direful?”\r\n\r\n“Since life is given me, I will.”\r\n\r\nMardonius stepped to the bedside and gave the Athenian his right hand.\r\n\r\n“At the island you saved my life and that of my best beloved. Let it never\r\nbe said that Mardonius, son of Gobryas, is ungrateful. To-day, in some\r\nmeasure, I have repaid the debt I owe. If you will have it so, as speedily\r\nas your strength returns and opportunity offers I will return you to your\r\npeople. And amongst them may your own gods show you favour, for you will\r\nhave none from ours!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon took the proffered hand in silent gratitude. He was still very\r\nweak and rested on the pillows, breathing hard. The bow-bearer went out to\r\nhis wife and his sister and told his promise. There was little to be said.\r\nThe Athenian must go his path, and they go theirs, unless he were to be\r\nhanded over to Xerxes to die a death of torments. And not even Roxana,\r\nkeenly as pierced her sorrow, would think of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE DARKEST HOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nA city of two hundred thousand awaiting a common sentence of death,—such\r\nseemed the doom of Athens.\r\n\r\nEvery morning the golden majesty of the sun rose above the wall of\r\nHymettus, but few could lift their hands to Lord Helios and give praise\r\nfor another day of light. “Each sunrise brings Xerxes nearer.” The bravest\r\nforgot not that.\r\n\r\nYet Athens was never more truly the “Violet-Crowned City” than on these\r\nlast days before the fearful advent. The sun at morn on Hymettus, the sun\r\nat night on Daphni, the nightingales and cicadas in the olives by\r\nCephissus, the hum of bees on the sweet thyme of the mountain, the purple\r\nof the hills, the blue and the fire of the bay, the merry tinkle of the\r\ngoat bells upon the rocks, the laugh of little children in the streets—all\r\nthese made Athens fair, but could not take the cloud from the hearts of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nTrade was at standstill in the Agora. The most careless frequented the\r\ntemples. Old foes composed their cases before the arbitrator. The courts\r\nwere closed, but there was meeting after meeting in the Pnyx, with\r\nincessant speeches on one theme—how Athens must resist to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nAnd why should not the end be bitter? Argos and Crete had Medized. Corcyra\r\npromised and did nothing. Thebes was weakening. Thessaly had sent earth\r\nand water. Corinth, Ægina, and a few lesser states were moderately loyal,\r\nbut great Sparta only procrastinated and despatched no help to her\r\nAthenian ally. So every day the Persian thunder-cloud was darkening.\r\n\r\nBut one man never faltered, nor suffered others about him to\r\nfalter,—Themistocles. The people heard him gladly—he would never talk of\r\ndefeat. He had a thousand reasons why the invader should be baffled, from\r\na convenient hexameter in old Bacis’s oracle book, up to the fact that the\r\nGreeks used the longest spears. If he found it weary work looking the\r\ncrowding peril in the face and smiling still, he never confessed it. His\r\nfriends would marvel at his serenity. Only when they saw him sit silent,\r\nsaw his brows knit, his hand comb at his beard, they knew his\r\ninexhaustible brain was weaving the web which should ensnare the lord of\r\nthe Aryans.\r\n\r\nThus day after day—while men thought dark things in their hearts.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nHermippus had come down to his city house from Eleusis, and with him his\r\nwife and daughter. The Eleusinian was very busy. He was a member of the\r\nAreopagus, the old council of ex-archons, an experienced body that found\r\nmuch to do. Hermippus had strained his own resources to provide shields\r\nfor the hoplites. He was constantly with Themistocles, which implied being\r\nmuch with Democrates. The more he saw of the young orator, the better the\r\nEleusinian liked him. True, not every story ran to Democrates’s credit,\r\nbut Hermippus knew the world, and could forgive a young man if he had\r\noccasionally spent a jolly night. Democrates seemed to have forsworn\r\nIonian harp-girls now. His patriotism was self-evident. The Eleusinian saw\r\nin him a most desirable protector in the perils of war for Hermione and\r\nher child. Hermione’s dislike for her husband’s destroyer was\r\nnatural,—nay, in bounds, laudable,—but one must not give way too much to\r\nwomen’s phantasies. The lady was making a Cyclops of Democrates by sheer\r\nimagination; an interview would dispel her prejudices. Therefore Hermippus\r\nplanned, and his plan was not hard to execute.\r\n\r\nOn the day the fleet sailed to Artemisium, Hermione went with her mother\r\nto the havens, as all the city went, to wish godspeed to the “wooden wall”\r\nof Hellas.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-seven triremes were to go forth, and three and\r\nfifty to follow, bearing the best and bravest of Athens with them.\r\nThemistocles was in absolute command, and perhaps in his heart of hearts\r\nDemocrates was not mournful if it lay out of his power to do a second\r\nill-turn to his country.\r\n\r\nIt was again summer, and again such a day as when Glaucon with glad\r\nfriends had rowed toward Salamis. The Saronian bay flashed fairest azure.\r\nThe scattered isles and the headlands of Argolis rose in clear beauty. The\r\ncity had emptied itself. Mothers hung on the necks of sons as the latter\r\nstrode toward Peiræus; friends clasped hands for the last time as he who\r\nremained promised him who went that the wife and little ones should never\r\nbe forgotten. Only Hermione, as she stood on the hill of Munychia above\r\nthe triple havens, shed no tear. The ship bearing her all was gone long\r\nsince. Themistocles would never lead it back. Hermippus was at the quay in\r\nPeiræus, taking leave of the admiral. Old Cleopis held the babe as\r\nHermione stood by her mother. The younger woman had suffered her gaze to\r\nwander to far Ægina, where a featherlike cloud hung above the topmost\r\nsummit of the isle, when her mother’s voice called her back.\r\n\r\n“They go.”\r\n\r\nA line of streamers blew from the foremast of the _Nausicaä_ as the piper\r\non the flag-ship gave the time to the oars. The triple line of blades,\r\npumiced white, splashed with a steady rhythm. The long black hull glided\r\naway. The trailing line of consorts swiftly followed. From the hill and\r\nthe quays a shout uprose from the thousands, to be answered by the\r\nfleet,—a cheer or a prayer to sea-ruling Poseidon those who gave it hardly\r\nknew. The people stood silent till the last dark hull crept around the\r\nsouthern headland; then, still in silence, the multitudes dissolved. The\r\nyoung and the strong had gone from them. For Athens this was the beginning\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nHermione and Lysistra awaited Hermippus before setting homeward, but the\r\nEleusinian was delayed. The fleet had vanished. The havens were empty. In\r\nCleopis’s arms little Phœnix wept. His mother was anxious to be gone, when\r\nshe was surprised to see a figure climbing the almost deserted slope. A\r\nmoment more and she was face to face with Democrates, who advanced\r\noutstretching his hand and smiling.\r\n\r\nThe orator wore the dress of his new office of strategus. The purple-edged\r\ncloak, the light helmet wreathed with myrtle, the short sword at his side,\r\nall became him well. If there were deeper lines about his face than on the\r\nday Hermione last saw him, even an enemy would confess a leader of the\r\nAthenians had cause to be thoughtful. He was cordially greeted by Lysistra\r\nand seemed not at all abashed that Hermione gave only a sullen nod. From\r\nthe ladies he turned with laughter to Cleopis and her burden.\r\n\r\n“A new Athenian!” spoke he, lightly, “and I fear Xerxes will have been\r\nchased away before he has a chance to prove his valour. But fear not,\r\nthere will be more brave days in store.”\r\n\r\nHermione shook her head, ill-pleased.\r\n\r\n“Blessed be Hera, my babe is too young to know aught of wars. And if we\r\nsurvive this one, will not just Zeus spare us from further bloodshed?”\r\n\r\nDemocrates, without answering, approached the nurse, and Phœnix—for\r\nreasons best known to himself—ceased lamenting and smiled up in the\r\norator’s face.\r\n\r\n“His mother’s features and eyes,” cried Democrates. “I swear it—ay, by all\r\nAthena’s owls—that young Hermes when he lay in Maia’s cave on Mt. Cylene\r\nwas not finer or lustier than he. His mother’s face and eyes, I say.”\r\n\r\n“His father’s,” corrected Hermione. “Is not his name Phœnix? In him will\r\nnot Glaucon the Beautiful live again? Will he not grow to man’s estate to\r\navenge his murdered father?” The lady spoke without passion, but with a\r\ncold bitterness that made Democrates cease from smiling. He turned away\r\nfrom the babe.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, dear lady,” he answered her, “I am wiser at ruling the\r\nAthenians than at ruling children, but I see nothing of Glaucon about the\r\nbabe, though much of his beautiful mother.”\r\n\r\n“You had once a better memory, Democrates,” said Hermione, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand your Ladyship.”\r\n\r\n“I mean that Glaucon has been dead one brief year. Can you forget _his_\r\nface in so short a while?”\r\n\r\nBut here Lysistra interposed with all good intent.\r\n\r\n“You are fond and foolish, Hermione, and like all young mothers are\r\nenraged if all the world does not see his father’s image in their\r\nfirst-born.”\r\n\r\n“Democrates knows what I would say,” said the younger woman, soberly.\r\n\r\n“Since your Ladyship is pleased to speak in riddles and I am no seer nor\r\noracle-monger, I must confess I cannot follow. But we will contend no more\r\nconcerning little Phœnix. Enough that he will grow up fair as the Delian\r\nApollo and an unspeakable joy to his mother.”\r\n\r\n“Her only joy,” was Hermione’s icy answer. “Wrap up the child, Cleopis. My\r\nfather is coming. It is a long walk home to the city.”\r\n\r\nWith a rustle of white Hermione went down the slope in advance of her\r\nmother. Hermippus and Lysistra were not pleased. Plainly their daughter\r\nkept all her prejudice against Democrates. Her cold contempt was more\r\ndisappointing even than open fury.\r\n\r\nOnce at home Hermione held little Phœnix long to her heart and wept over\r\nhim. For the sake of her dead husband’s child, if for naught else, how\r\ncould she suffer them to give her to Democrates? That the orator had\r\ndestroyed Glaucon in black malice had become a corner-stone in her belief.\r\nShe could at first give for it only a woman’s reason—blind intuition. She\r\ncould not discuss her conviction with her mother or with any save a\r\nstrange confidant—Phormio.\r\n\r\nShe had met the fishmonger in the Agora once when she went with the slaves\r\nto buy a mackerel. The auctioneer had astonished everybody by knocking\r\ndown to her a noble fish an obol under price, then under pretext of\r\nshowing her a rare Bœotian eel got her aside into his booth and whispered\r\na few words that made the red and white come and go from her cheeks, after\r\nwhich the lady’s hand went quickly to her purse, and she spoke quick words\r\nabout “the evening” and “the garden gate.”\r\n\r\nPhormio refused the drachma brusquely, but kept the tryst. Cleopis had the\r\nkey to the garden, and would contrive anything for her mistress—especially\r\nas all Athens knew Phormio was harmless save with his tongue. That evening\r\nfor the first time Hermione heard the true story of Glaucon’s escape by\r\nthe _Solon_, but when the fishmonger paused she hung down her head closer.\r\n\r\n“You saved him, then? I bless you. But was the sea more merciful than the\r\nexecutioner?”\r\n\r\nThe fishmonger let his voice fall lower.\r\n\r\n“Democrates is unhappy. Something weighs on his mind. He is afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Of what?”\r\n\r\n“Bias his slave came to see me again last night. Many of his master’s\r\ndoings have been strange to him. Many are riddles still, but one thing at\r\nlast is plain. Hiram has been to see Democrates once more, despite the\r\nprevious threats. Bias listened. He could not understand everything, but\r\nhe heard Lycon’s name passed many times, then one thing he caught clearly.\r\n‘_The Babylonish carpet-seller was the Prince Mardonius._’ ‘The Babylonian\r\nfled on the _Solon_.’ ‘The Prince is safe in Sardis.’ If Mardonius could\r\nescape the storm and wreck, why not Glaucon, a king among swimmers?”\r\n\r\nHermione clapped her hands to her head.\r\n\r\n“Don’t torture me. I’ve long since trodden out hope. Why has he sent me no\r\nword in all these months of pain?”\r\n\r\n“It is not the easiest thing to get a letter across the Ægean in these\r\ndays of roaring war.”\r\n\r\n“I dare not believe it. What else did Bias hear?”\r\n\r\n“Very little. Hiram was urging something. Democrates always said,\r\n‘Impossible.’ Hiram went away with a very sour grin. However, Democrates\r\ncaught Bias lurking.”\r\n\r\n“And flogged him?”\r\n\r\n“No, Bias ran into the street and cried out he would flee to the Temple of\r\nTheseus, the slave’s sanctuary, and demand that the archon sell him to a\r\nkinder master. Then suddenly Democrates forgave him and gave him five\r\ndrachmæ to say no more about it.”\r\n\r\n“And so Bias at once told you?” Hermione could not forbear a smile, but\r\nher gesture was of desperation. “O Father Zeus—only the testimony of a\r\nslave to lean on, I a weak woman and Democrates one of the chief men in\r\nAthens! O for strength to wring out all the bitter truth!”\r\n\r\n“Peace, _kyria_,” said Phormio, not ungently, “Aletheia, Mistress Truth,\r\nis a patient dame, but she says her word at last. And you see that hope is\r\nnot quite dead.”\r\n\r\n“I dare not cherish it. If I were but a man!” repeated Hermione. But she\r\nthanked Phormio many times, would not let him refuse her money, and bade\r\nhim come often again and bring her all the Agora gossip about the war.\r\n“For we are friends,” she concluded; “you and I are the only persons who\r\nhold Glaucon innocent in all the world. And is that not tie enough?”\r\n\r\nSo Phormio came frequently, glad perhaps to escape the discipline of his\r\nspouse. Now he brought a rumour of Xerxes’s progress, now a bit of Bias’s\r\ntattling about his master. The talebearing counted for little, but went to\r\nmake Hermione’s conviction like adamant. Every night she would speak over\r\nPhœnix as she held him whilst he slept.\r\n\r\n“Grow fast, _makaire_, grow strong, for there is work for you to do! Your\r\nfather cries, ‘Avenge me well,’ even from Hades.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the fleet Athens seemed silent as the grave. On the\r\nstreets one met only slaves and graybeards. In the Agora the hucksters’\r\nbooths were silent, but little groups of white-headed men sat in the\r\nshaded porticos and watched eagerly for the appearing of the archon before\r\nthe government house to read the last despatch of the progress of Xerxes.\r\nThe Pnyx was deserted. The gymnasia were closed. The more superstitious\r\nscanned the heavens for a lucky or unlucky flight of hawks. The\r\npriestesses sang litanies all day and all night on the Acropolis where the\r\ngreat altar to Athena smoked with victims continually. At last, after the\r\ndays of uncertainty and wavering rumour, came surer tidings of battles.\r\n\r\n“Leonidas is fighting at Thermopylæ. The fleets are fighting at\r\nArtemisium, off Eubœa. The first onsets of the Barbarians have failed, but\r\nnothing is decided.”\r\n\r\nThis was the substance, and tantalizingly meagre. And the strong army of\r\nSparta and her allies still tarried at the Isthmus instead of hasting to\r\naid the pitiful handful at Thermopylæ. Therefore the old men wagged their\r\nheads, the altars were loaded with victims, and the women wept over their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSo ended the first day after news came of the fighting. The second was\r\nlike it—only more tense. Hermione never knew that snail called time to\r\ncreep more slowly. Never had she chafed more against the iron custom which\r\ncommanded Athenian gentlewomen to keep, tortoise-like, at home in days of\r\ndistress and tumult. On the evening of the second day came once more the\r\ndusty courier. Leonidas was holding the gate of Hellas. The Barbarians had\r\nperished by thousands. At Artemisium, Themistocles and the allied Greek\r\nadmirals were making head against the Persian armadas. But still nothing\r\nwas decided. Still the Spartan host lingered at the Isthmus, and Leonidas\r\nmust fight his battle alone. The sun sank that night with tens of\r\nthousands wishing his car might stand fast. At gray dawn Athens was awake\r\nand watching. Men forgot to eat, forgot to drink. One food would have\r\ncontented—news!\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was about noon—“the end of market time,” had there been any market then\r\nat Athens—when Hermione knew by instinct that news had come from the\r\nbattle and that it was evil. She and her mother had sat since dawn by the\r\nupper window, craning forth their heads up the street toward the Agora,\r\nwhere they knew all couriers must hasten. Along the street in all the\r\nhouses other women were peering forth also. When little Phœnix cried in\r\nhis cradle, his mother for the first time in his life almost angrily bade\r\nhim be silent. Cleopis, the only one of the fluttering servants who went\r\nplacidly about the wonted tasks, vainly coaxed her young mistress with\r\nfigs and a little wine. Hermippus was at the council. The street, save for\r\nthe leaning heads of the women, was deserted. Then suddenly came a change.\r\n\r\nFirst a man ran toward the Agora, panting,—his himation blew from his\r\nshoulders, he never stopped to recover it. Next shouts, scattered in the\r\nbeginning, then louder, and coming not as a roar but as a wailing, rising,\r\nfalling like the billows of the howling sea,—as if the thousands in the\r\nmarket-place groaned in sore agony. Shrill and hideous they rose, and a\r\nhand of ice fell on the hearts of the listening women. Then more runners,\r\nuntil the street seemed alive by magic, slaves and old men all crowding to\r\nthe Agora. And still the shout and ever more dreadful. The women leaned\r\nfrom the windows and cried vainly to the trampling crowd below.\r\n\r\n“Tell us! In the name of Athena, tell us!” No answer for long, till at\r\nlast a runner came not toward the Agora but from it. They had hardly need\r\nto hear what he was calling.\r\n\r\n“Leonidas is slain. Thermopylæ is turned! Xerxes is advancing!”\r\n\r\nHermione staggered back from the lattice. In the cradle Phœnix awoke;\r\nseeing his mother bending over him, he crowed cheerily and flung his\r\nchubby fists in her face. She caught him up and again could not fight the\r\ntears away.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon! Glaucon!” she prayed,—for her husband was all but a deity in her\r\nsight,—“hear us wherever you are, even if in the blessed land of\r\nRhadamanthus. Take us thither, your child and me, for there is no peace or\r\nshelter left on earth!”\r\n\r\nThen, seeing her panic-stricken women flying hither and thither like\r\nwitless birds, her patrician blood asserted itself. She dashed the drops\r\nfrom her eyes and joined her mother in quieting the maids. Whatever there\r\nwas to hope or fear, their fate would not be lightened by wild moaning.\r\nSoon the direful wailing from the Agora ceased. A blue flag waved over the\r\nCouncil House, a sign that the “Five Hundred” had been called in hurried\r\nsession. Simultaneously a dense column of smoke leaped up from the\r\nmarket-place. The archons had ordered the hucksters’ booths to be burned,\r\nas a signal to all Attica that the worst had befallen.\r\n\r\nAfter inexpressibly long waiting Phormio came, then Hermippus, to tell all\r\nthey knew. Leonidas had perished gloriously. His name was with the\r\nimmortals, but the mountain wall of Hellas had been unlocked. No Spartan\r\narmy was in Bœotia. The bravest of Athens were in the fleet. The easy\r\nAttic passes of Phyle and Decelea could never be defended. Nothing could\r\nsave Athens from Xerxes. The calamity had been foreseen, but to foresee is\r\nnot to realize. That night in Athens no man slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE EVACUATION OF ATHENS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had come at last,—the hour wise men had dreaded, fools had scoffed at,\r\ncowards had dared not face. The Barbarian was within five days’ march of\r\nAttica. The Athenians must bow the knee to the world monarch or go forth\r\nexiles from their country.\r\n\r\nIn the morning after the night of terror came another courier, not this\r\ntime from Thermopylæ. He bore a letter from Themistocles, who was\r\nreturning from Eubœa with the whole allied Grecian fleet. The reading of\r\nthe letter in the Agora was the first rift in the cloud above the city.\r\n\r\n“Be strong, prove yourselves sons of Athens. Do what a year ago you so\r\nboldly voted. Prepare to evacuate Attica. All is not lost. In three days I\r\nwill be with you.”\r\n\r\nThere was no time for an assembly at the Pnyx, but the Five Hundred and\r\nthe Areopagus council acted for the people. It was ordered to remove the\r\nentire population of Attica, with all their movable goods, across the bay\r\nto Salamis or to the friendly Peloponnesus, and that same noon the heralds\r\nwent over the land to bear the direful summons.\r\n\r\nTo Hermione, who in the calm after-years looked back on all this year of\r\nagony and stress as on an unreal thing, one time always was stamped on\r\nmemory as no dream, but vivid, unforgetable,—these days of the great\r\nevacuation. Up and down the pleasant plain country of the Mesogia to\r\nsouthward, to the rolling highlands beyond Pentelicus and Parnes, to the\r\nslumbering villages by Marathon, to the fertile farm-land by Eleusis, went\r\nthe proclaimers of ill-tidings.\r\n\r\n“Quit your homes, hasten to Athens, take with you what you can, but\r\nhasten, or stay as Xerxes’s slaves.”\r\n\r\nFor the next two days a piteous multitude was passing through the city. A\r\ncountry of four hundred thousand inhabitants was to be swept clean and\r\nleft naked and profitless to the invader. Under Hermione’s window, as she\r\ngazed up and down the street, jostled the army of fugitives, women old and\r\nyoung, shrinking from the bustle and uproar, grandsires on their staves,\r\nboys driving the bleating goats or the patient donkeys piled high with\r\npots and panniers, little girls tearfully hugging a pet puppy or hen. But\r\nfew strong men were seen, for the fleet had not yet rounded Sunium to bear\r\nthe people away.\r\n\r\nThe well-loved villas and farmsteads were tenantless. They left the\r\nstanding grain, the ripening orchards, the groves of the sacred olives.\r\nMen rushed for the last time to the shrines where their fathers had\r\nprayed,—the temples of Theseus, Olympian Zeus, Dionysus, Aphrodite. The\r\ntombs of the worthies of old, stretching out along the Sacred Way to\r\nEleusis, where Solon, Clisthenes, Miltiades, and many another bulwark of\r\nAthens slept, had the last votive wreath hung lovingly upon them. And\r\nespecially men sought the great temple of the “Rock,” to lift their hands\r\nto Athena Polias, and vow awful vows of how harm to the Virgin Goddess\r\nshould be wiped away in blood.\r\n\r\nSo the throng passed through the city and toward the shore, awaiting the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nIt came after eager watching. The whole fighting force of Athens and her\r\nCorinthian, Æginetan, and other allies. Before the rest raced a stately\r\nship, the _Nausicaä_, her triple-oar bank flying faster than the spray.\r\nThe people crowded to the water’s edge when the great trireme cast off her\r\npinnace and a well-known figure stepped therein.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles is with us!”\r\n\r\nHe landed at Phaleron, the thousands greeted him as if he were a god. He\r\nseemed their only hope—the Atlas upbearing all the fates of Athens. With\r\nthe glance of his eye, with a few quick words, he chased the terrors from\r\nthe strategi and archons that crowded up around him.\r\n\r\n“Why distressed? Have we not held the Barbarians back nobly at Artemisium?\r\nWill we not soon sweep his power from the seas in fair battle?”\r\n\r\nWith almost a conqueror’s train he swept up to the city. A last assembly\r\nfilled the Pnyx. Themistocles had never been more hopeful, more eloquent.\r\nWith one voice men voted never to bend the knee to the king. If the gods\r\nforbade them to win back their own dear country, they would go together to\r\nItaly, to found a new and better Athens far from the Persian’s power. And\r\nat Themistocles’s motion they voted to recall all the political exiles,\r\nespecially Themistocles’s own great enemy Aristeides the Just, banished by\r\nthe son of Neocles only a few years before. The assembly dispersed—not\r\nweeping but with cheers. Already it was time to be quitting the city.\r\nCouriers told how the Tartar horsemen were burning the villages beyond\r\nParnes. The magistrates and admirals went to the house of Athena. The last\r\nincense smoked before the image. The bucklers hanging on the temple wall\r\nwere taken down by Cimon and the other young patricians. The statue was\r\nreverently lifted, wound in fine linen, and borne swiftly to the fleet.\r\n\r\n“Come, _makaira_!” called Hermippus, entering his house to summon his\r\ndaughter. Hermione sent a last glance around the disordered aula; her\r\nmother called to the bevy of pallid, whimpering maids. Cleopis was bearing\r\nPhœnix, but Hermione took him from her. Only his own mother should bear\r\nhim now. They went through the thinning Agora and took one hard look at\r\neach familiar building and temple. When they should return to them, the\r\ninscrutable god kept hid. So to Peiræus,—and to the rapid pinnaces which\r\nbore them across the narrow sea to Salamis, where for the moment at least\r\nwas peace.\r\n\r\nAll that day the boats were bearing the people, and late into the night,\r\nuntil the task was accomplished, the like whereof is not found in history.\r\nNo Athenian who willed was left to the power of Xerxes. One brain and\r\nvoice planned and directed all. Leonidas, Ajax of the Hellenes, had been\r\ntaken. Themistocles, their Odysseus, valiant as Ajax and gifted with the\r\ncraft of the immortals, remained. Could that craft and that valour turn\r\nback the might of even the god-king of the Aryans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ACROPOLIS FLAMES\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days only Xerxes and his host rested after the dear-bought triumph\r\nat Thermopylæ. An expedition sent to plunder Delphi returned\r\ndiscomfited—thanks, said common report, to Apollo himself, who broke off\r\ntwo mountain crags to crush the impious invaders. But no such miracle\r\nhalted the march on Athens. Bœotia and her cities welcomed the king;\r\nThespiæ and Platæa, which had stood fast for Hellas, were burned. The\r\nPeloponnesian army lingered at Corinth, busy with a wall across the\r\nIsthmus, instead of risking valorous battle.\r\n\r\n“By the soul of my father,” the king had sworn, “I believe that after the\r\nlesson at Thermopylæ these madmen will not fight again!”\r\n\r\n“By land they will not,” said Mardonius, always at his lord’s elbow, “by\r\nsea—it remains for your Eternity to discover.”\r\n\r\n“Will they really dare to fight by sea?” asked Xerxes, hardly pleased at\r\nthe suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Omnipotence, you have slain Leonidas, but a second great enemy remains.\r\nWhile Themistocles lives, it is likely your slaves will have another\r\nopportunity to prove to you their devotion.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! A stubborn rogue, I hear. Well—if we must fight by sea, it shall\r\nbe under my own eyes. My loyal Phœnician and Egyptian mariners did not do\r\nthemselves full justice at Artemisium; they lacked the valour which comes\r\nfrom being in the presence of their king.”\r\n\r\n“Which makes a dutiful subject fight as ten,” quickly added Pharnaspes the\r\nfan-bearer.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” smiled the monarch, “and now I must ask again, Mardonius, how\r\nfares it with my handsome Prexaspes?”\r\n\r\n“Only indifferently, your Majesty, since you graciously deign to inquire.”\r\n\r\n“Such a sad wound? That is heavy news. He takes long in recovering. I\r\ntrust he wants for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Omnipotence. He has the best surgeons in the camp.”\r\n\r\n“To-day I will send him Helbon wine from my own table. I miss his comely\r\nface about me. I want him here to play at dice. Tell him to recover\r\nbecause his king desires it. If he has become right Persian, that will be\r\nbetter than any physic.”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt he will be deeply moved to learn of your Eternity’s\r\nkindness,” rejoined the bow-bearer, who was not sorry that further\r\ndiscussion of this delicate subject was averted by the arch-usher\r\nintroducing certain cavalry officers with their report on the most\r\npracticable line of march through Bœotia.\r\n\r\nGlaucon, in fact, was long since out of danger, thanks to the sturdy\r\nbronze of his Laconian helmet. He was able to walk, and, if need be, ride,\r\nbut Mardonius would not suffer him to go outside his own tents. The\r\nAthenian would be certain to be recognized, and at once Xerxes would send\r\nfor him, and how Glaucon, in his new frame of mind, would deport himself\r\nbefore majesty, whether he would not taunt the irascible monarch to his\r\nface, the bow-bearer did not know. Therefore the Athenian endured a manner\r\nof captivity in the tents with the eunuchs, pages, and women. Artazostra\r\nwas often with him, and less frequently Roxana. But the Egyptian had lost\r\nall power over him now. He treated her with a cold courtesy more painful\r\nthan contempt. Once or twice Artazostra had tried to turn him back from\r\nhis purpose, but her words always broke themselves over one barrier.\r\n\r\n“I am born a Hellene, lady. My gods are not yours. I must live and die\r\nafter the manner of my people. And that our gods are strong and will give\r\nvictory, after that morning with Leonidas I dare not doubt.”\r\n\r\nWhen the host advanced south and eastward from Thermopylæ, Glaucon went\r\nwith it, riding in a closed travelling carriage guarded by Mardonius’s\r\neunuchs. All who saw it said that here went one of the bow-bearer’s harem\r\nwomen, and as for the king, every day he asked for his favourite, and\r\nevery day Mardonius told him, “He is even as before,” an answer which the\r\nbow-bearer prayed to truth-loving Mithra might not be accounted a lie.\r\n\r\nIt was while the army lay at Platæa that news came which might have shaken\r\nGlaucon’s purpose, had that purpose been shakable. Euboulus the Corinthian\r\nhad been slain in a skirmish shortly after the forcing of Thermopylæ. The\r\ntidings meant that no one lived who could tell in Athens that on the day\r\nof testing the outlaw had cast in his lot with Hellas. Leonidas was dead.\r\nThe Spartan soldiers who had heard Glaucon avow his identity were dead. In\r\nthe hurried conference of captains preceding the retreat, Leonidas had\r\ntold his informant’s precise name only to Euboulus. And now Euboulus was\r\nslain, doubtless before any word from him of Glaucon’s deed could spread\r\nabroad. To Athenians Glaucon was still the “Traitor,” doubly execrated in\r\nthis hour of trial. If he returned to his people, would he not be torn in\r\npieces by the mob? But the young Alcmæonid was resolved. Since he had not\r\ndied at Thermopylæ, no life in the camp of the Barbarian was tolerable. He\r\nwould trust sovran Athena who had plucked him out of one death to deliver\r\nfrom a second. Therefore he nursed his strength—a caged lion waiting for\r\nfreedom,—and almost wished the Persian host would advance more swiftly\r\nthat he might haste onward to his own.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nGlaucon had cherished a hope to see the whole power of the Peloponnesus in\r\narray in Bœotia, but that hope proved quickly vain. The oracle was truly\r\nto be fulfilled,—the whole of “the land of Cecrops” was to be possessed by\r\nthe Barbarian. The mountain passes were open. No arrows greeted the\r\nPersian vanguard as it cantered down the defiles, and once more the king’s\r\ncourtiers told their smiling master that not another hand would be raised\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nThe fourth month after quitting the Hellespont Xerxes entered Athens. The\r\ngates stood ajar. The invaders walked in silent streets as of a city of\r\nthe dead. A few runaway slaves alone greeted them. Only in the Acropolis a\r\nhandful of superstitious old men and temple warders had barricaded\r\nthemselves, trusting that Athena would still defend her holy mountain. For\r\na few days they defended the steep, rolling down huge boulders, but the\r\nend was inevitable. The Persians discovered a secret path upward. The\r\ndefenders were surprised and dashed themselves from the crags or were\r\nmassacred. A Median spear-man flung a fire-brand. The house of the\r\nguardian goddess went up in flame. The red column leaping to heaven was a\r\nbeacon for leagues around that Xerxes held the length and breadth of\r\nAttica.\r\n\r\nGlaucon watched the burning temple with grinding teeth. Mardonius’s tents\r\nwere pitched in the eastern city by the fountain of Callirhoë,—a spot of\r\nfond memories for the Alcmæonid. Here first he had met Hermione, come with\r\nher maids to draw water, and had gone away dreaming of Aphrodite arising\r\nfrom the sea. Often here he had sat with Democrates by the little pool,\r\nwhilst the cypresses above talked their sweet, monotonous music. Before\r\nhim rose the Rock of Athena,—the same, yet not the same. The temple of his\r\nfathers was vanishing in smoke and ashes. What wonder that he turned to\r\nArtazostra at his side with a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n“Lady, your people have their will. But do not think Athena Nikephorus,\r\nthe Lady of Triumphs, will forget this day when we stand against you in\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him. He knew that many noblemen had advised Xerxes\r\nagainst driving the Greeks to desperation by this sacrilege, but this fact\r\nhardly made him the happier.\r\n\r\nAt dusk the next evening Mardonius suffered him to go with two faithful\r\neunuchs and rove through the deserted city. The Persians were mostly\r\nencamped without the walls, and plundering was forbidden. Only Hydarnes\r\nwith the Immortals pitched on Areopagus, and the king had taken his abode\r\nby the Agora. It was like walking through the country of the dead.\r\nEverything familiar, everything changed. The eunuchs carried torches. They\r\nwandered down one street after another, where the house doors stood open,\r\nwhere the aulas were strewn with the débris of household stuff which the\r\nfleeing citizens had abandoned. A deserter had already told Glaucon of his\r\nfather’s death; he was not amazed therefore to find the house of his birth\r\nempty and desolate. But everywhere else, also, it was to call back\r\nmemories of glad days never to return. Here was the school where crusty\r\nPollicharmes had driven the “reading, writing, and music” into Democrates\r\nand himself between the blows. Here was the corner Hermes, before which he\r\nhad sacrificed the day he won his first wreath in the public games. Here\r\nwas the house of Cimon, in whose dining room he had enjoyed many a bright\r\nsymposium. He trod the Agora and walked under the porticos where he had\r\nlounged in the golden evenings after the brisk stroll from the wrestling\r\nground at Cynosarges, and had chatted and chaffered with light-hearted\r\nfriends about “the war” and “the king,” in the days when the Persian\r\nseemed very far away. Last of all an instinct—he could not call it\r\ndesire—drove him to seek the house of Hermippus.\r\n\r\nThey had to force the door open with a stone. The first red torch-light\r\nthat glimmered around the aula told that the Eumolpid had awaited the\r\nenemy in Athens, not in Eleusis. The court was littered with all manner of\r\nstuff,—crockery, blankets, tables, stools,—which the late inhabitants had\r\nbeen forced to forsake. A tame quail hopped from the tripod by the now\r\ncold hearth. Glaucon held out his hand, the bird came quickly, expecting\r\nthe bit of grain. Had not Hermione possessed such a quail? The outlaw’s\r\nblood ran quicker. He felt the heat glowing in his forehead.\r\n\r\nA chest of clothes stood open by the entrance. He dragged forth the\r\ncontents—women’s dresses and uppermost a white airy gauze of Amorgos that\r\nclung to his hands as if he were lifting clouds. Out of its folds fell a\r\npair of white shoes with clasps of gold. Then he recognized this dress\r\nHermione had worn in the Panathenæa and on the night of his ruin. He threw\r\nit down, next stood staring over it like a man possessed. The friendly\r\neunuchs watched his strange movements. He could not endure to have them\r\nfollow him.\r\n\r\n“Give me a torch. I return in a moment.”\r\n\r\nHe went up the stair alone to the upper story, to the chambers of the\r\nwomen. Confusion here also,—the more valuable possessions gone, but much\r\nremaining. In one corner stood the loom and stretched upon it the\r\nhalf-made web of a shawl. He could trace the pattern clearly wrought in\r\nbright wools,—Ariadne sitting desolate awaiting the returning of Theseus.\r\nWould the wife or the betrothed of Democrates busy herself with _that_,\r\nwhatever the griefs in her heart? Glaucon’s temples now were throbbing as\r\nif to burst.\r\n\r\nA second room, and more littered confusion, but in one corner stood a\r\nbronze statue,—Apollo bending his bow against the Achæans,—which Glaucon\r\nhad given to Hermione. At the foot of the statue hung a wreath of purple\r\nasters, dead and dry, but he plucked it asunder and set many blossoms in\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\nA third room, and almost empty. He was moving back in disappointment, when\r\nthe torch-light shook over something that swung betwixt two beams,—a\r\nwicker cradle. The woollen swaddling bands were still in it. One could see\r\nthe spot on the little pillow with the impress of the tiny head. Glaucon\r\nalmost dropped the torch. He pressed his hand to his brow.\r\n\r\n“Zeus pity me!” he groaned, “preserve my reason. How can I serve Hellas\r\nand those I love if thou strikest me mad?”\r\n\r\nWith feverish anxiety he sent his eyes around that chamber. His search was\r\nnot in vain. He almost trampled upon the thing that lay at his feet,—a\r\nwooden rattle, the toy older than the Egyptian pyramids. He seized it,\r\nshook it as a warrior his sword. He scanned it eagerly. Upon the handle\r\nwere letters carved, but there was a mist before his eyes which took long\r\nto pass away. Then he read the rude inscription: “ΦΟΙΝΙΞ : ΥΙΟΣ :\r\nΓΛΑΥΚΟΝΤΟΣ.” “Phœnix the son of Glaucon.” _His_ child. He was the father\r\nof a fair son. His wife, he was sure thereof, had not yet been given to\r\nDemocrates.\r\n\r\nOvercome by a thousand emotions, he flung himself upon a chest and pressed\r\nthe homely toy many times to his lips.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter a long interval he recovered himself enough to go down to the\r\neunuchs, who were misdoubting his long absence.\r\n\r\n“Persian,” he said to Mardonius, when he was again at the bow-bearer’s\r\ntents, “either suffer me to go back to my people right soon or put me to\r\ndeath. My wife has borne me a son. My place is where I can defend him.”\r\n\r\nMardonius frowned, but nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“You know I desire it otherwise. But my word is given. And the word of a\r\nprince of the Aryans is not to be recalled. You know what to expect among\r\nyour people—perhaps a foul death for a deed of another.”\r\n\r\n“I know it. I also know that Hellas needs me.”\r\n\r\n“To fight against us?” asked the bow-bearer, with a sigh. “Yet you shall\r\ngo. Eran is not so weak that adding one more to her enemies will halt her\r\ntriumph. To-morrow night a boat shall be ready on the strand. Take it. And\r\nafter that may your gods guard you, for I can do no more.”\r\n\r\nAll the next day Glaucon sat in the tents and watched the smoke cloud\r\nabove the Acropolis and the soldiers in the plain hewing down the sacred\r\nolives, Athena’s trees, which no Athenian might injure and thereafter\r\nlive. But Glaucon was past cursing now,—endure a little longer and after\r\nthat, what vengeance!\r\n\r\nThe gossiping eunuchs told readily what the king had determined. Xerxes\r\nwas at Phaleron reviewing his fleet. The Hellenes’ ships confronted him at\r\nSalamis. The Persians had met in council, deliberating one night over\r\ntheir wine, reconsidering the next morning when sober. Their wisdom each\r\ntime had been to force a battle. Let the king destroy the enemy at\r\nSalamis, and he could land troops at ease at the very doors of Sparta,\r\ndefying the vain wall across the Isthmus. Was not victory certain? Had he\r\nnot two ships to the Hellenes’ one? So the Phœnician vassal kings and all\r\nhis admirals assured him. Only Artemisia, the martial queen of\r\nHalicarnassus, spoke otherwise, but none would hear her.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow the war is ended,” a cup-bearer had told a butler in Glaucon’s\r\nhearing, and never noticed how the Athenian took a horseshoe in his slim\r\nfingers and straightened it, whilst looking on the scorched columns of the\r\nAcropolis.\r\n\r\nAt length the sun spread his last gold of the evening. The eunuchs called\r\nGlaucon to the pavilion of Artazostra, who came forth with Roxana for\r\ntheir farewell. They were in royal purple. The amethysts in their hair\r\nwere worth a month’s revenues of Corinth. Roxana had never been lovelier.\r\nGlaucon was again in the simple Greek dress, but he knelt and kissed the\r\nrobes of both the women. Then rising he spoke to them.\r\n\r\n“To you, O princess, my benefactress, I wish all manner of blessing. May\r\nyou be crowned with happy age, may your fame surpass Semiramis, the\r\nconqueror queen of the fables, let the gods refuse only one prayer—the\r\nconquest of Hellas. The rest of the world is yours, leave then to us our\r\nown.”\r\n\r\n“And you, sister of Mardonius,” he turned to Roxana now, “do not think I\r\ndespise your love or your beauty. That I have given you pain, is double\r\npain to me. But I loved you only in a dream. My life is not for the rose\r\nvalleys of Bactria, but for the stony hills by Athens. May Aphrodite give\r\nyou another love, a brighter fortune than might ever come by linking your\r\nfate to mine.”\r\n\r\nThey held out their hands. He kissed them. He saw tears on the long lashes\r\nof Roxana.\r\n\r\n“Farewell,” spoke the women, simply.\r\n\r\n“Farewell,” he answered. He turned from them. He knew they were\r\nre-entering the tent. He never saw the women again.\r\n\r\nMardonius accompanied him all the long way from the fount of Callirhoë to\r\nthe sea-shore. Glaucon protested, but the bow-bearer would not hearken.\r\n\r\n“You have saved my life, Athenian,” was his answer, “when you leave me\r\nnow, it is forever.”\r\n\r\nThe moon was lifting above the gloomy mass of Hymettus and scattering all\r\nthe Attic plain with her pale gold. The Acropolis Rock loomed high above\r\nthem. Glaucon, looking upward, saw the moonlight flash on the spear point\r\nand shield of a soldier,—a Barbarian standing sentry on the ruined shrine\r\nof the Virgin Goddess. Once more the Alcmæonid was leaving Athens, but\r\nwith very different thoughts than on that other night when he had fled at\r\nPhormio’s side. They quitted the desolate city and the sleeping camp. The\r\nlast bars of day had long since dimmed in the west when before them loomed\r\nthe hill of Munychia clustered also with tents, and beyond it the\r\nviolet-black vista of the sea. A forest of masts crowded the havens, the\r\nfleet of the “Lord of the World” that was to complete his mastery with the\r\nreturning sun. Mardonius did not lead Glaucon to the ports, but southward,\r\nwhere beyond the little point of Colias spread an open sandy beach. The\r\nnight waves lapped softly. The wind had sunk to warm puffs from the\r\nsouthward. They heard the rattle of anchor-chains and tackle-blocks, but\r\nfrom far away. Beyond the vague promontory of Peiræus rose dark mountains\r\nand headlands, at their foot lay a sprinkling of lights.\r\n\r\n“Salamis!” cried Glaucon, pointing. “Yonder are the ships of Hellas.”\r\n\r\nMardonius walked with him upon the shelving shore. A skiff, small but\r\nstanch, was ready with oars.\r\n\r\n“What else will you?” asked the bow-bearer. “Gold?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. Yet take this.” Glaucon unclasped from his waist the golden belt\r\nXerxes had bestowed at Sardis. “A Hellene I went forth, a Hellene I\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\nHe made to kiss the Persian’s dress, but Mardonius would not suffer it.\r\n\r\n“Did I not desire you for my brother?” he said, and they embraced. As\r\ntheir arms parted, the bow-bearer spoke three words in earnest whisper:—\r\n\r\n“Beware of Democrates.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I can say no more. Yet be wise. Beware of Democrates.”\r\n\r\nThe attendants, faithful body-servants of Mardonius, and mute witnesses of\r\nall that passed, were thrusting the skiff into the water. There were no\r\nlong farewells. Both knew that the parting was absolute, that Glaucon\r\nmight be dead on the morrow. A last clasping of the hands and quickly the\r\nboat was drifting out upon the heaving waters. Glaucon stood one moment\r\nwatching the figures on the beach and pondering on Mardonius’s strange\r\nwarning. Then he set himself to the oars, rowing westward, skirting the\r\nBarbarian fleet as it rode at anchor, observing its numbers and array and\r\nhow it was aligned for battle. After that, with more rapid stroke, he sent\r\nthe skiff across the dark ribbon toward Salamis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THEMISTOCLES IS THINKING\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonidas was taken. Themistocles was left,—left to bear as crushing a load\r\nas ever weighed on man,—to fight two battles, one with the Persian, one\r\nwith his own unheroic allies, and the last was the harder. Three hundred\r\nand seventy Greek triremes rode off Salamis, half from Athens, but the\r\ncommander-in-chief was Eurybiades of Sparta, the sluggard state that sent\r\nonly sixteen ships, yet the only state the bickering Peloponnesians would\r\nobey. Hence Themistocles’s sore problems.\r\n\r\nDifferent from the man of unruffled brow who ruled from the bema was he\r\nwho paced the state cabin of the _Nausicaä_ a few nights after the\r\nevacuation. For _he_ at least knew the morn would bring Hellas her doom.\r\nThere had been a gloomy council that afternoon. They had seen the\r\nAcropolis flame two days before. The great fleet of Xerxes rode off the\r\nAttic havens. At the gathering of the Greek chiefs in Eurybiades’s cabin\r\nThemistocles had spoken one word many times,—“Fight!”\r\n\r\nTo which Adeimantus, the craven admiral of Corinth, and many another had\r\nanswered:—\r\n\r\n“Delay! Back to the Isthmus! Risk nothing!”\r\n\r\nThen at last the son of Neocles silenced them, not with arguments but\r\nthreats. “Either here in the narrow straits we can fight the king or not\r\nat all. In the open seas his numbers can crush us. Either vote to fight\r\nhere or we Athenians sail for Italy and leave you to stem Xerxes as you\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\nThere had been sullen silence after that, the admirals misliking the\r\nfurrow drawn above Themistocles’s eyes. Then Eurybiades had haltingly\r\ngiven orders for battle.\r\n\r\nThat had been the command, but as the Athenian left the Spartan flag-ship\r\nin his pinnace he heard Globryas, the admiral of Sicyon, muttering,\r\n“Headstrong fool—he shall not destroy us!” and saw Adeimantus turn back\r\nfor a word in Eurybiades’s ear. The Spartan had shaken his head, but\r\nThemistocles did not deceive himself. In the battle at morn half of the\r\nHellenes would go to battle asking more “how escape?” than “how conquer?”\r\nand that was no question to ask before a victory.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was empty now save for the admiral. On the deck above the hearty\r\nshouts of Ameinias the trierarch, and chanting of the seamen told that on\r\nthe _Nausicaä_ at least there would be no slackness in the fight. The ship\r\nwas being stripped for action, needless spars and sails sent ashore, extra\r\noars made ready, and grappling-irons placed. “Battle” was what every\r\nAthenian prayed for, but amongst the allies Themistocles knew it was\r\notherwise. The crucial hour of his life found him nervous, moody, silent.\r\nHe repelled the zealous subalterns who came for orders.\r\n\r\n“My directions have been given. Execute them. Has Aristeides come yet?”\r\nThe last question was to Simonides, who had been half-companion,\r\nhalf-counsellor, in all these days of storm.\r\n\r\n“He is not yet come from Ægina.”\r\n\r\n“Leave me, then.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles’s frown deepened. The others went out.\r\n\r\nThe state cabin was elegant, considering its place. Themistocles had\r\nfurnished it according to his luxurious taste,—stanchions cased in bronze\r\nhammered work, heavy rugs from Carthage, lamps swinging from chains of\r\nprecious Corinthian brass. Behind a tripod stood an image of Aphrodite of\r\nFair Counsel, the admiral’s favourite deity. By force of habit now he\r\ncrossed the cabin, took the golden box, and shook a few grains of\r\nfrankincense upon the tripod.\r\n\r\n“Attend, O queen,” he said mechanically, “and be thou propitious to all my\r\nprayers.”\r\n\r\nHe knew the words meant nothing. The puff of night air from the port-hole\r\ncarried the fragrance from the room. The image wore its unchanging,\r\nmeaningless smile, and Themistocles smiled too, albeit bitterly.\r\n\r\n“So this is the end. A losing fight, cowardice, slavery—no, I shall not\r\nlive to see that last.”\r\n\r\nHe looked from the port-hole. He could see the lights of the Barbarian\r\nfleet clearly. He took long breaths of the clear brine.\r\n\r\n“So the tragedy ends—worse than Phrynicus’s poorest, when they pelted his\r\nchorus from the orchestra with date-stones. And yet—and yet—”\r\n\r\nHe never formulated what came next even in his own mind.\r\n\r\n“_Eu!_” he cried, springing back with part of his old lightness, “I have\r\nborne a brave front before it all. I have looked the Cyclops in the face,\r\neven when he glowered the fiercest. But it all will pass. I presume\r\nThersytes the caitiff and Agamemnon the king have the same sleep and the\r\nsame dreams in Orchus. And a few years more or a few less in a man’s life\r\nmake little matter. But it would be sweeter to go out thinking ‘I have\r\ntriumphed’ than ‘I have failed, and all the things I loved fail with me.’\r\nAnd Athens—”\r\n\r\nAgain he stopped. When he resumed his monologue, it was in a different\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n“There are many things I cannot understand. They cannot unlock the riddles\r\nat Delphi, no seer can read them in the omens of birds. Why was Glaucon\r\nblasted? Was he a traitor? What was the truth concerning his treason?\r\nSince his going I have lost half my faith in mortal men.”\r\n\r\nOnce more his thoughts wandered.\r\n\r\n“How they trust me, my followers of Athens! Is it not better to be a\r\nleader of one city of freemen than a Xerxes, master of a hundred million\r\nslaves? How they greeted me, as if I were Apollo the Saviour, when I\r\nreturned to Peiræus! And must it be written by the chroniclers thereafter,\r\n‘About this time Themistocles, son of Neocles, aroused the Athenians to\r\nhopeless resistance and drew on them utter destruction’? O Father Zeus,\r\nmust men say _that_? Am I a fool or crazed for wishing to save my land\r\nfrom the fate of Media, Lydia, Babylonia, Egypt, Ionia? Has dark Atropos\r\ndecreed that the Persians should conquer forever? Then, O Zeus, or\r\nwhatever be thy name, O Power of Powers, look to thine empire! Xerxes is\r\nnot a king, but a god; he will besiege Olympus, even thy throne.”\r\n\r\nHe crossed the cabin with hard strides.\r\n\r\n“How can I?” he cried half-aloud, beating his forehead. “How can I make\r\nthese Hellenes fight?”\r\n\r\nHis hand tightened over his sword-hilt.\r\n\r\n“This is the only place where we can fight to advantage. Here in the\r\nstrait betwixt Salamis and Attica we have space to deploy all our ships,\r\nwhile the Barbarians will be crowded by numbers. And if we once\r\nretreat?—Let Adeimantus and the rest prate about—‘The wall, the wall\r\nacross the Isthmus! The king can never storm it.’ Nor will he try to,\r\nunless his councillors are turned stark mad. Will he not have command of\r\nthe sea? can he not land his army behind the wall, wherever he wills? Have\r\nI not dinned that argument in those doltish Peloponnesians’ ears until I\r\nhave grown hoarse? Earth and gods! suffer me rather to convince a stone\r\nstatue than a Dorian. The task is less hard. Yet they call themselves\r\nreasoning beings.”\r\n\r\nA knock upon the cabin door. Simonides reëntered.\r\n\r\n“You do not come on deck, Themistocles? The men ask for you. Ameinias’s\r\ncook has prepared a noble supper—anchovies and tunny—will you not join the\r\nother officers and drink a cup to Tychē, Lady Fortune, that she prosper us\r\nin the morning?”\r\n\r\n“I am at odds with Tychē, Simonides. I cannot come with you.”\r\n\r\n“The case is bad, then?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, bad. But keep a brave face before the men. There’s no call to pawn\r\nour last chance.”\r\n\r\n“Has it come to that?” quoth the little poet, in curiosity and concern.\r\n\r\n“Leave me!” ordered Themistocles, with a sweep of the hand, and Simonides\r\nwas wise enough to obey.\r\n\r\nThemistocles took a pen from the table, but instead of writing on the\r\noutspread sheet of papyrus, thrust the reed between his teeth and bit it\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\n“How can I? How can I make these Hellenes fight? Tell that, King Zeus,\r\ntell that!”\r\n\r\nThen quickly his eager brain ran from expedient to expedient.\r\n\r\n“Another oracle, some lucky prediction that we shall conquer? But I have\r\nshaken the oracle books till there is only chaff in them. Or a bribe to\r\nAdeimantus and his fellows? But gold can buy only souls, not courage. Or\r\nanother brave speech and convincing argument? Had I the tongue of Nestor\r\nand the wisdom of Thales, would those doltish Dorians listen?”\r\n\r\nAgain the knock, still again Simonides. The dapper poet’s face was a cubit\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n“Oh, grief to report it! Cimon sends a boat from his ship the _Perseus_.\r\nHe says the _Dikē_, the Sicyonian ship beside him, is not stripping for\r\nbattle, but rigging sail on her spars as if to flee away.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” asked Themistocles, calmly.\r\n\r\n“And there is also a message that Adeimantus and many other admirals who\r\nare minded like him have gone again to Eurybiades to urge him not to\r\nfight.”\r\n\r\n“I expected it.”\r\n\r\n“Will the Spartan yield?” The little poet was whitening.\r\n\r\n“Very likely. Eurybiades would be a coward if he were not too much of a\r\nfool.”\r\n\r\n“And you are not going to him instantly, to confound the faint hearts and\r\nurge them to quit themselves like Hellenes?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“By the dog of Egypt, man,” cried Simonides, seizing his friend’s arm,\r\n“don’t you know that if nothing’s done, we’ll all walk the asphodel\r\nto-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. I am doing all I can.”\r\n\r\n“All? You stand with folded hands!”\r\n\r\n“All—for I am thinking.”\r\n\r\n“Thinking—oh, make actions of your thoughts!”\r\n\r\n“I will.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“When the god opens the way. Just now the way is fast closed.”\r\n\r\n“_Ai!_ woe—and it is already far into the evening, and Hellas is lost.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles laughed almost lightly.\r\n\r\n“No, my friend. Hellas will not be lost until to-morrow morning, and much\r\ncan happen in a night. Now go, and let me think yet more.”\r\n\r\nSimonides lingered. He was not sure Themistocles was master of himself.\r\nBut the admiral beckoned peremptorily, the poet’s hand was on the cabin\r\ndoor, when a loud knock sounded on the other side. The _prōreus_,\r\ncommander of the fore-deck and Ameinas’s chief lieutenant, entered and\r\nsaluted swiftly.\r\n\r\n“Your business?” questioned the admiral, sharply.\r\n\r\n“May it please your Excellency, a deserter.”\r\n\r\n“A deserter, and how and why here?”\r\n\r\n“He came to the _Nausicaä_ in a skiff. He swears he has just come from the\r\nBarbarians at Phaleron. He demands to see the admiral.”\r\n\r\n“He is a Barbarian?”\r\n\r\n“No, a Greek. He affects to speak a kind of Doric dialect.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles laughed again, and even more lightly.\r\n\r\n“A deserter, you say. Then why, by Athena’s owls, has he left ‘the Land of\r\nRoast Hare’ among the Persians, whither so many are betaking themselves?\r\nWe’ve not so many deserters to our cause that to-night we can ignore one.\r\nFetch him in.”\r\n\r\n“But the council with Eurybiades?” implored Simonides, almost on his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n“To the harpies with it! I asked Zeus for an omen. It comes—a fair one.\r\nThere is time to hear this deserter, to confound Adeimantus, and to save\r\nHellas too!”\r\n\r\nThemistocles tossed his head. The wavering, the doubting frown was gone.\r\nHe was himself again. What he hoped for, what device lay in that\r\ninexhaustible brain of his, Simonides did not know. But the sight itself\r\nof this strong, smiling man gave courage. The officer reëntered, with him\r\na young man, his face in part concealed by a thick beard and a peaked cap\r\ndrawn low upon his forehead. The stranger came boldly across to\r\nThemistocles, spoke a few words, whereat the admiral instantly bade the\r\nofficer to quit the cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CRAFT OF ODYSSEUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stranger drew back the shaggy cap. Simonides and Themistocles saw a\r\nyoung, well-formed man. With his thick beard and the flickering cabin\r\nlamps it was impossible to discover more. The newcomer stood silent as if\r\nawaiting remark from the others, and they in turn looked on him.\r\n\r\n“Well,” spoke the admiral, at length, “who are you? Why are you here?”\r\n\r\n“You do not know me?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least, and my memory is good. But your speech now is Attic,\r\nnot Doric as they told me.”\r\n\r\n“It may well be Attic, I am Athenian born.”\r\n\r\n“Athenian? And still to me a stranger? Ah! an instant. Your voice is\r\nfamiliar. Where have I heard it before?”\r\n\r\n“The last time,” rejoined the stranger, his tones rising, “it was a\r\ncertain night at Colonus. Democrates and Hermippus were with\r\nyou—likewise—”\r\n\r\nThemistocles leaped back three steps.\r\n\r\n“The sea gives up its dead. You are Glaucon son of—”\r\n\r\n“Conon,” completed the fugitive, folding his arms calmly, but the admiral\r\nwas not so calm.\r\n\r\n“Miserable youth! What harpy, what evil god has brought you hither? What\r\nprevents that I give you over to the crew to crucify at the foremast?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing hinders! nothing”—Glaucon’s voice mounted to shrillness—“save\r\nthat Athens and Hellas need all their sons this night.”\r\n\r\n“A loyal son you have been!” darted Themistocles, his lips curling. “Where\r\ndid you escape the sea?”\r\n\r\n“I was washed on Astypalæa.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you been since?”\r\n\r\n“In Sardis.”\r\n\r\n“Who protected you there?”\r\n\r\n“Mardonius.”\r\n\r\n“Did the Persians treat you so shabbily that you were glad to desert\r\nthem?”\r\n\r\n“They loaded me with riches and honour. Xerxes showered me with benefits.”\r\n\r\n“And you accompanied their army to Hellas? You went with the other Greek\r\nrenegades—the sons of Hippias and the rest?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon’s brow grew very red, but he met Themistocles’s arrowlike gaze.\r\n\r\n“I did—and yet—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes—the ‘yet,’ ” observed Themistocles, sarcastically. “I had\r\nexpected it. Well, I can imagine many motives for coming,—to betray our\r\nhopes to the Persians, or even because Athena has put some contrite\r\nmanhood in your heart. You know, of course, that the resolution we passed\r\nrecalling the exiles did not extend pardon to traitors.”\r\n\r\n“I know it.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles flung himself into a chair. The admiral was in a rare\r\ncondition for him,—truly at a loss to divine the best word and question.\r\n\r\n“Sit also, Simonides,” his order, “and you, once Alcmæonid and now outlaw,\r\ntell why, after these confessions, I should believe any other part of your\r\nstory?”\r\n\r\n“I do not ask you to believe,”—Glaucon stood like a statue,—“I shall not\r\nblame you if you do the worst,—yet you shall hear—”\r\n\r\nThe admiral made an impatient gesture, commanding “Begin,” and the\r\nfugitive poured out his tale. All the voyage from Phaleron he had been\r\nnerving himself for this ordeal; his composure did not desert now. He\r\nrelated lucidly, briefly, how the fates had dealt with him since he fled\r\nColonus. Only when he told of his abiding with Leonidas Themistocles’s\r\ngaze grew sharper.\r\n\r\n“Tell that again. Be careful. I am very good at detecting lies.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon repeated unfalteringly.\r\n\r\n“What proof that you were with Leonidas?”\r\n\r\n“None but my word. Euboulus of Corinth and the Spartans alone knew my\r\nname. They are dead.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! And you expect me to accept the boast of a traitor with a price\r\nupon his head?”\r\n\r\n“You said you were good at detecting lies.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles’s head went down between his hands; at last he lifted it and\r\ngazed the deserter in the face.\r\n\r\n“Now, son of Conon, do you still persist that you are innocent? Do you\r\nrepeat those oaths you swore at Colonus?”\r\n\r\n“All. I did not write that letter.”\r\n\r\n“Who did, then?”\r\n\r\n“A malignant god, I said. I will say it again.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Gods take human agencies to ruin a man in these days, even Hermes the\r\nTrickster. Again I say, who wrote that letter?”\r\n\r\n“Athena knows.”\r\n\r\n“And unfortunately her Ladyship the Goddess will not tell,” cried the\r\nadmiral, blasphemously. “Let us fall back on easier questions. Did I write\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Absurd.”\r\n\r\n“Did Democrates?”\r\n\r\n“Absurd again, still—”\r\n\r\n“Do you not see, dearest outlaw,” said Themistocles, mildly, “until you\r\ncan lay that letter on some other man’s shoulders, I cannot answer, ‘I\r\nbelieve you’?”\r\n\r\n“I did not ask that. I have a simpler request. Will you let me serve\r\nHellas?”\r\n\r\n“How do I know you are not a spy sent from Mardonius?”\r\n\r\n“Because too many deserters and talebearers are flying to Xerxes now to\r\nrequire that I thrust my head in the Hydra’s jaws. You know surely that.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“There’s truth said there, Simonides. What do you think?” The last\r\nquestion was to the poet.\r\n\r\n“That this Glaucon, whatever his guilt a year ago, comes to-night in good\r\nfaith.”\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_ that’s easily said. But what if he betrays us again?”\r\n\r\n“If I understand aright,” spoke Simonides, shrewdly, “our case is such\r\nthere’s little left worth betraying.”\r\n\r\n“Not badly put,”—again Themistocles pressed his forehead, while Glaucon\r\nstood as passive as hard marble. Then the admiral suddenly began to rain\r\nquestions like an arrow volley.\r\n\r\n“You come from the king’s camp?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And have heard the plans of battle?”\r\n\r\n“I was not at the council, but nothing is concealed. The Persians are too\r\nconfident.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. How do their ships lie?”\r\n\r\n“Crowded around the havens of Athens. The vassal Ionians have their ships\r\non the left. The Phœnicians, Xerxes’s chief hope, lie on the right, but on\r\nthe extreme right anchor the Egyptians.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know this?”\r\n\r\n“From the camp-followers’ talk. Then, too, I rowed by the whole armada\r\nwhile on my way to Salamis. I have eyes. The moon was shining. I was not\r\nmistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know where rides the trireme of Ariabignes, Xerxes’s\r\nadmiral-in-chief?”\r\n\r\n“Off the entrance to Peiræus. It is easy to find her. She is covered with\r\nlights.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! and the Egyptian squadron is on the extreme right and closest to\r\nSalamis?”\r\n\r\n“Very close.”\r\n\r\n“If they went up the coast as far as the promontory on Mt. Ægaleos, the\r\nstrait toward Eleusis would be closed?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“And on the south the way is already blocked by the Ionians.”\r\n\r\n“I had trouble in passing even in my skiff.”\r\n\r\nMore questions, Glaucon not knowing whither they all were drifting.\r\nWithout warning Themistocles uprose and smote his thigh.\r\n\r\n“So you are anxious to serve Hellas?”\r\n\r\n“Have I not said it?”\r\n\r\n“Dare you die for her?”\r\n\r\n“I made the choice once with Leonidas.”\r\n\r\n“Dare you do a thing which, if it slip, may give you into the hands of the\r\nBarbarians to be torn by wild horses or of the Greeks to be crucified?”\r\n\r\n“But it shall not slip!”\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_ that is a noble answer. Now let us come.”\r\n\r\n“Whither?”\r\n\r\n“To Eurybiades’s flag-ship. Then I can know whether you must risk the\r\ndeed.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles touched a bronze gong; a marine adjutant entered.\r\n\r\n“My pinnace,” ordered the admiral. As the man went out, Themistocles took\r\na long himation from the locker and wrapped it around the newcomer.\r\n\r\n“Since even Simonides and I did not recognize you in your long beard, I\r\ndoubt if you are in danger of detection to-night. But remember your name\r\nis Critias. You can dye your hair if you come safe back from this\r\nadventure. Have you eaten?”\r\n\r\n“Who has hunger now?”\r\n\r\nThemistocles laughed.\r\n\r\n“So say all of us. But if the gifts of Demeter cannot strengthen, it is\r\nnot so with those of Dionysus. Drink.”\r\n\r\nHe took from a hook a leathern bottle and poured out a hornful of hot\r\nChian. Glaucon did not refuse. After he had finished the admiral did\r\nlikewise. Then Glaucon in turn asked questions.\r\n\r\n“Where is my wife?”\r\n\r\n“In the town of Salamis, with her father; do you know she has borne—”\r\n\r\n“A son. Are both well?”\r\n\r\n“Well. The child is fair as the son of Leto.”\r\n\r\nThey could see the light flash out of the eyes of the outlaw. He turned\r\ntoward the statue and stretched out his hand.\r\n\r\n“O Aphrodite, I bless thee!” Then again to the admiral, “And Hermione is\r\nnot yet given to Democrates in marriage?” The words came swiftly.\r\n\r\n“Not yet. Hermippus desires it. Hermione resists. She calls Democrates\r\nyour destroyer.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon turned away his face that they might not behold it.\r\n\r\n“The god has not yet forgotten mercy,” Simonides thought he heard him say.\r\n\r\n“The pinnace is waiting, _kyrie_,” announced the orderly from the\r\ncompanionway.\r\n\r\n“Let the deserter’s skiff be towed behind,” ordered Themistocles, once on\r\ndeck, “and let Sicinnus also go with me.”\r\n\r\nThe keen-eyed Asiatic took his place with Themistocles and Glaucon in the\r\nstern. The sturdy boatmen sent the pinnace dancing. All through the brief\r\nvoyage the admiral was at whispers with Sicinnus. As they reached the\r\nSpartan flag-ship, half a score of pinnaces trailing behind told how the\r\nPeloponnesian admirals were already aboard clamouring at Eurybiades for\r\norders to fly. From the ports of the stern-cabin the glare of many lamps\r\nspread wavering bars of light across the water. Voices came, upraised in\r\njarring debate. The marine guard saluted with his spear as Themistocles\r\nwent up the ladder. Leaving his companions on deck, the admiral hastened\r\nbelow. An instant later he was back and beckoned the Asiatic and the\r\noutlaw to the ship’s rail.\r\n\r\n“Take Sicinnus to the Persian high admiral,” was his ominous whisper, “and\r\nfail not,—fail not, for I say to you except the god prosper you now, not\r\nall Olympus can save our Hellas to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nNot another word as he turned again to the cabin. The pinnace crew had\r\nbrought the skiff alongside, Sicinnus entered it, Glaucon took the oars,\r\npulled out a little, as if back to the _Nausicaä_, then sent the head of\r\nthe skiff around, pointing across the strait, toward the havens of Athens.\r\nSicinnus sat in silence, but Glaucon guessed the errand. The wind was\r\nrising and bringing clouds. This would hide the moon and lessen the\r\ndanger. But above all things speed was needful. The athlete put his\r\nstrength upon the oars till the heavy skiff shot across the black void of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was little short of midnight when Glaucon swung the skiff away from the\r\ntall trireme of Ariabignes, the Barbarian’s admiral. The deed was done. He\r\nhad sat in the bobbing boat while Sicinnus had been above with the Persian\r\nchiefs. Officers who had exchanged the wine-cup with Glaucon in the days\r\nwhen he stood at Xerxes’s side passed through the glare of the battle\r\nlanterns swaying above the rail. The Athenian had gripped at the dagger in\r\nhis belt as he watched them. Better in the instant of discovery to slay\r\none’s self than die a few hours afterward by slow tortures! But discovery\r\nhad not come. Sicinnus had come down the ladder, smiling, jesting, a dozen\r\nsubalterns salaaming as he went, and offering all manner of service, for\r\nhad he not been a bearer of great good tidings to the king?\r\n\r\n“Till to-morrow,” an olive-skinned Cilician navarch had spoken.\r\n\r\n“Till to-morrow,” waved the messenger, lightly. He did all things coolly,\r\nas if he had been bearing an invitation to a feast, took his post in the\r\nstern of the skiff deliberately, then turned to the silent man with him.\r\n\r\n“Pull.”\r\n\r\n“Whither?” Glaucon was already tugging the oars.\r\n\r\n“To Eurybiades’s ship. Themistocles is waiting. And again all speed.”\r\n\r\nThe line of twinkling water betwixt the skiff and the Persian widened. For\r\na few moments Glaucon bent himself silently to his task, then for the\r\nfirst time questioned.\r\n\r\n“What have you done?”\r\n\r\nEven in the darkness he knew Sicinnus grinned and showed his teeth.\r\n\r\n“In the name of Themistocles I have told the Barbarian chiefs that the\r\nHellenes are at strife one with another, that they are meditating a hasty\r\nflight, that if the king’s captains will but move their ships so as to\r\nenclose them, it is likely there will be no battle in the morning, but the\r\nHellenes will fall into the hands of Xerxes unresisting.”\r\n\r\n“And the Persian answered?”\r\n\r\n“That I and my master would not fail of reward for this service to the\r\nking. That the Egyptian ships would be swung at once across the strait to\r\ncut off all flight by the Hellenes.”\r\n\r\nThe outlaw made no answer, but pulled at the oars. The reaction from the\r\nday and evening of strain and peril was upon him. He was unutterably\r\nweary, though more in mind than in body. The clumsy skiff seemed only to\r\ncrawl. Trusting the orders of Sicinnus to steer him aright, he closed his\r\neyes. One picture after another of his old life came up before him now he\r\nwas in the stadium at Corinth and facing the giant Spartan, now he stood\r\nby Hermione on the sacred Rock at Athens, now he was at Xerxes’s side with\r\nthe fleets and the myriads passing before them at the Hellespont, he saw\r\nhis wife, he saw Roxana, and all other things fair and lovely that had\r\ncrossed his life. Had he made the best choice? Were the desperate fates of\r\nHellas better than the flower-banked streams of Bactria, whose delights he\r\nhad forever thrust by? Would his Fortune, guider of every human destiny,\r\nbring him at last to a calm haven, or would his life go out amid the\r\ncrashing ships to-morrow? The oars bumped on the thole-pins. He pulled\r\nmechanically, the revery ever deepening, then a sharp hail awoke him.\r\n\r\n“O-op! What do you here?”\r\n\r\nThe call was in Phœnician. Glaucon scarce knew the harsh Semitic speech,\r\nbut the _lembos_, a many-oared patrol cutter, was nearly on them. A moment\r\nmore, and seizure would be followed by identification. Life, death,\r\nHellas, Hermione, all flashed before his eyes as he sat numbed, but\r\nSicinnus saved them both.\r\n\r\n“The password to-night? You know it,” he demanded in quick whisper.\r\n\r\n“ ‘Hystaspes,’ ” muttered Glaucon, still wool-gathering.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? Why here?” An officer in the cutter was rising and upholding\r\nan unmasked lantern. “We’ve been ordered to cruise in the channel and snap\r\nup deserters, and by Baal, here are twain! The crows will pick at your\r\neyes to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nSicinnus stood upright in the skiff.\r\n\r\n“Fool,” he answered in good Sidonian, “dare you halt the king’s privy\r\nmessenger? It is not _our_ heads that the crows will find the soonest.”\r\n\r\nThe cutter was close beside them, but the officer dropped his lantern.\r\n\r\n“Good, then. Give the password.”\r\n\r\n“ ‘Hystaspes.’ ”\r\n\r\nThey could see the Phœnician’s hand rise to his head in salute.\r\n\r\n“Forgive my rudeness, worthy sir. It’s truly needless to seek deserters\r\nto-night with the Hellenes’ affairs so desperate, yet we must obey his\r\nEternity’s orders.”\r\n\r\n“I pardon you,” quoth the emissary, loftily, “I will commend your\r\nvigilance to the admiral.”\r\n\r\n“May Moloch give your Lordship ten thousand children,” called back the\r\nmollified Semite.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the cutter dropped their blades into the water. The boats\r\nglided apart. Not till there was a safe stretch betwixt them did Glaucon\r\nbegin to grow hot, then cold, then hot again. Chill Thanatos had passed\r\nand missed by a hair’s breadth. Again the bumping of the oars and the\r\nslow, slow creeping over the water. The night was darkening. The clouds\r\nhad hid the moon and all her stars. Sicinnus, shrewd and weatherwise,\r\nremarked, “There will be a stiff wind in the morning,” and lapsed into\r\nsilence. Glaucon toiled on resolutely. A fixed conviction was taking\r\npossession of his mind,—one that had come on the day he had been preserved\r\nat Thermopylæ, now deepened by the event just passed,—that he was being\r\nreserved by the god for some crowning service to Hellas, after which\r\nshould come peace, whether the peace of a warrior who dies in the arms of\r\nvictory, whether the peace of a life spent after a deed well done, he\r\nscarcely knew, and in the meantime, if the storms must beat and the waves\r\nrise up against him, he would bear them still. Like the hero of his race,\r\nhe could say, “Already have I suffered much and much have I toiled in\r\nperils of waves and war, let this be added to the tale of those.”\r\n\r\nBump—bump, the oars played their monotonous music on the thole-pins.\r\nSicinnus stirred on his seat. He was peering northward anxiously, and\r\nGlaucon knew what he was seeking. Through the void of the night their\r\nstraining eyes saw masses gliding across the face of the water. Ariabignes\r\nwas making his promise good. Yonder the Egyptian fleet were swinging forth\r\nto close the last retreat of the Hellenes. Thus on the north, and\r\nsouthward, too, other triremes were thrusting out, bearing—both watchers\r\nwisely guessed—a force to disembark on Psyttaleia, the islet betwixt\r\nSalamis and the main, a vantage-point in the coming battle.\r\n\r\nThe coming battle? It was so silent, ghostlike, far away, imagination\r\nscarce could picture it. Was this black slumberous water to be the scene\r\nat dawn of a combat beside which that of Hector and Achilles under Troy\r\nwould be only as a tale that is told? And was he, Glaucon, son of Conon\r\nthe Alcmæonid, sitting there in the skiff alone with Sicinnus, to have a\r\npart therein, in a battle the fame whereof should ring through the ages?\r\nBump, bump—still the monologue of the oars. A fish near by leaped from the\r\nwater, splashing loudly. Then for an instant the clouds broke. Selene\r\nuncovered her face. The silvery flash quickly come, more quickly flying,\r\nshowed him the headlands of that Attica now in Xerxes’s hands. He saw\r\nPentelicus and Hymettus, Parnes and Cithæron, the hills he had wandered\r\nover in glad boyhood, the hills where rested his ancestors’ dust. It was\r\nno dream. He felt his warm blood quicken. He felt the round-bowed skiff\r\nspring over the waves, as with unwearied hands he tugged at the oar. There\r\nare moments when the dullest mind grows prophetic, and the mind of the\r\nAthenian was not dull. The moonlight had vanished. In its place through\r\nthe magic darkness seemed gathering all the heroes of his people beckoning\r\nhim and his compeers onward. Perseus was there, and Theseus and\r\nErechtheus, Heracles the Mighty, and Odysseus the Patient, whose intellect\r\nThemistocles possessed, Solon the Wise, Periander the Crafty, Diomedes the\r\nUndaunted, men of reality, men of fable, sages, warriors, demigods,\r\ncrowding together, speaking one message: “Be strong, for the heritage of\r\nwhat you do this coming day shall be passed beyond children’s children,\r\nshall be passed down to peoples to whom the tongue, the gods, yea, the\r\nname of Hellas, are but as a dream.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon felt the weariness fly from him. He was refreshed as never by\r\nwine. Then through the void in place of the band of heroes slowly\r\noutspread the tracery of a vessel at anchor,—the outermost guardship of\r\nthe fleet of the Hellenes. They were again amongst friends. The watcher on\r\nthe trireme was keeping himself awake after the manner of sentries by\r\nsinging. In the night-stillness the catch from Archilochus rang lustily.\r\n\r\n  “By my spear I have won my bread,\r\n  By spear won my clear, red wine,\r\n  On my spear I will lean and drink,—\r\n  Show me a merrier life than is mine!”\r\n\r\nThe trolling called Glaucon back to reality. Guided by Sicinnus, who knew\r\nthe stations of the Greek fleet better than he, a second time they came\r\nbeside the Spartan admiral. The lamps were still burning in the\r\nstern-cabin. Even before they were alongside, they caught the clamours of\r\nfierce debate.\r\n\r\n“Still arguing?” quoth Sicinnus to the yawning marine officer who advanced\r\nto greet them as they reached the top of the ladder.\r\n\r\n“Still arguing,” grunted the Spartan. “I think your master has dragged\r\nforth all his old arguments and invented a thousand new ones. He talks\r\ncontinuously, as if battling for time, though only Castor knows wherefore.\r\nThere’s surely a majority against him.”\r\n\r\nThe emissary descended the companionway, Themistocles leaped up from his\r\nseat in the crowded council. A few whispers, the Asiatic returned to\r\nGlaucon on the deck. The two gazed down the companionway, observing\r\neverything. They had not long to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BEFORE THE DEATH GRAPPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the fourth time the subaltern who stood at Eurybiades’s elbow turned\r\nthe water-glass that marked the passing of the hours. The lamps in the\r\nlow-ceiled cabin were flickering dimly. Men glared on one another across\r\nthe narrow table with drawn and heated faces. Adeimantus of Corinth was\r\nrising to reply to the last appeal of the Athenian.\r\n\r\n“We have had enough, Eurybiades, of Themistocles’s wordy folly. Because\r\nthe Athenian admiral is resolved to lead all Hellas to destruction, is no\r\nreason that we should follow. As for his threat that he will desert us\r\nwith his ships if we refuse to fight, I fling it in his face that he dare\r\nnot make it good. Why go all over the well-threshed straw again? Is not\r\nthe fleet of the king overwhelming? Were we not saved by a miracle from\r\noverthrow at Artemisium? Do not the scouts tell us the Persians are\r\nadvancing beyond Eleusis toward Megara and the Isthmus? Is not our best\r\nfighting blood here in the fleet? Then if the Isthmus is threatened, our\r\nbusiness is to defend it and save the Peloponnesus, the last remnant of\r\nHellas unconquered. Now then, headstrong son of Neocles, answer that!”\r\n\r\nThe Corinthian, a tall domineering man, threw back his shoulders like a\r\nboxer awaiting battle. Themistocles did not answer, but only smiled up at\r\nhim from his seat opposite.\r\n\r\n“I have silenced you, grinning babbler, at last,” thundered Adeimantus,\r\n“and I demand of you, O Eurybiades, that we end this tedious debate. If we\r\nare to retreat, let us retreat. A vote, I say, a vote!”\r\n\r\nEurybiades rose at the head of the table. He was a heavy, florid\r\nindividual with more than the average Spartan’s slowness of tongue and\r\nintellect. Physically he was no coward, but he dreaded responsibility.\r\n\r\n“Much has been said,” he announced ponderously, “many opinions offered. It\r\nwould seem the majority of the council favour the decision to retire\r\nforthwith. Has Themistocles anything more to say why the vote should not\r\nbe taken?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” rejoined the Athenian, with an equanimity that made Adeimantus\r\nsnap his teeth.\r\n\r\n“We will therefore take the vote city by city,” went on Eurybiades. “Do\r\nyou, Phlegon of Seriphos, give your vote.”\r\n\r\nSeriphos—wretched islet—sent only one ship, but thanks to the Greek mania\r\nfor “equality” Phlegon’s vote had equal weight with that of Themistocles.\r\n\r\n“Salamis is not defensible,” announced the Seriphian, shortly. “Retreat.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Charmides of Melos?”\r\n\r\n“Retreat.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Phoibodas of Trœzene?”\r\n\r\n“Retreat, by all the gods.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Hippocrates of Ægina?”\r\n\r\n“Stay and fight. If you go back to the Isthmus, Ægina must be abandoned to\r\nthe Barbarians. I am with Themistocles.”\r\n\r\n“Record his vote,” shouted Adeimantus, ill-naturedly, “he is but one\r\nagainst twenty. But I warn you, Eurybiades, do not call for Themistocles’s\r\nvote, or the rest of us will be angry. The man whose city is under the\r\npower of the Barbarian has no vote in this council, however much we\r\ncondescend to listen to his chatterings.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian sprang from his seat, his aspect as threatening as Apollo\r\ndescending Olympus in wrath.\r\n\r\n“Where is my country, Adeimantus? Yonder!” he pointed out the open\r\nport-hole, “there rides the array of our Athenian ships. What other state\r\nin Hellas sends so many and sets better men within them? Athens still\r\nlives, though her Acropolis be wrapped in flames. ‘Strong-hearted men and\r\nnaught else are warp and woof of a city.’ Do you forget Alcæus’s word so\r\nsoon, O Boaster from Corinth? Yes, by Athena Promachos, Mistress of\r\nBattles, while those nine score ships ride on the deep, I have a city\r\nfairer, braver, than yours. And will you still deny me equal voice and\r\nvote with this noble trierarch from Siphinos with his one, or with his\r\ncomrade from Melos with his twain?”\r\n\r\nThemistocles’s voice rang like a trumpet. Adeimantus winced. Eurybiades\r\nbroke in with soothing tones.\r\n\r\n“No one intends to deny your right to vote, Themistocles. The excellent\r\nCorinthian did but jest.”\r\n\r\n“A fitting hour for jesting!” muttered the Athenian, sinking back into his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n“The vote, the vote!” urged the Sicyonian chief, from Adeimantus’s elbow,\r\nand the voting went on. Of more than twenty voices only\r\nthree—Themistocles’s and those of the Æginetan and Megarian admirals—were\r\nin favour of abiding the onset. Yet even when Eurybiades arose to announce\r\nthe decision, the son of Neocles sat with his hands sprawling on the\r\ntable, his face set in an inscrutable smile as he looked on Adeimantus.\r\n\r\n“It is the plain opinion,”—Eurybiades hemmed and hawed with his\r\nwords,—“the plain opinion, I say, of this council that the allied fleet\r\nretire at once to the Isthmus. Therefore, I, as admiral-in-chief, do order\r\neach commander to proceed to his own flag-ship and prepare his triremes to\r\nretire at dawn.”\r\n\r\n“Well said,” shouted Adeimantus, already on his feet; “now to obey.”\r\n\r\nBut with him rose Themistocles. He stood tall and calm, his thumbs thrust\r\nin his girdle. His smile was a little broader, his head held a little\r\nhigher, than of wont.\r\n\r\n“Good Eurybiades, I grieve to blast the wisdom of all these valiant\r\ngentlemen, but they cannot retire if they wish.”\r\n\r\n“Explain!” a dozen shouted.\r\n\r\n“Very simply. I have had good reason to know that the king has moved\r\nforward the western horn of his fleet, so as to enclose our anchorage at\r\nSalamis. It is impossible to retire save through the Persian line of\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\nPerseus upholding the Gorgon’s head before Polydectes’s guests and turning\r\nthem to stone wrought hardly more of a miracle than this calm announcement\r\nof Themistocles. Men stared at him vacantly, stunned by the tidings, then\r\nAdeimantus’s frightened wrath broke loose.\r\n\r\n“Fox!(10) Was this your doing?”\r\n\r\n“I did not ask you to thank me, _philotate_,” was the easy answer. “It is,\r\nhowever, urgent to consider whether you wish to be taken unresisting in\r\nthe morning.”\r\n\r\nThe Corinthian shook his fist across the table.\r\n\r\n“Liar, as a last device to ruin us, you invent this folly.”\r\n\r\n“It is easy to see if I lie,” rejoined Themistocles; “send out a pinnace\r\nand note where the Persians anchor. It will not take long.”\r\n\r\nFor an instant swords seemed about to leap from their scabbards, and the\r\nenraged Peloponnesians to sheathe them in the Athenian’s breast. He stood\r\nunflinching, smiling, while a volley of curses flew over him. Then an\r\norderly summoned him on deck, while Adeimantus and his fellows foamed and\r\ncontended below. Under the battle lantern Themistocles saw a man who was\r\nhis elder in years, rugged in feature, with massive forehead and wise gray\r\neyes. This was Aristeides the Just, the admiral’s enemy, but their feud\r\nhad died when Xerxes drew near to Athens.\r\n\r\nHands clasped heartily as the twain stood face to face.\r\n\r\n“Our rivalry forever more shall be a rivalry which of us can do most to\r\nprofit Athens,” spoke the returning exile; then Aristeides told how he had\r\neven now come from Ægina, how he had heard of the clamours to retreat, how\r\nretreat was impossible, for the Persians were pressing in. A laugh from\r\nThemistocles interrupted.\r\n\r\n“My handiwork! Come to the council. They will not believe me, no, not my\r\noath.”\r\n\r\nAristeides told his story, and how his vessel to Salamis had scarce\r\nescaped the Egyptian triremes, and how by this time all entrance and exit\r\nwas surely closed. But even now many an angry captain called him “liar.”\r\nThe strife of words was at white heat when Eurybiades himself silenced the\r\nfiercest doubter.\r\n\r\n“Captains of Hellas, a trireme of Teos has deserted from the Barbarian to\r\nus. Her navarch sends word that all is even as Themistocles and Aristeides\r\ntell. The Egyptians hold the passage to Eleusis. Infantry are disembarked\r\non Psyttaleia. The Phœnicians and Ionians enclose us on the eastern\r\nstrait. We are hemmed in.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOnce more the orderly turned the water-clock. It was past midnight. The\r\nclouds had blown apart before the rising wind. The debate must end.\r\nEurybiades stood again to take the votes of the wearied, tense-strung men.\r\n\r\n“In view of the report of the Teans, what is your voice and vote?”\r\n\r\nBefore all the rest up leaped Adeimantus. He was no craven at heart,\r\nthough an evil genius had possessed him.\r\n\r\n“You have your will, Themistocles,” he made the concession sullenly yet\r\nfirmly, “you have your will. May Poseidon prove you in the right. If it is\r\nbattle or slavery at dawn, the choice is quick. Battle!”\r\n\r\n“Battle!” shouted the twenty, arising together, and Eurybiades had no need\r\nto declare the vote. The commanders scattered to their flag-ships, to give\r\norders to be ready to fight at dawn. Themistocles went to his pinnace\r\nlast. He walked proudly. He knew that whatever glory he might gain on the\r\nmorrow, he could never win a fairer victory than he had won that night.\r\nWhen his barge came alongside, his boat crew knew that his eyes were\r\ndancing, that his whole mien was of a man in love with his fortune. Many\r\ntimes, as Glaucon sat beside him, he heard the son of Neocles repeating as\r\nin ecstasy:—\r\n\r\n“They must fight. They must fight.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nGlaucon sat mutely in the pinnace which had headed not for the _Nausicaä_,\r\nbut toward the shore, where a few faint beacons were burning.\r\n\r\n“I must confer with the strategi as to the morning,” Themistocles declared\r\nafter a long interval, at which Sicinnus broke in anxiously:—\r\n\r\n“You will not sleep, _kyrie_?”\r\n\r\n“Sleep?” laughed the admiral, as at an excellent jest, “I have forgotten\r\nthere was such a god as Hypnos.” Then, ignoring Sicinnus, he addressed the\r\noutlaw.\r\n\r\n“I am grateful to you, my friend,” he did not call Glaucon by name before\r\nthe others, “you have saved me, and I have saved Hellas. You brought me a\r\nnew plan when I seemed at the last resource. How can the son of Neocles\r\nreward you?”\r\n\r\n“Give me a part to play to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Thermopylæ was not brisk enough fighting, ha? Can you still fling a\r\njavelin?”\r\n\r\n“I can try.”\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_ Try you shall.” He let his voice drop. “Do not forget your name\r\nhenceforth is Critias. The _Nausicaä’s_ crew are mostly from Sunium and\r\nthe Mesogia. They’d hardly recognize you under that beard; still Sicinnus\r\nmust alter you.”\r\n\r\n“Command me, _kyrie_,” said the Asiatic.\r\n\r\n“A strange time and place, but you must do it. Find some dark dye for this\r\nman’s hair to-night, and at dawn have him aboard the flag-ship.”\r\n\r\n“The thing can be done, _kyrie_.”\r\n\r\n“After that, lie down and sleep. Because Themistocles is awake, is no\r\ncause for others’ star-gazing. Sleep sound. Pray Apollo and Hephæstus to\r\nmake your eye sure, your hand strong. Then awake to see the glory of\r\nHellas.”\r\n\r\nConfidence, yes, power came through the tones of the admiral’s voice.\r\nThemistocles went away to the belated council. Sicinnus led his charge\r\nthrough the crooked streets of the town of Salamis. Sailors were sleeping\r\nin the open night, and they stumbled over them. At last they found a small\r\ntavern where a dozen shipmen sprawled on the earthen floor, and a gaping\r\nhost was just quenching his last lamp. Sicinnus, however, seemed to know\r\nhim. There was much protesting and headshaking, at last ended by the glint\r\nof a daric. The man grumbled, departed, returned after a tedious interval\r\nwith a pot of ointment, found Hermes knew where. By a rush-candle’s\r\nflicker Sicinnus applied the dark dye with a practised hand.\r\n\r\n“You know the art well,” observed the outlaw.\r\n\r\n“Assuredly; the agent of Themistocles must be a Proteus with his\r\ndisguises.”\r\n\r\nSicinnus laid down his pot and brushes. They had no mirror, but Glaucon\r\nknew that he was transformed. The host got his daric. Again they went out\r\ninto the night and forsaking the crowded town sought the seaside. The\r\nstrand was broad, the sand soft and cool, the circling stars gave three\r\nhours yet of night, and they lay down to rest. The sea and the shore\r\nstretched away, a magic vista with a thousand mystic shapes springing out\r\nof the charmed darkness, made and unmade as overwrought fancy summoned\r\nthem. As from an unreal world Glaucon—whilst he lay—saw the lights of the\r\nscattered ships, heard the clank of chains, the rattling of tacklings.\r\nNature slept. Only man was waking.\r\n\r\n  “The mountain brows, the rocks, the peaks are sleeping,\r\n        Uplands and gorges hush!\r\n  The thousand moorland things are silence keeping,\r\n        The beasts under each bush\r\n         Crouch, and the hived bees\r\n         Rest in their honeyed ease;\r\n     In the purple sea fish lie as they were dead,\r\n     And each bird folds his wing over his head.”\r\n\r\nThe school-learned lines of Alcman, with a thousand other trivial things,\r\nswarmed back through the head of Glaucon the Alcmæonid. How much he had\r\nlived through that night, how much he would live through,—if indeed he was\r\nto live,—upon the morrow! The thought was benumbing in its greatness. His\r\nhead swam with confused memories. Then at last all things dimmed. Once\r\nmore he dreamed. He was with Hermione gathering red poppies on the hill\r\nabove Eleusis. She had filled her basket full. He called to her to wait\r\nfor him. She ran away. He chased, she fled with laughter and sparkling\r\neyes. He could hear the wavings of her dress, the little cries she flung\r\nback over her shoulder. Then by the sacred well near the temple he caught\r\nher. He felt her struggling gayly. He felt her warm breath upon his face,\r\nher hair was touching his forehead. Rejoicing in his strength, he was\r\nbending her head toward his—but here he wakened. Sicinnus had disappeared.\r\nA bar of gray gold hung over the water in the east.\r\n\r\n“This was the day. _This was the day!_”\r\n\r\nSome moments he lay trying to realize the fact in its full moment. A thin\r\nmist rested on the black water waiting to be dispelled by the sun. From\r\nafar came sounds not of seamen’s trumpets, but horns, harps, kettledrums,\r\nfrom the hidden mainland across the strait, as of a host advancing along\r\nthe shore. “Xerxes goes down to the marge with his myriads,” Glaucon told\r\nhimself. “Have not all his captains bowed and smiled, ‘Your Eternity’s\r\nvictory is certain. Come and behold.’ ” But here the Athenian shut his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nPeople at length were passing up and down the strand. The coast was\r\nwaking. The gray bar was becoming silver. Friends passed, deep in\r\ntalk,—perchance for the last time. Glaucon lay still a moment longer, and\r\nas he rested caught a voice so familiar he felt all the blood surge to his\r\nforehead,—Democrates’s voice.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, Hiram,—I told you before,—I have no part in the ordering of\r\nthe fleet. Were I to interfere with ever so good a heart, it would only\r\nbreed trouble for us all.”\r\n\r\nSo close were the twain, the orator’s trailing chiton almost fell on\r\nGlaucon’s face. The latter marvelled that his own heart did not spring\r\nfrom its prison in his breast, so fierce were its beatings.\r\n\r\n“If my Lord would go to Adeimantus and suggest,”—the other’s Greek came\r\nwith a marked Oriental accent.\r\n\r\n“Harpy! Adeimantus is no Medizer. He is pushed to bay now, and is sure to\r\nfight. Have you Barbarians no confidence? Has not the king two triremes to\r\nour one? Only fools can demand more. Tell Lycon, your master, I have long\r\nsince done my uttermost to serve him.”\r\n\r\n“Yet remember, Excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Begone, scoundrel. Don’t threaten again. If I know your power over me, I\r\ncan also promise you not to go down to Orchus alone, but take excellent\r\npains to have fair company.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to bear such tidings to Lycon, Excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Away with you!”\r\n\r\n“Do not raise your voice, _kyrie_,” spoke Hiram, never more blandly, “here\r\nis a man asleep.”\r\n\r\nThe hint sent Democrates from the spot almost on a run. Hiram disappeared\r\nin the opposite direction. Glaucon rose, shook the sand from his cloak,\r\nand stood an instant with his head whirling. The voice of his boyhood\r\nfriend, of the man who had ruined him because of a suspicion of\r\ntreason—and now deep in compromising talk with the agent of the chief of\r\nthe peace party at Sparta! And wherefore had Mardonius spoken those\r\nmysterious words at their parting, “Beware of Democrates”? For an instant\r\nthe problems evoked made him forget even the coming battle.\r\n\r\nA clear trumpet-blast down the strand gave a truce to questioning.\r\nSicinnus reappeared, and led Glaucon to one of the great fires roaring on\r\nthe beach, where the provident Greek sailors were breakfasting on barley\r\nporridge and meat broth before dining on spears and arrow-heads. A silent\r\ncompany, no laughter, no jesting. All knew another sun for them might\r\nnever rise. Glaucon ate not because he hungered, but because duty ordered\r\nit. As the light strengthened, the strand grew alive with thousands of men\r\nat toil. The triremes drawn on shore went down into the sea on their\r\nrollers. More trumpet-blasts sent the rowers aboard their ships. But last\r\nof all, before thrusting out to do or die, the Greeks must feast their\r\nears as well as their stomachs. On the sloping beach gathered the officers\r\nand the armoured marines,—eighteen from each trireme,—and heard one\r\nstirring harangue after another. The old feuds were forgotten. Adeimantus\r\nand Eurybiades both spoke bravely. The seers announced that every bird and\r\ncloud gave good omen. Prayer was offered to Ajax of Salamis that the hero\r\nshould fight for his people. Last of all Themistocles spoke, and never to\r\nfairer purpose. No boasts, no lip courage, a painting of the noble and the\r\nbase, the glory of dying as freemen, the infamy of existing as slaves. He\r\ntold of Marathon, of Thermopylæ, and asked if Leonidas had died as died a\r\nfool. He drew tears. He drew vows of vengeance. He never drew applause.\r\nMen were too strained for that. At last he sent the thousands forth.\r\n\r\n“Go, then. Quit yourselves as Hellenes. That is all the task. And I say to\r\nyou, in the after days this shall be your joy, to hear the greatest\r\ndeclare of you, ‘Reverence this man, for he saved us all at Salamis.’ ”\r\n\r\nThe company dispersed, each man to his ship. Themistocles went to his\r\npinnace, and a cheer uprose from sea and land as the boat shot out to the\r\n_Nausicaä_. Eurybiades might be chief in name; who did not know that\r\nThemistocles was the surest bulwark of Hellas?\r\n\r\nThe son of Neocles, standing in the boat, uplifted his face to the now\r\ngolden east.\r\n\r\n“Be witness, Helios,” he cried aloud, “be witness when thou comest, I have\r\ndone all things possible. And do thou and thy fellow-gods on bright\r\nOlympus rule our battle now; the lot is in your hands!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SALAMIS\r\n\r\n\r\nSunrise. The _Nausicaä_ was ready. Ameinias the navarch walked the deck\r\nabove the stern-cabin with nervous strides. All that human forethought\r\ncould do to prepare the ship had long been done. The slim hull one hundred\r\nand fifty feet long had been stripped of every superfluous rope and spar.\r\nThe masts had been lowered. On the cat-heads hung the anchors weighted\r\nwith stone to fend off an enemy, astern towed the pinnace ready to drag\r\nalongside and break the force of the hostile ram. The heavy-armed marines\r\nstood with their long boarding spears, to lead an attack or cast off\r\ngrappling-irons. But the true weapon of the _Nausicaä_ was herself. To\r\nsend the three-toothed beak through a foeman’s side was the end of her\r\nbeing. To meet the shock of collision two heavy cables had been bound\r\nhorizontally around the hull from stem to stern. The oarsmen,—the\r\n_thranites_ of the upper tier, the _zygites_ of the middle, the\r\n_thalamites_ of the lower,—one hundred and seventy swart, nervous-eyed\r\nmen, sat on their benches, and let their hands close tight upon those oars\r\nwhich trailed now in the drifting water, but which soon and eagerly should\r\nspring to life. At the belt of every oarsman dangled a sword, for\r\nboarders’ work was more than likely. Thirty spare rowers rested\r\nimpatiently on the centre deck, ready to leap wherever needed. On the\r\nforecastle commanded the _prōreus_, Ameinias’s lieutenant, and with him\r\nthe _keleustes_, the oar master who must give time on his sounding-board\r\nfor the rowing, and never fail,—not though the ships around reeled down to\r\nwatery grave. And finally on the poop by the captain stood the\r\n“governor,”—knotted, grizzled, and keen,—the man whose touch upon the\r\nheavy steering oars might give the _Nausicaä_ life or destruction when the\r\nships charged beak to beak.\r\n\r\n“The trireme is ready, admiral,” reported Ameinias, as Themistocles came\r\nup leisurely from the stern-cabin.\r\n\r\nThe son of Neocles threw back his helmet, that all might see his calm,\r\nuntroubled face. He wore a cuirass of silvered scale-armour over his\r\npurple chiton. At his side walked a young man, whom the ship’s people\r\nimagined the deserter of the preceding night, but he had drawn his helmet\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n“This is Critias,” said Themistocles, briefly, to the navarch; “he is a\r\ngood caster. See that he has plenty of darts.”\r\n\r\n“One of Themistocles’s secret agents,” muttered the captain to the\r\ngovernor, “we should have guessed it.” And they all had other things to\r\nthink of than the whence and wherefore of this stranger.\r\n\r\nIt was a weary, nervous interval. Men had said everything, done\r\neverything, hoped and feared everything. They were in no mood even to\r\ninvoke the gods. In desperation some jested riotously as they gripped the\r\noars on the benches,—demonstrations which the _prōreus_ quelled with a\r\nloud “Silence in the ship.” The morning mist was breaking. A brisk wind\r\nwas coming with the sun. Clear and strong sang the Notus, the breeze of\r\nthe kindly south. It covered the blue bay with crisping whitecaps, it sent\r\nthe surf foaming up along the Attic shore across the strait. Themistocles\r\nwatched it all with silent eyes, but eyes that spoke of gladness. He knew\r\nthe waves would beat with full force on the Persian prows, and make their\r\nswift movement difficult while the Greeks, taking the galloping surf\r\nastern, would suffer little.\r\n\r\n“Æolus fights for us. The first omen and a fair one.” The word ran in\r\nwhispers down the benches, and every soul on the trireme rejoiced.\r\n\r\nHow long did they sit thus? An æon? Would Eurybiades never draw out his\r\nline of battle? Would Adeimantus prove craven at the end? Would treachery\r\nundo Hellas to-day, as once before at Lade when the Ionian Greeks had\r\nfaced the Persian fleet in vain? Now as the vapour broke, men began to be\r\nable to look about them, and be delivered from their own thoughts. The\r\nshores of Salamis were alive,—old men, women, little children,—the\r\nfugitives from Attica were crowding to the marge in thousands to watch the\r\ndeed that should decide their all. And many a bronze-cheeked oarsman arose\r\nfrom his bench to wave farewell to the wife or father or mother, and sank\r\nback again,—a clutching in his throat, a mist before his eyes, while his\r\ngrip upon the oar grew like to steel.\r\n\r\nAs the _Nausicaä_ rode at her place in the long line of ships spread up\r\nand down the shore of Salamis, it was easy to detect forms if not faces on\r\nthe strand. And Glaucon, peering out from his helmet bars, saw Democrates\r\nhimself standing on the sands and beckoning to Themistocles. Then other\r\nfigures became clear to him out of the many, this one or that whom he had\r\nloved and clasped hands with in the sunlit days gone by. And last of all\r\nhe saw those his gaze hungered for the most, Hermippus, Lysistra, and\r\nanother standing at their side all in white, and in her arms she bore\r\nsomething he knew must be her child,—Hermione’s son, his son, born to the\r\nlot of a free man of Athens or a slave of Xerxes according as his elders\r\nplayed their part this day. Only a glimpse,—the throng of strangers opened\r\nto disclose them closed again; Glaucon leaned on a capstan. All the\r\nstrength for the moment was gone out of him.\r\n\r\n“You rowed and wrought too much last night, Critias,” spoke Themistocles,\r\nwho had eyes for everything. “To the cabin, Sicinnus, bring a cup of\r\nChian.”\r\n\r\n“No wine, for Athena’s sake!” cried the outlaw, drawing himself together,\r\n“it is passed. I am strong again.”\r\n\r\nA great shout from the shores and the waiting fleet made him forget even\r\nthe sight of Hermione.\r\n\r\n“They come! The Persians! The Persians!”\r\n\r\nThe fleet of the Barbarians was advancing from the havens of Athens.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe sun rose higher. He was far above Hymettus now, and shooting his\r\nbright javelins over mainland, islands, and waters. With his rising the\r\nsouthern breeze sang ever clearer, making the narrow channel betwixt\r\nSalamis and Attica white, and tossing each trireme merrily. Not a cloud\r\nhung upon Pentelicus, Hymettus, or the purple northern range of Parnes.\r\nOver the desolate Acropolis hovered a thin mist,—smoke from the\r\nsmouldering temple, the sight of which made every Attic sailor blink hard\r\nand think of the vengeance.\r\n\r\nYonder on the shore of the mainland the host of the Persian was moving:\r\nhorsemen in gilded panoply, Hydarnes’s spearmen in armour like suns. They\r\nstood by myriads in glittering masses about a little spur of Mt. Ægaleos,\r\nwhere a holy close of Heracles looked out upon the sea. To them were\r\ncoming more horsemen, chariots, litters, and across the strait drifted the\r\nthunderous acclamation, “Victory to the king!” For here on the ivory\r\nthrone, with his mighty men, his captains, his harem, about him, the “Lord\r\nof the World” would look down on the battle and see how his slaves could\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nNow the Barbarians began to move forth by sea. From the havens of Peiræus\r\nand their anchorages along the shore swept their galleys,—Phœnician,\r\nCilician, Egyptian, and, sorrow of sorrows, Ionian—Greek arrayed against\r\nGreek! Six hundred triremes and more they were, taller in poop and prow\r\nthan the Hellenes, and braver to look upon.\r\n\r\nEach vied with each in the splendour of the scarlet, purple, and gold upon\r\nstern and foreship. Their thousands of white oars moved like the onward\r\nmarch of an army as they trampled down the foam. From the masts of their\r\nmany admirals flew innumerable gay signal-flags. The commands shouted\r\nthrough trumpets in a dozen strange tongues—the shrill pipings of the oar\r\nmasters, the hoarse shouts of the rowers—went up to heaven in a clamorous\r\nbabel. “Swallows’ chatter,” cried the deriding Hellenes, but hearts were\r\nbeating quicker, breath was coming faster in many a breast by Salamis\r\nthen,—and no shame. For now was the hour of trial, the wrestle of Olympian\r\nZeus with Ahura-Mazda. Now would a mighty one speak from the heavens to\r\nHellas, and say to her “Die!” or “Be!”\r\n\r\nThe Barbarians’ armadas were forming. Their black beaks, all pointing\r\ntoward Salamis, stretched in two bristling lines from the islet of\r\nPsyttaleia—whence the shields of the landing force glittered—to that\r\nbrighter glitter on the promontory by Ægaleos where sat the king. To\r\ncharge their array seemed charging a moving hedge of spears, impenetrable\r\nin defence, invincible in attack. Slowly, rocked by the sea and rowing in\r\nsteady order, the armament approached Salamis. And still the Greek ships\r\nlay spread out along the shore, each trireme swinging at the end of the\r\ncable which moored her to the land, each mariner listening to the beatings\r\nof his own heart and straining his eyes on one ship now—Eurybiades’s—which\r\nrode at the centre of their line and far ahead.\r\n\r\nAll could read the order of battle at last as squadron lay against\r\nsquadron. On the west, under Xerxes’s own eye, the Athenians must charge\r\nthe serried Phœnicians, at the centre the Æginetans must face the\r\nCilicians, on the east Adeimantus and his fellows from Peloponnese must\r\nmake good against the vassal Ionians. But would the signal to row and\r\nstrike never come? Had some god numbed Eurybiades’s will? Was treachery\r\ndoing its darkest work? With men so highly wrought moments were precious.\r\nThe bow strung too long will lose power. And wherefore did Eurybiades\r\ntarry?\r\n\r\nEvery soul in the _Nausicaä_ kept his curses soft, and waited—waited till\r\nthat trailing monster, the Persian fleet, had crept halfway from\r\nPsyttaleia toward them, then up the shrouds of the Spartan admiral leaped\r\na flag. Eager hands drew it, yet it seemed mounting as a snail, till at\r\nthe masthead the clear wind blew it wide,—a plain red banner, but as it\r\nspread hundreds of axes were hewing the cables that bound the triremes to\r\nthe shore, every Greek oar was biting the sea, the ships were leaping away\r\nfrom Salamis. From the strand a shout went up, a prayer more than a cheer,\r\nmothers, wives, little ones, calling it together:—\r\n\r\n“Zeus prosper you!”\r\n\r\nA roar from the fleet, the tearing of countless blades on the thole-pins\r\nanswered them. Eurybiades had spoken. There was no treason. All now was in\r\nthe hand of the god.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAcross the strait they went, and the Barbarians seemed springing to meet\r\nthem. From the mainland a tumult of voices was rising, the myriads around\r\nXerxes encouraging their comrades by sea to play the man. No indecisive,\r\nhalf-hearted battle should this be, as at Artemisium. Persian and Hellene\r\nknew that. The keen Phœnicians, who had chafed at being kept from action\r\nso long, sent their line of ships sweeping over the waves with furious\r\nstrokes. The grudges, the commercial rivalries between Greek and Sidonian,\r\nwere old. No Persian was hotter for Xerxes’s cause than his Phœnician\r\nvassals that day.\r\n\r\nAnd as they charged, the foemen’s lines seemed so dense, their ships so\r\ntall, their power so vast, that involuntarily hesitancy came over the\r\nGreeks. Their strokes slowed. The whole line lagged. Here an Æginetan\r\ngalley dropped behind, yonder a Corinthian navarch suffered his men to\r\nback water. Even the _keleustes_ of the _Nausicaä_ slackened his beating\r\non the sounding-board. Eurybiades’s ship had drifted behind to the line of\r\nher sisters, as in defiance a towering Sidonian sprang ahead of the\r\nBarbarian line of battle, twenty trumpets from her poop and foreship\r\nasking, “Dare you meet me?” The Greek line became almost stationary. Some\r\nships were backing water. It was a moment which, suffered to slip\r\nunchecked, leads to irreparable disaster. Then like a god sprang\r\nThemistocles upon the capstan on his poop. He had torn off his helmet. The\r\ncrews of scores of triremes saw him. His voice was like Stentor’s, the\r\nherald whose call was strong as fifty common men.\r\n\r\nIn a lull amidst the howls of the Barbarians his call rang up and down the\r\nflagging ships:—\r\n\r\n    “_O Sons of Hellas! save your land,_\r\n  _Your children save, your altars and your wives!_\r\n  _Now dare and do, for ye have staked your all!_”\r\n\r\n“Now dare and do, for ye have staked your all!”\r\n\r\nNavarch shouted it to navarch. The cry went up and down the line of the\r\nHellenes, “loud as when billows lash the beetling crags.” The trailing\r\noars beat again into the water, and even as the ships once more gained\r\nway, Themistocles nodded to Ameinias, and he to the _keleustes_. The\r\nmaster oarsman leaped from his seat and crashed his gavel down upon the\r\nsounding-board.\r\n\r\n“_Aru! Aru! Aru!_ Put it on, my men!”\r\n\r\nThe _Nausicaä_ answered with a leap. Men wrought at the oar butts, tugging\r\nlike mad, their backs toward the foe, conscious only that duty bade them\r\nsend the trireme across the waves as a stone whirls from the sling. Thus\r\nthe men, but Themistocles, on the poop, standing at the captain’s and\r\ngovernor’s side, never took his gaze from the great Barbarian that leaped\r\ndefiantly to meet them.\r\n\r\n“Can we risk the trick?” his swift question to Ameinias.\r\n\r\nThe captain nodded. “With this crew—yes.”\r\n\r\nTwo stadia, one stadium, half a stadium, a ship’s length, the triremes\r\nwere charging prow to prow, rushing on a common death, when Ameinias\r\nclapped a whistle to his lips and blew shrilly. As one man every rower on\r\nthe port-side leaped to his feet and dragged his oar inward through its\r\nrow-hole. The deed was barely done ere the Sidonian was on them. They\r\nheard the roaring water round her prow, the cracking of the whips as the\r\npetty officers ran up and down the gangways urging on the panting cattle\r\nat the oars. Then almost at the shock the governor touched his steering\r\noar. The _Nausicaä_ swerved. The prow of the Sidonian rushed past them. A\r\nshower of darts pattered down on the deck of the Hellene, but a twinkling\r\nlater from the Barbarians arose a frightful cry. Right across her triple\r\noar bank, still in full speed, ploughed the Athenian. The Sidonian’s oars\r\nwere snapping like faggots. The luckless rowers were flung from their\r\nbenches in heaps. In less time than the telling every oar on the\r\nBarbarian’s port-side had been put out of play. The _diekplous_, favourite\r\ntrick of the Grecian seamen, had never been done more fairly.\r\n\r\nNow was Themistocles’s chance. He used it. There was no need for him to\r\ngive orders to the oar master. Automatically every rower on the port-tiers\r\nof the _Nausicaä_ had run out his blade again. The governor sent the head\r\nof the trireme around with a grim smile locked about his grizzled lips. It\r\nwas no woman’s task which lay before them. Exposing her whole broadside\r\nlay the long Sidonian; she was helpless, striving vainly to crawl away\r\nwith her remaining oar banks. Her people were running to and fro, howling\r\nto Baal, Astarte, Moloch, and all their other foul gods, and stretching\r\ntheir hands for help to consorts too far away.\r\n\r\n“_Aru! Aru! Aru!_” was the shout of the oar master; again the _Nausicaä_\r\nanswered with her leap. Straight across the narrow water she shot, the\r\nfirm hand of the governor never veering now. The stroke grew faster,\r\nfaster. Then with one instinct men dropped the oars, to trail in the\r\nrushing water, and seized stanchions, beams, anything to brace themselves\r\nfor the shock. The crash which followed was heard on the mainland and on\r\nSalamis. The side of the Phœnician was beaten in like an egg-shell. From\r\nthe _Nausicaä’s_ poop they saw her open hull reel over, saw the hundreds\r\nof upturned, frantic faces, heard the howls of agony, saw the waves leap\r\ninto the gaping void.—\r\n\r\n“Back water,” thundered Ameinias, “clear the vortex, she is going down!”\r\n\r\nThe _Nausicaä’s_ people staggered to the oars. So busy were they in\r\nrighting their own ship few saw the crowning horror. A moment more and a\r\nfew drifting spars, a few bobbing heads, were all that was left of the\r\nPhœnician. The Ægean had swallowed her.\r\n\r\nA shout was pealing from the ships of the Hellenes. “Zeus is with us!\r\nAthena is with us!”\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the battle, when advantage tells the most, advantage had\r\nbeen won. Themistocles’s deed had fused all the Greeks with hopeful\r\ncourage. Eurybiades was charging. Adeimantus was charging. Their ships and\r\nall the rest went racing to meet the foe.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nBut the _Nausicaä_ had paid for her victory. In the shock of ramming the\r\ntriple-toothed beak on her prow had been wrenched away. In the _mêlée_ of\r\nships which had just begun, she must play her part robbed of her keenest\r\nweapon. The sinking of the Barbarian had been met with cheers by the\r\nHellenes, by howls of revengeful rage by the host against them. Not\r\nlightly were the Asiatics who fought beneath the eyes of the king to be\r\ndaunted. They came crowding up the strait in such masses that sheer\r\nnumbers hindered them, leaving no space for the play of the oars, much\r\nless for fine manœuvre. Yet for an instant it seemed as if mere weight\r\nwould sweep the Hellenes back to Salamis. Then the lines of battle\r\ndissolved into confused fragments. Captains singled out an opponent and\r\ncharged home desperately, unmindful how it fared elsewhere in the battle.\r\nHere an Egyptian ran down a Eubœan, there a Sicyonian grappled a Cilician\r\nand flung her boarders on to the foeman’s decks. To the onlookers the\r\nscene could have meant naught save confusion. A hundred duels, a hundred\r\nvarying victories, but to which side the final glory would fall, who\r\nknew?—perchance not even Zeus.\r\n\r\nIn the roaring _mêlée_ the _Nausicaä_ had for some moments moved almost\r\naimlessly, her men gathering breath and letting their unscathed comrades\r\npass. Then gradually the battle drifted round them also. A Cyprian, noting\r\nthey had lost their ram, strove to charge them bow to bow. The skill of\r\nthe governor avoided that disaster. They ran under the stem of a Tyrian,\r\nand Glaucon proved he had not forgotten his skill when he sent his\r\njavelins among the officers upon the poop. A second Sidonian swept down on\r\nthem, but grown wise by her consort’s destruction turned aside to lock\r\nwith an Æginetan galley. How the fight at large was going, who was\r\nwinning, who losing, Glaucon saw no more than any one else. An arrow\r\ngrazed his arm. He first learned it when he found his armour bloody. A\r\nsling-stone smote the marine next to him on the forehead. The man dropped\r\nwithout a groan. Glaucon flung the body overboard, almost by instinct.\r\nThemistocles was everywhere, on the poop, on the foreship, among the\r\nrowers’ benches, shouting, laughing, cheering, ordering, standing up\r\nboldly where the arrows flew thickest, yet never hit. So for a while, till\r\nout of the confusion of ships and wrecks came darting a trireme, loftier\r\nthan her peers. The railing on poop and prow was silver. The shields of\r\nthe javelin-men that crowded her high fighting decks were gilded. Ten\r\npennons whipped from her masts, and the cry of horns, tambours, and\r\nkettledrums blended with the shoutings of her crew. A partially disabled\r\nHellene drifted across her path. She ran the luckless ship down in a\r\ntwinkling. Then her bow swung. She headed toward the _Nausicaä_.\r\n\r\n“Do you know this ship?” asked Themistocles, at Glaucon’s side on the\r\npoop.\r\n\r\n“A Tyrian, the newest in their fleet, but her captain is the admiral\r\nAriamenes, Xerxes’s brother.”\r\n\r\n“She is attacking us, Excellency,” called Ameinias, in his chief’s ear.\r\nThe din which covered the sea was beyond telling.\r\n\r\nThemistocles measured the water with his eye.\r\n\r\n“She will be alongside then in a moment,” was his answer, “and the beak is\r\ngone?”\r\n\r\n“Gone, and ten of our best rowers are dead.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles drew down the helmet, covering his face.\r\n\r\n“_Euge!_ Since the choice is to grapple or fly, we had better grapple.”\r\n\r\nThe governor shifted again the steering paddles. The head of the\r\n_Nausicaä_ fell away toward her attacker, but no signal was given to\r\nquicken the oars. The Barbarian, noting what her opponent did, but justly\r\nfearing the handiness of the Greeks, slackened also. The two ships drifted\r\nslowly together. Long before they closed in unfriendly contact the arrows\r\nof the Phœnician pelted over the _Nausicaä_ like hail. Rowers fell as they\r\nsat on the upper benches; on the poop the _prōreus_ lay with half his men.\r\nGlaucon never counted how many missiles dinted his helmet and buckler. The\r\nnext instant the two ships were drifting without steerage-way. The\r\ngrappling-irons dashed down upon the Athenian, and simultaneously the\r\nbrown Phœnician boarders were scrambling like cats upon her decks.\r\n\r\n“Swords, men!” called Themistocles, never less daunted than at the pinch,\r\n“up and feed them with iron!”\r\n\r\nThree times the Phœnicians poured as a flood over the _Nausicaä_. Three\r\ntimes they were flung back with loss, but only to rage, call on their\r\ngods, and return with tenfold fury. Glaucon had hurled one sheaf of\r\njavelins, and tore loose another, eye and arm aiming, casting\r\nmechanically. In the lulls he saw how wind and sea were sweeping the two\r\nships landward, until almost in arrow-shot of the rocky point where sat\r\nXerxes and his lords. He saw the king upon his ivory throne and all his\r\nmighty men around him. He saw the scribes standing near with parchment and\r\npapyrus, inscribing the names of this or that ship which did well or ill\r\nin behalf of the lord of the Aryans. He saw the gaudy dresses of the\r\neunuchs, the litters, and from them peering forth the veiled women. Did\r\nArtazostra think _now_ the Hellenes were mad fools to look her brother’s\r\npower in the face? From the shores of Attica and of Salamis, where the\r\nmyriads rejoiced or wept as the scattered battle changed, the cries were\r\nrising, falling, like the throb of a tragic chorus,—a chorus of Titans,\r\nwith the actors gods.\r\n\r\n“Another charge!” shouted Ameinias, through the din, “meet them briskly,\r\nlads!”\r\n\r\nOnce more the hoarse Semitic war-shout, the dark-faced Asiatics dropping\r\nupon the decks, the whir of javelins, the scream of dying men, the clash\r\nof steel on steel. A frantic charge, but stoutly met. Themistocles was in\r\nthe thickest _mêlée_. With his own spear he dashed two Tyrians overboard,\r\nas they sprang upon the poop. The band that had leaped down among the oar\r\nbenches were hewn in pieces by the seamen. The remnant of the attackers\r\nrecoiled in howls of despair. On the Phœnician’s decks the Greeks saw the\r\nofficers laying the lash mercilessly across their men, but the\r\ndisheartened creatures did not stir. Now could be seen Ariamenes, the high\r\nadmiral himself, a giant warrior in his purple and gilded armour, going up\r\nand down the poop, cursing, praying, threatening,—all in vain. The\r\n_Nausicaä’s_ people rose and cheered madly.\r\n\r\n“Enough! They have enough! Glory to Athens!”\r\n\r\nBut here Ameinias gripped Themistocles’s arm. The chief turned, and all\r\nthe Hellenes with him. The cheer died on their lips. A tall trireme was\r\nbearing down on them in full charge even while the _Nausicaä_ drifted.\r\nThey were as helpless as the Sidonian they had sent to death. One groan\r\nbroke from the Athenians.\r\n\r\n“Save, Athena! Save! It is Artemisia! The queen of Halicarnassus!”\r\n\r\nThe heavy trireme of the amazon princess was a magnificent sight as they\r\nlooked on her. Her oars flew in a flashing rhythm. The foam leaped in a\r\ncataract over her ram. The sun made fire of the tossing weapons on her\r\nprow. A yell of triumph rose from the Phœnicians. On the _Nausicaä_ men\r\ndropped sword and spear, moaned, raved, and gazed wildly on Themistocles\r\nas if he were a god possessing power to dash the death aside.\r\n\r\n“To your places, men!” rang his shout, as he faced the foe unmoved, “and\r\ndie as Athenians!”\r\n\r\nThen even while men glanced up at the sun to greet Helios for the last\r\ntime, there was a marvel. The threatening beak shot around. The trireme\r\nflew past them, her oars leaping madly, her people too intent on escape\r\neven to give a flight of javelins. And again the Athenians cheered.\r\n\r\n“The _Perseus_! Cimon has saved us.”\r\n\r\nNot three ships’ lengths behind the Halicarnassian raced the ship of the\r\nson of Miltiades. They knew now why Artemisia had veered. Well she might;\r\nhad she struck the _Nausicaä_ down, her own broadside would have swung\r\ndefenceless to the fleet pursuer. The _Perseus_ sped past her consort at\r\nfull speed, Athenian cheering Athenian as she went.\r\n\r\n“Need you help?” called Cimon, from his poop, as Themistocles waved his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n“None, press on, smite the Barbarian! Athena is with us!”\r\n\r\n“Athena is with us! Zeus is with us!”\r\n\r\nThe _Nausicaä’s_ crew were lifted from panic to mad enthusiasm. Still\r\nabove them towered the tall Phœnician, but they could have scaled Mt.\r\nCaucasus at that instant.\r\n\r\n“Onward! Up and after them,” rang Ameinias’s blast, “she is our own, we\r\nwill take her under the king’s own eye.”\r\n\r\nThe javelins and arrows were pelting from the Barbarian. The Athenians\r\nmocked the shower as they leaped the void from bulwark to bulwark. Vainly\r\nthe Phœnicians strove to clear the grapples. Too firm! Their foes came on\r\nto their decks with long leaps, or here and there ran deftly on projecting\r\nspars, for what athlete of Hellas could not run the tight rope? In an\r\ninstant the long rowers’ deck of the Tyrian was won, and the attackers\r\ncheered and blessed Athena. But this was only storming the first outpost.\r\nLike castles forward and aft reared the prow and poop, whither the sullen\r\ndefenders retreated. Turning at bay, the Phœnicians swarmed back into the\r\nwaist, waiting no scourging from their officers. Now their proud admiral\r\nhimself plunged into the _mêlée_, laying about with a mighty sword worthy\r\nof Ajax at Troy, showing he was a prince of the Aryans indeed. It took all\r\nthe steadiness of Ameinias and his stoutest men to stop the rush, and save\r\nthe Athenians in turn from being driven overboard. The rush was halted\r\nfinally, though this was mere respite before a fiercer breaking of the\r\nstorm. The two ships were drifting yet closer to the strand. Only the fear\r\nof striking their own men kept the Persians around the king from clouding\r\nthe air with arrows. Glaucon saw the grandees near Xerxes’s throne\r\nbrandishing their swords. In imagination he saw the monarch leaping from\r\nhis throne in agony as at Thermopylæ.\r\n\r\n“Back to the charge,” pealed Ariamenes’s summons to the Tyrians; “will you\r\nbe cowards and dogs beneath the very eyes of the king?”\r\n\r\nThe defenders answered with a second rush. Others again hurled darts from\r\nthe stern and foreship. Then out of the mælstrom of men and weapons came a\r\ntruce. Athenian and Tyrian drew back, whilst Themistocles and Ariamenes\r\nwere fighting blade to blade. Twice the giant Persian almost dashed the\r\nHellene down. Twice Themistocles recovered poise, and paid back stroke for\r\nstroke. He had smitten the helmet from Ariamenes’s head and was swinging\r\nfor a master-blow when his foot slipped on the bloody plank. He staggered.\r\nBefore he could recover, the Persian had brought his own weapon up, and\r\nflung his might into the downward stroke.\r\n\r\n“The admiral—lost!” Athenians shuddered together, but with the groan shot\r\na javelin. Clear through the scales of the cuirass it tore, and into the\r\nPersian’s shoulder,—Glaucon’s cast, never at the Isthmus truer with hand\r\nor eye. The ponderous blade turned, grazed the Athenian’s corselet,\r\nclattered on the deck. The Persian sprang back disarmed and powerless. At\r\nsight thereof the Phœnicians flung down their swords. True Orientals, in\r\nthe fate of their chief they saw decreeing Destiny,—what use to resist it?\r\n\r\n“Yield, my Lord, yield,” called Glaucon, in Persian, “the battle is\r\nagainst you, and no fault of yours. Save the lives of your men.”\r\n\r\nAriamenes gave a toss of his princely head, and with his left hand plucked\r\nthe javelin from his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“A prince of the Aryans knows how to die, but not how to yield,” he cast\r\nback, and before the Athenians guessed his intent he sprang upon the\r\nbulwark. There in the sight of his king he stood and bowed his head and\r\nwith his left arm made the sign of adoration.\r\n\r\n“Seize him!” shouted Ameinias, divining his intent, but too late. The\r\nPersian leaped into the water. In his heavy mail he sank like lead. The\r\nwave closed over him, as he passed forever from the sight of man.\r\n\r\nThere was stillness on the Tyrian for a moment. A groan of helpless horror\r\nwas rising from the Barbarians on the shore. Then the Phœnicians fell upon\r\ntheir knees, crying in their harsh tongue, “Quarter! Quarter!” and\r\nembracing and kissing the feet of the victors. Thanks to the moment of\r\nquietness given them, the Athenians’ blood had cooled a little; they\r\ngathered up the weapons cast upon the deck; there was no massacre.\r\n\r\nThemistocles mounted the poop of the captured flag-ship, and Glaucon with\r\nhim. The wind was wafting them again into the centre of the channel. For\r\nthe first time for many moments they were able to look about them, to ask,\r\n“How goes the battle?” Not the petty duel they had fought, but the great\r\nbattle of battles which was the life-struggle of Hellas. And behold, as\r\nthey gazed they pressed their hands upon their eyes and looked and looked\r\nagain, for the thing they saw seemed overgood for truth. Where the great\r\nBarbarian line had been pushing up the strait, were only bands of\r\nscattered ships, and most of these turning their beaks from Salamis. The\r\nwaves were strewn with wrecks, and nigh every one a Persian. And right,\r\nleft, and centre the triumphant Hellenes were pressing home, ramming,\r\ngrappling, capturing. Even whilst the fight raged, pinnaces were thrusting\r\nout from Salamis—Aristeides’s deed, they later heard—crowded with martial\r\ngraybeards who could not look idly on while their sons fought on the\r\nships, and who speedily landed on Psyttaleia to massacre the luckless\r\nPersians there stationed. The cheers of the Barbarians were ended now;\r\nfrom the shores came only a beastlike howling which drowned the pæans of\r\nthe victors. As the _Nausicaä’s_ people looked, they could see the once\r\nhaughty Phœnicians and Cilicians thrusting back against the land, and the\r\nthousands of footmen running down upon the shore to drag the shattered\r\ntriremes up and away from the triumphant Hellenes.\r\n\r\nThe _Nausicaä’s_ people in wondering gaze stood there for a long time as\r\nif transfixed, forgetful how their ship and its prize drifted, forgetful\r\nof weariness, forgetful of wounds. Then as one man they turned to the poop\r\nof the captured Tyrian, and to Themistocles. _He_ had done it—their\r\nadmiral. He had saved Hellas under the eyes of the vaunting demigod who\r\nthought to be her destroyer. They called to Themistocles, they worshipped\r\nas if he were the Olympian himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THEMISTOCLES GIVES A PROMISE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the _Nausicaä_ had returned that night to Salamis, after the old men\r\nand the women had laughed and wept over the living,—they were too proud to\r\nweep over the dead,—after the prudent admirals had set the fleet again in\r\norder, for Xerxes might tempt fate again in the morning with his remaining\r\nships, Themistocles found himself once more in his cabin. With him was\r\nonly Glaucon the Alcmæonid. The admiral’s words were few and pointed.\r\n\r\n“Son of Conon, last night you gave me the thought whereby I could save\r\nHellas. To-day your javelin saved me from death. I owe you much. I will\r\nrepay in true coin. To-morrow I can give you back to your wife and all\r\nyour friends if you will but suffer me.”\r\n\r\nThe younger man flushed a little, but his eyes did not brighten. He felt\r\nThemistocles’s reservation.\r\n\r\n“On what terms?”\r\n\r\n“You shall be presented to the Athenians as one who, yielding for a moment\r\nto overmastering temptation, has atoned for one error by rendering\r\ninfinite service.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am to be ‘Glaucon the Traitor’ still, even if ‘Glaucon the\r\nRepentant Traitor’?”\r\n\r\n“Your words are hard, son of Conon; what may I say? Have you any new\r\nexplanation for the letter to Argos?”\r\n\r\n“The old one—I did not write it.”\r\n\r\n“Let us not bandy useless arguments. Do you not see I shall be doing all\r\nthat is possible?”\r\n\r\n“Let me think a little.”\r\n\r\nThe younger Athenian held down his head, and Themistocles saw his brows\r\nknitting.\r\n\r\n“Son of Neocles,” said Glaucon, at length, “I thank you. You are a just\r\nman. Whatever of sorrow has or will be mine, you have no part therein, but\r\nI cannot return—not to Hermione and my child—on any terms you name.”\r\n\r\n“Your purpose, then?”\r\n\r\n“To-day the gods show mercy to Hellas, later they may show justice to me.\r\nThe war is far from ended. Can you not let me serve on some ship of the\r\nallies where none can recognize me? Thus let me wait a year, and trust\r\nthat in that year the sphinx will find her riddle answered.”\r\n\r\n“To wait thus long is hard,” spoke the other, kindly.\r\n\r\n“I have done many hard things, Themistocles.”\r\n\r\n“And your wife?”\r\n\r\n“Hera pity her! She bade me return when Athens knew me innocent. Better\r\nthat she wait a little longer, though in sorrow, when I can return to her\r\neven as she bade me. Nevertheless, promise one thing.”\r\n\r\n“Name it.”\r\n\r\n“That if her parents are about to give her to Democrates or any other, you\r\nwill prevent.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles’s face lightened. He laid a friendly hand on the young man’s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“I do not know how to answer your cry of innocency, _philotate_, but this\r\nI know, in all Hellas I think none is fairer in body or soul than you.\r\nHave no fear for Hermione, and in the year to come may Revealer Apollo\r\nmake all of your dark things bright.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon bowed his head. Themistocles had given everything the outlaw could\r\nask, and the latter went out of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE PASSING OF THE PERSIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DEMOCRATES SURRENDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHellas was saved. But whether forever or only for a year the gods kept\r\nhid. Panic-stricken, the “Lord of the World” had fled to Asia after the\r\ngreat disaster. The eunuchs, the harem women, the soft-handed pages, had\r\nescaped with their master to luxurious Sardis, the remnant of the fleet\r\nfled back across the Ægean. But the brain and right arm of the Persians,\r\nMardonius the Valiant, remained in Hellas. With him were still the Median\r\ninfantry, the Tartar horse-archers, the matchless Persian lancers,—the\r\nbackbone of the undefeated army. Hellas was not yet safe.\r\n\r\nDemocrates had prospered. He had been reëlected strategus. If Themistocles\r\nno longer trusted him quite so freely as once, Aristeides, restored now to\r\nmuch of his former power, gave him full confidence. Democrates found\r\nconstant and honourable employment through the winter in the endless\r\nnegotiations at Sparta, at Corinth, and elsewhere, while the jealous Greek\r\nstates wrangled and intrigued, more to humiliate some rival than to\r\nadvance the safety of Hellas. But amongst all the patriot chiefs none\r\nseemed more devoted to the common weal of Hellas than the Athenian orator.\r\n\r\nHermippus at least was convinced of this. The Eleusinian had settled at\r\nTrœzene on the Argive coast, a hospitable city that received many an\r\noutcast Athenian. He found his daughter’s resistance to another marriage\r\nincreasingly unreasonable. Was not Glaucon dead for more than a year?\r\nOught not any woman to bless Hera who gave her so noble, so eloquent, a\r\nhusband as Democrates—pious, rich, trusted by the greatest, and with the\r\nbest of worldly prospects?\r\n\r\n“If you truly desire any other worthy man, _makaira_,” said Hermippus,\r\nonce, “you shall not find me obstinate. Can a loving father say more? But\r\nif you are simply resolved never to marry, I will give you to him despite\r\nyour will. A senseless whim must not blast your highest happiness.”\r\n\r\n“He ruined Glaucon,” said Hermione, tearfully.\r\n\r\n“At least,” returned Lysistra, who like many good women could say\r\nexceeding cruel things, “_he_ has never been a traitor to his country.”\r\n\r\nHermione’s answer was to fly to her chamber, and to weep—as many a time\r\nbefore—over Phœnix in the cradle. Here old Cleopis found her, took her in\r\nher arms, and sang her the old song about Alphæus chasing Arethusa—a song\r\nmore fit for Phœnix than his mother, but most comforting. So the contest\r\nfor the moment passed, but after a conference with Hermippus, Democrates\r\nwent away on public business to Corinth unusually well pleased with the\r\nworld and himself.\r\n\r\nIt was a tedious, jangling conference held at the Isthmus city. Mardonius\r\nhad tempted the Athenians sorely. In the spring had come his envoys\r\nproffering reparation for all injuries in the wars, enlarged territory,\r\nand not slavery, but free alliance with the Great King, if they would but\r\njoin against their fellow-Hellenes. The Athenians had met the tempter as\r\nbecame Athenians. Aristeides had given the envoys the answer of the whole\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“We know your power. Yet tell it to Mardonius, that so long as Helios\r\nmoves in the heavens we will not make alliance with Xerxes, but rather\r\ntrust to the gods whose temples he has burned.”\r\n\r\nBravely said, but when the Athenians looked to Sparta for the great army\r\nto hasten north and give Mardonius his death-stroke, it was the old\r\nwearisome tale of excuses and delay. At the conference in Corinth\r\nAristeides and Democrates had passed from arguments to all but threats,\r\neven such as Themistocles had used at Salamis. It was after one of these\r\nfruitless debates that Democrates passed out of the gathering at the\r\nCorinthian prytaneum, with his colleagues all breathing forth their wrath\r\nagainst Dorian stupidity and evasiveness.\r\n\r\nDemocrates himself crossed the city Agora, seeking the house of the\r\nfriendly merchant where he was to sup. He walked briskly, his thoughts\r\nmore perhaps on the waiting betrothal feast at Trœzene, than on the\r\ndiscussion behind him. The Agora scene had little to interest, the same\r\nbuyers, booths, and babel as in Athens, only the citadel above was the\r\nmount of Acro-Corinthus, not the tawny rock of Athena. And in late months\r\nhe had begun to find his old fears and terrors flee away. Every day he was\r\ngrowing more certain that his former “missteps”—that was his own name for\r\ncertain occurrences—could have no malign influence. “After all,” he was\r\nreflecting, “Nemesis is a very capricious goddess. Often she forgets for a\r\nlifetime, and after death—who knows what is beyond the Styx?”\r\n\r\nHe was on such noble terms with all about him that he could even give ear\r\nto the whine of a beggar. The man was sitting on the steps between the\r\npillars of a colonnade, with a tame crow perched upon his fist, and as\r\nDemocrates passed he began his doggerel prayer:—\r\n\r\n  “Good master, a handful of barley bestow\r\n  On the child of Apollo, the sage, sable crow.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian began to fumble in his belt for an obol, when he was rudely\r\ndistracted by a twitch upon his chiton. Turning, he was little pleased to\r\ncome face to face with no less a giant than Lycon.\r\n\r\n“There was an hour, _philotate_,” spoke the Spartan, with ill-concealed\r\nsneer, “when you did not have so much silver to scatter out to beggars.”\r\n\r\nTime had not mended Lycon’s aspect, nor taken from his eye that sinister\r\ntwinkle which was so marked a foil to his brutishness.\r\n\r\n“I did not invite you, dear fellow,” rejoined the Athenian, “to remind me\r\nof the fact.”\r\n\r\n“Yet you should have gratitude, and you have lacked that virtue of late.\r\nIt was a sorry plight Mardonius’s money saved you from two years since,\r\nand nobly have you remembered his good service.”\r\n\r\n“Worthy Lacedæmonian,” said Democrates, with what patience he could\r\ncommand, “if you desire to go over all that little business which\r\nconcerned us then, at least I would suggest not in the open Agora.” He\r\nstarted to walk swiftly away. The Spartan’s ponderous strides easily kept\r\nbeside him. Democrates looked vainly for an associate whom he could\r\napproach and on some pretext could accompany. None in sight. Lycon kept\r\nfast hold of his cloak. For practical purposes Democrates was prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Why in Corinth?” he threw out sullenly.\r\n\r\n“For three reasons, _philotate_,” Lycon grinned over his shoulder, “first,\r\nthe women at the Grove of Aphrodite here are handsome; second, I am weary\r\nof Sparta and its black broth and iron money; third, and here is the rose\r\nfor my garland, I had need to confer with your noble self.”\r\n\r\n“Would not Hiram be your dutiful messenger again?” queried the other,\r\nvainly watching for escape.\r\n\r\n“Hiram is worth twenty talents as a helper;”—Lycon gave a hound-like\r\nchuckle,—“still he is not Apollo, and there are too many strings on this\r\nlyre for him to play them all. Besides, he failed at Salamis.”\r\n\r\n“He did! Zeus blast his importunity and yours likewise. Where are you\r\ntaking me? I warn you in advance, you are ‘shearing an ass,’—attempting\r\nthe impossible,—if you deceive yourself as to my power. I can do nothing\r\nmore to prevent the war from being pressed against Mardonius. It is only\r\nyour Laconian ephors that are hindering.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see, _philotate_, we shall see,” grunted the Spartan,\r\nexasperatingly cool. “Here is Poseidon’s Temple. Let us sit in the shaded\r\nportico.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates resigned himself to be led to a stone seat against the wall.\r\nThe gray old “dog-watcher” by the gate glanced up to see that no dogs were\r\nstraying into the holy house, noted only two gentlemen come for a chat,\r\nand resumed his siesta. Lycon took a long time in opening his business.\r\n\r\n“The world has used you well of late, dear fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Passing well, by Athena’s favour.”\r\n\r\n“You should say by Hermes’s favour, but I would trust you Athenians to\r\ngrow fat on successful villany and then bless the righteous gods.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you haven’t left Sparta just to revile me!” cried Democrates,\r\nleaping up, to be thrust back by Lycon’s giant paw.\r\n\r\n“_Ai!_ mix a little honey with your speech, it costs nothing. Well, the\r\nlength and breadth of my errand is this, Mardonius must fight soon, and\r\nmust be victorious.”\r\n\r\n“That is for your brave ephors to say,” darted Democrates. “According to\r\ntheir valiant proposals they desire this war to imitate that with Troy,—to\r\nlast ten years.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed—but I always held my people surpassed in procrastination, as yours\r\nin deceiving. However, their minds will change.”\r\n\r\n“Aristeides and Themistocles will bless you for that.”\r\n\r\nLycon shrugged his great shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll surpass the gods, who can seldom please all men. Still it is\r\nquite true.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Democrates, you know what’s befallen in Sparta. Since Leonidas died,\r\nhis rivals from my own side of the royal house have gathered a great deal\r\nmore of power. My uncle Nicander is at present head of the board of\r\nephors, and gladly takes my advice.”\r\n\r\n“Ha!” Democrates began to divine the drift.\r\n\r\n“It seemed best to me after the affair at Salamis to give the lie to my\r\ncalumniators, who hinted that I desired to ‘Medize,’ and that it was by my\r\nintriguing that the late king took so small a force to Thermopylæ.”\r\n\r\n“All Hellas knows _your_ patriotism!” cried Democrates, satirically.\r\n\r\n“Even so. I have silenced my fiercest abusers. If I have not yet urged in\r\nour assembly that we should fight Mardonius, it is merely because—it is\r\nnot yet prudent.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent scoundrel,” declared the other, writhing on his seat, “you are\r\nno Spartan, but long-winded as a Sicilian.”\r\n\r\n“Patience, _philotate_, a Spartan must either speak in apothegms or take\r\nall day. I have not advised a battle yet because I was not certain of your\r\naid.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, by Zeus,” broke out Democrates, “that ointment I sniffed a long way\r\noff. I can give you quick answer. Fly back to Sparta, swift as Boreas;\r\nplot, conspire, earn Tartarus, to your heart’s content—you’ll get no more\r\nhelp from me.”\r\n\r\n“I expected that speech.” Lycon’s coolness drove his victim almost\r\nfrantic.\r\n\r\n“In the affair of Tempē I bent to you for the last time,” Democrates\r\ncharged desperately. “I have counted the cost. Perhaps you can use against\r\nme certain documents, but I am on a surer footing than once. In the last\r\nyear I have done such service to Hellas I can even hope to be forgiven,\r\nshould these old mistakes be proved. And if you drive me to bay, be sure\r\nof this, I will see to it that all the dealings betwixt the Barbarian and\r\nyour noble self are expounded to your admiring countrymen.”\r\n\r\n“You show truly excellent courage, dear Democrates,” cried Lycon, in\r\npseudo-admiration. “That speech was quite worthy of a tragic actor.”\r\n\r\n“If we’re in the theatre, let the chorus sing its last strophe and have\r\ndone. You disgust me.”\r\n\r\n“Peace, peace,” ordered Lycon, his hand still on the Athenian’s shoulder,\r\n“I will make all the haste I can, but obstinacy is disagreeable. I repeat,\r\nyou are needed, sorely needed, by Mardonius to enable him to complete the\r\nconquest of Hellas. You shall not call the Persians ungrateful—the tyranny\r\nof Athens under the easy suzerainty of the king, is that no dish to whet\r\nyour appetite?”\r\n\r\n“I knew of the offer before.”\r\n\r\n“A great pity you are not more eager. Hermes seldom sends such chances\r\ntwice. I hoped to have you for ‘my royal brother’ when they gave me the\r\nlike lordship of Lacedæmon. However, the matter does not end with your\r\nrefusal.”\r\n\r\n“I have said, ‘Do your worst.’ ”\r\n\r\n“And my worst is—Agis.”\r\n\r\nFor an instant Lycon was dismayed. He thought he had slain his victim with\r\none word. Democrates dropped from his clutch and upon the pavement as\r\nthough stricken through the heart by an arrow. He was pallid as a corpse,\r\nat first he only groaned.\r\n\r\n“_Eu! eu!_ good comrade,” cried the Spartan, dragging him up, half\r\ntriumphant, half sympathetic, “I did not know I was throwing Zeus’s\r\nthunderbolts.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian sat with his head on his hands. In all his dealings with the\r\nSpartan he had believed he had covered the details of the fate of Glaucon.\r\nLycon could surmise what he liked, but the proof to make the damning\r\ncharges good Democrates believed he had safe in his own keeping. Only one\r\nman could have unlocked the casket of infamy—Agis—and the mention of his\r\nname was as a bolt from the blue.\r\n\r\n“Where is he? I heard he was killed at Artemisium.” Lycon hardly\r\nunderstood his victim’s thick whispers.\r\n\r\n“Wounded indeed, _philotate_, taken prisoner, and sent to Thebes. There\r\nfriends of mine found he had a story to tell—greatly to my advantage. It\r\nis only a little time since he came to Sparta.”\r\n\r\n“What lies has he told?”\r\n\r\n“Several, dear fellow, although if they are lies, then Aletheia, Lady\r\nTruth, must almost own them for her children. At least they are\r\ninteresting lies; as, for example, how you advised the Cyprian to escape\r\nfrom Athens, how you gave Agis a letter to hide in the boots of Glaucon’s\r\nmessenger, of your interviews with Lampaxo and Archias, of the charming\r\nart you possess of imitating handwritings and seals.”\r\n\r\n“Base-born swine! who will believe him?”\r\n\r\n“Base born, Democrates, but hardly swinish. He can tell a very clear\r\nstory. Likewise, Lampaxo and Archias must testify at the trial, also your\r\nslave Bias can tell many interesting things.”\r\n\r\n“Only if I consent to produce him.”\r\n\r\n“When did a master ever refuse to let his slave testify, if demanded,\r\nunless he wished to blast his own cause with the jury? No, _makaire_, you\r\nwill not enjoy the day when Themistocles arrays the testimony against\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates shivered. The late spring sun was warm. He felt no heat. A mere\r\ncharge of treason he was almost prepared now to endure. If Mistress\r\nFortune helped him, he might refute it, but to be branded before Hellas as\r\nthe destroyer of his bosom friend, and that by guile the like whereof\r\nTantalus, Sisyphus, and Ixion conjoined had never wrought—what wonder his\r\nknees smote together? Why had he not foreseen that Agis would fall into\r\nLycon’s hands? Why had he trusted that lying tale from Artemisium? And\r\nworst of all, worse than the howls of the people who would tear his body\r\nasunder like dogs, not waiting the work of the hemlock, was the thought of\r\nHermione. She hated him now. How she would love him, though he sat on\r\nXerxes’s throne, if once her suspicion rose to certainty! He saw himself\r\nruined in life and in love, and blazoned as infamous forever.\r\n\r\nLycon was wise enough to sit some moments, letting his utterance do its\r\nwork. He was confident, and rightly. Democrates looked on him at last. The\r\nworkings of the Athenian’s face were terrible.\r\n\r\n“I am your slave, Spartan. Had you bought me for ten minæ and held the\r\nbill of sale, I were not yours more utterly. Your wish?”\r\n\r\nLycon chose his words and answered slowly.\r\n\r\n“You must serve Persia. Not for a moment, but for all time. You must place\r\nthat dreadful gift of yours at our disposal. And in return take what is\r\npromised,—the lordship of Athens.”\r\n\r\n“No word of that,” groaned the wretched man, “what will you do?”\r\n\r\n“Aristeides is soon going to Sparta to press home his demands that the\r\nLacedæmonians march in full force against Mardonius. I can see to it that\r\nhis mission succeeds. A great battle will be fought in Bœotia. _We_ can\r\nsee to it that Mardonius is so victorious that all further resistance\r\nbecomes a dream.”\r\n\r\n“And my part in this monster’s work?”\r\n\r\nThe demands and propositions with which Lycon answered this despairing\r\nquestion will unfold themselves in due place and time. Suffice it here,\r\nthat when he let the Athenian go his way Lycon was convinced that\r\nDemocrates had bound himself heart and soul to forward his enterprise. The\r\norator was no merry guest for his Corinthian hosts that night. He returned\r\nto his old manner of drinking unmixed wine. “Thirsty as a Macedonian!”\r\ncried his companions, in vain endeavour to drive him into a laugh. They\r\ndid not know that once more the chorus of the Furies was singing about his\r\nears, and he could not still it by the deepest wine-cup. They did not know\r\nthat every time he closed his eyes he was seeing the face of Glaucon. That\r\nmorning he had mocked at Nemesis. That night he heard the beating of her\r\nbrazen wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE STRANGER IN TRŒZENE\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite exile, life had moved pleasantly for Hermippus’s household that\r\nspring. The Trœzenians had surpassed all duties to Zeus Xenios—the\r\nstranger’s god—in entertaining the outcast Athenians. The fugitives had\r\nreceived two obols per day to keep them in figs and porridge. Their\r\nchildren had been suffered to roam and plunder the orchards. But Hermippus\r\nhad not needed such generosity. He had placed several talents at interest\r\nin Corinth; likewise bonds of “guest-friendship” with prominent Trœzenians\r\nmade his residence very agreeable. He had hired a comfortable house, and\r\ncould enjoy even luxury with his wife, daughter, young sons, and score of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nLittle Phœnix grew marvellously day by day, as if obeying his mother’s\r\ncommand to wax strong and avenge his father. Old Cleopis vowed he was the\r\nhealthiest, least tearful babe, as well as the handsomest, she had ever\r\nknown,—and she spoke from wide experience. When he was one year old, he\r\nwas so active they had to tie him in the cradle. When the golden spring\r\ndays came, he would ride forth upon his nurse’s back, surveying the Hellas\r\nhe was born to inherit, and seeming to find it exceeding good.\r\n\r\nBut as spring verged on summer, Hermione demanded so much of Cleopis’s\r\ncare that even Phœnix ceased to be the focus of attention. The lordly\r\nAlcmæonid fell into the custody of one Niobe, a dark-haired lass of the\r\nislands, who treated him well, but cared too much for certain young\r\n“serving-gentlemen” to waste on her charge any unreciprocated adoration.\r\nSo on one day, just as the dying grass told the full reign of the Sun\r\nKing, she went forth with her precious bundle wriggling in her arms, but\r\nher thoughts hardly on Master Phœnix. Procles the steward had been cold of\r\nlate, he had even cast sly glances at Jocasta, Lysistra’s tiring-woman.\r\nMistress Niobe was ready—since fair means of recalling the fickle Apollo\r\nfailed—to resort to foul. Instead, therefore, of going to the promenade\r\nover the sea, she went—burden and all—to the Agora, where she was sure old\r\nDion, who kept a soothsayer’s shop, would give due assistance in return\r\nfor half a drachma.\r\n\r\nThe market was just thinning. Niobe picked her way amongst the vegetable\r\nwomen, fought off a boy who thrust on her a pair of geese, and found in a\r\nquiet corner by a temple porch the booth of Dion, who grinned with his\r\ntoothless gums in way of greeting. He listened with paternal interest to\r\nher story, soothed her when she sniffled at Procles’s name, and made her\r\nshow her silver, then began pulling over his bags and vials of strange\r\npowders and liquids.\r\n\r\n“Ah, kind Master Dion,” began Niobe, for the sixth time, “if only some\r\nphiltre could make Procles loath that abominable Jocasta!”\r\n\r\n“_Eu! eu!_” muttered the old sinner, “it’s hard to say what’s best,—powder\r\nof toad’s bone or the mixture of wormwood and adder’s fat. The safest\r\nthing is to consult the god—”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why, my holy cock here, hatched at Delphi with Apollo’s blessings on\r\nhim.” Dion pointed with his thumb to the small coop at his feet. “The\r\noracle is simple. You cast before him two piles of corn; if he picks at\r\nthe one to right we take toad’s bone, to left the adder’s fat. Heaven will\r\nspeak to us.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” cried Niobe, brightening.\r\n\r\n“But, of course, we must use only consecrated corn, that’s two obols\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nNiobe’s face fell. “I’ve only this half-drachma.”\r\n\r\n“Then, _philotata_,” said Dion, kindly but firmly, “we had better wait a\r\nlittle longer.”\r\n\r\nNiobe wept. “_Ai!_ woe. ‘A little longer’ and Jocasta has Procles. I can’t\r\nask Hermione again for money. _Ai! ai!_”\r\n\r\nTwo round tears did not move Dion in the slightest. Niobe was sobbing, at\r\nher small wits’ end, when a voice sounded behind her.\r\n\r\n“What’s there wrong, lass? By Zeus, but you carry a handsome child!”\r\n\r\nNiobe glanced, and instantly stopped weeping. A young man dressed roughly\r\nas a sailor, and with long black hair and beard, had approached her, but\r\ndespite dress and beard she was quite aware he was far handsomer than even\r\nProcles.\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon, _kyrie_,”—she said “_kyrie_” by instinct,—“I’m only an\r\nhonest maid. Dion is terribly extortionate.” She cast down her eyes,\r\nexpecting instant succour from the susceptible seaman, but to her disgust\r\nshe saw he was admiring only the babe, not herself.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Gods and goddesses, what a beautiful child! A girl?”\r\n\r\n“A boy,” answered Niobe, almost sullenly.\r\n\r\n“Blessed the house in Trœzene then that can boast of such a son.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s not Trœzenian, but one of the exiles from Athens,” volunteered\r\nDion, who kept all the tittle-tattle of the little city in stock along\r\nwith his philtres.\r\n\r\n“An Athenian! Praised be Athena Polias, then. I am from Athens myself. And\r\nhis father?”\r\n\r\n“The brat will never boast of his father,” quoth Dion, rolling his eyes.\r\n“He left the world in a way, I wager five minæ, the mother hopes she can\r\nhide from her darling, but the babe’s of right good stock, an Alcmæonid,\r\nand the grandfather is that Hermippus—”\r\n\r\n“Hermippus?” The stranger seemed to catch the word out of Dion’s mouth. A\r\ndonkey had broken loose at the upper end of the Agora; he turned and\r\nstared at it and its pursuers intently.\r\n\r\n“If you’re Athenian,” went on the soothsayer, “the story’s an old one—of\r\nGlaucon the Traitor.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger turned back again. For a moment Dion saw he was blinking, but\r\nno doubt it was dust. Then he suddenly began to fumble in his girdle.\r\n\r\n“What do you want, girl?” he demanded of Niobe, nigh fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Two obols.”\r\n\r\n“Take two drachmæ. I was once a friend to that Glaucon, and traitor though\r\nhe has been blazed, his child is yet dear to me. Let me take him.”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting her answer he thrust the coin into her hands, and caught\r\nthe child out of them. Phœnix looked up into the strange, bearded face,\r\nand deliberated an instant whether to crow or to weep. Then some friendly\r\ngod decided him. He laughed as sweetly, as musically, as ever one can at\r\nhis most august age. With both chubby hands he plucked at the black beard\r\nand held tight. The strange sailor answered laugh with laugh, and released\r\nhimself right gayly. Then whilst Niobe and Dion watched and wondered they\r\nsaw the sailor kiss the child full fifty times, all the time whispering\r\nsoft words in his ear, at which Phœnix crowed and laughed yet more.\r\n\r\n“An old family servant,” threw out Dion, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Sheep!” retorted the nurse, “do you call yourself wise? Do you think a\r\nman with that face and those long hands ever felt the stocks or the whip?\r\nHe’s gentleman born, by Demeter!”\r\n\r\n“War makes many changes,” rejoined Dion. “_Ai!_ is he beside himself or a\r\nkidnapper? He is walking off with the babe.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger indeed had seemed to forget them all and was going with swift\r\nstrides up the Agora, but just before Niobe could begin her outcry he\r\nwheeled, and brought his merry burden back to the nurse’s arms.\r\n\r\n“You ought to be exceeding proud, my girl,” he remarked almost severely,\r\n“to have such a precious babe in charge. I trust you are dutiful.”\r\n\r\n“So I strive, _kyrie_, but he grows very strong. One cannot keep the\r\nswaddling clothes on him now. They say he will be a mighty athlete like\r\nhis father.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes—his father—” The sailor looked down.\r\n\r\n“You knew Master Glaucon well?” pressed Dion, itching for a new bit of\r\ngossip.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered the sailor, standing gazing on the child as though\r\nsomething held him fascinated, then shot another question. “And does the\r\nbabe’s lady-mother prosper?”\r\n\r\n“She is passing well in body, _kyrie_, but grievously ill in mind. Hera\r\ngive her a release from all her sorrow!”\r\n\r\n“Sorrow?” The man’s eyes were opening wider, wider. “What mean you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, all Trœzene knows it, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not from Trœzene. My ship made port from Naxos this morning. Speak,\r\ngirl!”\r\n\r\nHe seized Niobe’s wrist in a grip which she thought would crush the bone.\r\n\r\n“_Ai!_ Let go, sir, you hurt. Don’t stare so. I’m frightened. I’ll tell as\r\nfast as I can. Master Democrates has come back from Corinth. Hermippus is\r\nresolved to make the _kyria_ wed him, however bitterly she resists. It’s\r\ntaken a long time for her father to determine to break her will, but now\r\nhis mind’s made up. The betrothal is in three days, the wedding ten days\r\nthereafter.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor had dropped her hand. She shrank at the pallor of his face. He\r\nseemed struggling for words; when they came she made nothing of them.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles, Themistocles—your promise!”\r\n\r\nThen by some giant exercise of will he steadied. His speech grew more\r\ncoherent.\r\n\r\n“Give me the child,” he commanded, and Niobe mutely obeyed. He kissed\r\nPhœnix on both cheeks, mouth, forehead. They saw that tears were running\r\ndown his bronzed face. He handed back the babe and again held out money,—a\r\ncoin for both the slave girl and the soothsayer,—gold half-darics, that\r\nthey gaped at wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“Say nothing!” ordered the sailor, “nothing of what I have said or done,\r\nor as Helios shines this noon, I will kill you both.”\r\n\r\nNot waiting reply, he went down the Agora at a run, and never looked back.\r\nIt took some moments for Dion and Niobe to recover their equanimity; they\r\nwould have believed it all a dream, but lo! in their hands gleamed the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n“There are times,” remarked the soothsayer, dubiously at last, “when I\r\nbegin to think the gods again walk the earth and work wonders. This is a\r\nvery high matter. Even I with my art dare not meddle with it. It is best\r\nto heed the injunction to silence. Wagging tongues always have troubles as\r\ntheir children. Now let us proceed with my sacred cock and his\r\ndivination.”\r\n\r\nNiobe got her philtre,—though whether it reconquered Procles is not\r\ncontained in this history. Likewise, she heeded Dion’s injunction. There\r\nwas something uncanny about the strange sailor; she hid away the\r\nhalf-daric, and related nothing of her adventure even to her confidant\r\nCleopis.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThree days later Democrates was not drinking wine at his betrothal feast,\r\nbut sending this cipher letter by a swift and trusty “distance-runner” to\r\nSparta.\r\n\r\n“Democrates to Lycon, greeting:—At Corinth I cursed you. Rejoice\r\ntherefore; you are my only hope. I am with you whether your path leads to\r\nOlympus or to Hades. Tartarus is opened at my feet. You must save me. My\r\nwords are confused, do you think? Then hear this, and ask if I have not\r\ncause for turning mad.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday, even as Hermippus hung garlands on his house, and summoned the\r\nguests to witness the betrothal contract, Themistocles returned suddenly\r\nfrom Eubœa. He called Hermippus and myself aside. ‘_Glaucon lives_,’ he\r\nsaid, ‘and with the god’s help we’ll prove his innocence.’ Hermippus at\r\nonce broke off the betrothal. No one else knows aught thereof, not even\r\nHermione. Themistocles refuses all further details. ‘Glaucon lives,’—I can\r\nthink of nothing else. Where is he? What does he? How soon will the awful\r\ntruth go flying through Hellas? I trembled when I heard he was dead. But\r\nname my terrors now I know he is alive! Send Hiram. He, if any snake\r\nliving, can find me my enemy before it is too late. And speed the victory\r\nof Mardonius! _Chaire._”\r\n\r\n“Glaucon lives.” Democrates had only written one least part of his\r\nterrors. Two words—but enough to make the orator the most miserable man in\r\nHellas, the most supple of Xerxes’s hundred million slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WHAT BEFELL ON THE HILLSIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more the Persians pressed into Attica, once more the Athenians,—or\r\nsuch few of them as had ventured home in the winter,—fled with their\r\nmovables to Salamis or Peloponnesus, and an embassy, headed by Aristeides,\r\nhastened to Sparta to demand for the last time that the tardy ephors make\r\ngood their promise in sending forth their infantry to hurl back the\r\ninvader. If not, Aristeides spoke plainly, his people must perforce close\r\nalliance with Mardonius.\r\n\r\nAlmost to the amazement of the Athenian chiefs, so accustomed were they to\r\nDorian doltishness and immobility, after a ten days’ delay and excuses\r\nthat “they must celebrate their festival the Hyacinthia,” the ephors\r\ncalled forth their whole levy. Ten thousand heavy infantrymen with a host\r\nof lightly armed “helots”(11) were started northward under the able lead\r\nof Pausanias, the regent for Leonidas’s young son. Likewise all the allies\r\nof Lacedæmon—Corinthians, Sicyonians, Elians, Arcadians—began to hurry\r\ntoward the Isthmus. Therefore men who had loved Hellas and had almost\r\ndespaired for her took courage. “At last we will have a great land battle,\r\nand an end to the Barbarian.”\r\n\r\nAll was excitement in the Athenian colony at Trœzene. The board of\r\nstrategi met and voted that now was the time for a crowning effort. Five\r\nthousand men-at-arms should march under Aristeides to join against\r\nMardonius in Bœotia. By sea Themistocles should go with every available\r\nship to Delos, meet the allied squadrons there, and use his infallible art\r\nin persuading the sluggish Spartan high admiral to conduct a raid across\r\nthe Ægean at Xerxes’s own doors. Of the ten strategi Democrates had called\r\nloudest for instant action, so loudly indeed that Themistocles had\r\ncautioned him against rashness. Hermippus was old, but experienced men\r\ntrusted him, therefore he was appointed to command the contingent of his\r\ntribe. Democrates was to accompany Aristeides as general adjutant; his\r\ndiplomatic training would be invaluable in ending the frictions sure to\r\narise amongst the allies. Cimon would go with Themistocles, and so every\r\nother man was sent to his place. In the general preparation private\r\nproblems seemed forgotten. Hermippus and Democrates both announced that\r\nthe betrothal of Hermione had been postponed, pending the public crisis.\r\nThe old Eleusinian had not told his daughter, or even his wife, why he had\r\nseemed to relax his announced purpose of forcing Hermione to an unwelcome\r\nmarriage. The young widow knew she had respite—for how long nothing told\r\nher, but for every day her agony was postponed she blessed kind Hera. Then\r\ncame the morning when her father must go forth with his men. She still\r\nloved him, despite the grief he was giving her. She did him justice to\r\nbelieve he acted in affection. The gay ribbons that laced his cuirass, the\r\nred and blue embroidery that edged his “taxiarch’s” cloak, were from the\r\nneedle of his daughter. Hermione kissed him as she stood with her mother\r\nin the aula. He coughed gruffly when he answered their “farewell.” The\r\nhouse door closed behind him, and Hermione and Lysistra ran into one\r\nanother’s arms. They had given to Hellas their best, and now must look to\r\nAthena.\r\n\r\nHermippus and Aristeides were gone, Democrates remained in Trœzene. His\r\nbusiness, he said, was more diplomatic than military, and he was expecting\r\nadvices from the islands which he must take to Pausanias in person. He had\r\na number of interviews with Themistocles, when it was observed that every\r\ntime he came away with clouded brow and gruff answers to all who accosted.\r\nIt began to be hinted that all was not as well as formerly between the\r\nadmiral and the orator, that Democrates had chosen to tie too closely to\r\nAristeides for the son of Neocles’s liking, and that as soon as the\r\ncampaign was decided, a bitter feud would break out betwixt them. But this\r\nwas merest gossip. Outwardly Democrates and Themistocles continued\r\nfriends, dined together, exchanged civilities. On the day when\r\nThemistocles was to sail for Delos he walked arm in arm with Democrates to\r\nthe quay. The hundreds of onlookers saw him embrace the young strategus in\r\na manner belying any rumour of estrangement, whilst Democrates stood on\r\nthe sand waving his good wishes until the admiral climbed the ladder of\r\nthe _Nausicaä_.\r\n\r\nIt was another day and landscape which the stranger in Hellas would have\r\nremembered long. The haven of Trœzene, noblest in Peloponnesus, girt by\r\nits two mountain promontories, Methana and the holy hill Calauria, opened\r\nits bright blue into the deeper blue of the Saronic bay. Under the eye of\r\nthe beholder Ægina and the coasts of Attica stood forth, a fit frame to\r\nthe far horizon. Sun, sea, hills, and shore wrought together to make one\r\nglorious harmony, endless variety, yet ordered and fashioned into a divine\r\nwhole. “Euopis,” “The Fair-Faced,” the beauty-loving dwellers of the\r\ncountry called it, and they named aright.\r\n\r\nSomething of the beauty touched even Hermione as she stood on the hill\r\nslope, gazing across the sea. Only Cleopis was with her. The young widow\r\nhad less trembling when she looked on the _Nausicaä_ than when one year\r\nbefore the stately trireme had sailed for Artemisium. If ill news must\r\ncome, it would be from the plains of Bœotia. Most of Themistocles’s fleet\r\nwas already at Delos. He led only a dozen sail. When his squadron glided\r\non into the blue deep, the haven seemed deserted save for the Carthaginian\r\ntrader that swung at her cables close upon the land. As Hermione looked\r\nand saw the climbing sun change the tintings of the waters, here spreading\r\na line of green gold amidst the blue, here flashing the waves with dark\r\nviolet, something of the peace and majesty of the scene entered into her\r\nown breast. The waves at the foot of the slope beat in monotonous music.\r\nShe did not wonder that Thetis, Galatea, and all the hundred Nereids loved\r\ntheir home. Somewhere, far off on that shimmering plain, Glaucon the\r\nBeautiful had fallen asleep; whether he waked in the land of Rhadamanthus,\r\nwhether he had been stolen away by Leucothea and the other nymphs to be\r\ntheir playfellow, she did not know. She was not sad, even to think of him\r\ncrowned with green seaweed, and sitting under the sea-floor with\r\nfish-tailed Tritons at their tables of pearl, while the finny shoals like\r\nbirds flitted above their heads. Thales the Sage made all life proceed out\r\nof the sea. Perchance all life should return to it. Then she would find\r\nher husband again, not beyond, but within the realms of great Oceanus.\r\nWith such beauty spreading out before her eyes the phantasy was almost\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThe people had wandered homeward. Cleopis set the parasol on the dry grass\r\nwhere it would shade her mistress and betook herself to the shelter of a\r\nrock. If Hermione was pleased to meditate so long, she would not deny her\r\nslave a siesta. So the Athenian sat and mused, now sadly, now with a gleam\r\nof brightness, for she was too young to have her sun clouded always.\r\n\r\nA speaker near by her called her out of her reverie.\r\n\r\n“You sit long, _kyria_, and gaze forth as if you were Zeus in Olympus and\r\ncould look on all the world.”\r\n\r\nHermione had not exchanged a word with Democrates since that day she cast\r\nscorn on him on that other hill slope at Munychia, but this did not make\r\nhis intrusion more welcome. With mortification she realized that she had\r\nforgotten herself. That she lay on the sunny bank with her feet\r\noutstretched and her hair shaken loose on her shoulders. Her feet she\r\ninstantly covered with her long himation. Her hands flew instantly to her\r\nhair. Then she uprose, flushing haughtily.\r\n\r\n“It has pleased my father, sir,” she spoke with frigid dignity, “to tell\r\nme that you are some day perchance to be my husband. The fulfilment lies\r\nwith the gods. But to-day the strategus Democrates knows our customs too\r\nwell to thrust himself upon an Attic gentlewoman who finds herself alone\r\nsave for one servant.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _kyria_; pardon the word, it’s overcold; _makaira_, I’d say more\r\ngladly,” Democrates was marvellously at his ease despite her frowns, “your\r\nnoble father will take nothing amiss if I ask you to sit again that we may\r\ntalk together.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so.” Hermione drew herself up at full height. But\r\nDemocrates deliberately placed himself in the path up the hillside. To\r\nhave run toward the water seemed folly. She could expect no help from\r\nCleopis, who would hardly oppose a man soon probably to be her master. As\r\nthe less of evils, Hermione did not indeed sit as desired, but stood\r\nfacing her unloved lover and hearkening.\r\n\r\n“How long I’ve desired this instant!” Democrates looked as if he might\r\nseize her hands to kiss them, but she thrust them behind her. “I know you\r\nhate me bitterly because, touching your late husband, I did my duty.”\r\n\r\n“Your duty?” Nestor’s eloquence was in her incredulous echo.\r\n\r\n“If I have pained you beyond telling, do you think my act was a pleasant\r\none for me? A bosom friend to ruin, the most sacred bonds to sever, last\r\nand not least, to give infinite sorrow to her I love?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly understand.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates drew a step nearer.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite the Golden—by what name shall I call my\r\ngoddess?” Hermione drew back a step. There was danger in his eyes. “I have\r\nloved you, loved you long. Before Glaucon took you in marriage I loved\r\nyou. But Eros and Hymen hearkened to his prayers, not mine. You became his\r\nbride. I wore a bright face at your wedding. You remember I was Glaucon’s\r\ngroomsman, and rode beside you in the bridal car. You loved him, he seemed\r\nworthy of you. Therefore I trod my own grief down into my heart, and\r\nrejoiced with my friends. But to cease loving you I could not. Truly they\r\nsay Eros is the strongest god, and pitiless—do not the poets say bloody\r\nAres begat him—”\r\n\r\n“Spare me mythologies,” interposed Hermione, with another step back.\r\n\r\n“As you will, but you shall hearken. I have desired this moment for two\r\nyears. Not as the weak girl given by her father, but as the fair goddess\r\nwho comes to me gladly, I do desire you. And I know you will smile on me\r\nwhen you have heard me through.”\r\n\r\n“Keep back your eloquence. You have destroyed Glaucon. That is enough.”\r\n\r\n“Hear me.” Democrates cried desperately now. Hermione feared even to\r\nretreat farther, lest he pass to violence. She summoned courage and looked\r\nhim in the eye.\r\n\r\n“Say on, then. But remember I am a woman and alone save for Cleopis. If\r\nyou profess to love me, you will not forget that.”\r\n\r\nBut Democrates was passing almost beyond the limits of coherent speech.\r\n\r\n“Oh, when you come to me, you will not know what a price I have paid for\r\nyou. In Homer’s day men wooed their wives with costly gifts, but I—have I\r\nnot paid for you with my soul? My soul, I say—honour, friendship, country,\r\nwhat has weighed against Himeros, ‘Master Desire,’—the desire ever for\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\nShe hardly understood him, his speech flowed so thick. She knew he was on\r\nthe edge of reason, and feared to answer lest she drive beyond it.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear the price I have paid? Do you still look on in cold hate,\r\nlady? Ah, by Zeus, even in your coldest, most forbidding mood you are fair\r\nas the Paphian when she sprang above the sea! And I will win you, lady, I\r\nwill win your heart, for they shall do you homage, even all Athens, and I\r\nwill make you a queen. Yes! the house of Athena on the Acropolis shall be\r\nyour palace if you will, and they will cry in the Agora, ‘Way, way for\r\nHermione, glorious consort of Democrates our king!’ ”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” spoke Hermione, while her hands grew chill, for now she was sure he\r\nraved, “I have not the joy to comprehend. There is no king in Athens,\r\nplease Athena, there never will be. Treason and blasphemy you speak all in\r\none.” She sought vainly with her eyes for refuge. None in sight. The hill\r\nslope seemed empty save for the scattered brown boulders. Far away a goat\r\nwas wandering. She motioned to Cleopis. The old woman was staring now, and\r\ndoubtless thought Democrates was carrying his familiarities too far, but\r\nshe was a weak creature, and at best could only scream.\r\n\r\n“Treason and blasphemy,” cried Democrates, dropping on his knees, his\r\nframe shaking with dishonest passion, “yes! call them so now. They will be\r\nblessed truth for me in a month, for me, for you. Hermes the Trickster is\r\na mighty god. He has befriended Eros. I shall possess Athens and possess\r\nyou. I shall be the most fortunate mortal upon earth as now I am most\r\nmiserable. Ah! but I have waited so long.” He sprang to his feet. “Tarry,\r\n_makaira_, tarry! A kiss!”\r\n\r\nHermione screamed at last shrilly and turned to fly. Instantly Democrates\r\nwas upon her. In that fluttering white dress escape was hopeless.\r\n\r\n“Apollo pursuing Daphne!”—his crazed shout as his arms closed around\r\nher,—“but Daphne becomes no laurel this time. Her race is lost. She shall\r\npay the forfeit.”\r\n\r\nShe felt him seize her girdle. He swung her face to face. She saw his wide\r\neyes, his mad smile. His hot breath smote her cheek. Cleopis at last was\r\nscreaming.\r\n\r\n“Mine,” he triumphed, while he forced her resisting head to his own,\r\n“there is none to hinder!”\r\n\r\nBut even while the woman’s flesh crept back at his impure kiss, a giant\r\npower came rending the twain apart. A man had sundered them, sprung from\r\nthe ground or from heaven belike, or from behind a boulder? He tore\r\nDemocrates’s hands away as a lion tears a lamb. He dashed the mad orator\r\nprone upon the sod, and kicked him twice, as of mingled hatred and\r\ncontempt. All this Hermione only knew in half, while her senses swam. Then\r\nshe came to herself enough to see that the stranger was a young man in a\r\nsailor’s loose dress, his features almost hidden under the dishevelled\r\nhair and beard. All this time he uttered no word, but having smitten\r\nDemocrates down, leaped back, rubbing his hands upon his thigh, as if\r\ndespising to touch so foul an object. The orator groaned, staggered\r\nupward. He wore a sword. It flew from its scabbard as he leaped on the\r\nsailor. The stranger put forth his hand, snatched his opponent’s wrist,\r\nand with lightning dexterity sent the blade spinning back upon the grass.\r\nThen he threw Democrates a second time, and the latter did not rise again\r\nhastily, but lay cursing. The fall had not been gentle.\r\n\r\nBut all this while Cleopis was screaming. People were hastening up the\r\nhill,—fishermen from a skiff upon the beach, slaves who had been carrying\r\nbales to the haven. In a moment they would be surrounded by a dozen. The\r\nstrange sailor turned as if to fly. He had not spoken one word. Hermione\r\nherself at last called to him.\r\n\r\n“My preserver! Your name! Blessed be you forever!”\r\n\r\nThe fisherfolk were very close. Cleopis was still screaming. The sailor\r\nlooked once into the lady’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“I am nameless! You owe me nothing!” And with that he was gone up the hill\r\nslopes, springing with long bounds that would have mocked pursuing, had\r\nany attempted. But Cleopis quenched her outcry instantly; her screams had\r\nbeen drowned by a louder scream from Hermione, who fell upon the\r\ngreensward, no marble whiter than her face. The nurse ran to her mistress.\r\nDemocrates staggered to his feet. Whatever else the chastisement had given\r\nhim, it had restored his balance of mind. He told the fisherfolk a glib\r\nstory that a sailor wandering along the strand had accosted Hermione, that\r\nhe himself had chased the villain off, but had tripped whilst trying to\r\nfollow. If the tale was not of perfect workmanship at all points, there\r\nwas no one with interest to gainsay it. A few ran up the hill slope, but\r\nthe sailor was nowhere in sight. Hermione was still speechless. They made\r\na litter of oars and sail-cloth and carried her to her mother. Democrates\r\noiled Cleopis’s palm well, that she should tell nothing amiss to Lysistra.\r\nIt was a long time before Hermione opened her eyes in her chamber. Her\r\nfirst words were:—\r\n\r\n“Glaucon! I have seen Glaucon!”\r\n\r\n“You have had a strange dream, _philotata_,” soothed Lysistra, shifting\r\nthe pillows, “lie still and rest.”\r\n\r\nBut Hermione shook her shining brown head and repeated, many times:—\r\n\r\n“No dream! No dream! I have seen Glaucon face to face. In that instant he\r\nspoke and looked on me I knew him. He lives. He saved me. Ah! why does he\r\nstay away?”\r\n\r\nLysistra, whose husband had not deemed it prudent to inform her of\r\nThemistocles’s revelations, was infinitely distressed. She sent for the\r\nbest physicians of the city, and despatched a slave to the temple of\r\nAsclepius at Epidaurus—not distant—to sacrifice two cocks for her\r\ndaughter’s recovery. The doctors looked wise and recommended heavy doses\r\nof spiced wine, and if those did not suffice, said that the patient might\r\nspend a night in the temple of the Healer, who would no doubt explain the\r\ntrue remedy in a dream. A “wise woman” who had great following among the\r\nslaves advised that a young puppy be tied upon Hermione’s temples to\r\nabsorb the disaffection of her brain. Lysistra was barely persuaded not to\r\nfollow her admonitions. After a few days the patient grew better,\r\nrecovered strength, took an interest in her child. Yet ever and anon she\r\nwould repeat over Phœnix’s cradle:—\r\n\r\n“Your father lives! I have seen him! I have seen him!”\r\n\r\nWhat, however, puzzled Lysistra most, was the fact that Cleopis did not\r\ncontradict her young mistress in the least, but maintained a mysterious\r\nsilence about the whole adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE LOYALTY OF LAMPAXO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night after his adventure on the hill slope Democrates received in his\r\nchambers no less an individual than Hiram. That industrious Phœnician had\r\nbeen several days in Trœzene, occupied in a manner he and his superior\r\ndiscreetly kept to themselves. The orator had a bandage above one eye,\r\nwhere a heavy sandal had kicked him. He was exceedingly pale, and sat in\r\nthe arm-chair propped with pillows. That he had awaited Hiram eagerly,\r\nbetrayed itself by the promptness with which he cut short the inevitable\r\nsalaam.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear rascal, have you found him?”\r\n\r\n“May it please your Excellency to hearken to even the least of your\r\nslaves?”\r\n\r\n“Do you hear, fox?—have you found him?”\r\n\r\n“My Lord shall judge for himself.”\r\n\r\n“Cerberus eat you, fellow,—though you’d be a poisonous mouthful,—tell your\r\nstory in as few words as possible. I _know_ that he is lurking about\r\nTrœzene.”\r\n\r\n“Compassion, your Lordship, compassion,”—Hiram seemed washing his hands in\r\noil, they waved so soothingly—“if your Benignity will grant it, I have a\r\nvery worthy woman here who, I think, can tell a story that will be\r\ninteresting.”\r\n\r\n“In with her, then.”\r\n\r\nThe person Hiram escorted into the room proved to be no more nor less than\r\nLampaxo. Two years had not removed the wrinkles from her cheek, the\r\nsharpness from her nose, the rasping from her tongue. At sight of her\r\nDemocrates half rose from his seat and held out his hand affably, the\r\ndemagogue’s instinct uppermost.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my good dame, whom do I recognize? Are you not the wife of our\r\nexcellent fishmonger, Phormio? A truly sterling man, and how, pray, is\r\nyour good husband?”\r\n\r\n“Poorly, poorly, _kyrie_.” Lampaxo looked down and fumbled her dirty\r\nchiton. Such condescension on the part of a magnate barely less than\r\nThemistocles or Aristeides was overpowering.\r\n\r\n“Poorly? I grieve to learn it. I was informed that he was comfortably\r\nsettled here until it was safe to return to Attica, and had even opened a\r\nprosperous stall in the market-place.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, _kyrie_; and the trade, considering the times, is not so\r\nbad—Athena be praised—and he’s not sick in body. It’s worse, far worse. I\r\nwas even on the point of going to your Lordship to state my misgivings,\r\nwhen your good friend, the Phœnician, fell into my company, and I found he\r\nwas searching for the very thing I wanted to reveal.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Democrates leaned forward and battled against his impatience,—“and\r\nwhat is the matter wherein I can be of service to so deserving a citizen\r\nas your husband?”\r\n\r\n“I fear me,”—Lampaxo put her apron dutifully to her face and began to\r\nsniff,—“your Excellency won’t call him ‘deserving’ any more. Hellas knows\r\nyour Excellency is patriotism itself. The fact is Phormio has ‘Medized.’ ”\r\n\r\n“Medized!” The orator started as became an actor. “Gods and goddesses!\r\nwhat trust is in men if Phormio the Athenian has Medized?”\r\n\r\n“Hear my story, _mu! mu!_” groaned Lampaxo. “It’s a terrible thing to\r\naccuse one’s own husband, but duty to Hellas is duty. Your Excellency is a\r\nmerciful man, if he could only warn Phormio in private.”\r\n\r\n“Woman,”—Democrates pulled his most consequential frown,—“Medizing is\r\ntreason. On your duty as a daughter of Athens I charge you tell\r\neverything, then rely on my wisdom.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, _kyrie_, certainly,” gasped Lampaxo, and so she began a\r\nrecital mingled with many moans and protestations, which Democrates dared\r\nnot bid her hasten.\r\n\r\nThe good woman commenced by reminding the strategus how he had visited her\r\nand her brother Polus to question them as to the doings of the Babylonish\r\ncarpet merchant, and how it had seemed plain to them that Glaucon was\r\nnothing less than a traitor. Next she proceeded to relate how her husband\r\nhad enabled the criminal to fly by sea, and her own part therein—for she\r\nloudly accused herself of treason in possessing a guilty knowledge of the\r\noutlaw’s manner of escape. As for Bias, he had just now gone on a message\r\nto Megara, but Democrates would surely castigate his own slave. “Still,”\r\nwound up Lampaxo, “the traitor seemed drowned, and his treason locked up\r\nin Phorcys’s strong box, and so I said nothing about him. More’s the\r\npity.”\r\n\r\n“The more reason for concealing nothing now.”\r\n\r\n“Zeus strike me if I keep back anything. It’s now about ten days since\r\n_he_ returned.”\r\n\r\n“ ‘He?’ Whom do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“It’s not overeasy to tell, _kyrie_. He calls himself Critias, and wears a\r\nlong black beard and tangled hair. Phormio brought him home one\r\nevening—said he was the _prōreus_ of a Melian trireme caulking at\r\nEpidaurus, but was once in the fish trade at Peiræus and an old friend. I\r\ntold Phormio we had enough these days to fill our own bellies, but my\r\nhusband would be hospitable. I had to bring out my best honey cakes. Your\r\nLordship knows I take just pride in my honey cakes.”\r\n\r\n“Beyond doubt,”—Democrates’s hand twitched with impatience,—“but tell of\r\nthe stranger.”\r\n\r\n“At once, _kyrie_; well, we all sat down to sup. Phormio kept pressing\r\nwine on the fellow as if we had not only one little jar of yellow Rhodian\r\nin the cellar. All the time the sailor barely spoke a few words of island\r\nDoric, but my heart misgave. He seemed so refined, so handsome. And near\r\nthe roots of his hair it was not so dark—as if dyed and needing renewal.\r\nTrust a woman’s eyes for that. When supper was over Phormio orders me, ‘Up\r\nthe ladder and to bed. I’ll come shortly, but leave a blanket and pillow\r\nfor our friend who sleeps on the hearth.’ Your Excellency knows we hired a\r\nlittle house on the ‘Carpenter’s Street,’ very reasonably you will\r\ngrant—only half a minæ for the winter. I gave the stranger a fine pillow\r\nand a blanket embroidered by Stephanium, she was my great-aunt, and left\r\nit to me by will, and the beautiful red wool was from Byzantium—”\r\n\r\n“But you spoke of Critias?” Democrates could scarce keep upon his seat.\r\n\r\n“Yes, _kyrie_. Well, I warned Phormio not to give him any more wine. Then\r\nI went up the ladder. O Mother Demeter, how sharply I listened, but the\r\nrascals spoke too low together for me to catch anything, save that Critias\r\nhad dropped his Doric and spoke good Attic now. At last Phormio came up to\r\nme, and I pretended to snore. In the morning, lo! the scoundrelly stranger\r\nhad slipped away. In the evening he returns late. Phormio harbours him\r\nagain. So for several nights, coming late, going early. Then to-night he\r\ncomes a bit before his wont. He and Phormio drank more than common. After\r\nPhormio sent me away, they talked a long time and in louder voice.”\r\n\r\n“You overheard?” Democrates gripped his arm-chair.\r\n\r\n“Yes, _kyrie_, blessed be Athena! The stranger spoke pure Attic such as\r\nyour Excellency might use. Many times I heard Hermione named, and yourself\r\nonce—”\r\n\r\n“And how?”\r\n\r\n“The stranger said: ‘So she will not wed Democrates. She loathes him.\r\nAphrodite shed joy on her forever.’ Then Phormio answered him, ‘Therefore,\r\ndear Glaucon, you should trust the gods a little longer.’ ”\r\n\r\n“ ‘Glaucon,’ said he?” Democrates leaped from the chair.\r\n\r\n“ ‘Glaucon,’ on my oath by the Styx. Then I covered my head and wept. I\r\nknew my husband harboured the arch-traitor. Heaven can tell how he escaped\r\nthe sea. As soon as Phormio was sleeping snug beside me, I went down the\r\nladder, intending to call the watch. In the street I met a man, this good\r\nPhœnician here,—he explained he was suspecting this ‘Critias’ himself, and\r\nlurked about in hopes of tracing him in the morning. I told my story. He\r\nsaid it was best to come straight to you. And now I have accused my own\r\nhusband, Excellency. _Ai!_ was wife ever harder beset? Phormio is a kindly\r\nand commonly obedient man, even if he doesn’t know the value of an obol.\r\nYou will be merciful—”\r\n\r\n“Peace,” commanded Democrates, with portentous gravity, “justice first,\r\nmercy later. Do you solemnly swear you heard Phormio call this stranger\r\n‘Glaucon’?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, _kyrie_. Woe! woe!”\r\n\r\n“And you say he is now asleep in your house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the wine has made them both very heavy.”\r\n\r\n“You have done well.” Democrates extended his hand again. “You are a\r\nworthy daughter of Athens. In years to come they will name you with King\r\nCodrus who sacrificed his life for the freedom of Attica, for have you not\r\nsacrificed what should be dearer than life,—the fair name of your husband?\r\nBut courage. Your patriotism may extenuate his crime. Only the traitor\r\nmust be taken.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he was breathing hard when I went out. Ah! seize him quickly.”\r\n\r\n“Retire,” commanded Democrates, with a flourish; “leave me to concert with\r\nthis excellent Hiram the means of thwarting I know not what gross\r\nvillany.”\r\n\r\nThe door had hardly closed behind Lampaxo, when Democrates fell as a heap\r\ninto the cushions. He was ashen and palsied.\r\n\r\n“Courage, master,”—Hiram was drawing a suggestive finger across his\r\nthroat,—“the woman’s tale is true metal. Critias shall sleep snug and\r\nsweetly to-night, if perchance too soundly.”\r\n\r\n“What will you do?” shrieked the wretched man.\r\n\r\n“The thing is marvellously simple, master. The night is not yet old.\r\nHasdrubal and his crew of Carthaginians are here and by the grace of Baal\r\ncan serve you. This cackling hen will guide us to the house. Heaven has\r\nput your enemy off his guard. He and Phormio will never wake to feel their\r\nthroats cut. Then a good stone on each foot takes the corpses down in the\r\nharbour.”\r\n\r\nBut Democrates dashed his hand in negation.\r\n\r\n“No, by the infernal gods, not so! No murder. I cannot bear the curse of\r\nthe Furies. Seize him, carry him to the ends of the earth, to hardest\r\nslavery. Let him never cross my path again. But no bloodshed—”\r\n\r\nHiram almost lost his never failing smile, so much he marvelled.\r\n\r\n“But, your Lordship, the man is a giant, mighty as Melkarth.(12) Seizing\r\nwill be hard. Sheol is the safest prison.”\r\n\r\n“No.” Democrates was still shaking. “His ghost came to me a thousand\r\ntimes, though yet he lived. It would hound me mad if I murdered him.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ would not murder him. Your slave is not afflicted by dreams.”\r\nHiram’s smile was extremely insinuating.\r\n\r\n“Don’t quibble with words. It would be I who slew him, though I never\r\nstruck the blow. You can seize him. Is he not asleep? Call Hasdrubal—bind\r\nGlaucon, gag him, drag him to the ship. But he must not die.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, Excellency.” Hiram seldom quarrelled to no purpose with his\r\nbetters. “Let your Lordship deign to leave this small matter to his slave.\r\nBy Baal’s favour Hasdrubal and six of his crew sleep on shore to-night.\r\nLet us pray they be not deep in wine. Wait for me one hour, perhaps two,\r\nand your heart and liver shall be comforted.”\r\n\r\n“Go, go! I will wait and pray to Hermes Dolios.”\r\n\r\nHiram even now did not forget his punctilious salaam before departing.\r\nNever had he seemed more the beautiful serpent with the shining scales\r\nthan the instant he bent gracefully at Democrates’s feet, the red light\r\nfalling on his gleaming ear and nose rings, his smooth brown skin and\r\nbeady eyes. The door turned on its pivots—closed. Democrates heard the\r\nretiring footsteps. No doubt the Phœnician was taking Lampaxo with him.\r\nThe Athenian staggered across the room to his bed and flung himself on it,\r\nlaughing hysterically. How absolutely his enemy was delivered into his\r\nhands! How the Moræ in sending that Carthaginian ship, to do Lycon’s\r\nbusiness and his, had provided the means of ridding him of the haunting\r\nterror! How everything conspired to aid him! He need not even kill\r\nGlaucon. He would have no blood guiltiness, he need not dread Alecto and\r\nher sister Furies. He could trust Hiram and Hasdrubal to see to it that\r\nGlaucon never returned to plague him. And Hermione? Democrates laughed\r\nagain. He was almost frightened at his own glee.\r\n\r\n“A month, my nymph, a month, and you and your dear father, yes,\r\nThemistocles himself, will be in no state to answer me ‘nay,’—though\r\nGlaucon come to claim you.”\r\n\r\nThus he lay a long time, while the drip, drip from the water-clock in the\r\ncorner told how the night was passing. The lamp flickered and burned\r\nlower. He never knew the hours to creep so slowly.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAt last, a knock; Scodrus, the yawning valet, ushering in a black and\r\nbearded sailor, who crouched eastern fashion at the feet of the strategus.\r\n\r\n“You have seized him?”\r\n\r\n“Blessed be Moloch, Baal, and Melkarth! They have poured sleep upon my\r\nLord’s enemy.” The sailor’s Greek was harsh and execrable. “Your servants\r\ndid even as commanded. The woman let us in. The young man my Lord hates\r\nwas bound and gagged almost ere he could waken, likewise the fishmonger\r\nwas seized.”\r\n\r\n“Bravely done. I never forget good service. And the woman?”\r\n\r\n“She is retained likewise. I have hastened hither to learn the further\r\nwill of my Lord.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates arose hastily.\r\n\r\n“My himation, staff, and shoes, boy!” he ordered. “I will go forth myself.\r\nThe prisoners are still at the fishmonger’s house?”\r\n\r\n“Even so, Excellency.”\r\n\r\n“I go back with you. I must see this stranger with my own eyes. There must\r\nbe no mistake.”\r\n\r\nScodrus stared widely when he saw his master go out into the dark, for his\r\nonly escort a black Carthaginian sailor with a dirk a cubit long.\r\nDemocrates did not even ask for a lantern. None of the servants could\r\nfathom their master’s doings of late. He gave strappings when they asked\r\nquestions, and Bias was away.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Trœzene were utterly deserted when Democrates threaded\r\nthem. There was no moon, neither he nor his companion were overcertain of\r\nthe way. Once they missed the right turn, wandered down a blind alley, and\r\nplunged into a pile of offal awaiting the scavenger dogs. But finally the\r\nseaman stopped at a low door in a narrow street, and a triple rap made it\r\nopen. The scene was squalid. A rush-candle was burning on a table. Around\r\nit squatted seven men who rose and bowed as the strategus entered. In the\r\ndim flicker he could just recognize the burly shipmaster Hasdrubal and\r\ngigantic Hib, the Libyan “governor,” whose ebon face betrayed itself even\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“We have expected you, _kyrie_,” said Hiram, who was one of the group.\r\n\r\n“Thanks be to Hermes and to you all. I have told my guide already I will\r\nbe grateful. Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“In the kitchen behind, your Lordship. We were singularly favoured. Hib\r\nhad the cord around his arms before he wakened. He could scarcely struggle\r\ndespite his power. The fishmonger awoke before Hasdrubal could nip him.\r\nFor a moment we feared his outcries would rouse the street. But again the\r\ngods blessed us. No one stirred, and we soon throttled him.”\r\n\r\n“Take the light,” ordered Democrates. “Come.”\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Hiram, the orator entered the kitchen, a small square room.\r\nThe white-washed ceiling was blacked around the smoke-hole, a few pots and\r\npans lay in the corners, a few dying embers gleamed on the hearth. But\r\nDemocrates had eyes only for two objects,—human figures tightly bound\r\nlying rigid as faggots in the further corner.\r\n\r\n“Which is he?” asked Democrates again, stepping softly as though going to\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n“The further one is Phormio, the nearer is my Lord’s enemy. Your\r\nExcellency need not fear to draw close. He is quite secure.”\r\n\r\n“Give me the candle.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates held the light high and trod gently over to the prostrate men.\r\nHiram spoke rightly that his victim was secure. They had lashed him hand\r\nand foot, using small chains in lieu of cords. A bit of wood had been\r\nthrust into his mouth and tied with twine under the ears. Democrates stood\r\nan instant looking down, then very deliberately knelt beside the prisoner\r\nand moved the candle closer. He could see now the face hidden half by the\r\ntangled black hair and beard and the gag—but who could doubt it?—the deep\r\nblue eye, the chiselled profile, the small, fine lips, yes, and the\r\ngodlike form visible in its comeliness despite the bands. He was gazing\r\nupon the man who two years ago had called him “bosom-friend.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner looked straight upward. The only thing he could move was his\r\neyes, and these followed Democrates’s least motion. The orator pressed the\r\ncandle closer yet. He even put out his hand, and touched the face to brush\r\naway the hair. A long look—and he was satisfied. No mistake was possible.\r\nDemocrates arose and stood over the prisoner, then spoke aloud.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon, I have played at dice with Fortune. I have conquered. I did not\r\nruin you willingly. There was no other way. A man must first be a friend\r\nto himself, and then friendly to others. I have cast in my lot with the\r\nPersians. It was I who wrote that letter which blasted you at Colonus.\r\nVery soon there will be a great battle fought in Bœotia. Lycon and I will\r\nmake it certain that Mardonius conquers. I am to be tyrant of Athens.\r\nHermione shall be my wife.” The workings of the prisoner’s face made\r\nDemocrates wince; from Glaucon’s throat came rattlings, his eyes were\r\nterrible. But the other drove recklessly forward. “As for you, you pass\r\nthis night out of my life. How you escaped the sea I know not and care\r\nless. Hasdrubal will take you to Carthage, and sell you into the interior\r\nof Libya. I wish you no misery, only you go where you shall never see\r\nHellas again. I am merciful. Your life is in my hands. But I restore it. I\r\nam without blood guiltiness. What I have done you would have done, had you\r\nloved as I—had you been under necessity as I. Eros is a great god, but\r\nAnangkë, Dame Necessity, is yet mightier. So to-night we part—farewell.”\r\n\r\nA strong spasm passed through the prisoner’s frame. For a moment\r\nDemocrates thought the bonds would snap. Too strong. The orator swung on\r\nhis heel and returned to the outer room.\r\n\r\n“The night wanes, _kyrie_,” remarked Hasdrubal; “if these good people are\r\nto be taken to the ship, it must be soon.”\r\n\r\n“As you will. I do nothing more concerning them.”\r\n\r\n“Fetch down the woman,” ordered Hasdrubal; in the mongrel Greek current\r\namongst Mediterranean sea-folk. Two of his seamen ascended the ladder and\r\nreturned with Lampaxo, who smirked and simpered at sight of Democrates and\r\nbobbed him a courtesy.\r\n\r\n“The traitor is seized, your Excellency. I hope your Excellency will see\r\nthat he drinks hemlock. You will be merciful to my poor husband, even if\r\nhe must be arrested for the night. Gods and goddesses! what are these men\r\ndoing to me?”\r\n\r\nA stalwart Carthaginian was in the act of knotting a cord around the good\r\nwoman’s arms preparatory to pinioning them.\r\n\r\n“_Kyrie! kyrie!_” she screamed, “they are binding me, too! Me—the most\r\nloyal woman in Attica.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates scowled and turned his back on her.\r\n\r\n“Your Lordship surely intended this woman to be taken also,” suggested\r\nHiram, sweetly. “It cannot be he will leave such a dangerous witness at\r\nlarge.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. Off with her!”\r\n\r\n“_Kyrie! kyrie!_” was her shriek, but quickly ended, for Hasdrubal knitted\r\nhis fingers around her throat.\r\n\r\n“A gag,” he ordered, and with a few more struggles Lampaxo stood helpless\r\nand silent.\r\n\r\nA little later the band was threading its stealthy way down the black\r\nstreets. Four of the Carthaginians carried Glaucon, slung hands and feet\r\nover a pole. They dared not trust him on his feet. Phormio and Lampaxo\r\nwalked, closely pinioned and pricked on by the captain’s dagger. They were\r\nsoon at the deserted strand, and their ship’s pinnace lay upon the beach.\r\nDemocrates accompanied them as far as the dark marge, and watched while\r\nthe boat glided out into the gloom of the haven. The orator paced homeward\r\nalone. Everything had favoured him. He had even cleared himself of the\r\ncurse of the Furies and the pursuit of Nemesis. He had, he congratulated\r\nhimself, shown marvellous qualities of mercy. Glaucon lived? Yes—but the\r\nparching sand-plains of Libya would be as fast a prison as the grave, and\r\nthe life of a slave in Africa was a short one. Glaucon had passed from his\r\nhorizon forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MOLOCH BETRAYS THE PHŒNICIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nEven whilst the boat pulled out to the trader, Hiram suggested that since\r\nhis superior’s “unfortunate scruples” forbade them to shed blood, at least\r\nthey could disable the most dangerous captive by putting out his eyes. But\r\nHasdrubal, thrifty Semite, would not hearken.\r\n\r\n“Is not the fellow worth five hundred shekels in the Carthage market?—but\r\nwho will give two for a blind dog?”\r\n\r\nAnd once at the ship the prisoners were stowed in the hold so securely\r\nthat even Hiram ceased to concern himself. In the morning some of the\r\nneighbours indeed wondered at Phormio’s closed door and the silence of the\r\njangling voice of Lampaxo; but the fishmonger was after all an exile, and\r\nmight have returned suddenly to Attica, now the Persians had retreated\r\nagain to Bœotia, and before these surmises could change to misdoubting,\r\nthe _Bozra_ was bearing forth into the Ægean.\r\n\r\nThe business of Hasdrubal with the _Bozra_ at Trœzene appeared simple. The\r\nwar had disturbed the Greek harvests. He had come accordingly with a cargo\r\nof African corn, and was taking a light return lading of olive oil and\r\nsalt fish. But those who walked along the harbour front remarked that the\r\n_Bozra_ was hardly a common merchantman. She was a “sea-mouse,” long,\r\nshallow, and very fast under sail; she also carried again an unwontedly\r\nheavy crew. When Hasdrubal’s cargo seemed completed, he lingered a couple\r\nof days, alleging he was repairing a cable; then the third morning after\r\nhis nocturnal adventure a cipher letter to Democrates sent the\r\nCarthaginian to sea. The letter went thus:—\r\n\r\n“Lycon, in the camp of the Greeks in Bœotia, to Democrates in Trœzene,\r\ngreeting:—The armies have now faced many days. The soothsayers declare\r\nthat the aggressor is sure to be defeated, still there has been some\r\nskirmishing in which your Athenians slew Masistes, Mardonius’s chief of\r\ncavalry. This, however, is no great loss to us. Your presence with\r\nAristeides is now urgently needed. Send Hasdrubal and Hiram at once to\r\nAsia with the papers we arranged in Corinth. Come yourself with speed to\r\nthe army. Ten days and this merry dice-throwing is ended. _Chaire!_”\r\n\r\nDemocrates immediately after this gave Hiram a small packet of papyrus\r\nsheets rolled very tight, with the ominous injunction to “conceal\r\ncarefully, weight it with lead, and fling it overboard if there is danger\r\nof capture.” At which Hiram bowed more elegantly than usual and answered,\r\n“Fear not; it shall be guarded as the priests guard the ark of Moloch, and\r\nwhen next your slave comes, it is to salute my Lord as the sovran of\r\nAthens.”\r\n\r\nHiram smiled fulsomely and departed. An hour later the _Bozra_ ran out on\r\nthe light wind around the point of Calauria and into the sparkling sea to\r\neastward. Democrates stood gazing after her until she was a dark speck on\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nThe speck at last vanished. The strategus walked homeward. Glaucon was\r\ngone. The fateful packet binding Democrates irrevocably to the Persian\r\ncause was gone. He could not turn back. At the gray of morning with a few\r\nservants he quitted Trœzene, and hastened to join Aristeides and Pausanias\r\nin Bœotia.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn the hold of the _Bozra_, where Hasdrubal had stowed his unwilling\r\npassengers, there crept just enough sunlight to make darkness visible. The\r\ngags had been removed from the prisoners, suffering them to eat, whereupon\r\nLampaxo had raised a truly prodigious outcry which must needs be silenced\r\nby a vigorous anointing with Hasdrubal’s whip of bullock’s hide. Her\r\nhusband and Glaucon disdained to join a clamour which could never escape\r\nthe dreary cavern of the hold, and which only drew the hoots of their\r\nunmagnanimous guardians. The Carthaginians had not misinterpreted\r\nGlaucon’s silence, however. They knew well they had a Titan in custody,\r\nand did not even unlash his hands. His feet and Phormio’s were tied\r\nbetween two beams in lieu of stocks. The giant Hib took it upon himself to\r\nfeed them bean porridge with a wooden spoon, making the dainty sweeter\r\nwith tales of the parching heats of Africa and the life of a slave under\r\nLibyan task-masters.\r\n\r\nSo one day, another, and another, while the _Bozra_ rocked at anchor, and\r\nthe prisoners knew that liberty lay two short cable lengths away, yet\r\nmight have been in Atlantis for all it profited them. Phormio never\r\nreviled his wife as the author of their calamity, and Lampaxo, with nigh\r\nchildish earnestness, would protest that surely Democrates knew not what\r\nthe sailors did when they bound her.\r\n\r\n“So noble a patriot! An evil god bewitched him into letting these harpies\r\ntake us. Woe! woe! What misfortune!”\r\n\r\nTo which plaint the others only smiled horribly and ground their teeth.\r\n\r\nPhormio as well as Glaucon had heard the avowal of Democrates on the night\r\nof the seizure. There was no longer any doubt of the answer to the great\r\nriddle. But disheartening, benumbing beyond all personal anguish was the\r\ndread for Hellas. The sacrifice at Thermopylæ vain. The glory of Salamis\r\nvain. Hellas and Athens enslaved. The will of Xerxes and Mardonius\r\naccomplished not because of their valour, but because of their enemies’\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\n“O gods, if indeed there be gods!” Glaucon was greatly doubting that at\r\nlast; “if ye have any power, if justice, truth, and honour weigh against\r\niniquity, put that power forth, or never claim the prayers and sacrifice\r\nof men again.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon was past dreading for himself. He prayed that Hermione might be\r\nspared a long life of tears, and that Artemis might slay her quickly by\r\nher silent arrows. To follow his thoughts in all their dark mazes were\r\nprofitless. Suffice it that the night which had brooded over his soul from\r\nthe hour he fled from Colonus was never so dark as now. He was too\r\ndespairing even to curse.\r\n\r\nThe last hope fled when they heard the rattling of the cables weighing\r\nanchor. Soon the soft slap of the water around the bow and the regular\r\nheaving motion told that the _Bozra_ was under way. The sea-mouse creaked\r\nand groaned through all her timbers and her lading. The foul bilge-water\r\nmade the hold stifling as a charnel-house. Lampaxo, Hib being absent,\r\nbegan to howl and moan.\r\n\r\n“O Queen Hera! O Queen Hera, I die for a breath of air—I, the most\r\npatriotic woman in Athens!”\r\n\r\n“Silence, goodwife,” muttered Phormio, twisting desperately on the filthy\r\nstraw under him. “Have I not enough to fret about without the addition of\r\nyour pipings?” And he muttered underbreath the old saw of Hesiod:—\r\n\r\n  “He who doth a woman trust,\r\n  Doth trust a den of thieves.”\r\n\r\n“Silence below there, you squealing sow,” ordered Hib, from the hatchway.\r\n“Must I tan your hide again?”\r\n\r\nLampaxo subsided. Phormio tugged vainly at his feet in the stocks. Glaucon\r\nsaid nothing. A terrible hope had come to him. If he could not speedily\r\ndie, at least he would soon go mad, and that would rescue him from his\r\nmost terrible enemy—himself.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe _Bozra_, it has been said, headed not south but eastward. Hasdrubal’s\r\ncommission was to fetch Samos, where the still formidable fleet of the\r\nBarbarian lay, and to put the precious packet from Democrates in the hands\r\nof Tigranes, Xerxes’s commander-in-chief on the coast of Asia Minor. But\r\nalthough speed had been enjoined, the voyage did not go prosperously. Off\r\nBelbina the wind deserted them altogether, and Hasdrubal had been\r\ncompelled to force his craft along by sweeps,—ponderous oars, worked by\r\nthree men,—but his progress at best was slow. Off Cythnos the breeze had\r\nagain arisen, but it was the Eurus from the southeast, worse than useless;\r\nthe _Bozra_ had been obliged to ride at anchor off the island for two\r\ndays. Then another calm; and at last, “because,” said Hasdrubal piously,\r\n“he had vowed two black lambs to the Wind God,” the breeze came clear and\r\ncool from the north, which, if not wholly favourable, enabled the\r\nmerchantman to plough onward. It was the fifth day, finally, after\r\nquitting Trœzene, that the headlands of Naxos came in sight at dawn, and\r\nthe master began to take comfort. The fleet of the Greeks—a fisherboat had\r\ntold him—was swinging inactive at Delos well to the north and westward,\r\nand he could fairly consider himself in waters dominated by the king.\r\n\r\n“A fortunate voyage,” the master was boasting to Hiram, as he sat at\r\nbreakfast in the stern-cabin above a platter of boiled dolphin; “two\r\ntalents from the Persians for acting as their messenger; a thousand\r\ndrachmæ profit on the corn; a hundred from Master Democrates in return for\r\nour little service, not to mention the profit on the return cargo, and\r\nlast but not least the three slaves.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the three slaves. I had almost forgotten about them.”\r\n\r\n“You see, my dear Hiram,” quoth the master, betwixt two unwontedly huge\r\nmouthfuls, “you see what folly it was of you to suggest putting out that\r\nhandsome fellow’s eyes. I am strongly thinking of selling him not to\r\nCarthage, but to Babylon. I know a trader at Ephesus who makes a specialty\r\nof handsome youths. The satrap Artabozares has commissioned him to find as\r\nmany good-looking out-runners as possible. Also for his harem—if this\r\nGlaucon were only a eunuch—”\r\n\r\nHiram, breaking a large disk of bread, was smiling very suggestively\r\nbefore making reply, when a sailor shouted at the hatch:—\r\n\r\n“Ships, master! Ships with oars!”\r\n\r\n“In what quarter?” Hasdrubal sprang up, letting the dishes clatter.\r\n\r\n“From Myconus. They come up fast. Hib at the masthead counts eleven\r\ntriremes.”\r\n\r\n“Baal preserve us!” The master at once clambered on deck. “The Greek fleet\r\nmay be quitting Delos. We must pray for wind.”\r\n\r\nIt was a gray, hazy day after a dozen bright ones. The northerly breeze\r\nseemed falling. The water spread out a sombre lead colour. The heights of\r\nNaxos were in sight to starboard, but none too clearly. Much more\r\ninteresting to Hasdrubal was the line of dots spreading on the horizon to\r\nnorthwest. Despite the distance his keen eyes could catch the rise and\r\nfall of the oar banks—war-ships, not traders. Hib was right, and\r\nHasdrubal’s face grew longer. No triremes save the Greeks could be bearing\r\nthither, and a merchantman, even from nominally neutral Carthage, caught\r\nheaded for the king’s coasts in those days of blazing war was nothing if\r\nnot fair prize. The master’s decision was prompt.\r\n\r\n“They are far off. Put the ship before the wind.”\r\n\r\nThe sea-mouse was fleet indeed for a trader, but unlike a trireme must\r\ncount on her canvas for her speed. With a piping breeze she could mock\r\npursuit. In a calm she was fearfully handicapped. However, for a moment\r\nHasdrubal congratulated himself he could slip away unnoticed. The distance\r\nwas very great. Then his dark lips cursed.\r\n\r\n“Moloch consume me! If I see aright, we are chased.”\r\n\r\nTwo vessels, in fact, seemed turning away from the rest. They were heading\r\nstraight after the _Bozra_. A long race it would be, but with the gale so\r\nlight the chances were against the sea-mouse. Hasdrubal had no need to\r\nurge his crew to rig out the oars and tug furiously, if they wished to\r\nescape a Greek prison and a slave market.\r\n\r\nThe whole crew, forty black-visaged, black-eyed creatures, were soon busy\r\nover the dozen great sweeps in a frantic attempt to force the _Bozra_\r\nbeyond danger. Panting, yelling, blaspheming, for a while they seemed\r\nholding their own, but the master watched with sinking heart the waning\r\nbreeze. At the end of an hour their pursuers could be distinguished,—a\r\ntall trireme behind, but closer, pulling more rapidly, a penteconter, a\r\nslim scouting galley working fifty oars in a single bank.\r\n\r\nHasdrubal began to shout desperately: “Wind, Baal, wind! Fill the sails,\r\nand seven he-goats await thy altar in Carthage!”\r\n\r\nEither the god found the bribe too small or lacked the power to accept it.\r\nThe breeze did not stiffen. The sailors strove like demons at the sweeps,\r\nbut almost imperceptibly the gap betwixt them and the war-ships was\r\nnarrowing.\r\n\r\nHiram, who had been rowing, now left his post to approach the master.\r\n\r\n“What of the captives? Crucifixion waits us all if they are found on the\r\nship and tell their story. Kill them at once and fling the bodies\r\noverboard.”\r\n\r\nHasdrubal shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Not yet. Still a good chance. I’ll not cast five hundred bright shekels\r\nto the fish till harder pressed. The breeze may strengthen.” Then he\r\nredoubled his shout. “Wind, Baal, wind!”\r\n\r\nBut a little later the gap betwixt the sea-mouse and the penteconter had\r\nso dwindled that even the master’s inborn thrift began to yield to\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\n“Hark you, Hib,” he cried from the helm. “Take Adherbal and Lars the\r\nEtruscan. It’s a good ten furlongs to that cursed galley still, but we\r\nmust have those prisoners ready on deck. Over they go if the chase gets a\r\nbit closer.”\r\n\r\nThe giant Libyan hastened to comply, while all the crew joined in the\r\ncaptain’s howl, “Wind, Baal, wind!” and cried reckless vows, while they\r\nscanned the fateful stretch of gray-green water behind the stern, whereon\r\nliberty if not life depended.\r\n\r\nThe trireme, pulling only one of her banks, was dropping behind, her\r\nnavarch leaving the tiring chase to the penteconter, but the latter hung\r\non doggedly.\r\n\r\n“Curse those war-ships with their long oars and heavy crews,” growled Hib,\r\nreappearing above the hatch with the prisoners. “The penteconter’s only\r\nnine furlongs off.”\r\n\r\nHe had been obliged to release the captives from the stocks, but Hib had\r\ntaken the precaution to place on the formidable athlete a pair of leg\r\nirons joined by a shackle. Not merely were Glaucon’s arms pinioned by a\r\nstout cord, but the great Libyan was gripping them tightly. Lars and\r\nAdherbal conducted the other prisoners, whose feet, however, were not\r\nbound. For a moment the three captives stood blinking at the unfamiliar\r\nlight, unconscious of the situation and their extremity, whilst Hasdrubal\r\nfor the fortieth time measured the distance. The wind had strengthened a\r\nlittle. Let it strengthen a trifle more and the _Bozra_ would hold her\r\nown. Still her people were nearly spent with their toiling, and the keen\r\nbeak and large complement of the man-of-war made resistance madness if she\r\nonce came alongside.\r\n\r\n“Have ready sand-bags,” ordered Hasdrubal, “to tie to these wretches’\r\nfeet. Set them by the boat mast, so the sail can hide our pretty deed from\r\nthe penteconter. Have ready an axe. We’ll bide a little longer, though,\r\nbefore we say ‘farewell’ to our passengers. The gods may help yet.”\r\n\r\nHib and his fellows were marching the prisoners to the poop, when the\r\nsight of the war-ship told Phormio all the story. No gag now hindered his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dragons from Carthage, are you going to murder us?” he began in tones\r\nmore indignant than terrified.\r\n\r\n“No, save as Heaven enjoins it!” quoth the master, clapping his hands to\r\nurge on the rowing stroke. “Pray, then, your Æolus, Hellene, to stiffen\r\nthe breeze.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, then, to Pluto, whelps,” bawled the undaunted fishmonger, “to give\r\nyou a snug berth in Orcus. Ha! but it’s a merry thought of you and all\r\nyour pretty lads stretched on crosses and waiting for the crows.”\r\n\r\nBut a violent screech came from Lampaxo, who had just comprehended the\r\nfate awaiting.\r\n\r\n“_Ai! ai!_ save me, fellow-Hellenes!” she bawled toward the penteconter,\r\n“a citizeness of Athens, the most patriotic woman in the city, slaughtered\r\nby Barbarians—”\r\n\r\n“Silence the squealing sow!” roared Hasdrubal. “They’ll hear her on the\r\nwar-ship. Aft with her and overboard at once.”\r\n\r\nBut as they dragged Lampaxo on the poop, her outcry rose to a tempest till\r\nLars the Etruscan clapped his hand upon her mouth. Her screaming stilled,\r\nbut his own outcry more than replaced it. In a twinkling the virago’s hard\r\nteeth closed over his fingers. Two ran from the oars to him. But the\r\nwoman, conscious that she fought for life or death, held fast. Curses,\r\nblows, even a dagger pried betwixt her lips—all bootless. She seemed as a\r\nthing possessed. And all the time the Etruscan howled in mortal agony.\r\n\r\nThe thin dagger, bent too hard, snapped betwixt her teeth. Lars’s clamour\r\ncould surely be heard on the penteconter. Again the breeze was falling.\r\n\r\nThey seized the fury’s throat, and pressed it till she turned black, but\r\nthe grip of her jaw only tightened.\r\n\r\n“_Attatai! attatai!_” groaned the victim, “forbear. Don’t throttle her.\r\nHer teeth are iron. They are biting through the bone. If you strangle her,\r\nthey will never relax. _Attatai! attatai!_”\r\n\r\n“Nip him tight, little wife,” called Phormio, for once regarding his\r\nspouse with supreme satisfaction. “It’s a dainty morsel you have in your\r\nmouth. Chew it well!”\r\n\r\nLampaxo’s attackers paused an instant, uncertain how to release the\r\nEtruscan. To their threats of torture the woman was deaf as the mainmast,\r\nand still the Etruscan screamed.\r\n\r\nGlaucon had stood perfectly passive during all this grim by-play. Once\r\nPhormio saw his fellow-captive’s face twist into a smile, but in the\r\nexcitement of the moment the fishmonger as well as the Carthaginians\r\nalmost forgot the Isthmionices, and Hib relaxed his grip and guard. Lars’s\r\nfinger was streaming red, when Hasdrubal threw away the steering-paddle in\r\na rage.\r\n\r\n“Silence her forever! The axe, Hib. Split her skull open!”\r\n\r\nThe axe lay at the Libyan’s feet. One instant, only one, betook his hands\r\nfrom the athlete’s wrists to seize the weapon, but in that instant the\r\nyell from all the crew drowned even the howls of Lars. Had any watched,\r\nthey might have seen all the muscles in the Alcmæonid’s glorious body\r\ncontract, might have seen the fire spring from his eyes as he put forth a\r\ngodlike might. Heracles and Athena Polias had been with him when he threw\r\nhis strength upon the bands that held his arms. The crushing of Lycon down\r\nhad been no feat like this. In a twinkling the cords about his wrists were\r\nsnapped. He swung his free hands in the air.\r\n\r\n“Athens!” he shouted, whilst the crew stood spellbound. “Hermione! Glaucon\r\nis still Glaucon!”\r\n\r\nHib had grasped the axe, but he never knew what smote him once behind the\r\near and sent him rolling lifeless against the bulwark. In an instant his\r\nbright weapon was swinging high above the athlete’s head. Glaucon stood\r\nterrible as Achilles before the cowering Trojans.\r\n\r\n“Woe! woe! he is Melkarth. We are lost men!” groaned the crew.\r\n\r\n“At him, fools!” bawled Hasdrubal, first to recover wits, “his feet are\r\nstill shackled.”\r\n\r\nBut whilst the master called to them, the axe dashed down upon the\r\nfetters, and one great stroke smote the coupling-link in twain. The\r\nAthenian stood a moment looking right and left, the axe dancing as a toy\r\nin his grasp, and a smile on his face inviting, “Prove me.”\r\n\r\nA javelin singing from the hand of Adherbal flew at him. An imperceptible\r\nbending of the body, a red streak on Glaucon’s naked side, and it dug into\r\nthe deck. Yet whilst it quivered, was out again and hurled through the\r\nCarthaginian’s breast and shoulders. He fell in a heap beside the Libyan.\r\n\r\nAnother howl from the sailors.\r\n\r\n“Not Melkarth, but Baal the Dragon-Slayer. We are lost. Who can contend\r\nwith him?”\r\n\r\n“Cowards!” thundered Hasdrubal, whipping the sword from his thigh, “do you\r\nnot know these three sniff our true business? If they live when the\r\npenteconter comes, it’s not prison but Sheol that’s waiting. Their lives\r\nor ours. One rush and we have this madman down!”\r\n\r\nBut their terrible adversary gave the master no time to gather his\r\nmyrmidons. One stroke of the axe had already released Phormio, who\r\nclutched the arms of his wife.\r\n\r\n“The cabin!” the ready-witted fishmonger commanded, and Lampaxo, scarce\r\nknowing what she did, released her ungentle hold on Lars and suffered her\r\nhusband to drag her down the ladder. Glaucon went last; no man loving\r\ndeath enough to come within reach of the axe. Hasdrubal saw his victims\r\nescaping under his eyes and groaned.\r\n\r\n“There is only one hatchway. We must force it. Darts, belaying-pins,\r\nballast stones—fling anything down. It’s for life or death!”\r\n\r\n“The penteconter is four furlongs away!” shrieked a sailor, growing gray\r\nunder his dark skin.\r\n\r\n“And Democrates’s despatches are hid in the cabin,” added Hiram,\r\nchattering. “If they do not go overboard, our deaths will be terrible.”\r\n\r\n“Hear, King Moloch!” called Hasdrubal, lifting his swarthy arms to heaven,\r\nthen striking them with his sword till the blood gushed down, “suffer us\r\nto escape this calamity and I vow thee even my daughter Tibaït,—a child in\r\nher tenth year,—she shall die in thy holy furnace a sacrifice.”\r\n\r\n“Hear, Baal! Hear, Moloch!” chorussed the crew; and gathering courage from\r\nnecessity seized boat-hooks, oars, dirks, and all other handy weapons for\r\ntheir attack.\r\n\r\nBut below the released prisoners had not been idle. Never—Glaucon knew\r\nit—had his brain been clearer, his invention more fertile than now, and\r\nPhormio was not too old to cease to be a valiant helper. The cabin was\r\nsmall. A few spears and swords stood in the rack about the mast. The\r\nathlete bolted the sliding hatch-cover, and tore down the weapons.\r\n\r\n“Release your wife,” he ordered Phormio; “yonder sea chest is strong. Drag\r\nit over to bar the hatch-ladder. Work as Titans if you hope for another\r\nsun.”\r\n\r\n“_Ai, ai, ai!_” screeched Lampaxo, who had released Lars’s fingers only to\r\nresume her din, “we all perish. They are hewing the hatch-cover with their\r\naxes. Hera preserve us! The wood splinters. We die.”\r\n\r\n“We have no time to die,” called the athlete, “but only to save Hellas.”\r\n\r\nA dozen blows beat the frail hatch-cover to splinters. A dark face with\r\ngrinning teeth showed itself. A heavy ballast stone grazed the athlete’s\r\nshoulder, but the intruder fell back with a gurgling in his throat, his\r\nhands clutching the empty air. Glaucon had sent a heavy spear clean\r\nthrough him.\r\n\r\nMore ballast stones, but the Titanic Alcmæonid had torn a mattress from a\r\nbunk, and held it as effective shield. By main force the others dragged\r\nthe chest across to the hatchway, making the entrance doubly narrow.\r\nVainly Hasdrubal stormed at his men to rush down boldly. They barely dared\r\nto fling stones and darts, so fast their adversary sped them back, and to\r\nthe mark.\r\n\r\n“A god! a god! We fight against Heaven!” bleated the seamen.\r\n\r\nTheir groans were answered by the screechings of Lampaxo through the\r\nport-hole and the taunts of Phormio.\r\n\r\n“Sing, sing, pretty Pisinoë, sweetest of the sirens,” tossed the\r\nfishmonger, playing his part at Glaucon’s side; “lure that dear\r\npenteconter a little nearer. And you, brave, gentle sirs, don’t try ‘to\r\nflay a skinned dog’ by thrusting down here. Your hands are just itching\r\nfor the nails, I warrant!”\r\n\r\nHasdrubal redoubled his vows to Moloch. In place of his daughter he\r\nsubstituted his son, though the lad was fourteen years old and the darling\r\nof his parents. But the god was not tempted even now. The attack on the\r\ncabin had called the sailors from the oars. The penteconter consequently\r\nhad gained fast upon them. The trireme behind was manning her other banks\r\nand drawing down apace. Hiram cast a hopeless glance toward her.\r\n\r\n“I know those ‘eyes’—those red hawse-holes—the _Nausicaä_. Come what may,\r\nThemistocles must not read the packet in the cabin. There is one chance.”\r\n\r\nHe approached the splintered hatchway and outstretched his\r\nhands—weaponless.\r\n\r\n“Ah, good and gracious Master Glaucon, and your honest friends, your gods\r\nof Hellas are very great and have delivered us, your poor slaves, into\r\nyour hands. Your friends approach. We will resist no longer. Come on deck;\r\nand when the ship is taken, entreat the navarch to be merciful and\r\ngenerous.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” spat Phormio, “you write your promises in water, or better in oil,\r\nblack-scaled viper. We know what time of day it is with us, and what for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nHiram saw Glaucon’s hand rise with a javelin, and shrank shivering.\r\n\r\n“They won’t hearken. All’s lost,” he whimpered, his smile becoming\r\nghastly.\r\n\r\n“Another rush, men!” pleaded Hasdrubal.\r\n\r\n“Lead the charge yourself, master!” retorted the seamen, sullenly.\r\n\r\nThe captain, swinging a cutlass, leaped down the bloodstained hatch. One\r\nmoment the desperate fury of his attack carried Glaucon backward. The two\r\nfought—sword against axe—in doubtful combat.\r\n\r\n“Follow! follow!” called Hasdrubal, dashing Phormio aside with the flat of\r\nhis blade. “I have him at last!” But just as Hiram was leading down a\r\ndozen more, the athlete’s axe swept past the sword, and fell like a\r\nmillstone on the master’s skull. He never screamed as he crashed upon the\r\nplanks.\r\n\r\nThis was enough. The seamen were at the end of their valour. If they must\r\ndie, they must die. What use resisting destiny?\r\n\r\nSlowly, slowly the moments crept for the three in the cabin. Even Lampaxo\r\ngrew still. They heard Hiram pleading frantically, vainly, for another\r\nattempt, and raving strange things about Democrates, Lycon, and the\r\nPersian. Then behind the _Bozra_ sounded the rushing of foam around a ram,\r\nthe bumping of fifty oars plying on the thole-pins. Into their sight shot\r\nthe penteconter, the brass glistening on her prow, the white blades\r\nleaping in rhythm. Marines in armour stood on the forecastle. A few arrows\r\npattered on the plankings of the _Bozra_. Her abject crew obeyed the\r\ndemand to surrender. Their helmsman pushed over the steering-paddle, and\r\nflung himself upon the deck. The sea-mouse went up into the wind. The\r\ngrappling-irons rattled over the bulwark. Glaucon heard the Phœnicians\r\nwhining, “Mercy! mercy!” as they embraced the boarders’ feet, then the\r\n_prōreus_, in hearty Attic, calling, “Secure the prisoners and rummage the\r\nprize!”\r\n\r\nGlaucon had suffered many things of late. He had faced intolerable\r\ncaptivity, immediate death. Now around his eyes swam hot mist. He fell\r\nupon a sea chest, and for a little cared not for anything around, whilst\r\ndown his cheeks would flow the tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE READING OF THE RIDDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nA hard chase. The rowers of the penteconter were well winded before they\r\ncaught the _Bozra_. A merchantman making for Asia was, however, undoubted\r\nprize; the luckless crew could be sold in the Agora, the cargo of oil,\r\nfish, and pottery was likewise of value. Cimon was standing on his poop,\r\nlistening to the report of his _prōreus_.\r\n\r\n“We’re all a mina richer for the race, captain, and they’ve some jars of\r\ntheir good Numidian wine in the forecastle.”\r\n\r\nBut here a seaman interrupted, staring blankly.\r\n\r\n“_Kyrie_, here’s a strange prize. Five men lie dead on the deck. The\r\nplanks are bloody. In the cabin are two men and a woman. All three seem\r\nmad. They are Greeks. They keep us out, and bawl, ‘The navarch! show us\r\nthe navarch, or Hellas is lost.’ And one of them—as true as that I sucked\r\nmy mother’s milk—is Phormio—”\r\n\r\n“Phormio the fishmonger,”—Cimon dropped his steering oar,—“on a\r\nCarthaginian ship? You’re mad yourself, man.”\r\n\r\n“See with your own eyes, captain. They’ll yield to none save you. The\r\nprisoners are howling that one of these men is a giant.”\r\n\r\nFor the active son of Miltiades to leap from bulwark to bulwark took an\r\ninstant. Only when he showed himself did the three in the cabin scramble\r\nup the ladder, covered with blood, the red lines of the fetters marked\r\ninto wrist and ankle. Lampaxo had thrown her dress over her head and was\r\nscreaming still, despite assurances. The third Hellene’s face was hid\r\nunder a tangle of hair. But Cimon knew the fishmonger. Many a morning had\r\nhe haggled with him merrily for a fine mackerel or tunny, and the navarch\r\nrecoiled in horror at his fellow-citizen’s plight.\r\n\r\n“Infernal gods! You a prisoner here? Where is this cursed vessel from?”\r\n\r\n“From Trœzene,” gasped the refugee; “if you love Athens and Hellas—”\r\n\r\nHe turned just in time to fling an arm about Hiram, who—carelessly\r\nguarded—was gliding down the hatchway.\r\n\r\n“Seize that viper, bind, torture; he knows all. Make him tell or Hellas is\r\nlost!”\r\n\r\n“Control yourself, friend,” adjured Cimon, sorely perplexed, while Hiram\r\nstruggled and began tugging out a crooked knife, before two brawny seamen\r\nnipped him fast and disarmed.\r\n\r\n“Ah! you carrion meat,” shouted Phormio, shaking his fists under the\r\nhelpless creature’s nose. “Honest men have their day at last. There’s a\r\ngay hour coming before Zeus claps the lid over you in Tartarus.”\r\n\r\n“Peace,” commanded the navarch, who betwixt Phormio’s shouts, Lampaxo’s\r\nhowls, and Hiram’s moans was at his wit’s end. “Has no one on this ship\r\nkept aboard his senses?”\r\n\r\n“If you will be so good, sir captain,” the third Hellene at last broke his\r\nsilence, “you will hearken to me.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“The _prōreus_ of the _Alcyone_ of Melos. More of myself hereafter. But if\r\nyou love the weal of Hellas, demand of this Hiram where he concealed the\r\ntreasonable despatches he received at Trœzene and now has aboard.”\r\n\r\n“Hiram? O Lord Apollo, I recognize the snake! The one that was always\r\ngliding around Lycon at the Isthmus. If despatches he has, I know the way\r\nto get them. Now, black-hearted Cyclops,”—Cimon’s tone was not\r\ngentle,—“where are your papers?”\r\n\r\nHiram had turned gray as a corpse, but his white teeth came together.\r\n\r\n“Phormio is mistaken. Your slave has none.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” threw out Cimon, “I can smell your lies like garlic. Silent still?\r\nGood, see how I am better than Asclepius. I make the dumb talk by a\r\nmiracle. A cord and belaying-pin, Naon.”\r\n\r\nThe seaman addressed passed a cord about the Phœnician’s forehead with a\r\nfearful dexterity, and put the iron pin at the back of the skull.\r\n\r\n“Twist!” commanded Cimon. Two mariners gripped the victim’s arms. Naon\r\npressed the cord tighter, tighter. A beastlike groan came through the lips\r\nof the Phœnician. His beady eyes started from his head, but he did not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“Again,” thundered the navarch, and as the cord stretched a howl of mortal\r\nagony escaped the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Pity! Mercy! My head bursts. I will tell!”\r\n\r\n“Tell quick, or we’ll squeeze your brains out. Relax a little, Naon.”\r\n\r\n“In the boat mast.” Hiram spit the words out one by one. “In the cabin.\r\nThere is a peg. Pull it out. The mast is hollowed. You will find the\r\npapers. Woe! woe! cursed the day I was born. Cursed my mother for bearing\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe miserable creature fell to the deck, pressing his hands to his temples\r\nand moaning in agony. No one heeded him now. Cimon himself ran below to\r\nthe mast, and wrenched the peg from its socket. Papyrus sheets were there,\r\nrolled compactly, covered with writing and sealed. The navarch turned over\r\nthe packet curiously, then to the amazement of the sailors seemed to\r\nstagger against the mast. He was as pale as Hiram. He thrust the packet\r\ninto the hands of his _prōreus_, who stood near.\r\n\r\n“What make you of this seal? As you fear Athena, tell the truth.”\r\n\r\n“You need not adjure me so, captain. The device is simple: Theseus slaying\r\nthe Minotaur.”\r\n\r\n“And who, in Zeus’s name, do you know in Athens who uses a seal like\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nSilence for a moment, then the _prōreus_ himself was pale.\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency does not mean—”\r\n\r\n“Democrates!” cried the trembling navarch.\r\n\r\n“And why not Democrates?” The words came from the released prisoner, who\r\nhad been so silent, but who had glided down and stood at Cimon’s elbow. He\r\nspoke in a changed voice now; again the navarch was startled.\r\n\r\n“Is Themistocles on the _Nausicaä_?” asked the stranger, whilst Cimon\r\ngazed on him spellbound, asking if he himself were growing mad.\r\n\r\n“Yes—but your voice, your face, your manner—my head is dizzy.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger touched him gently on the hand.\r\n\r\n“Have I so changed, you quite forget me, Cimon?”\r\n\r\nThe son of Miltiades was a strong man. He had looked on Hiram’s tortures\r\nwith a laugh. To his own death he would have gone with no eyelash\r\ntrembling. But now the rest saw him blench; then with a cry, at once of\r\nwonder and inexpressible joy, his arms closed round the tattered outlaw’s\r\nneck. Treason or no treason—what matter! He forgot all save that before\r\nhim was his long-time comrade.\r\n\r\n“My friend! My boyhood’s friend!” and so for many times they kissed.\r\n\r\nThe _Nausicaä_ had followed the chase at easy distance, ready with aid in\r\ncase the _Bozra_ resisted. Themistocles was in his cabin with Simonides,\r\nwhen Cimon and Glaucon came to him. The admiral heard his young navarch’s\r\nreport, then took the unopened packet and requested Cimon and the poet to\r\nwithdraw. As their feet sounded on the ladder in the companionway,\r\nThemistocles turned on the outlaw, it seemed, fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Tell your story.”\r\n\r\nGlaucon told it: the encounter on the hillside at Trœzene, the seizure in\r\nPhormio’s house, the coming of Democrates and his boasts over the\r\ncaptives, the voyage and the pursuing. The son of Neocles never hastened\r\nthe recital, though once or twice he widened it by an incisive question.\r\nAt the end he demanded:—\r\n\r\n“And does Phormio confirm all this?”\r\n\r\n“All. Question him.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! He’s a truthful man in everything save the price of fish. Now let\r\nus open the packet.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles was exceeding deliberate. He drew his dagger and pried the\r\nwrapper open without breaking the seals or tearing the papyrus. He turned\r\nthe strips of paper carefully one by one, opened a casket, and drew thence\r\na written sheet which he compared painfully with those before him.\r\n\r\n“The same hand,” his remark in undertone.\r\n\r\nHe was so calm that a stranger would have thought him engaged with routine\r\nbusiness. Many of the sheets he simply lifted, glanced at, laid down\r\nagain. They did not seem to interest. So through half the roll, but the\r\noutlaw, watching patiently, at last saw he eyebrows of the son of Neocles\r\npressing ever closer,—sign that the inscrutable brain was at its fateful\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAt last he uttered one word, “Cipher.”\r\n\r\nA sheet lay before him covered with broken words and phrases—seemingly\r\nwithout meaning—but the admiral knew the secret of the Spartan _scytalē_,\r\nthe “cipher wood.” Forth from his casket came a number of rounded sticks\r\nof varying lengths. On one after another he wound the sheet spirally until\r\nat the fifth trial the scattered words came together. He read with ease.\r\nThen Themistocles’s brows grew closer than before. He muttered softly in\r\nhis beard. But still he said nothing aloud. He read the cipher sheet\r\nthrough once, twice; it seemed thrice. Other sheets he fingered\r\ndelicately, as though he feared the touch of venom. All without haste, but\r\nat the end, when Themistocles arose from his seat, the outlaw trembled.\r\nMany things he had seen, but never a face so changed. The admiral was\r\nneither flushed nor pale. But ten years seemed added to those lines above\r\nhis eyes. His cheeks were hollowed. Was it fancy that put the gray into\r\nhis beard and hair? Slowly he rose; slowly he ordered the marine on guard\r\noutside the cabin to summon Simonides, Cimon, and all the officers of the\r\nflag-ship. They trooped hither and filled the narrow cabin—fifteen or more\r\nhale, handsome Athenians, intent on the orders of the admiral. Were they\r\nto dash at once for Samos and surprise the Persian? Or what other\r\nadventure waited? The breeze had died. The gray breast of the Ægean rocked\r\nthe _Nausicaä_ softly. The thranites of the upper oar bank were alone on\r\nthe benches, and stroking the great trireme along to a singsong chant\r\nabout Amphitrite and the Tritons. On the poop above two sailors were\r\ngrumbling lest the penteconter’s people get all the booty of the _Bozra_.\r\nGlaucon heard their grunts and complainings whilst he looked on\r\nThemistocles’s awful face.\r\n\r\nThe officers ranged themselves and saluted stiffly. Themistocles stood\r\nbefore them, his hands closed over the packet. The first time he started\r\nto speak his lips closed desperately. The silence grew awkward. Then the\r\nadmiral gave his head a toss, and drew his form together as a runner\r\nbefore a race.\r\n\r\n“Democrates is a traitor. Unless Athena shows us mercy, Hellas is lost.”\r\n\r\n“Democrates is a traitor!”\r\n\r\nThe cry from the startled men rang through the ship. The rowers ceased\r\ntheir chant and their stroking. Themistocles beckoned angrily for silence.\r\n\r\n“I did not call you down to wail and groan.” He never raised his voice;\r\nhis calmness made him terrible. But now the questions broke loose as a\r\nflood.\r\n\r\n“When? How? Declare.”\r\n\r\n“Peace, men of Athens; you conquered the Persian at Salamis, conquer now\r\nyourselves. Harken to this cipher. Then to our task and prove our comrades\r\ndid not die in vain.”\r\n\r\nYet despite him men wept on one another’s shoulders as became true\r\nHellenes, whilst Themistocles, whose inexorable face never relaxed,\r\nrewound the papyrus on the cipher stick and read in hard voice the words\r\nof doom.\r\n\r\n“This is the letter secreted on the Carthaginian. The hand is\r\nDemocrates’s, the seals are his. Give ear.\r\n\r\n“Democrates the Athenian to Tigranes, commander of the hosts of Xerxes on\r\nthe coasts of Asia, greeting:—Understand, dear Persian, that Lycon and I\r\nas well as the other friends of the king among the Hellenes are prepared\r\nto bring all things to pass in a way right pleasing to your master. Even\r\nnow I depart from Trœzene to join the army of the allied Hellenes in\r\nBœotia, and, the gods helping, we cannot fail. Lycon and I will contrive\r\nto separate the Athenians and Spartans from their other allies, to force\r\nthem to give battle, and at the crisis cause the divisions under our\r\npersonal commands to retire, breaking the phalanx and making Mardonius’s\r\nvictory certain.\r\n\r\n“For your part, excellent Tigranes, you must avoid the Hellenic ships at\r\nDelos and come back to Mardonius with your fleet ready to second him at\r\nonce after his victory, which will be speedy; then with your aid he can\r\nreadily turn the wall at the Isthmus. I send also letters written, as it\r\nwere, in the hand of Themistocles. See that they fall into the hands of\r\nthe other Greek admirals. They will breed more hurt amongst the Hellenes\r\nthan you can accomplish with all your ships. I send, likewise, lists of\r\nsuch Athenians and Spartans as are friendly to his Majesty, also memoranda\r\nof such secret plans of the Greeks as have come to my knowledge.\r\n\r\n“From Trœzene, given into the hands of Hiram on the second of\r\nMetageitnion, in the archonship of Xanthippus. _Chaire!_”\r\n\r\nThemistocles ceased. No man spoke a word. It was as if a god had flung a\r\nbolt from heaven. What use to cry against it? Then, in an ominously low\r\nvoice, Simonides asked a question.\r\n\r\n“What are these letters which purport to come from your pen,\r\nThemistocles?”\r\n\r\nThe admiral unrolled another papyrus, and as he looked thereon his fine\r\nface contracted with loathing.\r\n\r\n“Let another read. I am made to pour contempt and ridicule upon my\r\nfellow-captains. I am made to boast ‘when the war ends, I will be tyrant\r\nof Athens.’ A thousand follies and wickednesses are put in my mouth. Were\r\nthis letter true, I were the vilest wretch escaping Orcus. Since forged—”\r\nhis hands clinched—“by that man, that man whom I have trusted, loved,\r\ncherished, called ‘younger brother,’ ‘oldest son’—” He spat in rising fury\r\nand was still.\r\n\r\n“ ‘Fain would I grip his liver in my teeth,’ ” cried the little poet, even\r\nin storm and stress not forgetting his Homer. And the howl from the\r\nman-of-war’s men was as the howl of beasts desiring their prey. But the\r\nadmiral’s burst of anger ended. He stood again an image of calm power. The\r\nvoice that had charmed the thousands rang forth in its strength and\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\n“Men of Athens, this is no hour for windy rage. Else I should rage the\r\nmost, for who is more wronged than I? One whom we loved is fallen—later\r\nlet us weep for him. One whom we trusted is false—later punish him. But\r\nnow the work is neither to weep nor to punish, but to save Hellas. A great\r\nbattle impends in Bœotia. Except the Zeus of our sires and Athena of the\r\nPure Eyes be with us, we are men without home, without fatherland.\r\nPausanias and Aristeides must be warned. The _Nausicaä_ is the\r\n‘Salaminia,’—the swiftest trireme in the fleet. Ours must be the deed, and\r\nours the glory. Enough of this—the men must hear, and then to the oars.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles had changed from despair to a triumph note. There was uplift\r\neven to look upon him. He strode before all his lieutenants up and out\r\nupon the poop. The long tiers of benches and the gangways filled with\r\nrowers peered up at him. They had seen their officers gather in the cabin,\r\nand Dame Rumour, subtlest of Zeus’s messengers, had breathed\r\n“ill-tidings.” Now the admiral stood forth, and in few words told all the\r\nheavy tale. Again a great shout, whilst the bronzed men groaned on the\r\nbenches.\r\n\r\n“Democrates is a traitor!”\r\n\r\nA deity had fallen from their Olympus; the darling of the Athenians’s\r\ndemocracy was sunk to vilest of the vile. But the admiral knew how to play\r\non their two hundred hearts better than Orpheus upon his lyre. Again the\r\nnote changed from despair to incitement, and when at last he called, “And\r\ncan we cross the Ægean as never trireme crossed and pluck back Hellas from\r\nher fate?” thalamite, zygite, and thranite rose, tossing their brawny arms\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\n“_We can!_”\r\n\r\nThen Themistocles folded his own arms and smiled. He felt the god was\r\nstill with him.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nYet, eager as was the will, they could not race forth instantly. Orders\r\nmust be written to Xanthippus, the Athenian vice-admiral far away, bidding\r\nhim at all hazards to keep the Persian fleet near Samos. Cimon was long in\r\nprivy council with Themistocles in the state cabin. At the same time a\r\nprisoner was passed aboard the _Nausicaä_, not gently bound,—Hiram, a\r\nprecious witness, before the dogs had their final meal on him. But the\r\nrest of the _Bozra’s_ people found a quicker release. The penteconter’s\r\npeople decided their fate with a yell.\r\n\r\n“Sell such harpies for slaves? The money would stink through our pouches!”\r\n\r\nSo two by two, tied neck to neck and heel to heel, the wretches were flung\r\noverboard, “because we lack place and wood to crucify you,” called the\r\n_Nausicaä’s_ governor, as he pushed the last pair off into the leaden\r\nsea,—for the day was distant when the destruction of such Barbarian rogues\r\nwould weigh even on tender consciences.\r\n\r\nSo the Carthaginians ceased from troubling, but before the penteconter and\r\nthe _Bozra_ bore away to join the remaining fleet, another deed was done\r\nin sight of all three ships. For whilst Themistocles was with Cimon,\r\nSimonides and Sicinnus had taken Glaucon to the _Nausicaä’s_ forecastle.\r\nNow as the penteconter was casting off, again he came to view, and the\r\nshout that greeted him was not of fear this time, but wonder and delight.\r\nThe Alcmæonid was clean-shaven, his hair clipped close, the black dye even\r\nin a manner washed away. He had flung off the rough seaman’s dress, and\r\nstood forth in all his godlike beauty.\r\n\r\nBefore all men Cimon, coming from the cabin, ran and kissed him once more,\r\nwhilst the rowers clapped their hands.\r\n\r\n“Apollo—it is Delian Apollo! Glaucon the Beautiful lives again. _Io! Io!\r\npæan!_”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” spoke Themistocles, in a burst of gladness. “The gods take one\r\nfriend, they restore another. Œdipus has read the sphinx’s riddle. Honour\r\nthis man, for he is worthy of honour through Hellas!”\r\n\r\nThe officers ran to the athlete, after them the sailors. They covered his\r\nface and hands with kisses. He seemed escaped the Carthaginian to perish\r\nin the embrace of his countrymen. Never was his blush more boyish, more\r\ndivine. Then a bugle-blast sent every man to his station. Cimon leaped\r\nacross to his smaller ship. The rowers of the _Nausicaä_ ran out their\r\noars, the hundred and seventy blades trailed in the water. Every man took\r\na long breath and fixed his eyes on the admiral standing on the poop. He\r\nheld a golden goblet set with turquoise, and filled with the blood-red\r\nPramnian wine. Loudly Themistocles prayed.\r\n\r\n“Zeus of Olympus and Dodona, Zeus Orchios, rewarder of the oath-breaker,\r\nto whom the Hellenes do not vainly pray, and thou Athena of the Pure Eyes,\r\ngive ear. Make our ship swift, our arms strong, our hearts bold. Hold back\r\nthe battle that we come not too late. Grant that we confound the guilty,\r\nput to flight the Barbarian, recompense the traitor. So to you and all\r\nother holy gods whose love is for the righteous we will proffer prayer and\r\nsacrifice forever. Amen.”\r\n\r\nHe poured out the crimson liquor; far into the sea he flung the golden\r\ncup.\r\n\r\n“Heaven speed you!” shouted from the penteconter. Themistocles nodded. The\r\n_keleustes_ smote his gavel upon the sounding-board. The triple oar bank\r\nrose as one and plunged into the foam. A long “h-a!” went up from the\r\nbenches. The race to save Hellas was begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE RACE TO SAVE HELLAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chase had cost the Athenians dear. Before the _Bozra_ had submitted to\r\nher fate, she had led the _Nausicaä_ and her consort well down into the\r\nsouthern Ægean. A little more and they would have lifted the shaggy\r\nheadlands of Crete. The route before the great trireme was a long one. Two\r\nthousand stadia,(13) as the crow flies, sundered them from the Euripus,\r\nthe nearest point whence they could despatch a runner to Pausanias and\r\nAristeides; and what with the twistings around the scattered Cyclades the\r\nroute was one-fourth longer. But men had ceased reckoning distance. Their\r\nhearts were in the flying oars, and at first the _Nausicaä_ ran leaping\r\nacross the waves as leaps the dolphin,—the long gleaming blades springing\r\nlike shuttles in the hands of the ready crew. They had taken from the\r\npenteconter all her spare rowers, and to make the great ship bound over\r\nthe steel-gray deep was children’s play. “We must save Hellas, and we\r\ncan!” That was the thought of all from Themistocles to the meanest\r\nthranite.\r\n\r\nSo at the beginning when the task seemed light and hands were strong. The\r\nbreeze that had betrayed the _Bozra_ ever sank lower. Presently it died\r\naltogether. The sails they set hung limp on the mast. The navarch had them\r\nfurled. The sea spread out before them, a glassy, leaden-coloured floor;\r\nthe waves roaring in their wake faded in a wide ripple far behind. To\r\nhearten his men the _keleustes_ ceased his beating on the sounding-board,\r\nand clapped lips to his pipe. The whole trireme chorussed the familiar\r\nsong together:—\r\n\r\n  “Fast and more fast\r\n  O’er the foam-spray we’re passed.\r\n  And our creaking sails swell\r\n  To the swift-breathing blast,\r\n  For Poseidon’s wild steeds\r\n  With their manifold feet,\r\n  Like a hundred white nymphs\r\n  On the blue sea-floor fleet.\r\n  And we wake as we go\r\n  Gray old Phorcys below,\r\n  Whilst on shell-clustered trumpets\r\n    The loud Tritons blow!\r\n    The loud Tritons blow!\r\n\r\n  “All of Æolus’s train\r\n  Springing o’er the blue main\r\n  To our pæans reply\r\n  With their long, long refrain;\r\n  And the sea-folk upleap\r\n  From their dark weedy caves;\r\n  With a clear, briny laugh\r\n  They dance over the waves;\r\n  Now their mistress below,—\r\n  See bright Thetis go,\r\n  As she leads the mad revels,\r\n    While loud Tritons blow!\r\n    While loud Tritons blow!\r\n\r\n  “With the foam gliding white,\r\n  Where the light flash is bright.\r\n  We feel the live keel\r\n  Leaping on with delight;\r\n  And in melody wild\r\n  Men and Nereids and wind\r\n  Sing and laugh all their praise,\r\n  To the bluff seagods kind;\r\n  Whilst deep down below,\r\n  Where no storm blasts may go,\r\n  On their care-charming trumpets\r\n    The loud Tritons blow,\r\n    The loud Tritons blow.”\r\n\r\nBravely thus for a while, but at last Themistocles, watching from the poop\r\nwith eyes that nothing evaded, saw how here and there the dip of the\r\nblades was weakening, here and there a breast was heaving rapidly, a mouth\r\nwas panting for air.\r\n\r\n“The relief,” he ordered. And the spare rowers ran gladly to the places of\r\nthose who seemed the weariest. Only a partial respite. Fifty\r\nsupernumeraries were a poor stop-gap for the one hundred and seventy. Only\r\nthe weakest could be relieved, and even those wept and pled to continue at\r\nthe benches a little longer. The thunderous threat of Ameinias, that he\r\nwho refused a proffered relief must stand all day by the mast with an iron\r\nanchor on his shoulder, alone sufficed to make the malcontents give place.\r\nYet after a little while the singing died. Breath was too precious to\r\nwaste. It was mockery to troll of “Æolus’s winds” whilst the sea was one\r\nmotionless mirror of gray. The monotonous “beat,” “beat” of the\r\n_keleustes’s_ hammer, and the creaking of the oars in their leathered\r\nholes alone broke the stillness that reigned through the length of the\r\ntrireme. The penteconter and her prize had long since faded below the\r\nhorizon. With almost wistful eyes men watched the islets as they glided\r\npast one after another, Thera now, then Ios, and presently the greater\r\nParos and Naxos lay before them. They relieved oars whenever possible. The\r\nsupernumeraries needed no urging after their scanty rest to spring to the\r\nplace of him who was fainting, but hardly any man spoke a word.\r\n\r\nThe first time the relief went in Glaucon had stepped forward.\r\n\r\n“I am strong. I am able to pull an oar,” he had cried almost angrily when\r\nThemistocles laid his hand upon him, but the admiral would have none of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“You shall not. Sooner will I go on to the bench myself. You have been\r\nthrough the gates of Tartarus these last days, and need all your strength.\r\nAre you not the Isthmionices,—the swiftest runner in Hellas?”\r\n\r\nThen Glaucon had stepped back and said no more. He knew now for what\r\nThemistocles reserved him,—that after the _Nausicaä_ made land he must\r\nrun, as never man ran before across wide Bœotia to bear the tidings to\r\nPausanias.\r\n\r\nThey were betwixt Paros and Naxos at last. Wine and barley cakes soaked in\r\noil were passed among the men at the oars. They ate without leaving the\r\nbenches. And still the sea spread out glassy, motionless, and the pennon\r\nhung limp on the mainmast. The _keleustes_ slowed his beatings, but the\r\nmen did not obey him. No whipped cattle were they, such as rowed the\r\ntriremes of Phœnicia, but freemen born, sons of Athens, who called it joy\r\nto die for her in time of need. Therefore despite the _keleustes’s_ beats,\r\ndespite Themistocles’s command, the rowing might not slacken. And the\r\nblack wave around the _Nausicaä’s_ bow sang its monotonous music.\r\n\r\nBut Themistocles ever turned his face eastward, until men thought he was\r\nawaiting some foe in chase, and presently—just as a rower among the\r\nzygites fell back with the blood gushing from mouth and nostrils—the\r\nadmiral pointed his finger toward the sky-line of the morning.\r\n\r\n“Look! Athena is with us!”\r\n\r\nAnd for the first time in hours those panting, straining men let the hot\r\noar butts slip from their hands, even trail in the darkling water, whilst\r\nthey rose, looked, and blessed their gods.\r\n\r\nIt was coming, the strong kind Eurus out of the south and east. They could\r\nsee the black ripple springing over the glassy sea; they could hear the\r\nsinging of the cordage; they could catch the sweet sniff of the brine.\r\nAdmiral and rower lifted their hands together at this manifest favour of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n“Poseidon is with us! Athena is with us! Æolus is with us! We can save\r\nHellas!”\r\n\r\nSoon the sun burst forth above the mist. All the wide ocean floor was\r\nadance with sparkling wavelets. No need of Ameinias’s lusty call to bend\r\nagain the sails. The smaller canvas on the foremast and great spread on\r\nthe mainmast were bellying to the piping gale. A fair wind, but no storm.\r\nThe oars were but helpers now,—men laughed, hugged one another as boys,\r\nwept as girls, and let the benignant wind gods labour for them. Delos the\r\nHoly they passed, and Tenos, and soon the heights of Andros lifted, as the\r\nship with its lading of fate flew over the island-strewn sea. At last,\r\njust as the day was leaving them, they saw Helios going down into the\r\nfire-tinged waves in a parting burst of glory. Darkness next, but the\r\nkindly wind failed not. Through the night no man on that trireme\r\nslumbered. Breeze or calm, he who had an obol’s weight of power spent it\r\nat the oars.\r\n\r\nLong after midnight Themistocles and Glaucon clambered the giddy cordage\r\nto the ship’s top above the swelling mainsail. On the narrow platform,\r\nwith the stars above, the dim tracery of the wide sail, the still dimmer\r\ntracery of the long ship below, they seemed transported to another world.\r\nFar beneath by the glimmer of the lanterns they saw the rowers swaying at\r\ntheir toil. In the wake the phosphorous bubbles ran away, opalescent\r\ngleams springing upward, as if torches of Doris and her dancing Nereids.\r\nSo much had admiral and outlaw lived through this day they had thought\r\nlittle of themselves. Now calmer thought returned. Glaucon could tell of\r\nmany things he had heard and thought, of the conversation overheard the\r\nmorning before Salamis, of what Phormio had related during the weary\r\ncaptivity in the hold of the _Bozra_. Themistocles pondered long. Yet for\r\nGlaucon when standing even on that calm pinnacle the trireme must creep\r\nover the deep too slowly.\r\n\r\n“O give me wings, Father Zeus,” was his prayer; “yes, the wings of Icarus.\r\nLet me fly but once to confound the traitor and deliver thy Hellas,—after\r\nthat, like Icarus let me fall. I am content to die.”\r\n\r\nBut Themistocles pressed close against his side. “Ask for no wings,”—in\r\nthe admiral’s voice was a tremor not there when he sped confidence through\r\nthe crew,—“if it be destined we save Hellas, it is destined; if we are to\r\ndie, we die. ‘No man of woman born, coward or brave, can shun the fate\r\nassigned.’ Hector said that to Andromache, and the Trojan was right. But\r\nwe shall save Hellas. Zeus and Athena are great gods. They did not give us\r\nglory at Salamis to make that glory tenfold vain. We shall save Hellas.\r\nYet I have fear—”\r\n\r\n“Of what, then?”\r\n\r\n“Fear that Themistocles will be too merciful to be just. Ah! pity me.”\r\n\r\n“I understand—Democrates.”\r\n\r\n“I pray he may escape to the Persians, or that Ares may slay him in fair\r\nbattle. If not—”\r\n\r\n“What will you do?”\r\n\r\nThe admiral’s hold upon the younger Athenian’s arm tightened.\r\n\r\n“I will prove that Aristeides is not the only man in Hellas who deserves\r\nthe name of ‘Just.’ When I was young, my tutor would predict great things\r\nof me. ‘You will be nothing small, Themistocles, but great, whether for\r\ngood or ill, I know not,—but great you will be.’ And I have always\r\nstruggled upward. I have always prospered. I am the first man in Hellas. I\r\nhave set my will against all the power of Persia. Zeus willing, I shall\r\nconquer. But the Olympians demand their price. For saving Hellas I must\r\npay—Democrates. I loved him.”\r\n\r\nThe two men stood in silence long, whilst below the oars and the rushing\r\nwater played their music. At last the admiral relaxed his hand on Glaucon.\r\n\r\n“_Eu!_ They will call me ‘Saviour of Hellas’ if all goes well. I shall be\r\ngreater than Solon, or Lycurgus, or Periander, and in return I must do\r\njustice to a friend. Fair recompense!”\r\n\r\nThe laugh of the son of Neocles was harsher than a cry. The other answered\r\nnothing. Themistocles set his foot on the ladder.\r\n\r\n“I must return to the men. I would go to an oar, only they will not let\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe admiral left Glaucon for a moment alone. All around him was the\r\nnight,—the stars, the black æther, the blacker sea,—but he was not lonely.\r\nHe felt as when in the foot-race he turned for the last burst toward the\r\ngoal. One more struggle, one supreme summons of strength and will, and\r\nafter that the triumph and the rest.—Hellas, Athens, Hermione, he was\r\nspeeding back to all. Once again all the things past floated out of the\r\ndream-world and before him,—the wreck, the lotus-eating at Sardis,\r\nThermopylæ, Salamis, the agony on the _Bozra_. Now came the end, the end\r\npromised in the moment of vision whilst he pulled the boat at Salamis.\r\nWhat was it? He tried not to ask. Enough it was to be the end. He, like\r\nThemistocles, had supreme confidence that the treason would be thwarted.\r\nThe gods were cruel, but not so cruel that after so many deliverances they\r\nwould crush him at the last. “The miracles of Zeus are never wrought in\r\nvain.” Had not Zeus wrought miracles for him once and twice? The proverb\r\nwas great comfort.\r\n\r\nSuddenly whilst he built his palace of phantasy, a cry from the foreship\r\ndissolved it.\r\n\r\n“Attica, Attica, hail, all hail!”\r\n\r\nHe saw upon the sky-line the dim tracery of the Athenian headlands “like a\r\nshield laid on the misty deep.” Again men were springing from the oars,\r\nlaughing, weeping, embracing, whilst under the clear, unflagging wind the\r\n_Nausicaä_ sped up the narrowing strait betwixt Eubœa and the mainland.\r\nDawn glowed at last, unveiling the brown Attic shoreline with Pentelicus\r\nthe marble-fretted and all his darker peers.\r\n\r\nHour by hour they ran onward. They skirted the long low coast of Eubœa to\r\nthe starboard. They saw Marathon and its plain of fair memories stretching\r\nto port, and now the strait grew closer yet, and it needed all the\r\ngovernor’s skill at the steering-oars to keep the _Nausicaä_ from the\r\nthreatening rocks. Marathon was behind at last. The trireme rounded the\r\nlast promontory; the bay grew wider; the prow was set more to westward.\r\nEvery man—the faintest—struggled back to his oar if he had left it—this\r\nwas the last hundred stadia to Oropus, and after that the _Nausicaä_ might\r\ndo no more. Once again the _keleustes_ piped, and his note was swift and\r\nfeverish. The blades shot faster, faster, as the trireme raced down the\r\nsandy shore of the Attic “Diacria.” Once in the strait they saw a\r\nbrown-sailed fisherboat, and the helm swerved enough to bring her within\r\nhail. The fishermen stared at the flying trireme and her straining,\r\nwide-eyed men.\r\n\r\n“Has there been a battle?” cried Ameinias.\r\n\r\n“Not yet. We are from Styra on Eubœa; we expect the news daily. The armies\r\nare almost together.”\r\n\r\n“And where are they?”\r\n\r\n“Near to Platæa.”\r\n\r\nThat was all. The war-ship left the fishermen rocking in her wake, but\r\nagain Themistocles drew his eyebrows close together, while Glaucon\r\ntightened the buckle on his belt. Platæa,—the name meant that the courier\r\nmust traverse the breadth of Bœotia, and with the armies face to face how\r\nlong would Zeus hold back the battle? How long indeed, with Democrates and\r\nLycon intent on bringing battle to pass? The ship was more than ever\r\nsilent as she rushed on the last stretch of her course. More men fell at\r\nthe oars with blood upon their faces. The supernumeraries tossed them\r\naside like logs of wood, and leaped upon their benches. Themistocles had\r\nvanished with Simonides in the cabin; all knew their work,—preparing\r\nletters to Aristeides and Pausanias to warn of the bitter truth. Then the\r\nhaven at last: the white-stuccoed houses of Oropus clustering down upon\r\nthe shore, the little mole, a few doltish peasants by the landing gaping\r\nat the great trireme. No others greeted them, for the terror of\r\nMardonius’s Tartar raiders had driven all but the poorest to some safe\r\nshelter. The oars slipped from numb fingers; the anchor plunged into the\r\ngreen water; the mainsail rattled down the mast. Men sat on the benches\r\nmotionless, gulping down the clear air. They had done their part. The rest\r\nlay in the hands of the gods, and in the speed of him who two days since\r\nthey had called “Glaucon the Traitor.” The messenger came from the cabin,\r\nhalf stripped, on his head a felt skullcap, on his feet high hunter’s\r\nboots laced up to the knees. He had never shone in more noble beauty. The\r\ncrew watched Themistocles place a papyrus roll in Glaucon’s belt, and\r\npress his mouth to the messenger’s ear in parting admonition. Glaucon gave\r\nhis right hand to Themistocles, his left to Simonides. Fifty men were\r\nready to man the pinnace to take him ashore. On the beach the _Nausicaä’s_\r\npeople saw him stand an instant, as he turned his face upward to the\r\n“dawn-facing” gods of Hellas, praying for strength and swiftness.\r\n\r\n“Apollo speed you!” called two hundred after him. He answered from the\r\nbeach with a wave of his beautiful arms. A moment later he was hid behind\r\na clump of olives. The _Nausicaä’s_ people knew the ordeal before him, but\r\nmany a man said Glaucon had the easier task. He could run till life failed\r\nhim. They now could only fold their hands and wait.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was long past noon when Glaucon left the desolate village of Oropus\r\nbehind him. The day was hot, but after the manner of Greece not sultry,\r\nand the brisk breeze was stirring on the hill slopes. Over the distant\r\nmountains hung a tint of deep violet. It was early in Bœdromion.(14) The\r\nfields—where indeed the Barbarian cavalry men had not deliberately burned\r\nthem—were seared brown by the long dry summer. Here and there great black\r\ncrows were picking, and a red fox would whisk out of a thicket and go with\r\nlong bounds across the unharvested fields to some safer refuge. Glaucon\r\nknew his route. Three hundred and sixty stadia lay before him, and those\r\nnot over the well-beaten course in the gymnasium, but by rocky goat trails\r\nand by-paths that made his task no easier. He started off slowly. He was\r\ntoo good an athlete to waste his speed by one fierce burst at the outset.\r\nAt first his road was no bad one, for he skirted the willow-hung Asopus,\r\nthe boundary stream betwixt Attica and Bœotia. But he feared to keep too\r\nlong upon this highway to Tanagra, and of the dangers of the road he soon\r\nmet grim warnings.\r\n\r\nFirst, it was a farmstead in black ruin, with the carcass of a horse half\r\nburned lying before the gate. Next, it was the body of a woman, three days\r\nslain, and in the centre of the road,—no pleasant sight, for the crows had\r\nbeen at their banquet,—and hardened though the Alcmæonid was to war, he\r\nstopped long enough to cast the ceremonial handful of dust on the poor\r\nremains, as symbolic burial, and sped a wish to King Pluto to give peace\r\nto the wanderer’s spirit. Next, people met him: an old man, his wife, his\r\nyoung son,—wretched shepherd-folk dressed in sheepskins,—the boy helping\r\nhis elders as they tottered along on their staves toward the mountain. At\r\nsight of Glaucon they feebly made to fly, but he held out his hand,\r\nshowing he was unarmed, and they halted also.\r\n\r\n“Whence and whither, good father?”\r\n\r\nWhereat the old man began to shake all over and tell a mumbling story, how\r\nthey had been set upon by the Scythian troopers in their little farm near\r\nŒnophytæ, how he had seen the farmhouse burn, his two daughters swung\r\nshrieking upon the steeds of the wild Barbarians, and as for himself and\r\nhis wife and son, Athena knew what saved them! They had lost all but life,\r\nand fearful for that were seeking a cave on Mt. Parnes. Would not the\r\nyoung man come with them, a thousand dangers lurked upon the way? But\r\nGlaucon did not wait to hear the story out. On he sped up the rocky road.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Mardonius! ah, Artazostra!” he was speaking in his heart, “noble and\r\nbrave you are to your peers, but this is your rare handiwork,—and though\r\nyou once called me friend, Zeus and Dikē still rule, there is a price for\r\nthis and you shall tell it out.”\r\n\r\nYet he bethought himself of the old man’s warning, and left the beaten\r\nway. At the long steady trot learned in the stadium, he went onward under\r\nthe greenwood behind the gleaming river, where the vines and branches\r\nwhipped on his face; and now and again he crossed a half-dried brook,\r\nwhere he swept up a little water in his hands, and said a quick prayer to\r\nthe friendly nymphs of the stream. Once or twice he sped through fig\r\norchards, and snatched at the ripe fruit as he ran, eating without\r\nslackening his course. Presently the river began to bend away to westward.\r\nHe knew if he followed it, he came soon to Tanagra, but whether that town\r\nwere held by the Persians or burned by them, who could tell? He quitted\r\nthe Asopus and its friendly foliage. The bare wide plain of Bœotia was\r\nopening. Concealment was impossible, unless indeed he turned far eastward\r\ntoward Attica and took refuge on the foothills of the mountains. But speed\r\nwas more precious than safety. He passed Scolus, and found the village\r\ndesolate, burned. No human being greeted him, only one or two starving\r\ndogs rushed forth to snap, bristle, and be chased away by a well-sent\r\nstone. Here and yonder in the fields were still the clusters of crows\r\npicking at carrion,—more tokens that Mardonius’s Tartar raiders had done\r\ntheir work too well. Then at last, an hour or more before the sunset, just\r\nas the spurs of Cithæron, the long mountain over against Attica, began to\r\nthrust their bald summits up before the runner’s ken, far ahead upon the\r\nway approached a cloud of dust. The Athenian paused in his run, dashed\r\ninto the barren field, and flung himself flat between the furrows. He\r\nheard the hoof-beats of the wiry steppe horses, the clatter of targets and\r\nscabbards, the shrill shouts of the raiders. He lifted his head enough to\r\nsee the red streamers on their lance tips flutter past. He let the noise\r\ndie away before he dared to take the road once more. The time he lost was\r\nredeemed by a burst of speed. His head was growing very hot, but it was\r\nnot time to think of that.\r\n\r\nAlready the hills were spreading their shadows, and Platæa was many stadia\r\naway. Knowledge of how much remained made him reckless. He ran on without\r\nhis former caution. The plain was again changing to undulating foothills.\r\nHe had passed Erythræ now,—another village burned and deserted. He mounted\r\na slope, was descending to mount another, when lo! over the hill before\r\ncame eight riders at full speed. What must be done, must be done quickly.\r\nTo plunge into the fallow field again were madness, the horsemen had\r\nsurely seen him, and their sure-footed beasts could run over the furrows\r\nlike rabbits. Glaucon stood stock still and stretched forth both hands, to\r\nshow the horsemen he did not resist them.\r\n\r\n“O Athena Polias,” uprose the prayer from his heart, “if thou lovest not\r\nme, forget not thy love for Hellas, for Athens, for Hermione my wife.”\r\n\r\nThe riders were on him instantly, their crooked swords flew out. They\r\nsurrounded their captive, uttering outlandish cries and chatterings,\r\nogling, muttering, pointing with their swords and lances as if debating\r\namong themselves whether to let the stranger go or hew him in pieces.\r\nGlaucon stood motionless, looking from one to another and asking for\r\nwisdom in his soul. Seven were Tartars, low-browed, yellow-skinned, flat\r\nof nose, with the grins of apes. He might expect the worst from these. But\r\nthe eighth showed a long blond beard under his leather helm, and Glaucon\r\nrejoiced; the chief of the band was a Persian and more amenable.\r\n\r\nThe Tartars continued gesturing and debating, flourishing their steel\r\npoints right at the prisoner’s breast. He regarded them calmly, so calmly\r\nthat the Persian gave vent to his admiration.\r\n\r\n“Down with your lance-head, Rūkhs. By Mithra, I think this Hellene is\r\nbrave as he is beautiful! See how he stands. We must have him to the\r\nPrince.”\r\n\r\n“Excellency,” spoke Glaucon, in his best court Persian, “I am a courier to\r\nthe Lord Mardonius. If you are faithful servants of his Eternity the king,\r\nwhere is your camp?”\r\n\r\nThe chief started.\r\n\r\n“On the life of my father, you speak Persian as if you dwelled in Eran at\r\nthe king’s own doors! What do you here alone upon this road in Hellas?”\r\n\r\nGlaucon put out his hand before answering, caught the tip of Rūkhs’s\r\nlance, and snapped it short like a reed. He knew the way to win the\r\nadmiration of the Barbarians. They yelled with delight, all at least save\r\nRūkhs.\r\n\r\n“Strong as he is brave and handsome,” cried the Persian. “Again—who are\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nThe Alcmæonid drew himself to full height and gave his head its lordliest\r\npoise.\r\n\r\n“Understand, Persian, that I have indeed lived long at the king’s gates.\r\nYes,—I have learned my Aryan at the Lord Mardonius’s own table, for I am\r\nthe son of Attaginus of Thebes, who is not the least of the friends of his\r\nEternity in Hellas.”\r\n\r\nThe mention of one of the foremost Medizers of Greece made the subaltern\r\nbend in his saddle. His tone became even obsequious.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I understand. Your Excellency is a courier. You have despatches from\r\nthe king?”\r\n\r\n“Despatches of moment just landed from Asia. Now tell me where the army is\r\nencamped.”\r\n\r\n“By the Asopus, much to northward. The Hellenes lie to south. Here, Rūkhs,\r\ntake the noble courier behind you on the horse, and conduct him to the\r\ngeneral.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven bless your generosity,” cried the runner, with almost precipitate\r\nhaste, “but I know the country well, and the worthy Rūkhs will not thank\r\nme if I deprive him of his share in your booty.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, we have heard of a farm across the hills at Eleutheræ that’s not\r\nyet been plundered,—handsome wenches, and we’ll make the father dig up his\r\npot of money. Mazda speed you, sir, for we are off.”\r\n\r\n“Yeh! yeh!” yelled the seven Tartars, none more loudly than Rūkhs, who had\r\nno hankering for conducting a courier back into the camp. So the riders\r\ncame and went, whilst Glaucon drew his girdle one notch tighter and ran\r\nonward through the gathering evening.\r\n\r\nThe adventure had been a warning. Once Athena had saved him, not perchance\r\ntwice,—again he took to the fields. He did not love the sight of the sun\r\never lower, on the long brown ridge of Helicon far to west. Until now he\r\nscarce thought enough of self to realize the terrible draughts he had made\r\nupon his treasure-house of strength. Could it be that he—the Isthmionices,\r\nwho had crushed down the giant of Sparta before the cheering myriads—could\r\nfaint like a weary girl, when the weal of Hellas was his to win or lose?\r\nWhy did his tongue burn in his throat as a coal? Why did those feet—so\r\nswift, so ready when he sped from Oropus—lift so heavily?\r\n\r\nAs a flash it came over him what he had endured,—the slow agony on the\r\n_Bozra_, the bursting of the bands, the fight for life, the scene with\r\nThemistocles, the sleepless night on the trireme. Now he was running as\r\nthe wild hare runs before the baying chase. Could it be that all this race\r\nwas vain?\r\n\r\n“For Hellas! For Hermione!”\r\n\r\nWhilst he groaned through his gritted teeth, some malignant god made him\r\nmisstep, stumble. He fell between the hard furrows, bruising his face and\r\nhands. After a moment he rose, but rose to sink back again with keen pain\r\nshooting through an ankle. He had turned it. For an instant he sat\r\nmotionless, taking breath, then his teeth came together harder.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles trusts me. I carry the fate of Hellas. I can die, but I\r\ncannot fail.”\r\n\r\nIt was quite dusk now. The brief southern twilight was ending in pale bars\r\nof gold above Helicon. Glaucon rose again; the cold sweat sprang out upon\r\nhis forehead. Before his eyes rose darkness, but he did not faint. Some\r\nkind destiny set a stout pole upright in the field,—perhaps for vines to\r\nclamber,—he clutched it, and stood until his sight cleared and the pain a\r\nlittle abated. He tore the pole from the ground, and reached the roadway.\r\nHe must take his chance of meeting more raiders. He had one vast\r\ncomfort,—if there had been no battle fought that day, there would be none\r\nbefore dawn. But he had still weary stadia before him, and running was out\r\nof the question. Ever and anon he would stop his hobbling, take air, and\r\nstare at the vague tracery of the hills,—Cithæron to southward, Helicon to\r\nwest, and northward the wide dark Theban plain. He gave up counting how\r\nmany times he halted, how many times he spoke the magic words, “For\r\nHellas! For Hermione!” and forced onward his way. The moon failed, even\r\nthe stars were clouded. A kind of brute instinct guided him. At last—he\r\nguessed it was nearly midnight—he caught once more the flashings of a\r\nshallow river and the dim outlines of shrubbery beside the bank—again the\r\nAsopus. He must take care or he would wander straight into Mardonius’s\r\ncamp. Therefore he stopped awhile, drank the cool water, and let the\r\nstream purl around his burning foot. Then he set his face to the south,\r\nfor there lay Platæa. There he would find the Hellenes.\r\n\r\nHe was almost unconscious of everything save the fierce pain and the need\r\nto go forward even to the end. At moments he thought he saw the mountains\r\nspringing out of their gloom,—Helicon and Cithæron beckoning him on, as\r\nwith living fingers.\r\n\r\n“Not too late. Marathon was not vain, nor Thermopylæ, nor Salamis. You can\r\nsave Hellas.”\r\n\r\nWho spoke that? He stared into the solitary night. Was he not alone? Then\r\nphantasms came as on a flood. He was in a kind of euthanasy. The pain of\r\nhis foot had ceased. He saw the Paradise by Sardis and its bending\r\nfeathery palms; he heard the tinkling of the Lydian harps, and Roxana\r\nsinging of the magic Oxus, and the rose valleys of Eran. Next Roxana\r\nbecame Hermione. He was standing at her side on the knoll of Colonus, and\r\nwatching the sun sink behind Daphni making the Acropolis glow with red\r\nfire and gold. Yet all the time he knew he was going onward. He must not\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n“For Hellas! For Hermione!”\r\n\r\nAt last even the vision of the Violet-Crowned City faded to mist. Had he\r\nreached the end,—the rest by the fields of Rhadamanthus, away from human\r\nstrife? The night was ever darkening. He saw nothing, felt nothing,\r\nthought nothing save that he was still going onward, onward.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAt some time betwixt midnight and dawning an Athenian outpost was pacing\r\nhis beat outside the lines of Aristeides. The allied Hellenes were\r\nretiring from their position by the Asopus to a more convenient spot by\r\nPlatæa, less exposed to the dreaded Persian cavalry, but on the night\r\nmarch the contingents had become disordered. The Athenians were halting\r\nunder arms,—awaiting orders from Pausanias the commander-in-chief. The\r\noutpost—Hippon, a worthy charcoal-burner of Archarnæ—was creeping gingerly\r\nbehind the willow hedges, having a well-grounded fear of Tartar arrows.\r\nPresently his fox-keen ears caught footfalls from the road. His shield\r\nwent up. He couched his spear. His eyes, sharpened by the long darkness,\r\nsaw a man hardly running, nor walking, yet dragging one foot and leaning\r\non a staff. Here was no Tartar, and Hippon sprang out boldly.\r\n\r\n“Halt, stranger, tell your business.”\r\n\r\n“For Aristeides.” The apparition seemed holding out something in his hand.\r\n\r\n“That’s not the watchword. Give it, or I must arrest you.”\r\n\r\n“For Aristeides.”\r\n\r\n“Zeus smite you, fellow, can’t you speak Greek? What have you got for our\r\ngeneral?”\r\n\r\n“For Aristeides.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger was hoarse as a crow. He was pushing aside the spear and\r\nforcing a packet into Hippon’s hands. The latter, sorely puzzled, whistled\r\nthrough his fingers. A moment more the locharch of the scouting division\r\nand three comrades appeared.\r\n\r\n“Why the alarm? Where’s the enemy?”\r\n\r\n“No enemy, but a madman. Find what he wants.”\r\n\r\nThe locharch in earlier days had kept an oil booth in the Athens Agora and\r\nknew the local celebrities as well as Phormio.\r\n\r\n“Now, friend,” he spoke, “your business, and shortly; we’ve no time for\r\nchaffering.”\r\n\r\n“For Aristeides.”\r\n\r\n“The fourth time he’s said it,—sheep!” cried Hippon, but as he spoke the\r\nnewcomer fell forward heavily, groaned once, and lay on the roadway silent\r\nas the dead. The locharch drew forth the horn lantern he had masked under\r\nhis chalmys and leaned over the stranger. The light fell on the seal of\r\nthe packet gripped in the rigid fingers.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles’s seal,” he cried, and hastily turned the fallen man’s face\r\nupward to the light, when the lantern almost dropped from his own hand.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon the Alcmæonid! Glaucon the Traitor who was dead! He or his shade\r\ncome back from Tartarus.”\r\n\r\nThe four soldiers stood quaking like aspen, but their leader was of\r\nstouter stuff. Never had his native Attic shrewdness guided him to more\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n“Ghost, traitor, what not, this man has run himself all but to death. Look\r\non his face. And Themistocles does not send a courier for nothing. This\r\npacket is for Aristeides, and to Aristeides take it with speed.”\r\n\r\nHippon seized the papyrus. He thought it would fade out of his hands like\r\na spectre. It did not. The sentinel dropped his spear and ran breathless\r\ntoward Platæa, where he knew was his general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COUNCIL OF MARDONIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nNever since Salamis had Persian hopes been higher than that night. What if\r\nthe Spartans were in the field at last, and the incessant skirmishing had\r\nbeen partly to Pausanias’s advantage? Secure in his fortified camp by the\r\nAsopus, Mardonius could confidently wait the turn of the tide. His light\r\nTartar cavalry had cut to pieces the convoys bringing provisions to the\r\nHellenes. Rumour told that Pausanias’s army was ill fed, and his captains\r\nwere at loggerheads. Time was fighting for Mardonius. A joyful letter he\r\nhad sent to Sardis the preceding morning: “Let the king have patience. In\r\nforty days I shall be banqueting even in Sparta.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Prince sat at council with his commanders. Xerxes had\r\nleft behind his own war pavilion, and here the Persians met. Mardonius sat\r\non the high seat of the dais. Gold, purple, a hundred torches, made the\r\nscene worthy of the monarch himself. Beside the general stood a young\r\npage,—beautiful as Armaiti, fairest of the archangels. All looked on the\r\npage, but discreetly kept their thoughts to whispers, though many had\r\nguessed the secret of Mardonius’s companion.\r\n\r\nThe debate was long and vehement. Especially Artabazus, general of the\r\nrear-guard, was loud in asserting no battle should be risked. He was a\r\ncrafty man, who, the Prince suspected, was his personal enemy, but his\r\nopinion was worth respecting.\r\n\r\n“I repeat what I said before. The Hellenes showed how they could fight at\r\nThermopylæ. Let us retire to Thebes.”\r\n\r\n“Bravely said, valiant general,” sneered Mardonius, none too civilly.\r\n\r\n“It is mine to speak, yours to follow my opinion as you list. I say we can\r\nconquer these Hellenes with folded hands. Retreat to Thebes; money is\r\nplentiful with us; we can melt our gold cups into coin. Sprinkle bribes\r\namong the hostile chiefs. We know their weakness. Not steel but gold will\r\nunlock the way to Sparta.”\r\n\r\nThe generalissimo stood up proudly.\r\n\r\n“Bribes and stealth? Did Cyrus and Darius win us empire with these? No, by\r\nthe Fiend-Smiter, it was sharp steel and the song of the bow-string that\r\nmade Eran to prosper, and prosper to this day. But lest Artabazus think\r\nthat in putting on the lion I have forgotten the fox, let the strangers\r\nnow come to us stand forth, that he and every other may know how I have\r\ndone all things for the glory of my master and the Persian name.”\r\n\r\nHe smote with his commander’s mace upon the bronze ewer on the table.\r\nInstantly there appeared two soldiers, between them two men, one of\r\nslight, one of gigantic, stature, but both in Grecian dress. Artabazus\r\nsprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Who are these men—Thebans?”\r\n\r\n“From greater cities than Thebes. You see two new servants of the king,\r\ntherefore friends of us all. Behold Lycon of Sparta and Democrates, friend\r\nof Themistocles.”\r\n\r\nHis speech was Persian, but the newcomers both understood when he named\r\nthem. The tall Laconian straightened his bull neck, as in defiance. The\r\nAthenian flushed. His head seemed sinking betwixt his shoulders. Much\r\nwormwood had he drunk of late, but none bitterer than this,—to be welcomed\r\nat the councils of the Barbarian. Artabazus salaamed to his superior half\r\nmockingly.\r\n\r\n“Verily, son of Gobryas, I was wrong. You are guileful as a Greek. There\r\ncan be no higher praise.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s nostrils twitched. Perhaps he was not saying all he felt.\r\n\r\n“Let your praise await the issue,” he rejoined coldly. “Suffice it that\r\nthese friends were long convinced of the wisdom of aiding his Eternity,\r\nand to-night come from the camp of the Hellenes to tell all that has\r\npassed and why we should make ready for battle at the dawning.” He turned\r\nto the Greeks, ordering in their own tongue, “Speak forth, I am\r\ninterpreter for the council.”\r\n\r\nAn awkward instant followed. Lycon looked on Democrates.\r\n\r\n“You are an Athenian, your tongue is readiest,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“And you the first to Medize. Finish your handiwork,” the retort.\r\n\r\n“We are waiting,” prompted Mardonius, and Lycon held up his great head and\r\nbegan in short sentences which the general deftly turned into Persian.\r\n\r\n“Your cavalry has made our position by the Asopus intolerable. All the\r\nsprings are exposed. We have to fight every time we try to draw water.\r\nTo-day was a meeting of the commanders, many opinions, much wrangling, but\r\nall said we must retire. The town of Platæa is best. It is strong, with\r\nplenty of water. You cannot attack it. To-night our camp has been struck.\r\nThe troops begin to retire, but in disorder. The contingent of each city\r\nmarches by itself. The Athenians, thanks to Democrates, delay retreating;\r\nthe Spartans I have delayed also. I have persuaded Amompharetus, my\r\ncousin, who leads the Pitanate _mora_,(15) and who was not at the council,\r\nthat it is cowardly for a Spartan to retreat. He is a sheep-skulled fool\r\nand has believed me. Consequently, he and his men are holding back. The\r\nother Spartans wait for them. At dawn you will find the Athenians and\r\nSpartans alone near their old camping ground, their allies straggling in\r\nthe rear. Attack boldly. When the onset joins, Democrates and I will order\r\nour own divisions to retire. The phalanxes will be broken up. With your\r\ncavalry you will have them at mercy, for once the spear-hedge is\r\nshattered, they are lost. The battle will not cost you twenty men.”\r\n\r\nArtabazus rose again and showed his teeth.\r\n\r\n“A faithful servant of the king, Mardonius,—and so well is all provided,\r\ndo we brave Aryans need even to string our bows?”\r\n\r\nThe Prince winced at the sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“I am serving the king, not my own pleasure,” he retorted stiffly. “The\r\nson of Gobryas is too well known to have slurs cast on his courage. And\r\nnow what questions would my captains ask these Greeks? Promptly—they must\r\nbe again in their own lines, or they are missed.”\r\n\r\nAn officer here or there threw an interrogation. Lycon answered briefly.\r\nDemocrates kept sullen silence. He was clearly present more to prove the\r\ngood faith of his Medizing than for anything he might say. Mardonius smote\r\nthe ewer again. The soldiers escorted the two Hellenes forth. As the\r\ncurtains closed behind them, the curious saw that the features of the\r\nbeautiful page by the general’s side were contracted with disgust.\r\nMardonius himself spat violently.\r\n\r\n“Dogs, and sons of dogs, let Angra-Mainyu wither them forever. Bear\r\nwitness, men of Persia, how, for the sake of our Lord the King, I hold\r\nconverse even with these vilest of the vile!”\r\n\r\nSoon the council was broken up. The final commands were given. Every\r\nofficer knew his task. The cavalry was to be ready to charge across the\r\nAsopus at gray dawn. With Lycon and Democrates playing their part the\r\nissue was certain, too certain for many a grizzled captain who loved the\r\nring of steel. In his own tent Mardonius held in his arms the beautiful\r\npage—Artazostra! Her wonderful face had never shone up at his more\r\nbrightly than on that night, as he drew back his lips from a long fond\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow—the triumph. You will be conqueror of Hellas. Xerxes will make\r\nyou satrap. I wish we could conquer in fairer fight, but what wrong to\r\nvanquish these Hellenes with their own sly weapons? Do you remember what\r\nGlaucon said?”\r\n\r\n“What thing?”\r\n\r\n“That Zeus and Athena were greater than Mazda the Pure and glorious\r\nMithra? To-morrow will prove him wrong. I wonder whether he yet\r\nlives,—whether he will ever confess that Persia is irresistible.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know. From the evening we parted at Phaleron he has faded from\r\nour world.”\r\n\r\n“He was fair as the Amesha-Spentas, was he not? Poor Roxana—she is again\r\nin Sardis now. I hope she has ceased to eat her heart out with vain\r\nlonging for her lover. He was noble minded and spoke the truth. How rare\r\nin a Hellene. But what will you do with these two gold-bought traitors,\r\n‘friends of the king’ indeed?”\r\n\r\nMardonius’s face grew stern.\r\n\r\n“I have promised them the lordships of Athens and of Sparta. The pledge\r\nshall be fulfilled, but after that,”—Artazostra understood his sinister\r\nsmile,—“there are many ways of removing an unwelcome vassal prince, if I\r\nbe the satrap of Hellas.”\r\n\r\n“And you are that in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“For your sake,” was his cry, as again he kissed her, “I would I were not\r\nsatrap of Hellas only, but lord of all the world, that I might give it to\r\nyou, O daughter of Darius and Atossa.”\r\n\r\n“I am mistress of the world,” she answered, “for my world is Mardonius.\r\nTo-morrow the battle, the glory, and then what next—Sicily, Carthage,\r\nItaly? For Mazda will give us all things.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOtherwise talked Democrates and Lycon as they quitted the Persian pickets\r\nand made their way across the black plain, back to the lines of the\r\nHellenes.\r\n\r\n“You should be happy to-night,” said the Athenian.\r\n\r\n“Assuredly. I draw up my net and find it very full of mullets quite to my\r\nliking.”\r\n\r\n“Take care it be not so full that it break.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Democrates,”—Lycon slapped his paw on the other’s shoulder,—“why\r\nalways imagine evil? Hermes is a very safe guide. I only hope our victory\r\nwill be so complete Sparta will submit without fighting. It will be\r\nawkward to rule a plundered city.”\r\n\r\n“I shudder at the thought of being amongst even conquered Athenians; I\r\nshall see a tyrannicide in every boy in the Agora.”\r\n\r\n“A stout Persian garrison in your Acropolis is the surest physic against\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“By the dog, Lycon, you speak like a Scythian. Hellene you surely are\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“Hellene I am, and show my native wisdom in seeing that Persia must\r\nconquer and trimming sail accordingly.”\r\n\r\n“Persia is not irresistible. With a fair battle—”\r\n\r\n“It will not be a fair battle. What can save Pausanias? Nothing—except a\r\nmiracle sent from Zeus.”\r\n\r\n“Such as what?”\r\n\r\n“As merciful Hiram’s relenting and releasing your dear Glaucon.” Lycon’s\r\nchuckle was loud.\r\n\r\n“Never, as you hope me to be anything save your mortal enemy, mention that\r\nname again.”\r\n\r\n“As you like it—it’s no very pretty tale, I grant, even amongst Medizers.\r\nYet it was most imprudent to let him live.”\r\n\r\n“You have never heard the Furies, Lycon.” Democrates’s voice was so grave\r\nas to dry up the Spartan’s banter. “But I shall never see him again, and I\r\nshall possess Hermione.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty consolation. _Eu!_ here are our outposts. We must pass for\r\nofficers reconnoitring the enemy. You know your part to-morrow. At the\r\nfirst charge bid your division ‘wheel to rear.’ Three words, and the thing\r\nis done.”\r\n\r\nLycon gave the watchword promptly to one of Pausanias’s outposts. The man\r\nsaluted his officers, and said that the Greeks of the lesser states had\r\nretreated far to the rear, that Amompharetus still refused to move his\r\ndivision, that the Spartans waited for him, and the Athenians for the\r\nSpartans.\r\n\r\n“Noble tidings,” whispered the giant, as the two stood an instant, before\r\neach went to his own men. “Behold how Hermes helps us—a great deity.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I think Nemesis is greater,” said Democrates, once again\r\nrefusing Lycon’s proffered hand.\r\n\r\n“By noon you’ll laugh at Nemesis, _philotate_, when we both drink Helbon\r\nwine in Xerxes’s tent!” and away went Lycon into the dark.\r\n\r\nDemocrates went his own way also. Soon he was in the fallow-field, where\r\nunder the warm night the Athenians were stretched, each man in armour, his\r\nhelmet for a pillow. A few torches were moving. From a distance came the\r\nhum from a group of officers in excited conversation. As the orator picked\r\nhis way among the sleeping men, a locharch with a lantern accosted him\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n“You are Democrates the strategus?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Aristeides summons you at once. Come.”\r\n\r\nThere was no reason for refusing. Democrates followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE AVENGING OF LEONIDAS\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning at last, ruddy and windy. The Persian host had been long prepared.\r\nThe Tartar cavalry with their bulls-hide targets and long lances, the\r\nheavy Persian cuirassiers, the Median and Assyrian archers with their\r\nponderous wicker-shields, stood in rank waiting only the word that should\r\ndash them as sling-stones on Pausanias and his ill-starred following. The\r\nMagi had sacrificed a stallion, and reported that the holy fire gave every\r\nfavouring sign. Mardonius went from his tent, all his eunuchs bowing their\r\nforeheads to the earth and chorussing, “Victory to our Lord, to Persia,\r\nand to the King.”\r\n\r\nThey brought Mardonius his favourite horse, a white steed of the sacred\r\nbreed of Nisæa. The Prince had bound around his turban the gemmed tiara\r\nXerxes had given him on his wedding-day. Few could wield the Babylonish\r\ncimeter that danced in the chieftain’s hand. The captains cheered him\r\nloudly, as they might have cheered the king.\r\n\r\n“Life to the general! To the satrap of Hellas!”\r\n\r\nBut beside the Nisæan pranced another, lighter and with a lighter mount.\r\nThe rider was cased in silvered scale-armour, and bore only a steel-tipped\r\nreed.\r\n\r\n“The general’s page,” ran the whisper, and other whispers, far softer,\r\nfollowed. None heard the quick words passed back and forth betwixt the two\r\nriders.\r\n\r\n“You may be riding to death, Artazostra. What place is a battle for\r\nwomen?”\r\n\r\n“What place is the camp for the daughter of Darius, when her husband rides\r\nto war? We triumph together; we perish together. It shall be as Mazda\r\ndecrees.”\r\n\r\nMardonius answered nothing. Long since he had learned the folly of setting\r\nhis will against that of the masterful princess at his side. And was not\r\nvictory certain? Was not Artazostra doing even as Semiramis of Nineveh had\r\ndone of old?\r\n\r\n“The army is ready, Excellency,” declared an adjutant, bowing in his\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\n“Forward, then, but slowly, to await the reconnoitring parties sent toward\r\nthe Greeks.”\r\n\r\nIn the gray morning the host wound out of the stockaded camp. The women\r\nand grooms called fair wishes after them. The far slopes of Cithæron were\r\nreddening. A breeze whistled down the hills. It would disperse the mist.\r\nSoon the leader of the scouts came galloping, leaped down and salaamed to\r\nthe general. “Let my Lord’s liver find peace. All is even as our friends\r\ndeclared. The enemy have in part fled far away. The Athenians halt on a\r\nfoot-hill of the mountain. The Laconians sit in companies on the ground,\r\nwaiting their division that will not retreat. Let my Lord charge, and\r\nglory waits for Eran!”\r\n\r\nMardonius’s cimeter swung high.\r\n\r\n“Forward, all! Mazda fights for us. Bid our allies the Thebans(16) attack\r\nthe Athenians. Ours is the nobler prey—even the men of Sparta.”\r\n\r\n“Victory to the king!” thundered the thousands. Confident of triumph,\r\nMardonius suffered the ranks to be broken, as his myriads rushed onward.\r\nOver the Asopus and its shallow fords they swept, and raced across the\r\nplain-land. Horse mingled with foot; Persians with Tartars. The howlings\r\nin a score of tongues, the bray of cymbals and kettledrums, the clamour of\r\nspear-butts beaten on armour—who may tell it? Having unleashed his wild\r\nbeasts, Mardonius dashed before to guide their ragings as he might. The\r\nwhite Nisæan and its companion led the way across the hard plain. Behind,\r\nas when in the springtime flood the watery wall goes crashing down the\r\nvalley, so spread the thousands. A god looking from heaven would not have\r\nforgotten that sight of whirling plumes, plunging steeds, flying steel, in\r\nall the æons.\r\n\r\nFive stadia, six, seven, eight,—so Mardonius led. Already before him he\r\ncould see the glistering crests and long files of the Spartans—the prey he\r\nwould crush with one stroke as a vulture swoops over the sparrow. Then\r\nnigh involuntarily his hand drew rein. What came to greet him? A man on\r\nfoot—no horseman even. A man of huge stature running at headlong speed.\r\n\r\nThe risen sun was now dazzling. The general clapped his hand above his\r\neyes. Then a tug on the bridle sent the Nisæan on his haunches.\r\n\r\n“Lycon, as Mazda made me!”\r\n\r\nThe Spartan was beside them soon, he had run so swiftly. He was so dazed\r\nhe barely heeded Mardonius’s call to halt and tell his tale. He was almost\r\nnaked. His face was black with fear, never more brutish or loathsome.\r\n\r\n“All is betrayed. Democrates is seized. Pausanias and Aristeides are\r\nwarned. They will give you fair battle. I barely escaped.”\r\n\r\n“Who betrayed you?” cried the Prince.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon the Alcmæonid, he is risen from the dead. _Ai!_ woe! no fault of\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\nNever before had the son of Gobryas smiled so fiercely as when the giant\r\ncowered beneath his darting eyes. The general’s sword whistled down on the\r\nskull of the traitor. The Laconian sprawled in the dust without a groan.\r\nMardonius laughed horribly.\r\n\r\n“A fair price then for unlucky villany. Blessed be Mithra, who suffers me\r\nto give recompense. Wish me joy,”—as his captains came galloping around\r\nhim,—“our duty to the king is finished. We shall win Hellas in fair\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\n“Then it were well, Excellency,” thrust in Artabazus, “since the plot is\r\nfoiled, to retire to the camp.”\r\n\r\nMardonius’s eyes flashed lightnings.\r\n\r\n“Woman’s counsel that! Are we not here to conquer Hellas? Yes, by Mithra\r\nthe Glorious, we will fight, though every _dæva_ in hell joins against us.\r\nRe-form the ranks. Halt the charge. Let the bowmen crush the Spartans with\r\ntheir arrows. Then we will see if these Greeks are stouter than\r\nBabylonian, Lydian, and Egyptian who played their game with Persia to sore\r\ncost. And you, Artabazus, to your rear-guard, and do your duty well.”\r\n\r\nThe general bowed stiffly. He knew the son of Gobryas, and that\r\ndisobedience would have brought Mardonius’s cimeter upon his own helmet.\r\nBy a great effort the charge was stayed,—barely in time,—for to have flung\r\nthat disorganized horde on the waiting Spartan spears would have been\r\nworse than madness. A single stadium sundered the two hosts when Mardonius\r\nbrought his men to a stand, set his strong divisions of bowmen in array\r\nbehind their wall of shields, and drew up his cavalry on the flanks of the\r\nbowmen. Battle he would give, but it must be cautious battle now, and he\r\ndid not love the silence which reigned among the motionless lines of the\r\nSpartans.\r\n\r\nIt was bright day at last. The two armies—the whole strength of the\r\nBarbarian, the Spartans with only their Tegean allies—stood facing, as\r\nathletes measuring strength before the grapple. The Spartan line was\r\nthinner than Mardonius’s: no cavalry, few bowmen, but shield was set\r\nbeside shield, and everywhere tossed the black and scarlet plumes of the\r\nhelmets. Men who remembered Thermopylæ gripped their spear-stocks tighter.\r\nNo long postponing now. On this narrow field, this bit of pebble and\r\ngreensward, the gods would cast the last dice for the destiny of Hellas.\r\nAll knew that.\r\n\r\nThe stolidity of the Spartans was maddening. They stood like bronze\r\nstatues. In clear view at the front was a tall man in scarlet chlamys, and\r\ntwo more in white,—Pausanias and his seers examining the entrails of\r\ndoves, seeking a fair omen for the battle. Mardonius drew the turban lower\r\nover his eyes.\r\n\r\n“An end to this truce. Begin your arrows.”\r\n\r\nA cloud of bolts answered him. The Persian archers emptied their quivers.\r\nThey could see men falling among the foe, but still Pausanias stood beside\r\nthe seers, still he gave no signal to advance. The omens doubtless were\r\nunfavourable. His men never shifted a foot as the storm of death flew over\r\nthem. Their rigidity was more terrifying than any battle-shout. What were\r\nthese men whose iron discipline bound so fast that they could be pelted to\r\ndeath, and no eyelash seem to quiver? The archers renewed their volley.\r\nThey shot against a rock. The Barbarians joined in one rending yell,—their\r\nanswer was silence.\r\n\r\nDeliberately, arrows dropping around him as tree-blossoms in the gale,\r\nPausanias raised his hand. The omens were good. The gods permitted battle.\r\nDeliberately, while men fell dying, he walked to his post on the right\r\nwing. Deliberately, while heaven seemed shaking with the Barbarians’\r\nclamour, his hand went up again. Through a lull in the tumult pealed a\r\ntrumpet. _Then the Spartans marched._\r\n\r\nSlowly their lines of bristling spear-points and nodding crests moved on\r\nlike the sea-waves. Shrill above the booming Tartar drums, the blaring\r\nPersian war-horns pierced the screams of their pipers. And the Barbarians\r\nheard that which had never met their ears before,—the chanting of their\r\nfoes as the long line crept nearer.\r\n\r\n“Ah!—la—la—la—la! Ah!—la—la—la—la!” deep, prolonged, bellowed in chorus\r\nfrom every bronze visor which peered above the serried shields.\r\n\r\n“Faster,” stormed the Persian captains to their slingers and bowmen, “beat\r\nthese madmen down.” The rain of arrows and sling-stones was like hail,\r\nlike hail it rattled from the shields and helms. Here, there, a form sank,\r\nthe inexorable phalanx closed and swept onward.\r\n\r\n“Ah!—la—la—la! Ah!—la—la—la!”\r\n\r\nThe chant never ceased. The pipers screamed more shrilly. Eight deep,\r\nunhasting, unresting, Pausanias was bringing his heavy infantry across the\r\ntwo hundred paces betwixt himself and Mardonius. His Spartan spearmen\r\nmight be unlearned, doltish, but they knew how to do one deed and that\r\nsurpassingly well,—to march in line though lightnings dashed from heaven,\r\nand to thrust home with their lances. And not a pitiful three hundred, but\r\nten thousand bold and strong stood against the Barbarian that morning.\r\nMardonius was facing the finest infantry in the world, and the avenging of\r\nLeonidas was nigh.\r\n\r\n“Ah!—la—la—la! Ah!—la—la—la!”\r\n\r\nFlesh and blood in the Persian host could not wait the death grip longer.\r\n“Let us charge, or let us flee,” many a stout officer cried to his chief,\r\nand he sitting stern-eyed on the white horse gave to a Tartar troop its\r\nword, “Go!”\r\n\r\nThen like a mountain stream the wild Tartars charged. The clods flew high\r\nunder the hoofs. The yell of the riders, the shock of spears on shields,\r\nthe cry of dying men and dying beasts, the stamping, the dust-cloud, took\r\nbut a moment. The chant of the Spartans ceased—an instant. An instant the\r\nlong phalanx halted, from end to end bent and swayed. Then the dust-cloud\r\npassed, the chanting renewed. Half of the Tartars were spurring back, with\r\nshivered lances, bleeding steeds. The rest,—but the phalanx shook now\r\nhere, now there, as the impenetrable infantry strode over red forms that\r\nhad been men and horses. And still the Spartans marched, still the pipes\r\nand the war-chant.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time fear entered the heart of Mardonius, son of\r\nGobryas, and he called to the thousand picked horsemen, who rode beside\r\nhim,—not Tartars these, but Persians and Medes of lordly stock, men who\r\nhad gone forth conquering and to conquer.\r\n\r\n“Now as your fathers followed Cyrus the Invincible and Darius the\r\nDauntless, follow you me. Since for the honour of Eran and the king I ride\r\nthis day.”\r\n\r\n“We ride. For Eran and the king!” shouted the thousand. All the host\r\njoined. Mardonius led straight against the Spartan right wing where\r\nPausanias’s life-guard marched.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOld soldiers of Lacedæmon fighting their battles in the after days, when a\r\nwarrior of Platæa was as a god to each youth in Hellas, would tell how the\r\nPersian cavalrymen rode their phalanx down.\r\n\r\n“And say never,” they always added, “the Barbarians know not how to fight\r\nand how to die. Fools say it, not we of Platæa. For our first line seemed\r\nbroken in a twinkling. The Pitanate _mora_ was cut to pieces; Athena\r\nPromachus and Ares the City-Waster alone turned back that charge when\r\nMardonius led the way.”\r\n\r\nBut turned it was. And the thousand horse, no thousand now, drifted to the\r\ncover of their shield wall, raging, undaunted, yet beaten back.\r\n\r\nThen at last the phalanx locked with the Persian footmen and their rampart\r\nof wicker shields. At short spear length men grinned in each other’s\r\nfaces, while their veins were turned to fire. Many a soldier—Spartan,\r\nAryan—had seen his twenty fights, but never a fight like this. And the\r\nPersians—those that knew Greek—heard words flung through their foemen’s\r\nhelmets that made each Hellene fight as ten.\r\n\r\n“Remember Leonidas! Remember Thermopylæ!”\r\n\r\nOrders there were none; the trumpets were drowned in the tumult. Each man\r\nfought as he stood, knowing only he must slay the man before him, while\r\nslowly, as though by a cord tighter and ever tighter drawn, the Persian\r\nshield wall was bending back before the unrelenting thrusting of the\r\nSpartans. Then as a cord snaps so broke the barrier. One instant down and\r\nthe Hellenes were sweeping the light-armed Asiatic footmen before them, as\r\nthe scythe sweeps down the standing grain. So with the Persian infantry,\r\nfor their scanty armour and short spears were at terrible disadvantage,\r\nbut the strength of the Barbarian was not spent. Many times Mardonius led\r\nthe cavalry in headlong charge, each repulse the prelude to a fiercer\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!”\r\n\r\nThe call of the Prince was a call that turned his wild horsemen into\r\ndemons, but demons who strove with gods. The phalanx was shaken, halted\r\neven, broken never; and foot by foot, fathom by fathom, it brushed the\r\nBarbarian horde back across the blood-bathed plain,—and to Mardonius’s\r\nshout, a more terrible always answered:—\r\n\r\n“Remember Leonidas! Remember Thermopylæ!”\r\n\r\nThe Prince seemed to bear a charmed life as he fought. He was in the\r\nthickest fray. He sent the white Nisæan against the Laconian spears and\r\nbeat down a dozen lance-points with his sword. If one man’s valour could\r\nhave turned the tide, his would have wrought the miracle. And always\r\nbehind, almost in reach of the Grecian sling-stones, rode that other,—the\r\npage in the silvered mail,—nor did any harm come to this rider. But after\r\nthe fight had raged so long that men sank unwounded,—gasping, stricken by\r\nthe heat and press,—the Prince drew back a little from the fray to a\r\nrising in the plain, where close by a rural temple of Demeter he could\r\nwatch the drifting fight, and he saw the Aryans yielding ground finger by\r\nfinger, yet yielding, and the phalanx impregnable as ever. Then he sent an\r\naide with an urgent message.\r\n\r\n“To Artabazus and the reserve. Bid him take from the camp all the guards,\r\nevery man, every eunuch that can lift a spear, and come with speed, or the\r\nday is lost.”\r\n\r\nThe adjutant’s spurs grew red as he pricked away, while Mardonius wheeled\r\nthe Nisæan and plunged back into the thickest fight.\r\n\r\n“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!”\r\n\r\nHis battle-call pealed even above the hellish din. The Persian nobles who\r\nhad never ridden to aught save victory turned again. Their last charge was\r\ntheir fiercest. They bent the phalanx back like an inverted bow. Their\r\nfootmen, reckless of self, plunged on the Greeks and snapped off the\r\nspear-points with their naked hands. Mardonius was never prouder of his\r\nhost than in that hour. Proud—but the charge was vain. As the tide swept\r\nback, as the files of the Spartans locked once more, he knew his men had\r\ndone their uttermost. They had fought since dawn. Their shield wall was\r\nbroken. Their quivers were empty. Was not Mazda turning against them? Had\r\nnot enough been dared for that king who lounged at ease in Sardis?\r\n\r\n“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!”\r\n\r\nMardonius’s shout had no answer. Here, there, he saw horsemen and footmen,\r\nnow singly, now in small companies, drifting backward across the plain to\r\nthe last refuge of the defeated, the stockaded camp by the Asopus. The\r\nPrince called on his cavalry, so few about him now.\r\n\r\n“Shall we die as scared dogs? Remember the Aryan glory. Another charge!”\r\n\r\nHis bravest seemed never to hear him. The onward thrust of the phalanx\r\nquickened. It was gaining ground swiftly at last. Then the Spartans were\r\ndashing forward like men possessed.\r\n\r\n“The Athenians have vanquished the Thebans. They come to join us. On, men\r\nof Lacedæmon, ours alone must be this victory!”\r\n\r\nThe shout of Pausanias was echoed by his captains. To the left and not far\r\noff charged a second phalanx,—five thousand nodding crests and gleaming\r\npoints,—Aristeides bringing his whole array to his allies’ succour. But\r\nhis help was not needed. The sight of his coming dashed out the last\r\ncourage of the Barbarians. Before the redoubled shock of the Spartans the\r\nAsiatics crumbled like sand. Even whilst these broke once more, the\r\nadjutant drew rein beside Mardonius.\r\n\r\n“Lord, Artabazus is coward or traitor. Believing the battle lost, he has\r\nfled. There is no help to bring.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince bowed his head an instant, while the flight surged round him.\r\nThe Nisæan was covered with blood, but his rider spurred him across the\r\npath of a squadron of flying Medians.\r\n\r\n“Turn! Are you grown women!” Mardonius smote the nearest with his sword.\r\n“If we cannot as Aryans conquer, let us at least as Aryans die!”\r\n\r\n“_Ai! ai!_ Mithra deserts us. Artabazus is fled. Save who can!”\r\n\r\nThey swept past him. He flung himself before a band of Tartars. He had\r\nbetter pleaded with the north wind to stay its course. Horse, foot,\r\nBabylonians, Ethiopians, Persians, Medes, were huddled in fleeing rout.\r\n“To the camp,” their cry, but Mardonius, looking on the onrushing\r\nphalanxes knew there was no refuge there....\r\n\r\nAnd now sing it, O mountains and rivers of Hellas. Sing it, Asopus, to\r\nSpartan Eurotas, and you to hill-girt Alphæus. And let the maidens,\r\nwhite-robed and poppy-crowned, sweep in thanksgiving up to the welcoming\r\ntemples,—honouring Zeus of the Thunders, Poseidon the Earth-Shaker, Athena\r\nthe Mighty in War. The Barbarian is vanquished. The ordeal is ended.\r\nThermopylæ was not in vain, nor Salamis. Hellas is saved, and with her\r\nsaved the world.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAgain on the knoll by the temple, apart from the rushing fugitives,\r\nMardonius reined. His companion was once more beside him. He leaned that\r\nshe might hear him through the tumult.\r\n\r\n“The battle is lost. The camp is defenceless. What shall we do?”\r\n\r\nArtazostra flung back the gold-laced cap and let the sun play over her\r\nface and hair.\r\n\r\n“We are Aryans,” was all her answer.\r\n\r\nHe understood, but even whilst he was reaching out to catch her bridle\r\nthat their horses might run together, he saw her lithe form bend. The\r\narrow from a Laconian helot had smitten through the silvered mail. He saw\r\nthe red spring out over her breast. With a quick grasp he swung her before\r\nhim on the white horse. She smiled up in his face, never lovelier.\r\n\r\n“Glaucon was right,” she said,—their lips were very close,—“Zeus and\r\nAthena are greater than Mazda and Mithra. The future belongs to Hellas.\r\nBut we have naught for shame. We have fought as Aryans, as the children of\r\nconquerors and kings. We shall be glad together in Garonmana the Blessed,\r\nand what is left to dread?”\r\n\r\nA quiver passed through her. The Spartan spear-line was close. Mardonius\r\nlooked once across the field. His men were fleeing like sheep. And so it\r\npassed,—the dream of a satrapy of Hellas, of wider conquests, of an empire\r\nof the world. He kissed the face of Artazostra and pressed her still form\r\nagainst his breast.\r\n\r\n“For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!” he shouted, and threw away his sword.\r\nThen he turned the head of his wounded steed and rode on the Spartan\r\nlances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SONG OF THE FURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThemistocles had started from Oropus with Simonides, a small guard of\r\nmariners, and a fettered prisoner, as soon as the _Nausicaä’s_ people were\r\na little rested. Half the night they themselves were plodding on wearily.\r\nAt Tanagra the following afternoon a runner with a palm branch met them.\r\n\r\n“Mardonius is slain. Artabazus with the rear-guard has fled northward. The\r\nAthenians aided by the Spartans stormed the camp. Glory to Athena, who\r\ngives us victory!”\r\n\r\n“And the traitors?” Themistocles showed surprisingly little joy.\r\n\r\n“Lycon’s body was found drifting in the Asopus. Democrates lies fettered\r\nby Aristeides’s tents.”\r\n\r\nThen the other Athenians broke forth into pæans, but Themistocles bowed\r\nhis head and was still, though the messenger told how Pausanias and his\r\nallies had taken countless treasure, and now were making ready to attack\r\ndisloyal Thebes. So the admiral and his escort went at leisure across\r\nBœotia, till they reached the Hellenic host still camped near the\r\nbattle-field. There Themistocles was long in conference with Aristeides\r\nand Pausanias. After midnight he left Aristeides’s tent.\r\n\r\n“Where is the prisoner?” he asked of the sentinel before the headquarters.\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency means the traitor?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“I will guide you.” The soldier took a torch and led the way. The two went\r\ndown dark avenues of tents, and halted at one where five hoplites stood\r\nguard with their spears ready, five more slept before the entrance.\r\n\r\n“We watch him closely, _kyrie_,” explained the decarch, saluting.\r\n“Naturally we fear suicide as well as escape. Two more are within the\r\ntent.”\r\n\r\n“Withdraw them. Do you all stand at distance. For what happens I will be\r\nresponsible.”\r\n\r\nThe two guards inside emerged yawning. Themistocles took the torch and\r\nentered the squalid hair-cloth pavilion. The sentries noticed he had a\r\ncasket under his cloak.\r\n\r\n“The prisoner sleeps,” said a hoplite, “in spite of his fetters.”\r\n\r\nThemistocles set down the casket and carefully drew the tent-flap. With\r\nsilent tread he approached the slumberer. The face was upturned; white it\r\nwas, but it showed the same winsome features that had won the clappings a\r\nhundred times in the Pnyx. The sleep seemed heavy, dreamless.\r\n\r\nThemistocles’s own lips tightened as he stood in contemplation, then he\r\nbent to touch the other’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Democrates,”—no answer. “Democrates,”—still silence. “Democrates,”—a\r\nstirring, a clanking of metal. The eyes opened,—for one instant a smile.\r\n\r\n“_Ei_, Themistocles, it is you?” to be succeeded by a flash of unspeakable\r\nhorror. “O Zeus, the gyves! That I should come to this!”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner rose to a sitting posture upon his truss of straw. His\r\nfettered hands seized his head.\r\n\r\n“Peace,” ordered the admiral, gently. “Do not rave. I have sent the\r\nsentries away. No one will hear us.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates grew calmer. “You are merciful. You do not know how I was\r\ntempted. You will save me.”\r\n\r\n“I will do all I can.” Themistocles’s voice was solemn as an æolian harp,\r\nbut the prisoner caught at everything eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you can do so much. Pausanias fought the battle, but they call you\r\nthe true saviour of Hellas. They will do anything you say.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad.” Themistocles’s face was impenetrable as the sphinx’s.\r\nDemocrates seized the admiral’s red chlamys with his fettered hands.\r\n\r\n“You will save me! I will fly to Sicily, Carthage, the Tin Isles, as you\r\nwish. Have you forgotten our old-time friendship?”\r\n\r\n“I loved you,” spoke the admiral, tremulously.\r\n\r\n“Ah, recall that love to-night!”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“O piteous Zeus, why then is your face so awful? If you will aid me to\r\nescape—”\r\n\r\n“I will aid you.”\r\n\r\n“Blessings, blessings, but quick! I fear to be stoned to death by the\r\nsoldiers in the morning. They threaten to crucify—”\r\n\r\n“They shall not.”\r\n\r\n“Blessings, blessings,—can I escape to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” but Themistocles’s tone made the prisoner’s blood run chill. He\r\ncowered helplessly. The admiral stood, his own fine face covered with a\r\nmingling of pity, contempt, pain.\r\n\r\n“Democrates, hearken,”—his voice was hard as flint. “We have seized your\r\ncamp chest, found the key to your ciphers, and know all your\r\ncorrespondence with Lycon. We have discovered your fearful power of\r\nforgery. Hermes the Trickster gave it you for your own destruction. We\r\nhave brought Hiram hither from the ship. This night he has ridden the\r\n‘Little Horse.’(17) He has howled out everything. We have seized Bias and\r\nheard his story. There is nothing to conceal. From the beginning of your\r\npeculation of the public money, till the moment when, the prisoners say,\r\nyou were in Mardonius’s camp, all is known to us. You need not confess.\r\nThere is nothing worth confessing.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad,”—great beads were on the prisoner’s brow,—“but you do not\r\nrealize the temptation. Have you never yourself been betwixt Scylla and\r\nCharybdis? Have I not vowed every false step should be the last? I fought\r\nagainst Lycon. I fought against Mardonius. They were too strong. Athena\r\nknoweth I did not crave the tyranny of Athens! It was not that which drove\r\nme to betray Hellas.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you. But why did you not trust me at the first?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly understand.”\r\n\r\n“When first your need of money drove you to crime, why did you not come to\r\nme? You knew I loved you. You knew I looked on you as my political son and\r\nheir in the great work of making Athens the light of Hellas. I would have\r\ngiven you the gold,—yes, fifty talents.”\r\n\r\n“_Ai, ai_, if I had only dared! I thought of it. I was afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Right.” Themistocles’s lip was curling. “You are more coward than knave\r\nor traitor. Phobos, Black Fear, has been your leading god, not Hermes. And\r\nnow—”\r\n\r\n“But you have promised I shall escape.”\r\n\r\n“You shall.”\r\n\r\n“To-night? What is that you have?” Themistocles was opening the casket.\r\n\r\n“The papers seized in your chest. They implicate many noble Hellenes in\r\nCorinth, Sicyon, Sparta. Behold—” Themistocles held one papyrus after\r\nanother in the torch-flame,—“here is crumbling to ashes the evidence that\r\nwould destroy them all as Medizers. Mardonius is dead. Let the war die\r\nwith him. Hellas is safe.”\r\n\r\n“Blessings, blessings! Help me to escape. You have a sword. Pry off these\r\ngyves. How easy for you to let me fly!”\r\n\r\n“Wait!” The admiral’s peremptory voice silenced the prisoner. Themistocles\r\nfinished his task. Suddenly, however, Democrates howled with animal fear.\r\n\r\n“What are you taking now—a goblet?”\r\n\r\n“Wait.” Themistocles was indeed holding a silver cup and flask. “Have I\r\nnot said you should escape this captivity—to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Be quick, then, the night wanes fast.”\r\n\r\nThe admiral strode over beside the creature who plucked at his hem.\r\n\r\n“Give ear again, Democrates. Your crimes against Athens and Hellas were\r\nwrought under sore temptation. The money you stole from the public chest,\r\nif not returned already, I will myself make good. So much is forgiven.”\r\n\r\n“You are a true friend, Themistocles.” The prisoner’s voice was husky, but\r\nthe admiral’s eyes flashed like flint-stones struck by the steel.\r\n\r\n“Friend!” he echoed. “Yes, by Zeus Orcios, guardian of oaths and\r\nfriendship, you had a friend. Where is he now?”\r\n\r\nDemocrates lay on the turf floor of the tent, not even groaning.\r\n\r\n“You had a friend,”—the admiral’s intensity was awful. “You blasted his\r\ngood name, you sought his life, you sought his wife, you broke every bond,\r\nhuman or divine, to destroy him. At last, to silence conscience’ sting,\r\nyou thought you did a deed of mercy in sending him in captivity to a death\r\nin life. Fool! Nemesis is not mocked. Glaucon has lain at death’s door. He\r\nhas saved Hellas, but at a price. The surgeons say he will live, but that\r\nhis foot is crippled. Glaucon can never run again. You have brought him\r\nmisery. You have brought anguish to Hermione, the noblest woman in Hellas,\r\nwhom you—ah! mockery—professed to hold in love! You have done worse than\r\nmurder. Yet I have promised you shall escape this night. Rise up.”\r\n\r\nDemocrates staggered to his feet clumsily, only half knowing what he did.\r\nThemistocles was extending the silver cup. “Escape. Drink!”\r\n\r\n“What is this cup?” The prisoner had turned gray.\r\n\r\n“Hemlock, coward! Did you not bid Glaucon to take his life that night in\r\nColonus? The death you proffered him in his innocency I proffer you now in\r\nyour guilt. Drink!”\r\n\r\n“You have called me friend. You have said you loved me. I dare not die. A\r\nlittle time! Pity! Mercy! What god can I invoke?”\r\n\r\n“None. Cerberus himself would not hearken to such as you. Drink.”\r\n\r\n“Pity, by our old-time friendship!”\r\n\r\nThe admiral’s tall form straightened.\r\n\r\n“Themistocles the Friend is dead; Themistocles the Just is here,—drink.”\r\n\r\n“But you promised escape?” The prisoner’s whisper was just audible.\r\n\r\n“Ay, truly, from the court-martial before the roaring camp in the morning,\r\nthe unmasking of all your accomplices, the deeper shame of every one-time\r\nfriend, the blazoning of your infamy in public evidence through Hellas,\r\nthe soldiers howling for your blood, the stoning, perchance the plucking\r\nin pieces. By the gods Olympian, by the gods Infernal, do your past lovers\r\none last service—drink!”\r\n\r\nThat was not all Themistocles said, that was all Democrates heard. In his\r\nears sounded, even once again, the song of the Furies,—never so clearly as\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n    “With scourge and with ban\r\n    We prostrate the man\r\n    Who with smooth-woven wile\r\n    And a fair-facèd smile\r\n  Hath planted a snare for his friend!\r\n    Though fleet, we shall find him,\r\n    Though strong, we shall bind him,\r\n  Who planted a snare for his friend!”\r\n\r\nNemesis—Nemesis, the implacable goddess, had come for her own at last.\r\n\r\nDemocrates took the cup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BRIGHTNESS OF HELIOS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day that disloyal Thebes surrendered came the tidings of the crowning\r\nof the Hellenes’ victories. At Mycale by Samos the Greek fleets had\r\ndisembarked their crews and defeated the Persians almost at the doors of\r\nthe Great King in Sardis. Artabazus had escaped through Thrace to Asia in\r\ncaitiff flight. The war—at least the perilous part thereof—was at end.\r\nThere might be more battles with the Barbarian, but no second Salamis or\r\nPlatæa.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans had found the body of Mardonius pierced with five lances—all\r\nin front. Pausanias had honoured the brave dead,—the Persian had been\r\ncarried from the battle-ground on a shield, and covered by the red cloak\r\nof a Laconian general. But the body mysteriously disappeared. Its fate was\r\nnever known. Perhaps the curious would have gladly heard what Glaucon on\r\nhis sick-bed told Themistocles, and what Sicinnus did afterward. Certain\r\nit is that the shrewd Asiatic later displayed a costly ring which the\r\nsatrap Zariaspes, Mardonius’s cousin, sent him “for a great service to the\r\nhouse of Gobryas.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Thebes capitulated the household of Hermippus left\r\nTrœzene to return to Athens. When they had told Hermione all that had\r\nbefallen,—the great good, the little ill,—she had not fainted, though\r\nCleopis had been sure thereof. The colour had risen to her cheeks, the\r\nlove-light to her eyes. She went to the cradle where Phœnix cooed and\r\ntossed his baby feet.\r\n\r\n“Little one, little one,” she said, while he beamed up at her, “you have\r\nnot to avenge your father now. You have a better, greater task, to be as\r\nfair in body and still more in mind as he.”\r\n\r\nThen came the rush of tears, the sobbing, the laughter, and Lysistra and\r\nCleopis, who feared the shock of too much joy, were glad.\r\n\r\nThe _Nausicaä_ bore them to Peiræus. The harbour towns were in black\r\nruins, for Mardonius had wasted everything before retiring to Bœotia for\r\nhis last battle. In Athens, as they entered it, the houses were roofless,\r\nthe streets scattered with rubbish. But Hermione did not think of these\r\nthings. The Agora at last,—the porticos were only shattered, fire-scarred\r\npillars,—and everywhere were tents and booths and bustle,—the brisk\r\nAthenians wasting no time in lamentation, but busy rebuilding and making\r\ngood the loss. Above Hermione’s head rose a few blackened columns,—all\r\nthat was left of the holy house of Athena,—but the crystalline air and the\r\nred Rock of the Acropolis no Persian had been able to take away.\r\n\r\nAnd even as Hermione crossed the Agora she heard a shouting, a word\r\nrunning from lip to lip as a wave leaps over the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the buzzing mart she stopped. All the blood sprang to her\r\nface, then left it. She passed her fingers over her hair, and waited with\r\ntwitching, upturned face. Through the hucksters’ booths, amid the\r\nclamouring buyers and sellers, went a runner, striking left and right with\r\nhis staff, for the people were packing close, and he had much ado to clear\r\nthe way. Horsemen next, prancing chargers, the prizes from the Barbarian,\r\nand after them a litter. Noble youths bore it, sons of the Eupatrid houses\r\nof Athens. At sight of the litter the buzz of the Agora became a roar.\r\n\r\n“The beautiful! The fortunate! The deliverer! _Io! Io, pæan!_”\r\n\r\nHermione stood; only her eyes followed the litter. Its curtains were flung\r\nback; she saw some one within, lying on purple cushions. She saw the\r\nfeatures, beautiful as Pentelic marble and as pale. She cared not for the\r\npeople. She cared not that Phœnix, frighted by the shouting, had begun to\r\nwail. The statue in the litter moved, rose on one elbow.\r\n\r\n“Ah, dearest and best,”—his voice had the old-time ring, his head the\r\nold-time poise,—“you need not fear to call me husband now!”\r\n\r\n“Glaucon,” she cried. “I am not fit to be your wife. I am not fit to kiss\r\nyour feet.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThey set the litter down. Even little Simonides, though a king among the\r\ncurious, found the Acropolis peculiarly worthy of his study. Enough that\r\nHermione’s hands were pressing her husband, and these two cared not\r\nwhether a thousand watched or only Helios on high. Penelope was greeting\r\nthe returning Odysseus:—\r\n\r\n  “Welcome even as to shipmen\r\n  On the swelling, raging sea;\r\n  When Poseidon flings the whirlwind,\r\n  When a thousand blasts roam free,\r\n  Then at last the land appeareth;—\r\n  E’en so welcome in her sight\r\n  Was her lord, her arms long clasped him,\r\n  And her eyes shone pure and bright.”\r\n\r\nAfter a long time Glaucon commanded, “Bring me our child,” and Cleopis\r\ngladly obeyed. Phœnix ceased weeping and thrust his red fists in his\r\nfather’s face.\r\n\r\n“_Ei_, pretty snail,” said Glaucon, pressing him fast by one hand, whilst\r\nhe held his mother by the other, “if I say you are a merry wight, the\r\nnurse will not marvel any more.”\r\n\r\nBut Hermione had already heard from Niobe of the adventure in the\r\nmarket-place at Trœzene.\r\n\r\nThe young men were just taking up the litter, when the Agora again broke\r\ninto cheers. Themistocles, saviour of Hellas, had crossed to Glaucon. The\r\nadmiral—never more worshipped than now, when every plan he wove seemed\r\nperfect as a god’s—took Glaucon and Hermione, one by each hand.\r\n\r\n“Ah, _philotatoi_,” he said, “to all of us is given by the sisters above\r\nso much bliss and so much sorrow. Some drink the bitter first, some the\r\nsweet. And you have drained the bitter to the lees. Therefore look up at\r\nthe Sun-King boldly. He will not darken for you again.”\r\n\r\n“Where now?” asked Hermione, in all things looking to her husband.\r\n\r\n“To the Acropolis,” ordered Glaucon. “If the temple is desolate, the Rock\r\nis still holy. Let us give thanks to Athena.”\r\n\r\nHe even would have left the litter, had not Themistocles firmly forbidden.\r\nIn time the Alcmæonid’s strength would return, though never the speed that\r\nhad left the stadia behind whilst he raced to save Hellas.\r\n\r\nThey mounted the Rock. From above, in the old-time brightness, the noonday\r\nlight, the sunlight of Athens, sprang down to them. Hermione, looking on\r\nGlaucon’s face, saw him gaze eagerly upon her, his child, the sacred Rock,\r\nand the glory from Helios. Then his face wore a strange smile she could\r\nnot understand. She did not know that he was saying in his heart:—\r\n\r\n“And I thought for the rose vales of Bactria to forfeit—this!”\r\n\r\nThey were on the summit. The litter was set down on the projecting spur by\r\nthe southwest corner. The area of the Acropolis was desolation, ashes,\r\ndrums of overturned pillars, a few lone and scarred columns. The works of\r\nman were in ruin, but the works of the god, of yesterday, to-day, and\r\nforever were yet the same. They turned their backs on the ruin. Westward\r\nthey looked—across land and sea, beautiful always, most beautiful now, for\r\nhad they not been redeemed with blood and tears? The Barbarian was\r\nvanquished; the impossible accomplished. Hellas and Athens were their own,\r\nwith none to take away.\r\n\r\nThey saw the blue bay of Phaleron. They saw the craggy height of Munychia,\r\nSalamis with its strait of the victory, farther yet the brown dome of\r\nAcro-Corinthus and the wide breast of the clear Saronian sea. To the left\r\nwas Hymettus the Shaggy, to right the long crest of Daphni, behind them\r\nrose Pentelicus, home of the marble that should take the shape of the\r\ngods. With one voice they fell to praising Athens and Hellas, wisely or\r\nfoolishly, according to their wit. Only Hermione and Glaucon kept silence,\r\nhand within hand, and speaking fast,—not with their lips,—but with their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThen at the end Themistocles spoke, and as always spoke the best.\r\n\r\n“We have flung back the Barbarian. We have set our might against the\r\nGod-King and have conquered. Athens lies in ruins. We shall rebuild her.\r\nWe shall make her more truly than before the ‘Beautiful,’ the\r\n‘Violet-Crowned City,’ worthy of the guardian Athena. The conquering of\r\nthe Persian was hard. The making of Athens immortal by the beauty of our\r\nlives, and words, and deeds is harder. Yet in this also we shall conquer.\r\nYea, verily, for the day shall come that wherever the eye is charmed by\r\nthe beautiful, the heart is thrilled by the noble, or the soul yearns\r\nafter the perfect,—there in the spirit shall stand Athens.”\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter they had prayed to the goddess, they went down from the Rock and its\r\nvision of beauty.

While the\r\nbeautiful love of Cornelia and Drusus lies at the sound sweet heart of the\r\nstory, to say so is to give a most meagre idea of the large sustained\r\ninterest of the whole.... There are many incidents so vivid, so brilliant,\r\nthat they fix themselves in the memory.”—_The Bookman._\r\n\r\n                                                      _Cloth, 12mo, $1.50_\r\n\r\n“God Wills It”\r\n\r\nA TALE OF THE FIRST CRUSADE\r\n\r\n“Not since Sir Walter Scott cast his spell over us with ‘Ivanhoe,’ ‘Count\r\nRobert of Paris,’ and ‘Quentin Durward’ have we been so completely\r\ncaptivated by a story as by ‘God Wills It,’ by William Stearns Davis. It\r\ngrips the attention of the reader in the first chapter and holds it till\r\nthe last.... It is a story of strenuous life, the spirit of which might\r\nwell be applied in some of our modern Crusades. While true to life in its\r\nlocal coloring, it is sweet and pure, and leaves no after-taste of\r\nbitterness. The author’s first book, ‘A Friend of Cæsar,’ revealed his\r\npower, and ‘God Wills It’ confirms and deepens the impression\r\nmade.”—_Christian Endeavor World._\r\n\r\n                                       _With Illustrations by Louis Betts_\r\n\r\n                                                      _Cloth, 12mo, $1.50_\r\n\r\nFalaise of the Blessed Voice\r\n\r\nA TALE OF THE YOUTH OF ST.

It is a thrilling and an absorbing story. Through all the tragedy of\r\nlife ... there is a rarely sweet accompaniment of tender tones, of love\r\nand heroism and intermittent, never quite lost hope. It is a touching and\r\nbeautiful story.”—_Buffalo Evening News._\r\n\r\nConiston\r\n\r\nBy WINSTON CHURCHILL\r\n\r\n“Coniston has a lighter, gayer spirit, and a deeper, tenderer touch than\r\nMr. Churchill has ever achieved before....

But with what charm and delicacy, fine\r\nhumor and insight, the work has been done, only a direct acquaintance with\r\nthe finished volume can justly show. The Southerner will certainly find\r\nenchanting home touches in it, and every reader will feel the spell of the\r\nquiet old southern town and all the tender, dainty, and humorous southern\r\nlife and atmosphere that hang about it.”—_St. Louis Globe Democrat._\r\n\r\n                                                              Cloth, $1.50\r\n\r\nThe Garden, You and I\r\n\r\nBy MABEL OSGOOD WRIGHT\r\n\r\n“Few books published in this country recently have been of a kind to make\r\nan author so proud.

CRADDOCK\r\n\r\n“... A little old-fashioned, perhaps, according to modern sensational\r\nstandards, but written with force and feeling, full of local color and\r\ncharacter, wholesome and interesting from cover to cover, and so far as\r\none can judge, a truthful picture of a most picturesque phase of pioneer\r\nhistory that has not been exploited to the point of tiresomeness.”—_The\r\nNew York Times._\r\n\r\n                                                              Cloth, $1.50\r\n\r\nThe Romance of John Bainbridge\r\n\r\nBy HENRY GEORGE, Jr.\r\n\r\n“Belongs to the large class of present-day novels in which a young man of\r\nhigh ideals goes into politics in order to do battle with the dragons of\r\nbribery and corruption.

This story of the little samurai, hardly big enough to be a soldier,\r\nand of how the fair eta Hoshiko met his obligations for him, is very real\r\nand appealing.\r\n\r\n                                                              Cloth, $1.50\r\n\r\nThe Vine of Sibmah\r\n\r\nBy Dr. ANDREW MACPHAIL\r\n\r\n“The book is taut with action and breathless climaxes.
